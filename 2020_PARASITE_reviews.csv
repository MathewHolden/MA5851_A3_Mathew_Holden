PARASITE,22 October 2019,6/10,"I was able to see ""Parasite"" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn't that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person's head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it's still a good film but one I really wish I hadn't seen."
PARASITE,1 November 2020,10/10,"PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think."
PARASITE,4 January 2020,7/10,"The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society."
PARASITE,7 August 2020,9/10,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,6/10,"Okay, so these slightly over two hours are ""Parasite"" or ""Gisaengchung"", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,7/10,"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,"When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.""Gisaengchung"", a.k.a. ""Parasite"", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Parasita"" (""Parasite"")"
PARASITE,16 August 2020,,"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,8/10,"The title is a metaphor to describe the relationship between the rich and the poor. It is a social statement. We are first introduced to the poor Kim family who is street smart. They steal wi-fi and put together pizza boxes. Kevin (Woo-sik Choi ) is introduced to the rich gullible Kim family as an English tutor. He manages through lies to get the rest of his family hired on as the old servants are dismissed. We discover poor people have a disgusting smell to them. They smell like the subway (urine?) The film climaxes ar a birthday party.The film was mildly amusing and clever. It wasn't as funny or entertaining as say, ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."" While good, I would say the Oscar as ""best picture"" was a gift.Guide: F-word. groping. no nudity."
PARASITE,7 May 2020,10/10,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,10/10,"Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"
PARASITE,26 January 2020,8/10,"This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!"
PARASITE,11 May 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Gisaengchung"" (""Parasite"" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,9/10,"I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as ""Jessica"", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her ""uncle"" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a ""ghost"", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
PARASITE,26 October 2020,10/10,"This Oscar winning Korean film is centred on the Kim family; they live in a distinctly downmarket neighbourhood and struggle to earn enough money. One day a friend of Ki-woo, the son, tells him of a job opportunity; the wealthy Park family need an English tutor for their teenaged daughter. Equipped with forged qualifications he gets the job, not only that he suggests that his sister, Ki-jung, who he introduces as a cousin of a friend would be the ideal art tutor for their son. It isn't long before Father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, are also employed as driver and housekeeper... all this is done in a way that doesn't give away that they know each other. Things are looking up for the Kims as they enjoy their new situation; then the old house keeper, who they got fired, returns and their new success is threatened in a surprising way.This film is hard to pigeonhole; it is a comedy that provides plenty of laughs; it is a social commentary of the vast difference in wealth in Korean society; it toys with horror tropes; there is some romance; and has violent moments. It could have turned out to be a real mess but the elements blend together almost perfectly. The cast does a really fine job making the characters believable even when the situation is far-fetched. For the most part it is set within the Park's large, modern house; the only other location of note it the contrastingly small basement flat the Kim's call home... the comparison emphasises who different the families' circumstances are. The story provides some twists, which I won't spoil here; these often lead to a shift in tone... even when things turn darker in tone there are still laughs to be had. Director Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the story, does a great job as the film treads the fine line between brilliance and silliness... always keeping on just the right side. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles."
PARASITE,25 January 2020,7/10,"A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like ""Parasite"", but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task."
PARASITE,14 October 2020,8/10,"Since it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Mom and I were curious about watching this Korean film and we finally did today after I checked this out from the library. The verdict: It's interesting how the picture goes to various places concerning the poor family being employed by the rich one and then also a surprise concerning an eventual former employee of the rich family with a secret... Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it. But it's a unique enough piece of work so that's something of a recommendation..."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had."
PARASITE,25 November 2019,,"This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life.This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat, even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing. The suspense is quite chilling, and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end. It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching."
PARASITE,31 March 2020,10/10,"The Park family is the epitome of riches. The Kim's dwell in a subbasement and live off of assembling pizza boxes. By sheer fate, these two families are brought together. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik) and his sister (Park-So-dam), the Kim children , gets the unexpected opportunity to get work as an English tutor and an art therapist for the Park family children. Unbeknownst to the wealthy family, the Kim's father is hired as chauffeur to the aloof businessman Mr. Park, while Ki-Woo realizes he can, by hook and crook, get his own mother hired to fill a newly opening for housekeeper. The Kim's are providing services while the Parks become the whole bankroll for the parasitic Kim family. The golden opportunity becomes unsteady when underhanded dominance raises its head.Bong Joon-ho's tragicomedy is nearly flawless and deserves its many awards highlighted by the Golden Globes and Oscars. PARASITE makes the Silver Screen a remarkable experience."
PARASITE,13 June 2019,9/10,"That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,7/10,"I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as ""Mother""."
PARASITE,10 March 2020,8/10,"How courteous is the Japanese
He always says 'excuse it, please'
He walks into his neighbour's garden
And smise and says 'I beg your pardon'
He bows, and grins a little grin
And brings his hungry family in
He grins, and bows a little bow
'So sorry, this MY garden now'.That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,9/10,"A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction."
PARASITE,2 January 2020,8/10,". . . even more deplorable than the USA under POTUS #45. The Wealth Disparity in South Korea is five or six times worse than America's, if you can imagine that! A tiny fraction of PARASITE ""people"" live like Corrupt Corporate Capitalist\Communist U.S. CEO's, but the vast majority of the remainder 99 Per Centers struggle for survival in roach-filled hovels deep underground, subject to life-threatening floods of raw sewage during the frequent year-round monsoon rains. It's an absolute ordeal for the ordinary normal average Koreans to keep a set of dry work clothes available in order to perform their low-paid menial jobs for the monied PARASITE Class wallowing in the conspicuous consumption of their ill-gotten Wealth. These work environments are flagrantly unsafe. When employees perish, the Miser Clique dismisses them like squashed bugs and hire replacement victims, complaining all the time about the Smell of Squalor to which they condemn their fellow man. PARASITE concludes just like another 2019 film--JOKER--with the onset of a long overdue Kill-the-Rich Movement."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,8/10,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."
PARASITE,1 September 2020,10/10,"PARASITE (2019) **** Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choie, So-dam Park, Jeong-eun Lee, Hye-jin Jan, Myeong-hoon Park, Ji-so Jung, Hyun-jun Jung. Superb South Korean film from brilliant filmmaker Bong Joon Ho who weaves a tight wire thin fable of family, class distinction and diabolical cunning in this black comic/horror drama about the near destitute Kim family who deceive an upper-class family, The Parks, by infiltrating themselves into their domestic bliss posing as highly-skilled caregivers that ultimately leads to a plot of Greek tragedy proportions. Well acted by one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled and a Hitchcockian bar set for suspense and eventual dread. One of the best films of the decade which would go on to win 4 Oscars for Best Picture, Directing, Original Screenplay (co-written by Jin Won Han with Ho) and Best International Film."
PARASITE,23 October 2019,9/10,"One of the things I liked about the film ""12 Years a Slave"" was that it punctured the idea of the ""happy slave."" Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others, but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property. If they had a ""nice"" master, they might smile and exchange pleasantries, but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away.A variation on the ""happy slave"" concept still exists in the world of today, I think, but it's been transferred to the serving class. There's this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more. Maids, nannies, chauffeurs, doormen -- what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy, and as long as they're well treated and paid for their efforts, what do they have to complain about?This dynamic is explored explosively in ""Parasite."" It's almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets, and this is one film that works best the less you know about it. It's funny, scary, suspenseful, sad, sometimes all at the same time. It's playful, yet serious. Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations. The fun of this movie is never knowing where it's going to go next. It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who, in their eyes, exist to do things for them, even when those people are (literally) right under their feet. There aren't good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains. At times you despise everyone in the movie, at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them. It's a movie that is many things at once and refuses to be categorized, and as a result it looks much like our modern world.Grade: A"
PARASITE,8 November 2019,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. At least once per year, a movie really hits a sweet spot ... something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we've previously seen. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest film is this year's cinematic surprise. It's filled with interesting characters, social commentary, a unique setting, a creative and twisty story, and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll. There have already been a few excellent movies this year, and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019.We first meet the Kims, a family in poverty living in near-squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window. That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in, and also provides a too-clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves. The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past, in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation (yes, there is symmetry to this later in the story). The Kim family consists of Dad (Kang-ho Song), Mother (Hye-jin Jang), teenage son Kevin/Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) and 20-something daughter Jessica/Ki-jung (So-dam Park), and they react strongly when they lose ""free hi-fi"" access from a neighbor's system. The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor.Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin's friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town. This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks, the aforementioned wealthy family. The Park's home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim's city apartment. Mr. Park (Sun-kyun Lee) is a 1% tech titan married to a high-strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over-matched mom (a fantastic Yeo-jeong Jo). Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung) and hyperactive young son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung).It's fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home, and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills, Google, and a street-wise understanding of how to read people. The script, co-written by the director and Han Jin Won, explores the co-dependency as the rich depend on the poor for service work, and the poor depend on the rich for jobs and a living wage. Given the film's title, we soon realize that a ""host"" may have more than one parasite at any time ... something that plays out in what has to be the wildest film twist of the year, thanks to an all-out performance from Jeong-eun Lee as the Park's long-time housekeeper.The social and class commentaries are spread throughout, and in addition to the window comparisons, you'll also notice that the walk is uphill to the Parks' home and downhill (and flood-risky) to the Kim's apartment. There are multiple layers within the stories and within the individual characters. What begins as a devastating social satire morphs into a wild and crazy time of violence ... without losing its general theme. A comedy of familial con artists bursts into a violent class thriller - the price to pay for unearned comfort. The film is not just unpredictable, it smacks us with a jarring twist.Bong Joon Ho has become a well-respected filmmaker for his previous work: THE HOST 2006, MOTHER 2009, SNOWPIERCER 2013, and OKJA 2017. This latest elevates him to a whole new level. The film is darkly humorous and unpredictable, with excellent performances throughout. It's also quite something to look at. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong works his magic, and it should be noted that the Park's home is a complete set built solely for the film. I challenge you to notice this - I sure couldn't tell. The film won the 2019 Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, and it is likely headed for many more accolades."
PARASITE,21 November 2019,7/10,"Parasite is unique and manically engaging with humour, it doesn't all work though.Another reviewer captured it right, in saying it's lacking of human spirit. Unlike that person I like the film, but I do agree with that. Yeo-jeong Jo's good as the house wife, but the Kim Ki-Jung character's ineffective and her mother unlikable. I don't buy that Kim Ki-taek and Kim Chung-sook could actually fill these job roles at this time, more so the mother. Plus the guy living in the basement and the Morse code, quite stupid and the resolution well it's weak. It's obvious the father will be in the basement, after fleeing the incident and Kim Ki-woo just isn't going to go from the slums to earning enough money to buy this place."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"Since seeing the early awards it was winning,this has been one of the top 2019 films I've wanted to see on the big screen, but finding it not playing anywhere near me. After it won the Oscars,I checked and found the local Odeon was at last showing it, leading me to finally extracting the parasite.View on the film:Descending in the opening shot to the Kim household, co-writer/(with Jin Won Han) directing auteur Bong Joon Ho reunites with cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and builds a foundation which continues to explore Bong's major recurring theme of class, gliding upwards to the decadent Park household, balanced with long tracking shots down to the dirt-poor ground of the Kim's.Astonishingly building the Park house by scratch, Bong and his regular editor Jinmo Yang work in perfect synch with each other, as Bong's ultra-stylised panning shots over the reflecting surfaces of the Park's house are pinned by Yang's fluid editing slicing off the peel from each level of the Park house the Kim's begin to inhabit.
Housing a magnificent ensemble cast, the screenplay by Bong & Han wisely avoid the option of the Park's=bourgeoisie scum,and the Kim's=the angelic poor, instead going for a more thoughtful study of class and capitalism, (major recurring themes of Bong) lit by wonderful con artist thrills, which get baked into a hauntingly bitter final bite.Covering the skyline/screen with the Park house, the writers open the door to the house being at a level of wealth which the Kim's (and others) will never be able to cross the divide to reach, leading to a intense doom-laden scramble to secretly retain control on the lowest level of the house,inside a location where everyone's attempt to keep a firm grip on their cut, leads to them all being parasites."
PARASITE,18 December 2019,10/10,"Stunning. This is a movie of superlatives. Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing. It is a drama, comedy, unbiased social commentary, thriller - a lot in one.The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed - every scene has a purpose. Given the extremes that this story goes to - it's still plausible - the thriller elements don't get out of hand or descend into stupidity. There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish. It has changed the way I
think about relationships across the wealth divide.Don't read anything about the story before you watch it. Just go and see it.This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come. And it deserves every accolade out there."
PARASITE,1 May 2020,8/10,"The surprise at the Oscars. So finally I got the time to see what's it all about and I must say. It's a simple story but it works out really fine. In fact, it's a story about home invasion but not in a horror way but in a normal way, lower-class invades upper-class.Even as it is spoken in a language that needs subtitles I had a smile on my face in some situations. But it's also weird what is happening in the basement. I had a bit of problems what is happening in the basement with the lights, it's funny but also a thing you can't believe.But I agree, I understand for a flick coming out of a country not known for flicks that this is Oscar worthy. Excellent cinematography and top notch performances.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 0/5
Story 4/5
Comedy 1/5"
PARASITE,19 March 2020,9/10,"From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies. I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again. I'm glad it won the Oscar for best foreign picture, totally deserved."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,7/10,"One of director, Bong Joon Ho's favourite cinematic ploys is to mix up the genres. I remember being most unhappy watching his earlier Host (2006) when a perfectly acceptable horror film was interspersed with social comment on the various family members back home. There are great films and great genre films and I can enjoy both but they are different animals. Mr Ho seems to want to do away with the thoughtful script and writing needed for the former and use a mixing of the genre to make up for lack of depth. With Parasite we have, for about an hour, a very decent story building, even if it is becoming more and more far fetched. The big surprise certainly surprised me but not as much as the change that then befall the film and my mind began to wander as all the seriousness fell away. We have a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer. Writing is clearly not his forte and his urge to slip off piste needs, in my opinion, to be restrained so that his wondrous cinematic chemistry can cook away without losing the plot."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,"If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham, then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise. However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones.Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh."
PARASITE,21 January 2020,9/10,"Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture ""Parasite"" as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. ""Parasite"" by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films."
PARASITE,6 May 2020,9/10,"When I started watching this I thought well here is a caption film and I haven't watched one in a while. I fully expected that because of the captions I would lose track of the story. Then, as I got into this film, I realized I was being drawn into the social fabric of South Korea. I appreciated it more and more as the film moved on.We have a desperate family living in a basement. The son has a friend whose leaving for college in America. His friend asks him to tutor his girlfriend while he is away at school because he trusts him. The girlfriend has a wealthy upper middle class family. So on his classmate recommendation he gets the job.Then the son finds he can get his entire family jobs with his new employer as well. So pretty soon the desperate family is all working and getting involved with the employers family. The social consequences of this become more and more complex as the desperate family is not telling their employers they are all related to each other. The wealthy family has many issues of it's own as well.Character development here is excellent and key to this as their relationship becomes more and more complex. Everything is going well until one week-end when the middle class family is taking their youngest son camping for a week-end. Then we find out some dark hidden secrets of their house as their employees decide to have a party at the employers house. Then the employees find out about a dark hidden secret in their employers house and everything starts falling apart for both families.I don't want to get too technical here because even though I warn for spoilers, I would rather the complexity of these social interactions are better if you see them for yourself, than my getting too detailed describing them. This is great writing and direction of a very complex social order story. It teaches the viewer about South Korean Culture and South Korea in a way that is unexpected, but very welcome. While the results of everything coming apart might not make some viewers happy, the way it happens when things come apart make total sense. There is some mild adult material here, but it is done milder than many R rated films.All the cast fit their roles and get plenty of chance to act. They really make the viewer feel what is going on and where complex relationships have to wind up. The title is a give away in that the desperate family does become parasites to the wealthy family. The way it happens is what makes this movie special. Kudos to all the folks who have given this movie awards. It deserves all of them. The film takes the viewer into a different world, and does so in a unique manner."
PARASITE,13 September 2019,8/10,"Two years in a roll, films from Far East have snatched the coveted Palme d'or, after Hirokazu Koreeda's SHOPLIFTERS (2018), here comes this year's champ, Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE, his 7th feature, also first Korean film to be crowned the top honor in Cannes, which denotes Bong's almost inconceivable triumph in conquering both cinema's box-office and artistic fronts, a feat even Steven Spielberg cannot achieve in his salad days, Bong can indeed have his cake and eat it as well!Both SHOPLIFTERS and PARASITE hinge around the underclass, but a more apposite reference of the latter should be Lee Chang-dong's BURNING (2018), a Cannes also-ran, both Lee and Bong vigorously tackle the ubiquitous classism, the pathological canker in our modern society, while Lee deliberately and stylishly veils his central story with elusiveness and makes great play of the ambivalent mystique exuded from the unattainable pursuance of truth, here, Bong cunningly employs gripping genre tropes to underpin his trenchant perspicacity on the treacherous waters of rich and poor's co-existence.In Seoul, the semi-basement dwelling Kim family - patriarch Ki-taek (Song), his wife Chung-sook (Jang), their two adolescent children, son Ki-woo (Choi) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), slyly insinuates their way into being employed by the high-flying Park family, respectively, as their driver, housekeeper, English tutor and art teacher. Sparks fly and laughter erupts intermittently in the beggar-belief process of how each member of Kim family tactfully excels in their designated jobs and consecutively sells on the unsuspecting....continue reading the review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks!"
PARASITE,2 March 2020,9/10,"This fascinating South Korean film starts with a poor family scheming to get jobs with a rich family but eventually becomes something much darker and weirder. A very pointed exploration of the class/wealth divide, the movie is not just about personal tragedy but about societal tragedy.At the same time, it's also at times quite funny and exciting, and it's beautifully shot and acted.Thought-provoking and compelling, it's that rare movie that actually deserved all the awards it won."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,"This movie grabbed my interest immediately and never let go. well-made all around. a memorable experience. (1 viewing, 2/15/2020)"
PARASITE,15 June 2020,9/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe Kims, a South Korean family including father Ki Taek (Kang-ho Song), wife Yeon Kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo) and son Dong Ik (Sun-kyun Lee) live in poverty in the slums of Korea, scamming free wi-fi from those above. Dong Ik gets a job as an english tutor to the daughter of a rich family, headed by father Guen Se (Myeong-hoon Park) and mother Chung Sook (Hye-jin Jang), before the rest of them weed their way in in various capacities. They get accustomed to a new quality of life, until a grievance with a disgruntled housekeeper (Rosie Peralta) who they wronged goes lethally awry.Having had a three month break from the bombardment of regurgitated Hollywood, seemingly recession proof soulless dross, that fills the cinema screens, on account of them having to close because of the pandemic, they now find themselves in a position where they're losing money regardless (like they weren't enough already.) And so, it's even more reason to give this critically acclaimed offering of world cinema from South Korea, no less, a go. While a few notches off perfect, it's still an undeniably original and inspired piece, that gives some food for thought.Director Bong Joon Ho seems to be attempting some commentary on the rich and poor divide, which undoubtedly exists in any society to some degree or another, and has his characters make some noted observations on this cold reality, with Ching Sook mentioning how rich people can afford to be nice, and become a little too trusting as a result, through to Ki Taek lamenting how having a plan is the worst thing to do, as it's the surest way for things to go wrong. Are these people in the state they're in because they're lazy and unethical, or does the system work to keep them grinded down?It's maybe a little overlong, and the ending does drag on a bit, but it undoubtedly leaves an impression, and makes you wonder what other hidden treasures the Koreans are hiding from us? ****"
PARASITE,10 March 2020,10/10,"For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho's ""Parasite"", I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was ""Old Boy"" and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn't expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn't even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn't sure I liked it, but I wasn't sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here's my personal take, and apologies if I don't mention the actors' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn't make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don't think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn't expect it the catalyst, and film's leitmotif, to be something as trivial as ""smell"". You read me.There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.1/ ""They have the same smell"": we've come to the comical momentum where every member of the ""poor"" family got a job in the rich property. They're all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it's the little kid who smells something 'fishy' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn't treat it as the hint that there's something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver's work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father's reaction, he realizes that he's not just a man or a valuable employee, he's got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father's comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn't been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don't like it, they just don't have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones' perspectives, people who don't mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man's body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter's life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.If there's one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it's ""Parasite"" and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner ""The Eel"", where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"'Parasite (2019)', like many South Korean efforts I've seen, essentially starts out as one thing and ends up another, constantly tightrope walking a razor-thin tonal line. Indeed, this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect. The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror, each as genuine as the other. It's always entertaining, whether comedic or unsettling, and it's very well-made, to boot. Interestingly, the focal family aren't really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far, attempting to usurp the innocent and hard-working staff of the rich family they're 'scamming'. This isn't really detrimental, though. It's a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right, no matter whose perspective we're in. What it also does, however, is somewhat dampen the impact of the picture's proposed theme. Its comments on class perhaps don't quite come full circle - at least, not in the way you'd expect. Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture, but this isn't detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do. Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable. For me, the movie's second half - marked by its biggest tonal shift - isn't necessarily as successful as the first, despite it being the 'real beginning' according to director Bong Joon Ho. Of course, the film is always compelling. It's astutely crafted, too. Despite a few issues, it's an entertaining experience throughout. It's fantastic. 9/10."
PARASITE,29 November 2021,9/10,"Being a Korean language film was not the only reason Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' was an unlikely multiple Oscar winner; it's also unusually dark. A vicious black comedy, it tells the story of an impoverished family who think they've found a meal-ticket for life when they manage to displace the servants of a gullable rich one; but it turns out they're not the only desparate people in town. Everyone can enjoy its ingenious plot and wonderful sense of aesthetic; but at heart, this is a serious film about how both wealth and poverty corrupt the soul. As such, it has no heroes; and its victims are either not innocent, or, if they are, have no right to be. There's no question it deserved it's awards."
PARASITE,16 December 2019,10/10,"If you must make a home invasion movie do it as a comedy and not as a horror film, right? Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" arrives already festooned with awards and rightly so. In this gem a family of low-life con-artists manage to take over the home and lives of a softer and much richer family that in some ways mirror them. It's like ""Us"" but without the supernatural element. Of course, a scheme like theirs can't succeed without something going very wrong which, of course, it does turning ""Parasite"" beautifully and brilliantly into the blackest of comedy-thrillers that does finally manage to erupt into just the kind of horror flic we expected from the start.With pitch-perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year, not to mention the kind of home any family would be happy to invade, this is an instant classic. I can already see the American remake but it will never top this. It may not be quite as profound as it would like to be but for sheer cleverness it's up there with the very best."
PARASITE,27 November 2021,9/10,"Much has been said about this amorally elegant black comedy as full of twists and reversals as 'Volpone', yet few observers have commented upon the remarkable use of music; including the unexpected use of two arias from Handl's 'Rondelina' which add yet another veneer to the frantic proceedings and adroitly compliments the mise en scene."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,"This is just a pure masterpiece. You can see movies like this one only once in couple years. It was intense, interesting plot, amazing actors. Everyone was telling me like first half was OK, but second was boring so film is just Meh. How dare you? If you're basic person who loves only MARVEL or DC films of course this movie is not for you, but if you want to see something more deeper than that pick this one you won't regret. Totally recommended, my favourite movie of 2019."
PARASITE,9 August 2019,9/10,"We've only been through the middle of 2019, but I think that I can mark the fact that I experienced the cinema event of the year, or at least one of the important events of the year in movies. This is the film by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, 'Gisaengchung' / 'Parasite'. It has already received 'Palme d'Or' at the Cannes festival, and this time I believe that the jury's choice is extremely appropriate. 'Parasite' is a profound and complex cinematographic work, which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today's world, but it does so in an elegant and expressive way, with images. and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time, causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story.At the center of the story of the film are two families from today's South Korea, located at the two extremes of the society. The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa, full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape. He is the CEO of a large company, she is a spoiled housewife, the kids, a girl and a boy are even more spoiled. They are all surrounded by servants, drivers, tutors for children. The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half-underground flat. The parents are unemployed, their children are smart young people, but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty. The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story, the luxury and order of the Parks' villa hides secrets, while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis' family home is similar to that of the family in the movie 'Shoplifters' of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes (with the help of forged references) the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family. As relationships intensify, cultural differences seem to diminish, the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions. Until about halfway through the movie, the audience is watching a social satire in a light style, a kind of 'rich family vs. poor family' story. And then everything changes.A few weeks ago, writing about another Korean film, I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics. 'Parasite' is yet another example in this regard. We have here manifested social satire, melodrama, humor, love among teenagers, horror in the Gothic style, comments on art, a natural catastrophe, neo-realistic poverty and soap operas wealth. Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos are quoted. The natural tendency of the spectator to take the part of the oppressed in the class conflict that takes place in front of us is put to the test by the events that happen on the screen. 'Parasite' is an excellently acted movie, filmed in style, a story with many ramifications and meanings, which will not be easily forgotten by the spectators and which gives them material to think about the society and the world in which we live."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,9/10,"I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.9.1/10"
PARASITE,2 September 2019,,"Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades."
PARASITE,3 December 2019,9/10,"Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world. The scenes in the basement were chilling, especially that first one. The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on, swimming in their own filth during that flood scene, and turning against one another ... it was all devastating commentary on the position they're in, and the struggle. The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party. This is a message film that works on both levels, as it's hard to know how it will play out, and while dark, it's entertaining. The ending is brilliant too."
PARASITE,11 December 2019,9/10,"A lot has been made of the social commentary, the message, of ""Parasite,"" but I think the picture is effective because the message is not overly blunt and because the structure--largely geographical--supporting it is congruent. Plus, it's unpredictable genre-mixing entertainment otherwise. That's not to say the social commentary isn't obvious, though, and rather nihilistic. There's ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the ""parasites."" While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower-class Kim family, they are the ones conning the upper-class Parks. In one sequence, to deter detection, they even hide, crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home. But, then, the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt. In effect, they're all parasites--even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them. Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another. The Kims get others fired, forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks' trust. Conversely, the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki-taek, and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay. Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help, and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans.The only other Bong Joon-ho movie that I've seen thus far, ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) is more heavy-handed in its depiction of class. In it, the rich exploit the poor; it's as straightforward as the continuously-running train. ""Parasite"" is more steeply layered. The upstairs-downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul's geography. The Kims live in a semi-basement in a crowded urban area. We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs, whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard. While it rains at the Park's home, that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage, including feces raining on them from the toilet. A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point. Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower--in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs. This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea, which itself mirrors Mr. Park's condemnation of ""crossing the line."" Even the hope of upward mobility is represented in the landscape--by a stone.Besides reflecting the message, all of this geography also serves the narrative. What begins as a black comedy and con-artist film, with actors playing actors, turns into a mix of suspense thriller and old-dark-house horror beginning with one stormy night. Characteristic of the haunted-house subgenre, there's already the aforementioned secret bunker, and there's also a ghostly, mysterious assailant (and the figure of the youngest Park's supposed trauma reflected in his artwork). There's even fantasy in the Kims' son's dream of upward mobility and a grand guignol finale. It's also a well-composed picture, with an exciting score and amusing performances. And, to top off this multi-layered message movie, there's the Morse-code messaging. Messages inside a message... genres upon genres, actors within actors, characters within characters, haves among the have-nots--all underlined geographically."
PARASITE,3 September 2019,,"A meticulously crafted & confidently narrated black comedy thriller that offers a biting take on the socio-economic state of modern South Korea, while also taking a jab at late capitalism, the 2019 Palme d'Or winner is Bong Joon-ho's most mature & accomplished film to date that finds the distinguished filmmaker at the apex of his craft, and further cements his position as one of the brightest storytellers of our generation."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,8/10,"It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time."
PARASITE,28 August 2021,9/10,"After watching this movie, I liked it very much. At the office, I told my colleagues that this film would definitely win a foreign language film Oscar. But I never expected the best picture Oscar award. This movie was great. The performances, the story were great. The ending a little weak, but overall the movie was excellent. A true allegory."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,4/10,"Two families of people; one poor, poorly educated; unemployed, and willing to lie to get money. The other wealthy, loving family, existing in their own world. What happens when they cross paths? Well, for one, a weird ending that didn't fit w/the rest of the story.
Overall impression: I'm not going to remember this movie unlike, first & foremost, ""The Lighthouse"", then ""Once Upon a Time ..."", ""Joker"", and ""Judy"". Relative to the those creations I'm not sure why this movie garnered so many awards."
PARASITE,19 November 2019,7/10,"This film was the winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes. One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite, wealthy, rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk. Clearly, that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film. But on the other hand, there are others who view this film as a balancing act, where there is no clear hero or villain. As such, it is a film that asks more questions than it answers.One thing is certain: this film is a visual treat. Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail. Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed, it is tempting to get lost in the visual details.But there is a story to tell and it is compelling, even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent. The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending. And even then, one wonders about the final lines, which might contradict what has gone before. The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films, like ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Host"", which feel less ambiguous."
PARASITE,9 October 2019,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korea'n movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i thing that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. Its a universal theme.And this movie is a universal treasure."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,7/10,"Metascore 96, IMDb Top Rated Movies #26, higher than "" The Green Mile"", ""Léon"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""C'era una volta il West"", ""Django Unchained"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", even ""2001: A Space Odyssey""... Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember.""I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.7,5/10"
PARASITE,29 December 2019,8/10,"This supposedly best film of 2019 South Korean venture into mystery, comedic thrills is for some hard to digest with not so likeable characters. There are grifters and then there are likeable grifters like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), The Grifters (1990), and Heartbreakers (2001). This movie in a fascinating way has similarities to a ""evil"" version of The Pink Panther (1963) or a more frightening chilly version of The Ice Storm (1997). Over time, the movie does seem to increase in its compelling mystery including a number of well-done tense scenes and twists. It's problematic though that such talented grifters would be living in such a disheveled, shoddy accommodations almost as if the director scripted it that way for dramatic effect and the father's outrageous behavior at the end seems a little overall the top without real sense of consistency with the storyline, except again to adhere to some dramatic script design to impress critics or audience members. Admittedly this movie succeeds in its intensity and captivating ambiance while building a sense of off-balanced comedy psychological drama. Yet the overall impact is an unsympathetic resonance that while attractive is also quite repulsive."
PARASITE,2 October 2019,9/10,"The sudden uproar at the 95th minute of Parasite, a poignant story about a poor family of four living it up through unfair and illicit means and invisibly enjoying the riches of an affluent family of four living in a tony neighborhood, made me stop sipping from my cup of hot water and stare at it, thinking how can a bunch of people create such a moving film that does not stop at one or two messages but delivers this funny yet sad thing called life in its entirety. TN."
PARASITE,10 August 2019,10/10,"But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,10/10,"My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it! It's about a family that lives in a little house that want better things. Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography, writing, production design, and captivating characters! Well deserving of the awards/nominations; unfortunate people didn't like the movie."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,8/10,"I just got out of my second viewing of Parasite. I first seen it back in November at an advanced screening.I think anyone watching this after the Oscars will probably think it is over rated (I certainly think that about Gladiator and Silence Of The Lambs) and 1917 should have won. I'm not one of them, I loved 1917, but I loved this equally as much, and I was totally fine with it winning. If movies with subtitles bother you, this will not be for you.For me thought, it is 100% original, you'll never know where it is going, the acting is great by all concerned and it is darkly funny.I have to say, It was a lot more effective on its first watch, as I knew nothing about the movie (which is how I think it should be seen) and it simply blew me away. That has now been taken away now, but it is still a great movie."
PARASITE,11 November 2019,,"While set in Korea, the main theme of this movie is as universal as the most basic of human nature, as in ""Se7en"" (1995). We saw the same sentiments played out in the French Revolution - the Have-not getting even with the Have. In the French Revolution, it played out as revolution and guillotines. Here in ""Parasite"" it plays out as a multiple con job turned ugly - no decapitation, mind you, but with blood and gore to match.There are two remarkable things about this movie. The first is the change, abruptly at the mid-point, in tone from farce-like comedy to horror-like thriller. The other thing is the matter-of-course approach at both. Neither the comedy nor the horror is laboured or deliberately crafted. While the plot may sound outlandish, the delivery is so natural as to make it believable. A great deal of credit goes to the splendid cast.The movie opens with a crispy introduction of a ""cheap"" family, in every sense of the word. Out of a cramped basement, riding on a lucky break, the four members successively and successfully con their way into the household of a slick, ultra-modern, luxurious mega estate. First, the son becomes the English tutor of a naïve girl at puberty. He quickly gets his sister a job as the arts tutor of the girl's little brother. The father and mother, with the sibling's cunning plotting, soon replace the existing housekeeper and chauffer. The couple that employ them are unsuspicious, if not entirely gullible. At this point, nobody can fault you for thinking that the title refers, obviously, to these four.Then comes the twist at midpoint. When the masters take their kids on a camping trip, the ""parasite"" family live like royalties, albeit transiently. But it turns out that they are not the only ""parasite"" because there is one that fits the description even better - living in the bowels. A sudden visit from the discharged housekeeper reveals a secret - she has been hiding her husband in a secret basement unknown to the masters. Then, when the camping trip is cut short by foul weather, all hell breaks loose.While people may call this movie different things, the crux of the matter is the revelation of the resentment the Have-not harboured towards the Have."
PARASITE,29 October 2019,8/10,"'Parasite' can be summarized in a single word: WOW!Director Joon-ho Bong brought us the incredible films 'Memories of Murder', 'The Host', 'Mother', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', and now 'Parasite'. Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller.Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints.The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller."
PARASITE,8 July 2020,8/10,"This film starts out like a comedy but gets pretty dark. I can definitely see Bong's signature style that we can also see in Snowpiercer, especially the social satire. Both of the families in this film have their own issues that really come out. The main point is the overall setting, portrayed visually through the architecture. Everyone is trapped by the class system and cannot escape except by ruthlessly attacking each other for what amounts to not much in the end."
PARASITE,22 November 2019,8/10,"""Parasite"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we watch a struggling family doing everything it can in order to succeed. Since they are all unemployed they don't have anything to lose and they risk everything. After an opportunity that shows up they find themselves not only interested but a part of the wealthy and glamorous Parks. But everything changes when they get entangled in an unexpected incident which they couldn't even think of it.I enjoyed this movie because it was very unexpected and full of surprises. It had a lot of suspense and many surprising moments. Regarding the interpretations, Kang-ho Song who played as Kim Ki-taek was simply outstanding, Yeo-jeong Jo who played as Park Yeon-kyo was equally good and Woo-sik Choi who played as Kim Ki-woo made a very good interpretation. The direction which was made by Bong Joon Ho is simply amazing and in addition to a very interesting script makes this movie not only interesting but something very different and unique.Finally, I have to say that ""Parasite"" is a surprisingly great movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and if you haven't read any critics or reviews for this movie yet I am sure that you are going to enjoy it even more."
PARASITE,24 March 2020,7/10,"Let me say right away here that ""Parasite"" may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,9/10,"Over the course of well-regarded and unique films such as The Host, the under-appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja, Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades.Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever-present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins, Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite, that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all-time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box-office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars.Incomparable to any other film you could think of, Parasite is a very original beast, that believe it or not combines drama, comedy, thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co-inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre-understanding as possible.Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family, Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot-line that may seemingly be headed one way, only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected.Wonderfully played out by its core cast, with highlights from Kang-ho Song as father Ki-taek and Hye-jin Jang as mother Chung-sook, Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you're glued to the screen, unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho.As you watch the expertly directed, edited and scored film, one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next, you begin to appreciate that you're watching a director operating at the top of their game, in what's still likely a career only around its halfway mark, it's exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths.In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations, remakes or sequels, its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new, fresh and exhilarating, no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema-goers helped make Parasite a world-wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars.Final Say -While not flawless, Parasite isn't far off it, a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous, Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in-form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet.4 1/2 peaches out of 5"
PARASITE,31 October 2019,8/10,"There is a big hype about this movie, and for a good reason. Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names, Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses.So, overall, Parasite is good. If you like movies about real people, that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice, than watch this one. It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together. The performances were top notch as well. The story, finally, was well paced and interesting."
PARASITE,27 January 2020,6/10,"This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10"
PARASITE,31 August 2020,8/10,"Review:
Were do I start with this film! I really didn't know what to expect because every time I asked someone what it was about, no one could explain it, and now that I've watched it, I can totally understand why. I deliberately waited for the UK Steelbook release because I was hoping that it would come with an English dubbed version, which it didn't so I wasn't happy when I saw I had to read subtitles all the way through. I can honestly say, it wouldn't have worked with a dubbed version because of there expressions and tones. Now, after the first 15 minutes, I didn't know where the movie was going, and I personally thought that the rock was going to have some mystical and magical powers, but it's SO cleverly written and full of surprises throughout, and I'm glad that I didn't know what was going to happen. The acting is top class, and with the storyline being based around 2 families, in two houses, it proves that you don't need a massive budget to produce something special. A lot of people think that 1971 deserved the Oscar for best picture, but after watching this film it beats it hands down for its originality, acting and pure suspense. The amazing twists and turns, mixed with comedy and emotion, was put together extremely well, and you couldn't help but feel for the family who used their brains to get out of the gutter. There are little touches of genius, like the smell aspect of the storyline, and the way that the dad could turn on a switch of a button, which all come's together by the end of the film. Anyway, I fully recommend this movie to all moviegoers, except for kids of course, and I hope that people will give it a chance because you will be surprised with the outcome. Brilliant!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Bong Joon Ho, who also brought you Barking Dogs Never Bite in 2000, Memories of Murder, The Host, Tokyo!, Mother, Snowpiercer and Okja. The only movie that I have seen from his previous work, was Snowpiercer, which I wasn't that impressed with, but this film was unique and a touch of class. It's not often that I agree with the Oscar's panel, but in this case, I did. It won 4 awards, including Best Picture, Best International Film, Best Writing and Best Directing at the 2019 Awards Ceremony, and it's the first Non-English film to win an Oscar in the Best Picture category. Truly Deserved! It covers all genres, which is extremely rare, and the message about different classes is relevant to what is happening around the world today.Budget: $11.4million
Worldwide Gross: $257.5millionGenre: Comedy, Drama, Thriller
Cast: Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park, Jeong-eun Lee, Hye-jin Jang, Myeong-hoon Park and Ji-so Jung. 8/10"
PARASITE,15 October 2019,7/10,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,9/10,"""Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them."". ""It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money."". The Kim family, residing in the secluded darkness of a semi-underground basement apartment, acquire limited income. Jaggedly folding pizza boxes for an independent takeaway chain, with the already low-paying income reduced as a consequence of poor workmanship. They, much like the bottom-feeders of South Korea's working class division, struggle to survive. Consuming rotting food. Hijacking neighbouring paid Wi-Fi services. Residing in potentially diseased sub-urban streets. Ultimately aspiring to achieve the lofty heights of upper-class formalities. Conceptualising the popularised term ""Hell Joseon"", a critique on the current socioeconomic declining trajectory of South Korea. As the Kims tucked into their minimised dinner, son Ki-woo's university friend gifts the family a scholar's rock. Traditionally granting the bearer a promise of wealth. Swiftly after, he offers a proposition to Ki-woo. To continue his vocation as an English tutor for the elegant daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. Ki-woo ponders, fabricating a plan that would seize this opportunity for beneficial gain. A chance to relish in the opposing scale of unequalised capitalism. After a successful lesson, Ki-woo insists his awareness for an art therapy teacher at the behest of the gullible Choi Yeon-gyo for her son. Ki-woo, unbeknown to the Parks, invites his sister Ki-jung to provide these lessons. Gradually, the Kim family, one-by-one, assimilate themselves into the lives of the Park family, pretending to be unrelated. The poor draining the wealth and opportunism from the rich.Before tackling this critically lauded feature, which has now grown to be one of the highest-rated productions of all-time in such an inconsequential amount of time, the black humour of director Joon-ho's filmography acted as preparation for what was to be expected. Providing critiques on sociopolitical endeavours that overburden an OECD nation. Predictably, yet efficiently, Joon-ho's darkly comedic satire on class conflict manages to succinctly tackle the enragement of allocated resources that supplies social inequality and wealth disparity through the microcosmic insight of two opposing families. Not just in prosperity or affluence, but in temperament. A reflection of late-stage capitalism where the enticingly inviting wealthy superfluously ignore the difficulties of life for the remaining population. Youth unemployment at the expense of extortionate higher education fees. Affordability for shelter and essential food items rapidly dissipating along with the lower class. The Kims perpetuate these foreboding crises, utilising fraudulent and forgery crimes to attain the standard of living that many aspire to achieve. Yet, beneath the sharply hilarious foundations of Joon-ho's screenplay, which confidently satirises the naivety and credulity of opulence whilst embedding thought-provoking themes of affirmative contemplation and economic disassociation, is a visceral vision of palpable colonialism.The Parks original housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang imitating North Korea's dictatorial leader, whom openly yearns to invade South Korea, mimicking the voice and mannerisms of a propagandist news reporter. Before engaging in a fight with the Kims for social dominance, a microcosm for the poor fighting the poor. The Parks' son, Da-song, frolicking in the freshly sprinkled garden in an ""Indian"" outfit, memorialising colonial occupation. Whilst these are included as surface-level replications, the contextual substance beneath these depictions hark back to the economic order of capitalism. The poor decline, and the rich rise. The latter viewing the former as parasitical microbes feeding off of their principled success. Staircases acting as prominent motifs to accentuate economic disparity, with Kyung-pyo's clinically precise cinematography emphasising their thematic purpose through extensive shots from banished basements and luxurious lounges.Coincidentally, Joon-ho intelligently avoids assigning protagonists, rather viewing the perspectives of both social classes as unethical divisions of society, with the ""upstairs/downstairs"" ideology implying this viewpoint. Each cast member supplying bountiful amounts of energy and deliverance in depicting the social divide. Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong especially, with their eccentric portrayals of two parents from each end of the divide. The onscreen chemistry between Woo-shik and So-dam also enhanced the close familial bonds within the Kim family, working as a crime syndicate rather than individuals.Every technicality and thematic endeavour was on course for perfection. From Jae-il's orchestral score to Jin-mo's precise editing. All Joon-ho had to do, to truly finish with finesse, was solidify a resonant conclusion. For a moment, with Ki-taek rampantly abandoning Da-song's birthday party, he did. Fade to black. A statement on everything that was depicted previously was conceptualised in these final moments. Perfection! Alas, the feature resumed, and it kept going. The aftermath of the party, narration included, and the proceeding weeks unfortunately quelled the outstanding momentum that preceded the lavishly wrapped conclusion. In spite of the proposed incalculable unlikelihood of the climactic fantasy scenario, heavily inferring the inescapable boundaries of the proposed ""coup de grace"" for a particular individual, it was too immaculate. Heavy-handedly providing implications in a film that astoundingly dealt with nuanced subtextual thematic representations.However, despite the agitated reservations for Joon-ho's embellished ending, Parasite is a dramatic journey that is boundless in scope. Seamlessly blending genres through prosperous performances and luxurious direction, Joon-ho fully realises the dual meaning behind the feature's title through sheer confidence. The poor infiltrating the wealthy, and the rich leeching off of the working-class' labour. Society is self-parasitical. No grand life plan will change that. ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all""."
PARASITE,16 November 2020,6/10,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10."
PARASITE,22 August 2020,10/10,"Often you can look at the awards given to a film and upon watching it wonder who gave large bags of cash to whom?
In the case of Parasite, every good thing that has been said about this movie is true!
Engaging, dramatic, funny, tragic, original and more.
Congratulations to all those involved :)"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.
The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,"A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety."
PARASITE,5 February 2021,9/10,"Oscar deserved, a wonderful production, incredibly necessary social criticism and fascinating development ... Everything very well produced, great performances, improbable and surprising situations, we almost sympathize with the evildoers, tricky with a good heart, or not, interesting, that none of them, no matter how bad whatever their actions were, they had good intentions, unreasonable ambitions... The simple, short, now black and almost imperceptible humor, I like very much, besides the suspense / terror / drama genre... I love..."
PARASITE,4 September 2019,10/10,This movie is really great korean movie with great cast and just idea for this movie is unique and it is one of best foreign movies out there
PARASITE,4 March 2020,8/10,"The Best Picture win for ""Parasite"" finally convinced some local cinemas to me to give it a whirl. Though I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it. (Also, I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph)Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) lives in a subterranean apartment with his family. One day, he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So) the daughter of a wealthy family. Spying the opportunity to exploit the family, Ki-Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) as art tutor to Da-Hye's younger brother. His father, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) replaces the family's chauffer and most importantly, his mother, Park Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin) replaces Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) as the families trusted housekeeper. All is going well for the Kim family, until one night when the Parks are away - the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement, to collect something she's left behind.I enjoyed ""Parasite"" a lot. The performances are great. Kim Ki-taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down. The direction and cinematography are excellent. I enjoyed the story, and particular, not knowing exactly where the film was going to go. I'd seen ""The Host"" before, so I know that Boon Joon-Ho is capable of taking his films into B-Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror/science fiction plots in mind. I don't feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some.My problem was that I really don't know much about how South Korean society works. I'm assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea. That the ""Parasite"" of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks, and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees. But again, I feel like I'm guessing this, rather than being sure.That doesn't really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,2/10,Best foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.How did Joker get overlooked?
PARASITE,15 November 2021,8/10,"I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.Park Seo-Hoon offers his poorer friend a job to tutor a high school girl he plans on asking out when she gets into university.

The family asked their driver to drive her home as it was night and he did so but the sneaky girl removed her panties and dropped it in the back. The rich dad was sitting in the backseat and found the panties. He discusses this with his wife - he wonders if their driver gets off from having his sperm on the seat. He says a young guy's sex life is none of his business but it is gross. That was when the art tutor's recommendation was wanted and her father is hired.The father reports to the rich mom that their housekeeper has tuberculosis. He overheard her at the hospital apparently. She doesn't it is just that she has an extreme allergy to peaches and they took advantage of this. The father drips sauce that looks like blood into the tissue in the garbage. The housekeeper is fired.The rich family is off to go camping for their son's birthday.

PARASITE,10 March 2020,9/10,"Ever since his first film, director Bong Joon-ho has been interested in class divide. And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite, where a low-class family of four, down on their luck, infiltrate an upper class household, each posing as a separate helper. One is a tutor to their daughter, another a driver, and so forth.And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating. Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character, brimming with personality, hopes and aspirations. Sure, what they're doing is questionable and even immoral, but the film is told from their point of view and you can't really hate them for trying to reach for those stars. It's not like they're hurting anyone. Initially.But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it's deadly serious, fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense. Before that twist, Parasite was already a great film, but afterwards it became a masterpiece.It also helps that Bong is a splendid director. Each scene, each shot, is measured, beautiful and poignant. The whole film look amazing, but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling. Such an impactful scene. For the rich, it's just a night of rain drumming their roof. Kind of relaxing, actually. They don't have to worry about it. But for the poor, it's a night of nightmares, floods and loss. For them, it's the end of their lives as they knew it.Parasite earned it's Best Picture Oscar and I'm so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films. It's a film full of heavy themes, brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks. Heavily recommended."
PARASITE,17 November 2019,6/10,"This 2019 crime-drama tells of a needy, Asian family that sneaks their way into a wealthy businessman's home by pretending to be hired help and after one of their children tutors his daughter. Things go well at first, but take a drastic turn effecting everyone involved. This is a pretty good film with a bit of humorous, tense and dramatic moments. Give this one a try if you enjoy Foreign or crime
films."
PARASITE,2 November 2019,8/10,"""Parasite"" (2019 release from South Korea; 132 min.) brings the story of the Kim family. As the movie opens, we get to know the family: they live in a semi-basement apartment, and mom and dad are out of work, and their teenage son and daughter aren't in much better shape. Then one day, the son's friend Min informs him that he is leaving the country, and that it would be good if the son takes over for him as the private English tutor of a HS sophomore girl, whose family is well-off, if not rich. The son agrees, and before we know it he is now the English tutor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho, best known for his 2013 ""Snowpiercer"" film. Here he brings a one-of-a-kind story that is so plot-heavy that I cannot take any risks in spoiling anything, so my comments will be brief. Let me say this: there is a good reason that ""Parasite"" won the top prize (Palme d'or) at this year's Cannes film festival, and I will already go on record that there is zero chance that this movie isn't getting an Oscar nomination early next year for Best Foreign Language movie. The movie is everything that Hollywood at its worst (with endless sequels, prequels, franchises and ""re-imaginations"") isn't: It's original, it's witty, and it's storytelling at its very best.""Parasite"" got a limited release in New York and LA in early October, and has gradually been rolling out to more cities. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Man, I couldn't wait to see this! The Friday late afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (10 people), but I am quite certain that as word of mouth gets around, this will find its box office legs in the weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a top=notch foreign movie that is original and witty and will have you on the edge of your seat, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, to check this out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
PARASITE,17 October 2019,6/10,"Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His ""heroes"" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.
The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.
The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.
Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself ""Jessica"" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces ""Uncle Kim"" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the ""uncle"" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.
The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When ""Uncle Kim"" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.
Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).
When Moon-kwang discovers the new ""hired help"" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.
As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is ""permitting the outrage without the consequences."" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.
A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.
Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.
But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.
Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.
Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet."
PARASITE,6 October 2019,8/10,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
PARASITE,22 October 2019,8/10,"I herd good things about this movie but I never expected I would love it so much. It was brilliant. Reminds me of another brilliant movie I just saw JoJo Rabbit. Like JoJo Rabbit that movie's dark humor gets you swept in before hitting you with just pure darkness (although you get a better shining light with Parasite)
It's a well done picture. I'm taken away by what a good story about social status is was.
Recommend highly"
PARASITE,27 June 2021,10/10,"Parasite (2019) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it was released. The storyline involves a family down on their luck and funds when they find an opportunity they can't pass up. They've been asked to house sit for a wealthy family while on vacation and have strict rules on how they need to take care of the house. Each member of the family lies to the wealthy family and takes a role within their household. When the family comes back from their trip early, the working family needs to work really hard to hide their scheming ways; unfortunately for them, there may be secrets going on all around them they could have never anticipated. This movie is directed by Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer) and stars Kang-ho Song (The Host), Sun-kyun Lee (A Hard Day), Yeo-jeong Cho (The Concubine) and Woo-sik Choi (Train to Busan). The storyline for this is awesome and very well paced. The character development and interactions throughout the film was perfect and the cast had great chemistry. The body language and dialogue throughout the film is creepy and well executed and the sudden intensity at the end of the movie was awesome. This is just a well done film that is very compelling, smart, entertaining and worth your time. This is a masterpiece that is easy to score a 10/10 and recommending for your collection."
PARASITE,21 January 2020,9/10,"Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020."
PARASITE,29 March 2021,10/10,"The Kims, a clever but out-of-work family living in a Seoul basement slowly inveigles themselves into the lives of the Parks, a wealthy family living in a designer home looking down on the city, only to discover that they are not the only people abusing the Park's unwitting hospitality. Bong Joon-ho's Oscar wining exploration of class distinctions is an entertaining spin on the 'upstairs/downstairs' diptych and is very well made, with an engaging cast, great production values and cinematography and an excellent score. Next only to 2017's 'The Shape of Water', 'Parasite' is the most unusual film ever to take home the Oscars for Best Picture and Director (but deservedly on both counts). Fun and memorable."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,8/10,"Yes, the script is equal to the task, there are several twists (but also predictable moments), performances are pleasant (Song Kang-ho as Kim and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi), but apparently my expectations were too high after lots of awards and accolades. The title is ambiguous, and the course of events is as the Coen brothers would join forces with Tarantino...The film in question won 4 Academy Awards and it is nice, but if I look back on The King´s Speech, Rain Man, or No Country for Old Men - also with 4 Oscars, then I have to admit I liked those more. My bad... :)"
PARASITE,20 December 2019,6/10,"I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."
PARASITE,28 March 2020,,"Somewhere in a slum of South Korea, a tight-knit, underprivileged family (two parents, two kids) struggle to make ends meet, each day clinging to the hope of wealth and good fortune. When the son lands a gig tutoring the child of a well-to-do family, the father seizes the opportunity to escape their squalid existence...to reveal any more would be a travesty. Takes its time getting started, but once it does hang on! Spellbinding mixture of social commentary, greed, horror, dark comedy, familial bonds, and a totally unpredictable narrative with creative, clever story twists that you can't possibly see coming, this inspires a multitude of emotions like anger, sadness, pity, humorous shock and awe, and just refuses to let up. The ending is padded-out, and definitely stretches the limits of credulity, but the film's overall impact is simply undeniable. Daring, ambitious, and ingeniously handled by Bong Joon-ho (deservedly earning a best director Oscar) who manages to pull the rug out even when you're sure you've got things figured out. ***½"
PARASITE,26 January 2020,10/10,10/10 - undoubtedly original and captivating...this is why we go to the cinema
PARASITE,29 November 2019,7/10,"I saw ""Parasite"", starring Kang_Ho Song-Snowpiercer, The Good The Bad The Weird; Woo_Sik Choi-Okja, Set Me Free; So_Dam Park-Fukuoka, The Priests and Hye_Jin Jang-Mothers, Marine Boy.
In case you couldn't tell by the actors names above, this is a South Korean movie with sub_titles. It explores the question, exactly who is the parasite? Between the rich and the poor, either group could be considered a parasite on the other one. Kang_Ho is the father of an unemployed family in South Korea. When an opportunity pops up for his son, Woo_Sik, to be a private tutor to a rich family, Woo_Sik gets an idea for employing the rest of his family, including his father, Kang_Ho, his sister, So_Dam, and his mother, Hye_Jin. There are complications, of course, which come to a head as each member of his family takes the place of a former employee and before it's over, blood is spilled and people are dead.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD, but it would be a good rental."
PARASITE,13 November 2019,6/10,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,9/10,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho
SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan
CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin
In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.
Main Character
Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.
Supporting Characters
Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.
Story
The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.
Script
The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.
Style
First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.
Overall
Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"This film is always going to be known as the first international (nonEnglish) film to win best picture. I am glad that the Oscars finally honored world cinema and I am especially glad this is a very good movie.I don't have much to add to what others have said. It is funny social satire, an engaging thriller and heart breaking drama (esp. the last shot of the film) rolled into a story that feels to go everywhere it needs to. I have watched this twice and it is such a engaging story first and foremost. That it also functions as a rebuke of capital makes the film richer but the social themes don't overwhelm it as pure storytelling.The film has a great vertical aspect to its visual constructions. It has a lot of stairs in the film and the camera is moving up and down a lot during it. It is not overdone but the use of space is really striking. So glad I blind bought this."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,8/10,"A poor street savvy family trick their way into taking on various roles working for a very rich family. The con works well until an unexpected turn of events leaves them in danger of being found out.Extraordinarily absorbing film which manages to combine societal messages with high drama and laugh out loud comedy. All the characters in both families are a pleasure to be with - there are no villains here - and you just sit back and enjoy a well scripted journey in the certain knowledge that it's going to end in tears. The sets and the set pieces (the storm, the piece under the table etc) are superbly structured and the main house begins to feel like a genuine home. A lingering, audacious masterpiece"
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"(Flash Review)WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder."
PARASITE,24 June 2021,9/10,"Parasite is a black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho and stars Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, Lee Jung-eun, Jang Hye-jin, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Ji-so and Jung Hyeon-jun.The best part of the movie is it's highly engaging story which will not even give you a reason to blink, the movie has all the ingredients to keep you engaged. The running time of the movie is of two hours but you'll feel that this is the shortest two hours you've ever spent on any movie.The director has chosen the characters very carefully and each of the characters were just artistically brilliant in the portray of their assigned character. The acting will leave you spell-bounded and the realism in the acting will leave you awestruck.The screenplay of the movie is brilliant and there are regular shocks and turns with mind boggling twists which will keep increasing the interest in the movie. The climax of the movie describes why Bong Joon-ho is considered one of the greatest directors of his era.In the end i would like to thank you for trading my review and would suggest to watch this magnificently crafted work of art which will keep you mesmerized and entertained."
PARASITE,10 October 2019,8/10,"This film has it all comedy, drama, horror and anything else you can squeeze out of it. It works really well. Four characters that literally take over another families life."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,8/10,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."
PARASITE,3 December 2019,6/10,"There is a house on a hill, and there are people in it. And they're nice, but not really. There is a garden, and there they get a lot of sunlight. And it is nice, and they get to sleep there sometimes.There is a house underground, and there are people in it. And they're the first to tell you that they're not very nice: they're con-men, grifters, forgers and imposters. They sit among stink bugs, and they've been there for so long that maybe they've convinced themselves that they just belong there.There is a rock, and it is a gift, but it is also a burden. And maybe it's a metaphor, but it's also just a rock: solid and heavy, difficult to lug around, and dangerous in the wrong hands. Some people will tell you that it's supposed to bring wealth. But again, it's also just a rock.There is a line, and it cannot be crossed.There is a smell, and it comes from the underground. And the people who live in the house on the hill can smell it. And the people who live underground try to imagine a life in the sun, a future where they aren't just garbage to be washed away in the rain. But there is a smell that sticks to them, and they know that they can never really belong.There is a world, and it is nice, but not really. There are houses on hills, and houses underground. There is plenty of sun, but it isn't for everybody. There are people grateful to be slaves, and people unhappy to be served. There are systems that we are born into, and they create these lines that cannot be crossed. And we all dream of something better, but we've been living with these lines for so long that we've convinced ourselves that there really isn't anything to be done.There is a knife. And it doesn't do much in the long run, but there will always be some satisfaction in crossing some lines."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,,"The movie is watchable, but a failure. The first part is slow but it builds up well. Still, when the things go down for the characters, the story goes down also. It had to end somewhere, I guess, but everything loses focus and probably the people taking it as a social statement are right.Anyway, I don't get the comedy of the first part. Probably the Korean style of drama is too exotic to me. And I surely don't get the oh, so common, gore and gratuitous violence that come with movies made by people living there."
PARASITE,1 November 2020,9/10,"Despite hearing about this from day dot, I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it's title, director and subsequent success. Boy am I glad, because it's quite the ride!No doubt about it, 'Parasite' is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.The cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun.I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. From the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. You name it, this produces it on an impressive level.Not that I need to say this, given I'm seemingly one of the last few who hadn't, but you must watch this!"
PARASITE,10 November 2020,10/10,"With no idea what that was about, I went through it, laughing my belly out, almost falling from my chair, enjoying it tremendously, being destabilized and shocked with my mouth half-open...(+) Superb screenplay and story(+) Superb accompanying music(+) Amazing and believable acting. One of the best group acting that I've ever seen(+) Very good and smooth development throughout(-) Minor unrealistic events toward the end, dissipated in the satirical story and of no real importanceKorean productions have a force and class of their own, being Comedy, Drama or Horror; Most of them shine and they shine deeply.Highly recommended and deserving the Palme d'Or that it won."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,A good movie in which the plot plays 'second fiddle' to the incredible visuals. The social message is obvious and the story is more like a graphic novel.
PARASITE,5 May 2020,10/10,"PARASITE is that rare movie that works for both cinephiles and an audience seeking nothing more than an entertaining two hours. For me, this is the best sort of movie, giving the audience both food for thought and a great time. Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal."
PARASITE,12 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,9/10,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."
PARASITE,31 March 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job. I guess the ending bothered me a little bit, but I'll admit it helped to reinforced what the movie was trying to say."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,7/10,"Okay, so as many have stated before it is funny comedy, but also unpredictable and a suspenseful thriller. I don't like the ending tho, I think father went a bit out of character, I don't buy it that he would have stabbed the rich man, I understand why he did that, but it's not enough for this character to do such drastic moves. I also dislike that son survived, but daughter died, by their wounds, I would've prefered opposite."
PARASITE,15 September 2019,9/10,"Superb mix of comedy and tragedy, happiness, sadness, joy and sympathy. Serious theme in a very exciting and refreshing way. Well done."
PARASITE,9 December 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!"
PARASITE,13 September 2020,6/10,"The Kims are a struggling lower class family. One day the son gets an opportunity from a friend. He also gets some good-luck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film. He can work as an English tutor for a rich family. His sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears US educated. He gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee. The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn't home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age. But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he's some kind of painter prodigy. That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an ""art therapist"" for the troubled son. So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she's meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper. They succeed. When the Parks leave for a weekend, the Kims celebrate in the mansion. Then the former housekeeper shows up. She reveals that there is a secret basement where she's been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money. Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her. She takes some video. The families fight over the video. Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon. The Kims hide under the living room table. The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured. Her husband is bound back in his basement room.Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room. There's heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded. Then they get a call from the Parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day. In the middle of the party, the housekeeper's husband has freed himself. and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim's head in with his good luck rock, then attacks daughter Kim with a knife. Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims. That leads father Kim to attack Park after he's taken care of the housekeeper's husband.Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working/scheming family and the wealthy/naive family whose ""problems"" are mostly blown up minor issues. The characters are slightly cartoonish. Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2/3rds of the movie. You do end up rooting for the Kims. The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse. It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn't recover. From then on you know and expect something you happen, you just don't know from which direction it will come. In the end it's somewhat of a surprise but it doesn't amount to much really.Sure, economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor, no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable, thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed. It's not so much about class warfare but rather codependency. As with any codependent relationship, there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments. But there is no major message in the movie. It could have don't more with the theme but it went for an easy solution, one that doesn't solve anything."
PARASITE,24 August 2019,10/10,Probably the best movie of this year. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Acting is so natural and trailer didn't reveal anything to me and I'm grateful for that. This is another Korean masterpiece and it reminds me a little of Oldboy. It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.
PARASITE,2 November 2019,10/10,I can't get enough of it. I watched it second time and it is even better than first time and first time was like amazing amazing.
PARASITE,7 December 2019,10/10,"This is the best movie of 2019, over.
RESPECT, over."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,10/10,"This time I watched it in theatre with very annoying crowd. They laughed all the time but the reaction to second half of the movies was priceless (everyone was like wtf is happening). Oscars not nominating Kang-ho Song for best supporting actor is a disgrace.
Also, it deserved at least cinematography nomination but whatever."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,After 6th watch I think I got all little details and all messages. I really love the climate change/rain message. He changes genres so smoothly and never bored me once on my 3rd watch in last week and a half. I just gotta say Bravo Bong!!!
PARASITE,9 August 2019,9/10,"Theme is nothing new, a topic of gap between rich and poor ones, which an social issue we hear everyday. But on top of the theme, the story aims at showing the dark side of the human being, no matter poor or rich are also dark. I like the every single little details described such as the master annoyed by the smell of driver. It's so vivid. The story end well without too much fuzzy parts. The director nail it by showing a serious theme but in an very entertaining way. Awesome movie!"
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,"With a fantastic cast, fabulous sense of direction, and a truly wild sense of storytelling, Parasite checks all the right boxes for a best picture winner, and proves to be something truly new, by also relying on things found familiar. The main cast is truly spectacular, with Kang-Ho Song and Cho Yeo-jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances. The dialogue is rich and relatable, and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often. The film's pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks, with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime, and thoroughly entertained without. The film simply never stops, it doesn't shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling, but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly, it truly is quite impressive. The cinematography is outstanding, with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view. Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming, the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations, and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so. In the end however, Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon-Ho and is one of, if not, the best work he has made to date.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
PARASITE,26 November 2019,8/10,"I'm a fan of Joon-ho Bong's films, although I haven't seen one of his most famous films, ""Memories of Murder."" I was very excited to see this movie with my wife, who, uncharacteristically, was interested in a foreign art film.There's a lot going on in this movie so I am afraid my own exploration of it here, will only scratch the surface of what there is to say about it. I'll only briefly mention the cinematography which is just wonderful. This is Joon-ho unleashed from the bonds of entertainment that are part and parcel with a film that is released on Netflix (Okja) or in American theaters (Snowpiercer.) Here, he can luxuriate with height imagery ranging from subterranean staircases to winding city streets descending into the slums in order to sub-textually communicate ideas to his audience and he does it with subtle panache'.What I think the average movie goer will appreciate most about this film is the dichotomy of humor and terror in the characters, acting, script, and general 'feel' of the film. It is certainly the most jarring turn of atmosphere I have seen in a film this year and one that I like to imagine every one who watches this film will enjoy and experience as a true revelation.The themes of class struggle and survival all writ large in this film. From the beginning where we see the poor as they seek to find the means to sustain their lives by abandoning their true identities to be whatever the rich want them to be in order to glean scraps from their table to the dismissal of the poor for even the hint of an offense rather than actually getting to know them and their place to the desperation of people being asked to sub-exist and their eventual reaction, this film stuns by not only displaying the benefits of a life linked to a wealthy person and the happiness that some find there but also watching that happiness turn to despair as time passes.The humor and joy that is in ""Parasite"" is truly experienced by the audience so that the turn feels true as well when the rug is pulled out. This isn't a horror movie with a dash of humor, or a funny movie with a sprinkle of violent class struggle. It is both, one of the funniest movies I've seen all year and the terror inducing in the same way as the best atmospheric horror that $11.50 at your local cinema can buy.All of this is interesting but, if done too heavy-handed, feels preachy or propagandist. Luckily, Joon-ho knows how to restrain himself from such blunt force methods as having someone scream something like ""Soylent green is people,"" or ""You maniacs, you blew it up."" (boy did CH ever corner the market on that.) By restraining himself it allows the audience to come to conclusions, ask questions, and discuss amongst themselves without the feeling of manipulation. It respects the audience enough to say, ""I'm not going to tell you how to think but check out this funny, crazy, and fantastic situation and let's hear what YOU think.""I imagine there are a host of other interesting reading of this film and that is what makes it so fascinating and gives me some degree of comfort when I call this movie more than a movie. It is Art.Not everyone is into art. I am. If you are too than you should definitely be searching this movie out, supporting it, thinking about it, and discussing it. I know I was thinking about it for days afterward. Weeks now, I guess."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing."
PARASITE,5 September 2019,,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."
PARASITE,28 April 2020,9/10,"Writer/director Bong Joon Ho (""The Host"" ""Snowpiercer"" ""Okja"") has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary. From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With ""Parasite"" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,8/10,"Who is the antagonist? This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself. He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy, and, as I wondered who the antagonist was, I remembered that in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves. Then the answer clicked. The antagonists are the Kims.So, the Kims are a poor family of four, struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life's niceties. In the opening scene, we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom (where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room) to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs. The son, Dong Ik, gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family. Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher/therapist for the younger child, a position driving the patriarch for his father, and the position of housekeeper for his mother. The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot, but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper. And that is where the con takes another level.Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home, creating the impression, when the patriarch finds them, that the driver was having sex with women in his car. He gets let go, replaced by Ki Taek, Dong Ik's father. To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning, since she had been with the house from the house's previous owner. They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper's life-threatening allergy to peach fuzz. The Kims are not good people. They're deceptive, cruel, and dishonest.The Parks, on the other hand, are a mixture of detached, thoughtless, and unfeeling. They're not really good people either. They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear, fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him. They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis.The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces. It's hard to get into how that manifests late in the film (essentially past the halfway point) without digging into spoilers, so I'll speak in generalities. It's the Kim's duplicitousness that gets them into the situation that undoes them. It's their lies that keep them from finding solutions that will actually work. On the other side is the Parks whose thoughtlessness and lack of feeling brought in the destructive force into their homes to begin with. There are no heroes or villains in this story, only flawed people who can't grow.The movie is filled with imagery as well. From the scholar's rock that Dong Ik carries around, meant as a symbol for wealth, to the constant vertical motion of the characters. There's a large sequence where a torrential downpour hits the city and the Kims, after having been trapped in the Park's house because of their presumption that the richer family would be out of town all night, run down the hills of Seoul to their half-underground dwelling that's been filled with water, the toilet spewing a black substance because of the messed up pressure. The Kims left their window open that allowed the water in. Would they have left it open if they hadn't spent the night at the Parks' residence? The rain isn't the fault of either the Parks or the Kims, but it affects both families very differently. Atop their hill in their mansion, the Parks simply watch it from their window, appreciating the aesthetics. The Kims get wiped out and end up abandoning their home to sleep on the floor of a local gym along with the others who were displaced.It's an interesting and highly entertaining look into the class differences present in South Korea. It's alternatively extremely funny, horrifying, and even touching. It can be all three in seconds, and it ends up working because the tone never really jumps. It's evenly and expertly filmed with an eye towards black comedy and tragedy mixed into one package."
PARASITE,29 September 2020,10/10,"It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,9/10,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Brilliantly directed, Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn't let go.JIM'S REVIEW: Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal, but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement. His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man. Yet, his films can range to a host of genres, from horror film to surreal sci-fi to political satire. One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived, still contain powerful messages about greed, consumerism, and class struggles.Parasite may be his best film to date. It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome. The film starts out as a dark comedy, then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story. It is an exhilarating ride. Dare I say, very twisted, metaphorically speaking.The literate screenplay by Han Jin-won and co-authored by the director contrasts two Korean families: the Kims, a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub-basement apartment doing menial low-paying jobs just to get by, and the Parks, an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted. The Kims' work their way into the Parks' lives through their lies and deceptive action, all resulting in tragic events.The script cleverly weaves The Kims' greedy scheming against the Parks' naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence. The film does have one too many anti-climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact, but Bong Joon-ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war.The cast is wonderful. Song Kang-ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye-jin is his shrewish wife. Choi Woo-shik is their idealistic son and Park So-dam is their wily daughter. They battle Lee Sun-kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo-jeong, in a scene-stealing role, as his fragile and dim wife.Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes. Visually, the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha-jun Lee. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong lenses the two settings, lighting one home in dark umber hues and claustrophobic low angles while using bright intense lighting to imply the stark formal symmetry of the other dwelling in order to establish the imbalance of both families.Parasite is insightful and excels in its execution. Bong Joon-ho creates lasting images that correspond directly to his narratives. His film has much to say about the ongoing power struggle between those who have and those who have not. Simply put, it is one of the year's best films."
PARASITE,11 September 2019,9/10,"My Rating : 9/10Believe me, you are in for a ride!It's weirdly engaging and oddly satisfying - I love my thrillers and 'Parasite' certainly didn't disappoint. I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.What stood out for me personally was the acting from every cast member, the superb cinematography and the most laugh-out-loud hilarious infusion of humour and superbly crafted comedic, sad and horrific moments juxtaposed so as to play with the emotional state of the viewer in a most artistic way only a skilful filmmaker like Bong Joon-Ho can.All in all, technical mastery From Mr. Bong Joon-Ho. A Must-See Korean Black Comedy! This film is a milestone for Korean cinema."
PARASITE,5 December 2019,10/10,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
PARASITE,21 December 2019,9/10,"Crazy movie. Really, really original, entertaining, and shocking. I walked out of the theatre very impressed. Easily one of the best films of 2019."
PARASITE,23 August 2019,8/10,"This is certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. (Others have already summarized the plot, so I won't go over that again here.) Indeed, it kept getting stranger and more unpredictable with each new scene.It is, however, also one of the most imaginative and creative films I have seen. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to handle something that is perpetually unforeseeable.My only problem was the subtitles. I saw the movie tonight here in France with French subtitles. Half the time I could not read the white subtitles against a light or white background. It is so easy to put a black cartouche around the subtitles to make them always readable. Sure, you lose a little of the original image, but that's better than losing your audience for half the picture.Something distributors need to rethink."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.4/4"
PARASITE,12 June 2020,8/10,"Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend if you're okay with subtitles.What in the world? Why was everyone SO HYPED about this? Yes its good, but its not even ""Get Out"" good.We follow an awful family of financial parasites (the movie should have been called ""Parasites"", much more apt), and while I didn't necessarily see the ""twists"" coming, they were so natural that they weren't surprises so much as they were just things that made sense.I don't think Americans are able to gauge good quality of entertainment (see any reality tv show). While this is good, it shouldn't have taken America by storm like it did. This should be a bar for movies to reach (and honestly it shouldn't be so hard to get on the same level as this movie: we just lack originality and substance over...explosions and punching).The main thing that makes this movie good is that there are no heroes (from the very beginning, it is established that the protagonists are awful), but those with and those without, and it doesn't seem to matter how you get what you get as long as you get it.And while Americans are going to go wild relating to wronging their peers to get by, the focus is on ""take from the rich"" so a crude lens is going to justify their actions when its still legally and morally wrong, but there is a capitalistic mindset that just sees the survival and the gains as a win.This movie has some depth and substance to it that you don't normally see from America, and this is one that is worth the read."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,If you like Asian cinema and are curious about which movie to see before tonight's oscar ceremony then this movie is a must see. Despite being a Korean movie with subs it has a lot of excitement and drama to make it an upset at tonight's telecast.
PARASITE,1 March 2020,6/10,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge."
PARASITE,18 August 2019,8/10,"1.General review
South Korea has been leading for 30 years on the road to pursuing art and resonating with the audience.
The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts, but they also mean a good and tangible experience. Commercial films are just the opposite. Nowadays, the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception.
At this time, Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money.2.The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking
The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions. But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil.
In the traditional film of the reaction to the class, the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor, and the poor are always diligent and kind. The film is the opposite. The rich man is a hard-working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward; the poor are savage and sneaky.
The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film's creative thinking is more mature, and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition. And through more realistic role positioning, with the plot, to communicate with the audience.3.Understatement and into the wood
This film is used to distinguish the class, the most important thing is the smell. You don't need a luxury shoe bag, you don't need to travel Shopping, just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid, has become a finishing touch.
What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time? The film gives a more appropriate description, ""cooking the taste of the rag"". This distinction does not help the audience not applaud.
The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor. It's just the smell, with the long ladder in the rainstorm, the sewage filled in the basement, it seems to be understated but it is three times.
As a negative example, you can compare the ""Taste of Money"" (2012), I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen, how boring.4.Calm, is the biggest gap
After completing the division of the two classes by smell, how to show the gap between the two classes? The director gave a unique answer: calm.
When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window, he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes: calmly.
The version of the poor is given from the father's mouth: ""People should not have plans, and they will not go wrong without planning.""
This kind of contrast is not obvious when you look at it, but when you are fine, you understand the difference in attitudes between life and the scorpio between the two classes.5.Performance, icing on the cake
The performance of the two actors of the father and mother in the film can be said to be the icing on the cake.
Song Kangxi In the basement and driving, the deliberate expression of self-esteem can make the audience feel the inferiority of the inner character of the wrapped person, and thus can end the anger and stab the president. This is the anger of the little man who was dismissed. In particular, the one that turned back after the president of the thorny center was full of confusion, confusion, and helplessness.
Zhang Huizhen's mother, when she was drinking in the rainy night, had a very wonderful performance. The expression was in a few seconds from scare to anger to fear of the last laugh, and every trembling of the face muscles was a play.6.Not perfect, there are also disadvantages
The whole plot is divided into three sections. The plots with some fine details can be trimmed in the middle, and the main line is not helpful.
In addition, I don't really like the end of the film. Father escaped from reality and how do you know when to pass information? Reuniting the sun seems to be a reflection of the darkness of reality, but the actual painting is superfluous.7.Written at the end
There is a stone in the play that symbolizes the flow of class, which was eventually discarded by his son.
For the contemporary society, poverty is the only disease. Stone is not an antidote."
PARASITE,4 August 2020,5/10,"I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,9/10,"This is quite a tour de force, scooping up all the prizes in this award season (so far). It begins as a comedy of circumstance but takes a decided turn into some unexpected genres. The story is surprising and multi-layered. Your allegiances will shift throughout. The acting is superb. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Comedy, Thriller, Drama}"
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Jung-eun, Jeong Ji-so, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Hyeon-jun, Park Seo-joon, Park Geun-rok. (R)Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.91/100"
PARASITE,23 February 2020,9/10,What and how and why and when that is the questions you gonna ask at the end
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is pure art. The subtle theme becomes entangled with the characters' lives and relationships. Must watch. i give 9/10 because this movie made me sad , its a education for us not an entertainment . as education i would give 10/10
as an Entertainment 9/10 for me . anyway its a must watch for everyone ."
PARASITE,15 August 2019,8/10,"It's safe to say the Joon-ho Bong is one of the greatest original storytellers of our generation. The man's filmography speaks for itself. Barking Dogs Never Bite, Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Okja, and now, Parasite - that's the kind of portfolio to be proud of. Now let's talk about the movie in question here.Parasite is a darkly funny social satire that paints a subtle (yet not-so-subtle) picture of different social strata. On one hand, we have Kim Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), an out-of-work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook (a mighty effective Jang Hye-jin) and his two college-age kids Ki-woo and Ki-jyeong. On the other, we have the well-off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself, his wife Yeon-Kyo, and his two children Da-Hye and Da-song.A series of events leads to Kim ki-woo getting employed by the Park family as Da-Hye's tutor. Then, we come across the master-plan executed by Kim Ki-woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks. This stretch of street-smarts versus rich-naivety while engaging and funny, still seemed like it was missing the 'element of twist' commonly associated with Bong's films. But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive. It's indeed twists-and-thrills galore, with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion.Parasite, as a film, should claim a rightful genre to itself. It's a masterful blend of so many genres: comedy, family, drama (plenty of it), survival thriller, satire, horror (rarely), and many more. The social inequality trope isn't used for stirring extra sentiment. Instead, Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film-makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either. Most of all, Bong's attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes.The film boasts several scenes (not moments, scenes altogether) that are worthy of further discussion. The subtext is impressively underplayed, with the second hour leaving no stone unturned. The climax is the best thing about Parasite (as is the case with most of Bong's movies) and it makes a giant statement - both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale. Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings; a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously-created characters. Also, two thumbs up for the production design and cinematography departments for making everything in the film appear so very real.Verdict: This time around, the 'monsters' are human, and they're more than fierce! A MUST-WATCH!"
PARASITE,25 January 2020,7/10,"ParasiteOverall a very enjoyable movie.This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister. We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum-type basement dwelling. They were all universally hard working, inventive and inspired to get on in life, however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset.The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around, never quite landing on any definitive conclusion. We, the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat. It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie, perhaps this style was an influence.Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor. The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility. What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer.What was goodThe family bonds were well established, they were all in this together. This very much held the movie together.This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery.There was, for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus, we were all gripped, and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house.The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles.The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural.The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall, and very in keeping with this kind of story.The musical score was great.What was problematicThe Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family, but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene, this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time.It was inferred that wealth isolates and anaesthetises you from the realities of other people lives, but the script so over simplified this observation it became irrelevant.We had insufficient character separation they are were just voices of the Director.It was inferred that oppression leads to revolution, I agree, but the family were not oppressed at the moment or indeed previously they were on the way up, so revolution, and this instigation for a bloodbath was flimsy.I enjoyed this movie, it lost its way in the last half hour and arrived at little redemption or conclusion. It really had little to say on the human condition, however it's great strength lay in its inventive comedy.With regard to awards, I would nominate it for best foreign language movie and give the award to Pain & Glory by Almodovar."
PARASITE,24 June 2020,7/10,"The Kim family who are the main characters are not likable at all and greedy too. They do things very irrationally. The first half is quite empty and a bit boring. The park family are so gullible too but they are much more likable as the.... say the bad guys?Mr Kim - the father: his character got the most problem, as the father he didn't make good decisions for the family. He decisions are really bad. They got a young man fired, they don't care if he's poor and miserable as they are. They only think about themselves - selfish.They found out about the maid's secret but instead of negotiating something. They chose to fight all over the place.Mrs Kim the mother is heartless too, she pushed the poor maid down the stairs which ultimately ended her life, and then they tied them up in the bunker, wounded, no food and they go on to live their lives normally. And they expect to find them alive in the following morning?And what's up with that rock, I thought it was going to be used for something important but no it was there all this time so that it would used to smashed the son's head. lolThe party is where everything goes wrong. When the bunker guy show up and stab the kim sister and looking to kill the mother, it wasn't Mr Kim's problem at that time, his mind was totally on Mr park, and helping his family comes second I guess. he went ahead and stab Mr Park even though he employed him and pay him good money. He then left his bleeding daughter and son and his wounded wife to go hide in the bunker. Gimme a break.the behavior of the Kim family can't be excused because they re just poor. Poor people don't normally behave in an erratic way and are contented.And since both the Kim family and the Park family helped each other in certain ways, knowingly or unknowingly, isn't their relationship symbiotic? I mean it's not parasitic since both are benefitting from each other right? the Kim family get to enjoy the life of wealth while they are taking care of the Park family's kids and house. the relationship is symbiotic, therefore the film's title should be Symbiosis not Parasite in that case hahaha just sayingThe film overall doesn't left as much impact
on me as say joker did."
PARASITE,5 September 2019,8/10,"What is it with foreign movies! they just seem to be able to pull a new idea out of the bag and deliver it with aplomb and this social commentary of Korea and the world in general is no exception. Different culture, different ideas and way of life perhaps but this movie applies equally to West as it does East and pulls out all the stops to deliver an excellent nights viewing!Very well acted and produced, this just goes to show that there are a shed load of new ideas out there if one is just willing to look for them."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.
PARASITE,16 January 2020,7/10,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars"
PARASITE,8 December 2019,7/10,"The appreciation for ""Parasite"" is I think partially dependent on the expectations that you have in advance.I expected to see a movie in line with ""The handmaiden"" (2016, Chan Wook Park) or (an older example) ""The servant"" (1963, Joseph Losey) where the servants gradually take over the power. My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller ""Burning"" (2018, Chang Dong Lee) that I saw recently. Both films share the same cinematographer (Kyung Pyo Hong).My expectations where not fulfilled. There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo. In this stage the film has a caricatural / comedy element in it that was not to my taste. It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres, and only the Coen brothers (for example ""Fargo"" 1996) are able to do this job well.One can also see the film in an entirely different way, namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor. In ""Parasite"" the rich and the poor are geographically seperated. The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town. In film such a setting has ancient origins. Think about a classic as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Frits Lang). The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual (think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty). At the same time as ""Parasite"" the latest film of Ken Loach was released (""Sorry, we missed you""). In ""Parasite"" the underdogs of society are not so honest as in ""Sorry, we missed you"" and (controray to the combination crime / comedy) the combination social drama / comedy works well. It makes the film less moralizing.I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning. At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell. This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown. The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities. In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static. Success is inheritable.The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring. Visually this gives rise to some scenes that made me think of ""Prejudice"" (2015, Antoine Cuypers)."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,I was curious to watch because of got 4 oscars...casting and story is amazing even its slow pace...there are soo many deatails in this movie soo must watch consiously...
PARASITE,24 February 2020,7/10,I did watch with more expectation after knew it got 4 oscars and its tempting trailer...the movie was good even the base story is simple.but the detailing of movie is soo impressive and casting was awesome..
PARASITE,27 September 2021,10/10,"I watched this on Amazon Prime. I have rated over 3000 movies on IMDb and this is the 5th movie I have given a 10/10 rating. A movie about social standings, somewhere between a Dickensian novel and an Ealing dark comedy movie. It's a long movie but doesn't feel so, the writing is some of the best I've seen in years, the acting is superb and the general feel of the movie is brilliant. A movie to make you laugh, shed a tear and also contemplate. I doubt I will see a better movie for many years."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,8/10,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
PARASITE,1 February 2020,10/10,"Song Kang-ho is one of my favorite South Korean actors and I've seen many of his films. However, I hadn't seen a Korean film since a long time, and once I heard all the good things about Parasite and the amount of acclaim it has earned, I couldn't stop myself from watching it. And whoever said it slowly transforms into something unexpected, wasn't kidding at all! Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor, before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can't even move. It's that spellbinding.The film can't be easily put into one genre, and that's true. Still, whether you like black comedies/dramas/thrillers or not, you must see this film at least once. It's just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming, you can't forget any of that for a long time. Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time.Words won't be sufficient to further describe this film's actual brilliance. I'm still spellbound. What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended. It took away the very feel of watching a film. Whatever I saw just felt real, absolutely real. No doubt, Parasite is one of the most original films you'll see in the recent memory, and surprisingly has elements of almost every genre covered in its entire duration. Let's hope it wins big at the Oscars too!"
PARASITE,23 October 2019,,"There are many wealthy people who have taken short cuts -- legal or not -- to get their place in society. The Kim family in Seoul is of the underclass, but, they see no issue adopting the 'ethics' of some of the very wealthy to claim a piece for themselves. The Kims are living in a below street level hovel barely scraping by, but they aren't without certain wits and skills.
An opportunity falls in their lap when their son Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) finds himself tutoring a sweet teen daughter (Jung Ziso) or a successful tech entrepreneur Park Dong-Ik (Sun-kyun Lee) and his lovely if simple wife Yeon-Kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). Before long the Kims all but move into the Parks' spacious architectural marvel of a home (each couple has a male and a female child).
Director Bong Joon-Ho who also co-wrote the screenplay (with Jin Won Han) takes his time to set up the story. As seen in his previous work such as OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, THE HOST and MOTHER, Bong isn't the most formal filmmaker working today. His movies often seem wildly inconsistent in style and tone. Seeming leaps in logic and form abound. But, what makes his work so consistently invigorating and exciting is that if one looks past the seeming chaotic structure, Bong plays fair with the viewer. The extended set-ups are a means to an end. There is a 'Bong Playbook' that he is setting up and he abides by those rules.
PARASITE is an exemplary case of the Bong Playbook. Once the dominoes fall the scabrous satire can cut deeply. Class warfare isn't an original concept in and of itself, but Bong continually upends expectations and circumstances here. Making it all the more interesting is that he doesn't set up the rich Park family as cartoon villains. Heck, they are so banal that one feels more sympathy for them. You shouldn't want them to get their lives disrupted -- but, you also can't help but cheer on the disruptors (the Kims).
Bong takes PARASITE to some dark places and quite visceral places. There's some razor sharp allusions to the works of the great Luis Bunuel (DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID, VIRIDIANA), Chabrol's (CEREMONIE) as well as, most pointedly, Gorky's The Lower Depths, but, it still remains firmly the work of Bong Joon-Ho. Without a doubt, there are some allusions to provincial matters in South Korean society that will escape domestic viewers, but, Bong's scalpel cuts broadly and deeply enough for most international audiences (it won the Palme D'or at Cannes). It's a wild nasty ride. Take it."
PARASITE,5 July 2019,10/10,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
PARASITE,9 November 2019,8/10,"I can't remember watching a film that covers as many genres as 'Parasite' (Gisaengchung) and does it so successfully. This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy/drama and gets darker as it goes along, becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements. Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that.At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement. 'Parasite' is great, highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,7/10,"It's not a bad movie and it has some great moments. But it's way too over hyped, like much award winning movies these days (insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino). You can tell it's a movie that wants to deliver a message; the problem is it's not quite clear what the message is."
PARASITE,3 January 2021,6/10,"I liked this movie for being very deep and complicated in story, while not being so much unclear. It just explains us realistic and possible real life complicated situations. Emotional, funny, realistic, serious, religious, moral, teaching, but negative. Also interesting insight into Korean culture and behavior. The only thing that makes this movie bad is that it is too negative, and especially negative ending. Teaches us about instability of life, greed, desperation, survival, crime. Worth an oscar at least because of its depth or because of seriousness of topics or lessons. Not good to watch for those sensitive to scary and difficult realistic situations like getting hurt, imprisoned, etc."
PARASITE,25 July 2020,9/10,"Movie night with Iris.Korean Cannes/ Oscar doesn't disappoint. Bong showing himself to be a cinematic master.Parasite doesn't quite take place in our universe, but nor is it a fantasy world. This is the ugliness of class conflict shown bare. The parasites are every character in this film; rich leeching off the poor, who in turn retaliate by attaching themselves to the underbelly of their rulers.Much of the story isn't told in words, but in the utilisation of space and the way people occupy it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture so they can all fit. Whereas the Parks always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame.The narrative will literally take you into uncharted territory, with a fantastic conclusion. Brilliant movie."
PARASITE,7 December 2019,8/10,"In an unnamed South Korean city, a family of four (a middle-aged couple and their adult son and daughter) all struggle with low-paying jobs to get by in the cramped basement apartment in which they live. After the son has the good fortune of getting a well-paying job in the home of a wealthy family, his other family members manipulate their way into similar good fortune. Massive chaos follows.Among universally acclaimed films, ""Parasite"" is unique: it is actually worthy of its acclaim. It could be described as bizarrely amazing or amazingly bizarre. Maybe both. The first half succeeds as a farcical comedy before going dramatic with many plot twists and turns, suspense, thrills, and a class war to top it off. The film also wins with its flexibility and mystery as to who are the potential villains. And it has a climax that must be among the best of all time.While most of the dramatic surprises are welcome, some seem unnecessary and over the top (non-spoiler hint: the scene with the aftermath of a huge rainfall); there are also a few false endings. But these pale compared to the film's many assets the best of which is its uniqueness and originality. The cast is great too especially Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the poor family. His face registers so much pent-up emotion. And director Bong Joon-ho has talents that are comparable to those of Alfred Hitchcock.It is easy to compare ""Parasite"" with last year's ""Burning"", another South Korean film that digs deeply into modern class conflicts in explosive ways. While these are only two examples, it seems South Korean cinema leads the way in acknowledging contemporary class struggles - a problem that has exacerbated everywhere for the past three decades or so. Hopefully, these fine examples will inspire many more film-makers in all countries."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,Utterly bonkers at times but always brilliant something completely fresh for the first time in a long while. Loved every second couldn't take my eyes off the screen words can not justify just how great this film was other than films this good and this original really don't come around very often. Truly riveting and a true joy to watch.
PARASITE,25 February 2020,6/10,"This is a fun, different movie. But, to be totally honest, as a lover of Asian cinema, not that different. For example Thirst by Park Chan-Wook is off the charts different. But, an ok, if somewhat erratic, sloppy dark comedy nonetheless.Full of unexpected twists and turns. Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately. Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper's face has been beaten. In fact, the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet.... never answered. WTF?A quirky look at the class divide. I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary, and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant. Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure. It all seened very amateurish. Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great.The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights? Really? A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which, in itself, was trivial and silly. Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world? Very very incongruous and illogical.Oscar worthy? I definitely don't agree, but there you go.An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers. A great opportunity for the less educated Hollywood elite to show how politically woke they are. 🙄"
PARASITE,9 July 2021,7/10,"I already saw the comment on capitalism and the other layers of human nature and relationships other times in other films. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, maybe that's on me and my expectations."
PARASITE,14 June 2020,8/10,"Wow. Definitely deserved the Best Picture Win at the Oscars!Totally not what I thought it was going to be. But great, despite having to read the subtitles the whole film.."
PARASITE,6 March 2020,9/10,"Parasite comes to us in an age where the intersection between art and politics seems to be reaching fever pitch; the moving screen has become a battleground for representation and polemic, and the arguments that stem from the validity of just that become their own dogfights. Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season. The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons. Every man and his dog and his dog's twitter account has a voice, and those tweets may well qualify for Rotten Tomatoes critic status. And at times, the noise surrounding a film can impair our ability to discern its true qualities.Todd Phillips' Joker made the biggest splash throughout 2019, with an array of voices vying for control of the narrative. Some critics derided its dangerous allure to the Arthur Flecks of our time, ticking time bombs waiting to pull their own talk-show stunts, whereas the director himself bemoaned the 'woke culture' that had ruined the comedic genre. While he's not wrong about the disconnect between imagined violence and real crime (in the end, no clowns armed with AR-15s showed up at the premiere), surely Phillips has to realise the slippery slope of interpretation that his film endorses. As a straight-forward character study of Fleck's descent into unhinged derangement, it's sympathetic enough, if not clumsy in its social commentary, mimicking the aesthetic of its Scorsese inspirations from the New Hollywood era in exchange for diluting its contemporary relevance. But as serious critique it's laughable, simplifying society's sickness to a scattershot of seriously specific symptoms. These range from a gang of teenage hooligans hunting clown sign holders (and only clown sign holders) to a pair of cruel Wall Street bankers who coinkidinkily happen to know a full verse and chorus of Send in the Clowns, a song that has zero relevance to the scenario other than its title - that's Glee level, Todd. While Scorsese's camera turned away out of embarrassment for Travis Bickle, Joker revels in its final triumph, consoling its audience's edgiest sympathies. A brief glance at the YouTubers serenading the 167th Street stairs confirms this. It's brand store nihilism, broad enough for anyone to latch onto with their worldly angst.Relatively, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is more consistent in its overall delivery, spinning social parable from the familiar yarn of a classic whodunnit. The moral is solidified in the final frame, where the immigrant carer surveys her new estate (a labyrinthine, Clue-esque mansion) from its top balcony, towering above the former employers who held her family ransom. But although its interactions strike truer (it's gratifying to see the Thrombey clan cajole Marta as 'part of the family', only to sharply change tack when she is granted their entire inheritance, exposing their actual priorities), the story places the othered outsider on such a pedestal that it feels obligatory to side with her. Marta can't even tell a lie without vomiting, wielded by Johnson as a clever plot device, and yet also a characteristic approaching noble savage levels of patronising. The spatial metaphor isn't dissimilar to that of the staircase in Parasite, but you wish that it had a shade more nuance, and that she wasn't just the straight character in a pulpy film where the rest of the ensemble seems ripped out a 21st century version of Clue. In this edition of the board game, Marta wins by playing the moral high ground at every turn. But real life isn't that easy, or that simple.As far as Bong Joon-ho is concerned, politics has always been entwined with the big screen. Because the latter is designed to captivate the popular audience, surely it must be a reflection of their general wants and needs, universal concerns and priorities. Some of his more pointed 'monster movies' take direct aim at the injustices of the world: the ramifications and pitfalls of American exceptionalism in The Host, and the cruel disregard for animal rights by multinational conglomerates in Okja. From his worldview, profit rises above the rest, leaving all behind. But Parasite isn't as straightforwardly didactic, or as easy to summarise. Just when you think you have the film's measure, that the Kims have beaten the system by assuming their mantle on the throne of the Parks, it swerves violently to the left.From the very beginnings of his career, Joon-Ho has been taking genre films and twisting them into social satire, and while the first half of Parasite could operate as a straight thriller on its own, the latter half upends its foundations beyond a merely literal sense. The cast is uniformly excellent, and it is through the Kims that Joon-Ho begins to form his thesis; that class is performative, that being is a constant state of code-switching, and that anyone could find themselves at the bottom of the basement or the top of the stairs, at one point or another in the twisted prism of capitalism. There is an entire wealth of nuance in the formal and informal registers of Korean that will be forever lost to foreign audiences, but their body language and tone tell a whole story of their own; how Ki-woo is seduced by the allure and esteem of a university tutor and in turn seduces Ji-so, feigning aloofness while in awe of her status, or how So-dam's dialogue pokes through upper class formality (while her father fails to bridge this gap), or how Chung-sook swells above the former housekeeper when she talks down to her, scolding the unemployed for not knowing their place. When the new head of house nudges the old aside as if she were nothing more than a pesky mosquito, our laughter is smothered quickly by the crack! of her head against concrete, a testament to both the film's careful drip of dark humour and the lateral cruelty inflicted at the bottom tier of society, driven by a desperate yearning to ascend and escape.Joons-Ho's visual style is a slick, almost insidious thing, willing you subconsciously in the direction of the narrative and to where the power resides within the scene. Consider the opening shot of his debut, Barking Dogs Never Bite, which pulls back from an idyllic forest line to trap the protagonist within the frame, imprisoned in a cage of unemployment and yelping neighbouring dogs. The closing shot pulls the same trick, presenting his success at scoring the coveted title of a university professor, before pulling back to replace the old bars of his apartment with a new set. He has won, but at what cost? Parasite begins literally below ground level, showing you the world as the Kims see it, the veritable vermin of the underground. The camera squeezes in with them hunched around their dining table, the long lens compressing the planes, evoking a feeling of claustrophobia. When Ki-woo makes his initial ascent, the frame expands, dwarfing him in the gated community of the Parks, bathing him in angelic natural light. Only when their gambit is exposed do they scurry back into their murky sewers like rats, flushed out by the same waters that preserve the pristine pastures of their employers. And yet, they commit the same sins, and are guilty of the same transgressions they scorn the Parks for.Parasite finishes with a door slam of an ending, exposing the elusiveness of social mobility as absolute. In truth, I prefer the agony of the close in Burning from compatriot Lee Chang-dong, which achieves the same order of anguish that Joon-ho tapped into with Memories of Murder (its impact somewhat lessened by the recent revelation of the real-life perpetrator). In the end, it is infinite obsession which reigns over the resolution of the plot's puzzle, laced with the poison of class envy; it matters not who Ben really was. Parasite more or less deals with a similar crisis of identity, in which the working class protagonist eventually succumbs to the lure of the nouveau riche and their shiny new world. If you pull back, you'll see that this doubles for the broader anxieties of a country coming to terms with its rapid economic and social growth after civil war. Winning the nation's first, second, third, and fourth Oscar in one fell swoop is a significant boon for Asian representation in the West. And as for working class representation? Perhaps not in the gilded, gated halls of the Academy. Even in fantasy, Ki-woo's triumph barely nudges the status quo. He merely wins by joining them."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,"Better than 'Birdman', are you out of your mind? The next thing you will say is that this is better than 'Police Academy'? How insulting? I'm not saying this movie is bad, no way. Nor am I saying ""Parasite"" is good either - because it is not. What can I say, I'm waffling all around the middle? The obvious inadvertence to materiality perfectly conjoins with the script's puerile jabber. Scene One stumbles onto screen and swiftly kicks out any semblance of reality. A family unable to butter toast become shifty, successful deadbeats swindling really stupid people out of their livelihood. Talk about poor messaging. Like so many 'Art' movies in the past. It seems designed to entertain only the elite. A kind of movie embraced by a few and soon forgotten by all. If I gave this movie a mediocre score, it would be too high. But it won an Oscar, so that tells me - ahhhh - nothing really."
PARASITE,23 May 2020,10/10,"Better late than never, I say. Parasite has shocked the film world, in the best way possible. Against all odds, it defeated a crowded field for Best Picture at the Oscars. A field that included heavy hitters like Scorsese and Tarantino. Nobody should have ever counted Parasite out, but the Oscars don't have a track record of awarding Best Picture to groundbreaking independent films, let alone a groundbreaking independent film from South Korea. It's win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere. It's a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes. Garnering international acclaim, people have hailed Parasite as the best film of 2019, and the decade itself. Does it live up to the hype? The answer is an enthusiastic yes.Parasite is one of the best independent films I've ever seen. It's a textbook example of how to take a small idea, and a modest script, with limited locations and launch them all into the stratosphere. Without giving too much away, it centers around two families on opposite sides of the Korean social class. The ultra rich, elite class and the poor. The poor family devises an elaborate scheme to work as servants for the rich family, in the hopes that they can take a taste of aristocratic life, and work their way up the ladder. All is well, until they discover something underneath the house. A third class of servitude is revealed. A class more destitute and subservient to the rich family than the poor family could ever dream of. Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, Parasite serves as an allegory for income inequality and the ways in which the poorest classes of people are often exploited by the rich, with no thanks in return.The best horror films out there tell stories of larger meaning. They need to in order to be properly scary. Bong-Joon Ho allows his agenda to take shape throughout, but cleverly and gracefully, avoids being heavy-handed. For instance, there are no clear heroes and villains in his characters. To Ho, they are all victims of a larger societal struggle. In terms of its visual scope, Parasite is a masterclass in production design and framing. Instantly, the luxurious Park residence has become an iconic backdrop in film history. It's spacious rooms and narrow hallways paint a chilling picture of the enormity of wealth. The large screen door leading to the front yard is reminiscent of a large film screen, almost designed to showcase the importance of the Park family household. At 135 minutes, Parasite tells it's story as fitfully as a best-selling novel. In the end, you don't leave Parasite having missed the point of having watched it. It's satisfying, minute to minute. That's what makes this a great film."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,8/10,"To follow the trailer, I was not interested, but then the movie held itself high in IMDb trends. Thus I decided to watch it. The movie is South Korean and one needed subtitles to understand it. Sadly this was too much and I gave up after ten minutes of run time. I would like to add the names of people with mentioned country and neighborhood are quite confusing and it takes effort which is escalated even more if you are to understand it with subtitles.A day came when I decided to again give it a try. The reason being Oscars this time. The movie won four Oscars. After searching for hindi version I settled for youtube narration for one fifth of time. What did I conclude was is everything associated was good enough but then still it was overrated. Once again my belief of awards being overrated stood concrete.Final Verdict: The story is not something good on the senses neither in the category all's well that ends well. However it presents side(s) worth knowing. I would like to see it in a language I am more comfortable with in future."
PARASITE,15 October 2019,8/10,"There is a real insurmountable hype surrounding Bong Joon-ho's latest film. Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend. Luckily, I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off. The hype is real. I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film. Its, funny, smart, violent, and socially timely. Whatever, you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already.The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive. An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family. Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family. The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth.Bong Jonon-ho's films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here. Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story. The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well. The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed, even if it means hurting innocent people.The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor. It doesn't matter the country, this is just ever present everywhere. Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates, especially through the patriarch of the family, portrayed by Song Kang-ho. I'm trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn't like. It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is.This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing. Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I'd say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year. Its so mesmerizing in all regards. I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year. I'm gonna reiterate, go and see this film.8.5/10"
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"The story was really interesting and amusing.
The plot was only a bit exciting at the beginning, so it was mostly boring.
I give 6/10, but only because of the good story."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,10/10,"In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"If you haven't discovered South Korean cinema yet, Parasite (2019) is a fantastic introduction for the uninitiated. Director Bong Joon-ho has been hard at work over the last 20 years, helping craft films that are thoughtful and horrifying. Movies like The Host (2006) and Snowpiercer (2013) give a sense of his artistic style. Parasite merely takes his ability to shed light on class conflict and molds it into a masterpiece that's half heist-comedy, half horror-drama, and all suspense. If it weren't for the somewhat lackluster ending, I'd give this film the full five stars it deserves.At the base of Parasite is a conflict between the impoverished and the rich. This theme could be easily applied to any country with a wide income disparity, which is probably why it works so well in the United States as well as in South Korea. To survive in these environments, the poor must do their best to polish their image enough so that the rich will hire them. Sometimes, this requires an elaborate series of prepared and practiced cons to break into financial success. Of course, the threat of being uncovered as charlatans is what drives the comedy and suspense of Parasite.My only qualm with Parasite is the uncertainty of its ending. There's a point during the climactic incident where I thought the movie could end, and it would be a perfect kind of ambiguity (mostly because there was a finality to it). Instead, there's a little bit tacked on that covers the ""where are they now?"" which-while being an adequate way to show the cycle of dependency continuing-still doesn't give a wholly satisfying conclusion. Regardless of this, I found Parasite to be a fantastic piece of cinema and one that I believe will stand the test of time like other South Korean films like The Housemaid (1960) and Oldboy (2003) have.A nearly perfect heist/comedy/horror/drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema, I give Parasite 4.5 stars out of 5."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,8/10,"Parasite (South Korean) review :A lot has already been said, debated and critiqued about this film which wowed not just the jury at the Cannes but also walked away with four Oscars this year including Best Picture - the first non - English film to do so.As for my take on it, two scenes stayed with me long after the movie ended : One is the Kim family relaxing in their employers - the Parks- mansion after they go on a picnic. The Parks are unaware that the driver, housekeeper, tutor and translator they hired are all one family - the Kims having cunningly manipulated them to seek employment.Talking about the scene, Father Kim remarks that their madam is a nice lady. Rich yet Nice. To which his wife corrects him saying She's nice because she's rich.In yet another amazingly conceived scene, the Park couple is now lying - incidentally on the same drawing room sofa - and Mr Park observes how driver Kim is a well behaved guy who doesn't cross his limit yet he hates his stink. He smells like an old rag!!In those two scenes, writer director Bong Joon-Ho makes a solid statement on class divide which may not be seemingly apparent but exists and thrives universally at mind set level.Parasite is a highly relatable drama - blending comedy in to serious situations - culminating in to a cracker of a bloodied climax. Infact, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it explores myriad human relationships like no other film and leaves you wondering at the end who exactly is the parasite here!!Watch it online on Amazon Prime.

PARASITE,21 May 2021,10/10,The first foreign Academy award-winning movie to earn Best Picture!!!!!!
PARASITE,27 May 2020,9/10,"Writer/director Bong Joon Ho pulls off another sharp genre film with a darkly comedic twist - after tackling serial killers (Memories of Murder, 2003), monsters (The Host, 2006), science fiction (Snowpiercer, 2013, the only one I did not like) and child-and-her-pet genre (Okja, 2017), it's time for the family drama with a dash of Hitchcockian thriller.The poor but cunning Kim family infiltrates the rich Park family through a series of deceptions, as the Kims discredit the previous domestic workers to replace them one by one, fabricating fake credentials. However, the Park house hides a dark secret which throws the Kims' plan into chaos. To say more would be a shame.This is, for me, Bong's best movie since The Host, possibly even since Memories of Murder, boasting perfect editing, fine performances (the great Kang-ho Song, Bong's long-time collaborator, plays the patriarch of the poor family) and clever visual storytelling. The attention to details is stunning: the film has a strong vertical structure, with the road to the Parks house ascending into the sunlight while the journey back to the Kims' basement is a long, dim descent; the two great windows of the houses contrast each other, with the Parks' showing a gorgeous garden and the Kims' a squalid alley populated by drunkards; when a Native Americans-themed birthday turns into something far more sinister, a character's face is smeared with blood in a way to resemble war paintings.The script is worthy of these remarkable visuals and finds a miraculous balance between comedy, tragedy and tension.8,5/10"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite tells the story of a poor family in South Korea. Kim Ki-taek(Kang-ho Song), his wife Kim Chung-sook(Hye-jin Jang), son Kim Ki-woo(Woo-sik Choi) & daughter Kim Ki-jung(So-dam Park), start working for the super rich Park family. Soon, things start getting complicated.Parasite is a jaw-dropping film. Director Bong Joon Ho has given us another unforgettable movie, after The Host(2006), Snowpiercer(2013) & Okja(2017). Parasite has so many levels & nuances to it. This film, makes you experience a whirlwind of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked, you'll be teary-eyed & you will be left ruminating about the movie, long after the credits roll. The performances are mind-blowing. Kang-ho Song is spectacular as Kim Ki-taek. Sun-kyun Lee is brilliant as Park Dong-ik. Yeo-jeong Jo is amazing as Park Yeon-kyo. Woo-sik Choi is outstanding as Kim Ki-woo. So-dam Park is fantastic as Kim Ki-jung. Jeong-eun Lee is excellent as Moon-gwang. Hye-jin Jang is awesome as Kim Chung-sook. Ji-so Jung is great as Park Da-hye. Myeong-hoon Park is superb as Geun-se. The supporting cast is memorable. Parasite is a must watch. It deserves all the awards it has received so far & deserves its six Oscar nominations. Definitely one of the best films of the year, whether it's English, Korean or any other language!"
PARASITE,12 November 2019,8/10,"There are more strong film makers in this world than are just sitting in traditionally English-speaking Countries (like the U.S./England). One of the strongest - and a Director that I will watch WHATEVER he is Directing - is South Korean auteur Bong Joon-Hoo. His previous efforts (THE HOST, OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, amongst others) were all led by intriguing stories, interesting people and strong visual imagery, so I was very excited for his newest effort, PARASITE. I purposely did not find out too much about this film, for I wanted to be surprised by what was unfolding in front of me.And...I was rewarded, greatly by another intriguing story with interesting people and strong visual imagery.In Korean, with English subtitles, PARASITE follows a lower class Korean family that go to work for a high class Korean family and brings us on a journey for BOTH families. And that's all I'm going to say about it, for to reveal anything else would be to spoil the surprises along the way.But, as is often the case with these types of stories, it is the journey, not the destination that is the treat of this film. Bong Joon-Ho regular Kang-ho Song stars as the Patriarch of the lower class family who, seemingly, is lazy and allergic to ""work"", but that is not really the case. Woo-sik Choi is the son of the lower class family that connects with the daughter of the higher class family and Hye-jin Jang is the matriarch of the lower class family and they both bring sensitivity and strength to their roles. But for me, the real star of this film is So-dam Park as the daughter of this family who turns out to be the heart and the brains of the operation.Director Bong Joon-Ho brings his usual flair to the proceedings, not letting his camera shy away from the seemy underbelly of this society, but not lingering on it either, moving the surprising plot along at a fast (enough) pace to keep you guessing throughout. I see a lot of films, so when I run across a plot that I couldn't tell what was going to come next, it is satisfying.And, satisfying this film is. Some are calling it an ""Oscar Contender"" and I don't think I would go quite that far - the film does drag a bit in the middle. But, if you can handle reading the subtitles, you'll be entertained indeed by the fervent mind of one of the better Directors working in film today.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
PARASITE,6 March 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a fine example of Korean cinema and an entertaining, cross-generic piece with overt Hitchcock influences, but the best film of 2019 and the best screenplay? Well, I'm sorry I don't think so. Not by a long way.It's very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss. But that's the thing; for a film that's won an Oscar for best screenplay, there's precious little subtlety or nuance on show. Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air-headed social matriarch, with Mr Park, who's supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi-national company, not much better.The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright, sharp as tacks, in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy. I'm not doubting the existence of the banjiha, but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work, so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well-spoken hardly rings true. This is before and after their abode (and presumably their wardrobes) have been entirely flooded with sewage.For me, all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours; not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots, on display in Parasite. And I need to emphasise here that I'm talking about intelligences too, not just material possessions and finances.A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places, to the extent, that I was wondering ""how they managed to do such and such a sequence?"" I was entertained by Parasite, but never enthralled, by what many critics were and are still saying is a ""near-perfect"" picture. I can't agree with this sort of summation. Having said that, I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit, that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year. I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat."
PARASITE,4 September 2020,9/10,"It's very rare to see such a masterful piece of cinema. Not only is this a uniquely mesmerising story, told through brilliant acting and magical cinematography, it is also dripping with metaphor and symbolism. This is a movie that needs to be watched multiple times to allow the deeper subtleties to emerge. Without a doubt one of the films of the decade."
PARASITE,2 November 2019,,"I can't help but think that if I were Korean, I'd somehow catch more nuances and details ... and end up appreciating this movie a bit more.I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else. Since he's done several well-received sci-fi themed movies, I couldn't get it out of my head that ""maybe"" a sub-plot in the movie involved sinister parasites. Nope - it's purely a metaphor. And that's still fine.I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed. But I wouldn't say it was spine-tinglingly suspenseful, shocking or fully engrossing. There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions. However, I don't think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past.The story is unusual but I didn't find myself having any thought-provoking ideas after the show was over. No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact. It kept my attention throughout it's 2 hour runtime ... but I'd still call it ""good"" ... not ""great""."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,5/10,"I've never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film. It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago.Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes.It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie."
PARASITE,4 March 2021,9/10,I had this film ruined for me by Twitter and STILL thought it was excellent.My mind would've been blown if I'd have been oblivious.
PARASITE,5 January 2020,7/10,"I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.It comes with a highly recommended from me.(For the graphical version of this review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)"
PARASITE,23 April 2020,7/10,"A well told tale of a family of have-naughts who lie their way into a job for each member in the home of a rich family. They engineer the firing of the people they replace. People who deserved nothing of the kind. Plus the son of the pushy family disregards his promise to the friend who set him up with this rich family and he totally moves in on the little school-girl daughter he was supposed to be safe guarding. While so engaged they find a secret. Or rather a secret is given them. This movie is beautifully shot and well presented. It's a story in movements. It has the power to draw you in so much so that you forget what things were like, back there in the beginning. Back there in the basement."
PARASITE,30 November 2020,2/10,"In 1938 The Grand Illusion was the first foreign film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Since then, ten others have been nominated and in 2019 Parasite was the first to win.Bong Joon-Ho described the film as symbolic of the class barrier in Korea and symbolism is the only description or justification for the movie; which is very unorthodox in its plot, structure and overall style.
The catalyst the film is Kevin accepting to fill in for his friend as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's daughter. The first act ends when the entire Kim family secures a job in the Park residence. After that the story starts to lose control.
At first, the film quickly advances in a clipped, transient style. Bong Joon-Ho establishes the setting and composition of his film and then sets forth. No scene lingers too long and each sets the other up so by just seeing the tail end of it the audience understands what's happened. The characters are quirky and idiosyncratic black humor is bestrewed throughout creating a light and comedic tone. And then out of nowhere the film takes a sharp turn with the Kim's discovering the former maid's husband, Geun-sae, living in the basement. Ho has admitted he is an Alfred Hitchcock fan(clearly demonstrated by the Hitchcock collection in the Park house) and attempted to imitate the incredible twists that became a trademark of The Master Of Suspense. However, Parasite's twist fails to deliver the punch that those in Psycho, North By Northwest and Vertigo do. It doesn't change the story or further complicate it but instead creates an entirely new and separate plot. Don't get me wrong, a good twist in a movie is meant to alter its course(e.g. Judy/Madeleine's identity revealed in Vertigo) or when placed at the very end to completely alter your perception of all that you just saw(Citizen Kane, The Sixth Sense, Psycho) In Parasite no new dimension is added to the film but essentially everything leading up is made irrelevant.
For roughly the last half, the movie meanders with no direction before finally collapsing. The birthday party 'finale' is shocking and senseless. What prompts both men to murder, particularly Mr. Kim, is unknown. Is it a final accumulation of his contempt for the upper class ? Whatever it is, everything that follows drags like car with no wheels. Bong Joon-Ho brings the pace to a near halt and spends the final moments of this film trying to pile on every last bit of emotion and sentiment possible. And as always, all impact is only sucked out by the ennui and frustration.Since I don't understand Korean I can't accurately judge the dialogue or
acting because no matter how precise a translation is, something is always lost.
One is merely left to follow with the subtitles and what an actor emotes non-verbally-which can never be the same.
Parasite is a film that probably resembles half a dozen genres...which means it doesn't cover any properly. The movie is very unconventional and not without some amusing elements but collectively it fails to deliver on any level."
PARASITE,19 January 2020,3/10,"Parasite is getting a ton of great reviews from its American audience. i get how class separation can frustrate those on the lower rings and pompous prejudices on the higher echelons. That frustration can lead to fierce debates and sometimes violent acts.
It's the later in writer/director Bong Joon-ho's black comedy where he takes the easy way out to settle his score with those with more wealth. Up to the movie's denouement I was rather thoughtfully following his methodical examination of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" approach on seeing the two families civilly working alongside each other despite the low-esteem both parties privately felt on one another. A more ambitious approach with a far greater payoff would have produced both a moral and soluble message to a societal problem in today's civilized world. Instead Bong ruins it in the final analysis. I cannot recommend this movie despite its witty dialogue and unusual setups."
PARASITE,24 October 2020,8/10,"Korean cinema, subtitled I thought would be a turn off but the satirical, black comedy of the screenplay strikes a chord and the story makes you forget those barriers.
The story is of different social classes. A poor family (mother, father and two grown up children) who live in squalid conditions, a kind of basement.
They are all unemployed and penniless.One of the children, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) somehow gains or should I say blags employment as an English tutor to the daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso) of the rich Park family with a CEO father, a dim wife and two children who live in opulent conditions, a big house with a large landscaped garden.Through sheer cheek Ki-woo hatches his smart sister on the scam as an art tutor to the Park's young son.
Later his sister conceives to get the Park's driver fired and replaced conveniently by her father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho).By now you get the just of the screenplay as even mother gains employment as the housekeeper. The entire 'poor' family are scamming the rich Park family.The film abounds with black comedy, spoiled somewhat by a blood splattered finale.The director, and writer Bong Joon-ho also delivered social commentary film Snowpiercer (2013) and seems to deliver leftist films in the vein of some famous Western filmmakers.Funny film, showing class difference. The smelly, poor family struggling to survive against the rich but a bit dim at times, Park's.Good film, if a little overrated by the Awards fraternity and some critics."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"Only mild spoilers.If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the ""monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted ""The Artist"" the ""foreign acknowledgement Best Picture"" a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance(8)"
PARASITE,19 July 2021,10/10,"Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script.The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful.Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10."
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"O.M.G... I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good.Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense.5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year."
PARASITE,28 October 2019,10/10,"Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today."
PARASITE,5 January 2020,9/10,"Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple, drawing the viewer's interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements, after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally.We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for, no ""good guys"" of the story. The film focuses on ""crossing the line"" which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,9/10,"My Review- Parasite
My Rating 9/10I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""I read Director and script writer Bong Joon
is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home.
I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon.
It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on.
Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year .
I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almodóvar's Pain & Glory..Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more.
There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment.
I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup.
The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth.
The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-parasiteLearn to pronounce
noun
1.
an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense."
PARASITE,17 August 2021,7/10,"Movie who play with the social ascension all along in the movie. We follow that poor family that integrate a rich family. The movie have a comedy side clearly, sexual content too. The movie was worth to watch. But despite all the struggle to the poor family to avoid his own condition, we can clearly see that their condition will follow them for the rest of their life and they will never be able to rise the social conditon that they are in."
PARASITE,25 January 2020,6/10,"I dont see it. i dont see why this would be the great film everybody's talking about. the story isnt all that grand, the acting is fine, camerawork is sometimes good but mostly kept simple and the ending is also fine.6/10: good, but not great. imo overhyped"
PARASITE,9 September 2019,8/10,"One of the most exquisitely directed, and well-crafted, films of the decade. Give Joon-ho Bong an Oscar from now!(8.5/10)"
PARASITE,19 February 2020,7/10,"Comedy drama.I was attracted to this after seeing the many recent and different awards and commendations.Rich / poor family contrasts. The poor family manipulate the rich family with private highly recommended services. Each member of the poor family use their wit to become an English tutor, Art Therapist, Driver and Housekeeper. The rich family are completely oblivious to their new elite home help, or to what's really going on!The film does a good job of demonstrating social structure, but a little cliché in places. I wanted it to blow my socks off, and in the end I'm bewildered to how this has won so many awards.I'd say this is a well made film but have seen better."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,9/10,"First of all , i Just wanna say that ""Memories of Murder"" is Still My Favorite Joon-ho Bong Film, But that doesn't Make this any less of a masterpiece in my Book, Definitely One of the best films of this decade,what a superb Mix of comedy and tragedy, Happiness and Sadness, joy and sympathy."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,"Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!"
PARASITE,13 December 2020,8/10,"Parasite is certainly not boring, and the cinematography is exquisite. Is it a masterpiece? I am not convinced. The work is multigeneric, with the first half bearing nearly no resemblance to the second half. I suspect that those who found the first half appealing would be, albeit surprised, not necessarily pleased by the second half. On the other hand, people who found the first half to be too slow and perhaps even boring may have loved the action-packed second half. I see the influence of Tarantino in part 2, and the Cohen brothers throughout, which I have been noticing more and more in recent films.Good but not great, given loose ends and dubious stereotypes and nonsequiturs. Great films are perfect, with everything fitting together so that nothing can be removed without making it worse. This creation, in contrast, is more sensationalist. While it is surprising, and no one could guess the ending from the beginning, that is mainly because of the shock effect of scenes such as the sewers spilling out all over during a torrential rainstorm. And, of course the complete switch to an entire different genre."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...Rating: A+"
PARASITE,1 June 2020,10/10,"Very calm conversation about a ""pervert"".Now they have infested the entire house, what comes next? I hope they at smart enough to leave it alone now.That's a very loud door.Everybody's a little bit freaky.Wow!How the he'll is this going to end?Oh damn! This is heading to 11.Doesn't no one sneak anymore? Have you heard of silence?"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally.
Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,10/10,"So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is, I didn't think it could possibly live up to all that praise.Well, it somehow managed to be even better than I anticipated.
How the hell did Bong Joon-Ho manage that?!This is an incredibly tense, darkly funny, beautifully shot and amazingly acted masterpiece and I loved every minute of it.From now on, I'm staying away from basements"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"Two nuclear families - Mum, Dad, son, daughter; one filthy rich, one filthy poor. The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation. Did I mention the great acting?I do wonder what happened when the son's friend, who got him the tutoring gig in the first place, got back from university. Parasite II, anybody? (joke)"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,3/10,"Apart from Hollywood I like seeing International movies, Iranian, Korean, French, German etc. moviesParasite movie came into news because it won Oscar for best movie. It is the first foreign movie to win the top most prize. With that came the comparison and allegation that it is a remake of a Tamil movie - Minsara Kanna.May be the plot of the movie is taken from Minsara Kanna, but the story is totally different. In Tamil movie which is a comedy - the story is about winning the family of a rich girl whom the poor hero loves, and he brings each member of his family to do a job (similar to Parasite movie) in the girl's family, and there is a happy ending.Whereas in the South Korean movie Parasite is about class divide, the poor family slowly plots to be part of rich family and in the end there is gory violence where the poor family kills off the rich family.I have seen the Tamil movie and I was interested to see the South Korean movie with all the buzz and good reviews it garnered.The Director Bong Joon Ho - has built the sets of houses for both the poor family living down town dirty and dingy basement and rich family living uptown spacious luxurious bungalow.The poor family are shown cunning, smart, clever and shrewd and the rich family people are shown stupid, dumb and ignorant. As the movie progresses - each member of poor family finds a way in the rich family household by forging documents, and sweet talks.The internet is so full with stuff on how the director has taken pain in comparatively portraying small details of poor and rich life styles on the celluloid.The Director also insists on watching the movie without subtitles.Some audiences who may be jealous of rich people - laughed at the way rich people are fooled by poor people. (sour grapes - Inequity and income gap disparity syndrome) But the movie could not drawn a little bit of smirk on my face.
Critics who have lauded this movie say it is rise of socialism against crony corrupt capitalism.The Director Bong has made a stupid movie marketing it as an intelligent thriller, and those who are liking it - makes us doubt today world's sanity. People who rave about this movie must be mentally ""sick"" people.They are the real parasites of this world - and not the rich or poor which the director intends to show here.The acting is not good. Th plot and twists are so convenient and predictably dumb. Forcibly inserted vulgarity and terrible violence at the end just to juxtapose the lethargy of a third rate scripting and film-making.The Tamil movie was bad, but the South Korean movie is worse.Anyways - the Director Bong Joon Ho - is smiling on grabbing 241 awards internationally and 4 Oscars. The times we live in...!I go with 3 out of 10 rating."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,8/10,"Original, entertaining and very well drafted film. It nicely mixes comedy genre with drama and delivers a quirky protrayal of class differences.
The concept works and could be placed in many societies. The characters were extremely well written and developed. Generally you care for them from the beginning and they keep being investing through the whole film. Bong Joon Ho newest film really captures you and is quite though provoking in general. The acting is very solid with the best performances coming from Kang-ho Song and Woo-sik Choi. The rest of the cast does marvelously as well.
The setting is nice, offering the audience very nice and believable sets and beautiful pictures. Bong Joon Ho's direction is constantly good as he perfectly understands his characters, their motivations and generally gives the film a very nice flow you can easily follow and he makes sure you never lose interest in it.
I wish Hollywood would also come up with original stuff like that and such great screenplays."
PARASITE,6 April 2021,9/10,"The stage curtains open ...It takes a lot for me to invest into a foreign film where I have to watch it with subtitles, and I will usually pass unless it is an exceptional film. The last such film I can remember watching was the 2007 Spanish supernatural film, ""The Orphanage"", which I did feel was exceptionally good. So, when I read the reviews on ""Parasite"" and seeing that it had won Best Picture, I decided to go ahead and take the plunge ... and I'm so glad I did.Our story starts with the Kim family, struggling financially and trying to make ends meet when the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to tutor a rich family's teenage daughter. Taking the job, Ki-woo begins to manufacture reasons to trick the privileged family into hiring his father, mother and sister in various capacities, while they pretend to be complete strangers to each other. The scheme is going well, until one of the former house employees returns to the home requesting to be let in because, in her haste to leave, she had left something important behind. When they allow her inside, that is when it all begins to unravel with very unexpected results.I absolutely loved this twisted film! Despite the subtitles, I was completely sucked in, and found myself grinning with guilty pleasure at the predicaments that this opportunist family was placed into in their efforts to keep their devious plan from being discovered. The outcome was not what I expected, but completely satisfying. The pacing was excellent, the acting above average, and the cinematography solid. The film featured a strong use of lighting and colors that adds to the feel and atmosphere effectively.This is one of the few foreign films (well, foreign to me, that is) that I would highly recommend, without hesitation. It is well deserving of its praises, and well worth the time invested into it. I have added it to my own collection and am looking forward to watching it again down the road. A high 9 stars out of 10."
PARASITE,3 October 2019,9/10,"Parasite is a South Korean black comedy directed by Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, OKJA). Based on a screenplay by Han Jin-won and Bong Joon-ho, it is a quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea.In Seoul, the unemployed Kim family, led by Ki-taek, his wife Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment. One day, Ki-woo's friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad. Over time, the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park's swanky lifestyle.With its unique Korean style, Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience. It's just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn't even belong to them. This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea, in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment. Even better is the ending, which I will not spoil, but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible. If you watch one Korean movie this year, make it this one."
PARASITE,17 November 2019,10/10,I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,"The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece."
PARASITE,26 April 2020,4/10,"Social satire retread that brought nothing new to the topic. It seems to have brought the topic back to the basics and to the beginning again, and that leaves me feeling as if we haven't learned anything. Maybe that is the ultimate point: class warfare is neverending. Heavy handed storytelling with moments of what I'm assuming are to be ""nuggets of wisdom"" giving insight to motivations in the class struggle. This has been done better and done with more thoughtfulness."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,10/10,"Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon."
PARASITE,23 October 2019,1/10,"Spoilers. don't be fooled. this is not a brilliant satire about the ""real"" south korea. it's really a horror movie dressed as quality. violence and cruelty abound."
PARASITE,18 May 2021,9/10,"Looking back at the previous Best Picture winner, which was literally one month before the corona pandemic, it's still remarkable that the South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite even won such a prestigious award in the first place. Marked as the return of Snowpiercer & Okja director Bong Joon-ho in his native country, the film gained international recognition for being the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and for being one of the highest rated films in recent years. So now that's been a year since its historical landmark, it's time to see if the movie's status is actually worthy of all the praise.The film follows the poor Kim family who start off scheming to achieve employment from the wealthy Park family and end up infiltrating their household by disguising as separate highly qualified individuals. That alone is all that can be stated about the movie without detailing too many narrative points, for as seemingly simple of a premise as this is, the whole movie goes in so many different directions. The first third establishes the state of low income poverty the Kim family is in, therefore making their desire to make money off of the upper class. From then on, the film becomes part commentary of the rich being infiltrated by the poor. As Bong Joon-ho himself stated, the film's title is derived from how the rich will end up leeching off the poor and how the poor may potentially take advantage of their positions. The Kim family themselves are so charismatic, especially the intelligent son Kim Ki-woo and the witty sardonic father Kim Ki-taek, that even if you didn't know they were a whole unit, you would buy them as their individual personas and be none the wiser at all.However, from the movie's second act onward, the plot ends up becoming a lot more complicated than your average liar revealed story. While seemingly darker and more messed up than the film's initial comedic tone, it does paint a thoroughly fascinating picture of what might happen if the ultra aristocratic landscape sucked the less fortunate in with it. Given the major theme of class warfare that is explored throughout the feature, one can imagine how passionate Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won are towards the subject matter, yet clearly not entirely one sided, as they do portray poor sides as legitimate people of different circumstances. The Park family are likable in their general concern and safety of their own children, in addition to their home, except that they happen to be unaware of how their own privileged well being may affect others. However, their own obliviousness to what goes on with the Kim family ends up adding into the film's themes of the social economic gap hurting some and benefiting others. The ones below have to suffer while the ones above get to have all the fun.Now given that the film is part comedy and part thriller, the pacing does actually make the shift between each scene rather poignant. Given how differently the Kims and Parks live, with one living in a murky semi-basement apartment around a low income town and the other living in a higher class fancy house with a gorgeous forest, the film knows how to convey a realistic amount of sardonic humor and horrific pathos based on what goes down in their lives. The gritty yet down to earth cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo and subtly jarring music by Jung Jae-il also play big parts in the intentional tonal shifts, with a lot of high tension coming after things seem a little good for the Kims or a little too bad for the Parks. Also, given that most of the production design was actually built from the ground up instead of the crew using already existing architecture, the film's themes of how real estate is generally utilized end up giving more character to the poor and rich sides of Seoul. I guess if you're going to play around with sets, they need to be your own.There are few movies that depict the economical segregation between classes as surreally profound as Parasite, and that's what truly makes it worthy of its Best Picture victory. Even if there are other incredible foreign language films that have tackled these issues in their own ways, it's not often when they get as much attention as this one, although I'm sure there are plenty of great ones on this movie's level too. So if you're yet to see the film and you're curious as to why it's been immensely well received, give it a go yourself. It sure is one heck of a thrill for anyone regardless of their class."
PARASITE,27 January 2020,7/10,"Kept my interest till the end,pretty good film.
Definitely not 1 or 2 stars,but not 9 or 10 either.
Very strong artistic performances,amazing directing!
Story itself is a bit confusing,changing directions all the time.Nevertheless ,very decent watchable movie,even if just for art qualities."
PARASITE,11 April 2021,9/10,"Im very surprise by this movie, a masterpiece in his style. The best asian movie of all Time , give it a shot you wont be dissapointed."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,10/10,"There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,4/10,"I had to delete my previous review after considering it for a day...
So folks...here it is...
It's ""Married With Children"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" told with great style and eventually dark violence.
Yes, friends..you've been fooled and somewhat charmed, but it seems the people who've rated this a masterpiece just got a dose of cold reality.
They even mention Chicago, Illinois in the flick. Which is where the 90's show took place. Critics are too dumb with short memories to draw this conclusion, which is why I'll fill you in.
Dad who is underemployed/unemployed, former gloried athlete
Wife has no aspirations to work, has bad housekeeping skills, crass
Son, distances himself from the low-life world of his low life
Sister, street wise and pretty. Uses her sexuality to get thingsI wondered why it felt familiar. In fact, there is an episode where they meet a rich family at a campsite. Also, ""The Simpsons"" had an episode where Homer loses the house to carnys.
So much for originality.
Though you're fooled by a different message of the have and have nots. Which confused me even more. They spent so very little time allowing the family to integrate themselves as ""the rich"" which is how it was sold.
Any way, the message also backfired, considering how despicable the ""poor family"" behaves. The only rationale is that they are so desperate, their actions are forgivable. No, the ends doesn't justify the means. It becomes even MORE muddled when we see the future life that is the possibility, never mind the supposed Morse code feature works only one direction. So if the son is writing a letter to the father, he can't get it. Or maybe we're to assume he left it somewhere where he'd find it. Too many damn questions.SPOILERS!!! Stop reading if you are going to see:I dunno, it's shot well, and it's funny, but there are just questions. As one reviewer had put it ""why do they make dumb decisions?"" Are they trying to say that poor people are dumb? Also, when the old housekeeper comes back, why don't they just join forces? The entire thing was unnecessary and aggravating. Also, what was the end game? To kill the rich people and assume their lives? And the fact that poor Dad snaps and attacks the rich Dad over a stench poor people have? Delaying the bleed out death of his daughter?
Pretty grim stuff.
All I know is neither of these guys scored 4 touchdowns as a fullback for Polk High"
PARASITE,30 October 2021,7/10,"Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,4/10,"This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED.
just don't understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard.
People who're praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed.
There is really nothing special in this movie that stands out.
Cannot digest that an average movie like this has got so much limelight. Btw: Where does this trend start off?"
PARASITE,26 January 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."
PARASITE,3 December 2020,6/10,"The film's story was excellent and the characters the director tried to convey were great, but he didn't deserve a Best Picture award. Acting in the movie was good especially for the rich wife. The angle and camera were excellent and the director in the film was excellent. In conclusion the film was accepted"
PARASITE,8 January 2020,10/10,This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.
PARASITE,20 February 2020,7/10,"Of the films in contention this year, I think I would have given Best Director and Best Picture awards to Quentin Tarantino and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD - a sly 'revisionist' take on Tinseltown at the far end of its Golden Age. I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary, but Best Picture? Nah.It's hard to write about it without spoilers, but it's a tale of two Korean families, one rich and living in a hilltop mansion, the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill. Crafty as well as envious, the poor people slowly (a bit too slowly, IMO) infiltrate the lives of the rich folk. When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip, things start to unravel.The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT (1963), which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory. I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie, since that's where it ends up. Set against the standards of Class-A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST, I would not put PARASITE in their league. Good, yes, and clever, beautifully shot and edited (and acted), but not up there with The Best. Sorry!"
PARASITE,25 January 2020,8/10,"A great film that really has a bit of everything in it. It starts off funny as they infiltrate the household before turning into a thoughtful look at the gap between the richest and poorest in society, and ultimately ends up as a bloodbath and rather sad. The social commentary is topical, the plot has some good surprises along the way, and the arty style and use of music makes it a very interesting film to watch."
PARASITE,10 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite is a movie where each element has the precise intended effect. Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant, and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot. If you haven't seen Parasite yet, I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it.The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite. On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably, while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims. The twist adds to the complexity of the situation - who's the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations? The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house. It's also an edge of your seat thriller where you're so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape. Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense. The comedy is an underrated element, as many scenes were very funny, especially the self-portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical. The acting was all excellent, and my two favorite performances were Jessica (the sister), who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor, and Mrs. Park, who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly. The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes, especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot, with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house, or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down, down, down. So many things to absolutely love about this movie that I could go on about, and nothing feels incomplete or not fully satisfying. Parasite is a genuine masterpiece."
PARASITE,25 July 2020,7/10,"I quite liked this but I wouldn't put this into my top 10 of best films. It's different, its acted well, the script has a nice twist, but to me, it's lacking something. It felt a bit forced in places. Anyway, that's me being overly fussy. Overall, a good watch and 7/10 does it for me."
PARASITE,16 June 2020,8/10,"Parasite is probably the most interesting vol I've seen this year. It was a little hard to follow but it's worth the watch, even with subtitles. Not sure I understood the end."
PARASITE,31 August 2020,7/10,"Sincerely I found it like a slice-of-life thing with some humor and at the end some drama. Nothing more.
I think that this movie is mainly psychological, not proper a thriller.
Anyway it can be a good movie to watch (but not the best).The actors are good, much better than those ones that you can see in Korean TV shows (personally I find them pretty awkward and acting-exaggerated). The soundtrack can be appreciate.This movie is about the difference between poor and rich. In particular the struggling of poor people to live.I can't get why it is so appreciate and famous, maybe is me that I didn't get the hidden message or something? I think that I have to search on internet some information about it..."
PARASITE,16 September 2020,8/10,This movie hit the spot for me. It was unique and thrilling. It starts off with a poor family essentially infiltrating a rich family doing various jobs for them but it escalates far past a harmless con. Near the middle it gets crazy and I thoroughly enjoyed the end. Very good movie.
PARASITE,30 May 2021,9/10,"The trailer to this movie does not give anything away, and that makes me super happy because wow, this movie caught me off guard. Beautiful cinematography, intense moments and a great cast. Also I need a bowl of ram-don... NOW!"
PARASITE,3 September 2019,10/10,This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.
PARASITE,9 July 2020,8/10,"The first 1/4, 1/3 was slow- but knowing it won best picture I continued with expectation. Knowing this was required to set up what follows.
I don't agree that the characters are inconsistent, they are multi-dimensional. as to the violence, less than many others with less artistic merit.
It is a kind of tragedy born out of desperation. Bad people or just desperate to survive. It takes the absurd, and brings it to reality in a credible way, step by step. Dreams of future success out of misery and poverty. Wrong decisions, sure. some surprises. I think it takes an unexpected course, amking the absurd seem plausible, almost destiny.It's an interesting, original plot. and any violence is artistically justified, I think. And frankly these days, I've seen worse (usually won't watch) with less artistic merit.
8 stars (4 out of 5) is a great film- is it a masterpiece. I am not sure. Is it the best film of the year. I am not sure. good casting, which is important- good script, good director very solid film making"
PARASITE,9 June 2019,9/10,"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Yeo-jeong Cho for whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
PARASITE,28 November 2019,8/10,Never watched anything quite like it. The story was awesome. I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little confusing. Maybe I missed something. I didn't understand why the father flipped out. Still thought it was a witty clever movie. Check it out.
PARASITE,24 February 2020,8/10,"I tried going into this movie with as little information as possible, and I'm glad I did. The title definitely threw me off, thinking that it was a horror of some sort. Turns out it had a lot of comedy and drama. Great characters and very original. I wasn't a huge fan of the way it ended, it felt like a bit more time could have made a difference, but overall I think it deserved a lot of the awards it got."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,10/10,"Captivating, intelligent, funny, unique... at times Parasite feels like an opera with its majestic score and visuals.One of the greatest things about Parasite is its sharp plot. The way that the Kim family plot their scheme and enact their plan is brilliantly devised, and shot in the most extraordinary way. I really liked that the plot didn't bog itself down in the morality of their actions. There was no dithering about from the family and no pause for a discussion of whether what they were doing was right (which I feel an American film would have bogged itself down in). Bong Joon-ho trusted us as an audience to immerse ourselves in the world of the Kim's and just roll with what they doing.The themes of Parasite were also very layered, some more subtle and complex than others, but all intricately connected and well thought out. The messaging throughout the film was so rich that it remained constantly engaging.From the little I knew about this film going in I was expecting a dark thriller, so the comedy took me completely by surprise. Choi Yeon-gyo stole the show for me with her comedic scenes standing out the most, and she was perhaps unlucky not to get greater Academy recognition.I can't sing Bong Joon-ho's praises enough for his direction on Parasite, creating such an eerie atmosphere while also nailing the black comedy. The minimalist design of the house, the bleak colours and tones, all holding their own meanings, really emphasised the messaging of the film and cultivated a constant atmosphere of unease, at times descending into full on horror.After a second viewing/dissection I'm sure I will have more to say, but for now I will simply say that Parasite is a must watch. Intriguing from the get go and spot on with its dark humour, Parasite is sure to pave the way for a greater visibility of eastern cinema in the west."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,3/10,"Let's see. Some of the previous best films of the year: The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Terms of Endearment, Dances with Wolves, Schindler's List, Gladiator, American Beauty are some Oscar winners, but lately, it's been meritless films that won the accolades based on social justice.It's the decline of Hollywood that has become infested with SJWs. Surprisingly the SJWs weren't upset over Koreans dressing as Native Americans.Personally I thought JoJo Rabbit was the best of the year, but I honestly didn't see any film in 2019 that was worthy of an Oscar.Here, we have an extremely unlikely family of con artists that takes a whole hour to get to anything dramatic. Was it somewhat fun? Sure, but miles away from winning the best film of the year. Are we really going to look back at this in 30 years and claim it as a classic? Not a chance.It was fairly predictable. We knew the honeymoon wasn't going to last very long, I just wish it started earlier. It is also an example that plot-driven movies are never as good as character-driven movies because once you know the ending it's not that interesting to watch again.It just felt a lack of focus and direction and seems to be 5 different ideas into one film. Also, I didn't buy some of the extreme clumsiness and carelessness. It was just too bizarre to win the best film.They just don't make films like they used to and that is a shame.On a side note, Parasite reminds me of another undeserving Oscar winner, SIlence of the Lambs, which was at best a mediocre crime/horror film, a notch above a TV film, but I think it won because it was up against a few not so great films, with the exception of JKF, which I guess should have won considering the competition. Thelma and Louise should have won but wasn't nominated for best picture. 1991 wasn't a great year for films."
PARASITE,19 June 2020,10/10,"With an incredible story, message/commentary and direction, ""Parasite"" is truly an Oscar Best Picture winner film. Giving a few laughs at the beginning and a sudden change in tone in the middle, this movie will terrify you not because the film provides gore or has ghosts, but because of the thought that these events can happen in real life."
PARASITE,1 August 2020,8/10,"Beautifully filmed and acted! One family inserts itself into another, and neither will be the same again. And the way they address the socioeconomic disparities through the use of smell is really interesting. I didn't love the ending, but the rest was thoroughly engaging!"
PARASITE,28 December 2019,8/10,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."
PARASITE,17 May 2020,7/10,With an Oscar win and liking his previous movies mother and Snowpiercer I figured this would be great as well. It's much slower then mother and didn't find the ending to be as good either. Overall I enjoyed it but don't think I would go back to it and think it wouldn't appeal majority of people.
PARASITE,21 July 2020,10/10,"Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced, and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it. Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,8/10,"So Parasite is good but certainly not a mega masterpiece. Something special, indeed, but don't expect too much. One can also interpret more than possible.In terms of cinematography its rather average. good storytelling. good acting.The movie has special moments, impacts that you dont expect. All in all, the socially critical background makes it special for me."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,8/10,"This movie was a treat. I had heard from friends that it was a pleasant surprise. Went into it expecting a thriller, got so much more. It was funny, heart-warming, scary. It did fill all the boxes. Worthy of the BEST PIC award. No agendas. No silliness. Just good writing and a well-spun plot. We loved it!"
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,"A cinematic peach: every dialogue and visual drips with succulent style and significance, while the plot is as juicy as they come (the night of drinking-basement discovery-escape into the rain was a standout sequence). It's contrived but in the most well-rounded, delicious way possible (see the phenomenal editing and music building to the masterful hot sauce tissue climax of the first half), its flavourful flesh unearthing a pit of potent commentary on wealth and status in the second half.
9.5/10"
PARASITE,19 February 2020,8/10,Good to watch the Chinese movie about crime and profession set in a dark world all characters are watchable and good acting has been done.
PARASITE,9 January 2020,8/10,I beleieve that movies from Europe and Asia are special.Take this one for example.Starts slowly and as the time goes the characters are developping we get to know the two famileis.The rich one and the poor one.The end of the film is strange.And the scene with the murder I didn't like.Overall a different film that will maybe capture your heart.Give it a chance.

PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,I couldn't help but laugh at the gullible rich family when the poor underdogs manipulated them and got jobs in their house. The second half is a great thriller. The movie has many twists that will leave you baffled. I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a must watch .
PARASITE,28 November 2019,9/10,"PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended."
PARASITE,14 April 2020,9/10,"Bathing the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the dark room can only walk away like a ghost. Embracing a poor stone will never let go, and the cheap smell will never be eliminated. Bed bugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening windows with medicaments; hosts in high places hire money to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked up the blood of the poor, and the poor lived in the house of the rich. The ghosts and the ghosts shared food in the same room."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,7/10,"The 2020 best picture winner is a sleeper hit that started to get some buzz last summer, translating positive word-of-mouth into Oscar gold in February. 'Parasite' may be the first foreign language film to win the honor, but it's fair to say it isn't the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences.Still, there's no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho's dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains. The two families at the center of 'Parasite's plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver - a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society. Aside from the acting, the execution of the plot, filled with more twists and turns than you'd expect from a best picture honoree, is top-notch. And then there's the climax - talk about a series of events that were not expected. Understandably, this earned Ho a ""best original screenplay"" award - and for that, 'Parasite' did deserve the recognition.While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year, 'Parasite' is a edge-of-your-seat, original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,4/10,But defintely didn't deserve the best movie award. That should've went to jojo rabbit. There's so many things wrong with this movie. It starts out interesting and then just collapses into things that don't make any sense.
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.Parents this film is rated R for language sexual content and violence
PARASITE,24 February 2020,7/10,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.I had no issue with understanding it.It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.Except he does.As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.The cinematography is simply beautiful.It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing."
PARASITE,4 December 2019,10/10,"""Parasite"" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film.
.
In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.
.
Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"Director Bong Joon Ho directed, wrote the screenplay and produced PARASITES. He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected. There is something Tarantino-like about his style, in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences. However, he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age, and stage in his career.He presents reality without judging: the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly, who have no money for Wi-Fi, and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I've ever seen.The father - superbly played by Kang-ho Song - claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won't fail is no plan. He tries to adapat to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity.The mother is admirably played by Hye-jin Jang, a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life's adversities, and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders' speech delivery styles.Sun Kyun-Lee plays the son, a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend's example, which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him.His sister, the extremely beautiful So-dam Park, is the most level-headed and intelligent of the lot, a quick thinker who has a touch for children,The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris, and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo (lovely legs!)By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family, and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother, the son gets the family's foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined, and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy. Needless to say, that can only be achieved with violence, and violence does indeed beget violence, but there are surprises along the way.Acting is of the highest standard by all, but I would like to single out Jeong-eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches, who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house's basement. The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain, and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are unique and memorable.Cinematography is immaculate, with memorable sequences like the flood in the poorer sections of town -- in contrast with the safety in the higher grounds occupied by the rich; the scramble for the cell phone before a video can be sent from it; and the overhead shot of Kang-ho Song running into hiding after stabbing the rich homeowner.Credible and gripping screenplay, fantastic action sequences. Completely deserved Best Picture Academy Award."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"I started to rent on Demand several times because of the high meta score rating of 96 but the fact it was sub-titled made me change my mind several times. Finally my 19 yr old son who rarely watches movies, especially sub-titled came to me and wanted to rent it... so we did and wow what an interesting evening. We were fascinated from the first few minutes and never was there a dull moment. Great acting, great story and a very very well directed movie!A great night of entertainment!!!!"
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite, is a hard film to discuss, not because it's one of those films that is truly horrendous but genuinely its a hard film to talk about because its one those where you cant do your research, or where you can see any trailers because they would most likely spoil the outcome. The hard truth is, you have to go into it completely blind, because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn, essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it's director: Bong Joon-ho.This is pure Bong, it's insane, if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into, is it a horror? A thriller? A crime-caper? A comedy? Or is it just a drama? It's all of them, and none of them at the same time. But in a way in that sense that's the way that Bong creates his cinema, just for him, the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style. From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite, to Memories of Murder, through his monster invasion flick The Host, Snowpiercer and there's even no way to describe his last film Netflix's Okja they are all him. And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we're not sure if it's trying to be a meticulous crowd-pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art-house caper. The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully. From the opening reel it'll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again...And why shouldn't you? It's perfect - the plot is watertight, the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless, they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son (Woo-shik) seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions. So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion, liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride, and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident. And that's when everything changes. Intrigued? Well, that's enough. Because when it comes to Bong it's not the story that matters its the way his characters are written, the way they delve into making new plans for the well-off Park family. No. What the story is a about, is family. Now we know what you're going to say, and you can refrain from that because this is the exact opposite, it's about a family who have nothing, then they go into everything and then they think they're doing fine until they slip. And that could result in a lot of things going wrong. For the first hour during the different plans you could essentially say that this is another version of The Italian Job minus the cars and Michael Caine or perhaps a mixture between Ocean's and Rififi and you'd be write it's all those. And much more, there's no knowing how many references to old films Bong has put here. But what he does in that first hour is absolutely captivating and the execution of the plans is one-of-a-kind cinema. It's a film that doesn't that doesn't really sound like it works, but it does. And here Bong has created a miracle of a film.Joyously it couldn't have come at a better time, amidst all the modern cinema redos, remakes and been-there-done-that sequels this is a real miracle and Bong has a real gem on his hands. Plus naturally in crime caper when people get found out they lose everything, here there's no evidence of that, maybe (but remember no spoilers) but the Kims they just keep going until they have ruined enough of the Park family's well being. There's a moment of a threat of being caught but with eager hands they soon put a stop to that. The fact is Bong does nothing wrong here, Parasite is a perfect, water-tight and captivating thriller that will put your heart on edge, make you scratch your head and finally make wonder if cinema can get any better. No is the answer, and Bong could not have made it a better time as it will keep you going to the end reel and refuse to let go even well after the credits roll. He's essentially the Korean version of the Coen brothers, and there's no better compliment than that.VERDICT: Bong has made a miracle of a film that's a water-tight crime caper, thriller and dram a plus many more genres all in one film. And with an unforgettable story it will keep you watching for years to come. Truly cinema at its best."
PARASITE,2 January 2020,8/10,"I was very hyped about this movie since the trailer was released. I did not know what to expect. The story is brilliant and I never once felt bored, the more I was going on with the movie, the more I was intrigued by it, and I wanted to know what would happen in the next scene. Character development is amazing: every character has his own personality, they have their own psychological profile, and you can immediately bound with them, because they look humans.Kim, a young boy part of a poor and unprivileged family, one day receive a job offer from his friend, to work as a private English tutor for the daughter of a rich korean family. The guy, that starts to earn a lot of money, will then involves his family, in order to earn even more money and be without debts. The entire family manage will work for them. In order to obtain that, they will use illegal strategies. These strategies are so well conceived by the movie, that even me felt tricked at a certain point.The cast did an amazing job by being so expressive, a good performance that for sure helped to win the so earned Palme D'Or to Cannes Festival. Parasite is a movie that will put you on front a of different moral dilemmas and sometimes, you don't really know which side to take.For sure one of the best movies of the year. Make yourself a favor and watch it is really worth it."
PARASITE,26 August 2020,7/10,"Very good movie, it has a twist that you are not going to believe, you need to watch this movie."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,8/10,"Being poor sucks and there is no poetry in misery: it stunts your emotional and sometimes even physical growth. Sometimes you can fight back and improve, sometimes you are just have to suck it up and surrender, which makes you bitter and angry.
This is what this movie is about: the loss of innocence of the poor and the blessed naivety of the rich."
PARASITE,15 October 2021,10/10,"Such a breathtaking movie! Both in terms of script, acting and look of the film. It's beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. Some really great twists and turns and unexpected moments.Admittedly I've only ever watched one other thing from Korea and that is the latest Squid Games. This movie is made me want to watch more Korean movies."
PARASITE,2 December 2019,8/10,"Instead of talking about the individual positive aspects of this movie, I'm just gonna say that this an excellent movie and will point out a few things that I personally did not enjoy. The main one being; all of the events feeling ridiculously coincidental. Another one is; -still under the coincidentiality umbrella but with a slight twist- a common issue that I tend to realize in above-average-budgeted international movies. They sometimes want to tell too many things when they didn't really need to, which ends up muddying up the overall balance of the main story.An unemployed family of 4 infiltrate into a rich family's household."
PARASITE,28 June 2020,10/10,"When Parasite won the Academy Award for Best Picture it made the headlines as the first non-English language film to do so. That doubtless gained it a wider Western audience it might otherwise it had, but then that is precisely what it deserves: Parasite is every bit as good as all its accolades suggest.
Directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won, the film's story follows the Kim family, who live in a tiny semi-basement apartment. They are grindingly poor and in an early scene they leave their small window open when the street is fumigated to get free extermination. They seek to change their fortunes when an unexpected opportunity arises and Ki-woo fraudulently gets a job as a tutor with the wealthy Park family. He and his family then deviously orchestrate a series of situations whereby each member of the Kim family gets a job with the Parks, a goal they've achieved about halfway through the film. At which point a bizarre twist completely changes the direction of the plot.
It's very funny, with lashings of biting wit in the first half. There's a hilariously cringe-worthy scene if Da-hye asks Ki-woo if he fancies Jessica, secretly his sister, whilst Ki-jung's means of getting the Parks' driver fired so that she can recommend her dad for the job is priceless. It's enormously satisfying watching the family's ingenious schemes unfold; they are horribly devious, getting the driver fired for supposedly having sex in the car and leading Yeon-gyo to believe that Moon-gwang has tuberculosis. In the second half, it becomes increasingly slapstick, as the Kims are forced to hide in the Parks' living room whilst Dong-ik discusses Mr Kim's smell and then starts having sex with his wife on the sofa, and when they return to their semi-basement apartment to discover it has been flooded with sewer water. As it becomes more slapstick, it also becomes increasingly dark and macabre, and the bloody climax at the party, partly filmed in slow motion, is as shocking as it is unexpected.
Bong handles the film's transition from one thing to another with remarkable ease, resulting in a superbly well-crafted film. It's brilliantly shot by cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, and the sets are lit in such a way that they never look like sets, whilst Jung Jae-il's elegant and occasionally unsettling soundtrack constantly underpins and emphasises the story's shifting mood. The cast - probably unknown to most Western audiences - is uniformly excellent, especially Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek, park So-dam and Kim Ki-jung, and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi Yeon-gyo.
Much has been written about Parasite as a satire on social injustice and Bong has stated that the title refers to both families, the Kims because they infiltrate the house and the Parks because as a rich family they leech off society. But in spite of that, the film defies simple categorization and its message isn't clear cut. Interestingly, the Park family are portrayed as nice people - there's a conversation amongst the Kims where they attribute this to the Parks having money, the implication being that the only reason that the Kims turn to crime is because they are poor. At the same time however, the Kims' self-justification is undermined when they suddenly ponder the fate of the driver they have displaced, whilst Chung-sook's unsympathetic treatment of Moon-gwang and Geun-sae is the catalyst for the subsequent carnage that leaves none of the families unscathed.
Ultimately, Bong doesn't provide a clear-cut message about inequality and injustice, but instead presents a cast of flawed characters and leaves the audience to form its own opinions on their actions and the consequences of these. Much of the publicity surrounding Parasite might lead audiences to expect a Korean equivalent of an angry Mike Leigh or Ken Loach kitchen sink drama, but it isn't anything of the sort. It's some more complicated, less easy to define, and highly idiosyncratic and it most assuredly deserves to be seen."
PARASITE,20 April 2021,9/10,"Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hidingThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,5/10,"I became mildly interested in this movie when a student mentioned it in my horror-film class. However, I became skeptical when the film went all mainstream by snagging the Best Picture Oscar.I was right to be hesitant. This movie has some strengths, including its cinematography and stunning musical score, but its story line goes wildly astray in its second half.Here we have the story of an impoverished family of freeloaders who ingratiate themselves into the lives and home of a wealthy family. Just when it looks like they'll get away with their scam, everything is threatened by the return of the family's fired homemaker.At this point, the movie careens into thoroughly unlikely territory that is slightly reminiscent of recent horror movies like ""Get Out"" and ""The Hostel."" There are indeed moments of high tension, such as when the family has to sneak out of the house when their hosts are sleeping nearby.A Noah's Ark-level rain shower and flood is good for its special effects but does nothing to advance the story.The movie's maudlin ending is the weakest part of the film. By the time the movie reaches its denouement the audience doesn't like what remains of the family and doesn't give a fig about its Morse Code messaging.To me, the ending seemed haphazardly slapped on because the producers didn't know how else to end this work. Anti-climactic to the max!"
PARASITE,29 May 2020,10/10,"Parasite is one of those movies where it gets you excited in the first half, then just tears you apart in the second. It's either a hit or miss for this style of film making, but Parasite did it perfectly. The best part is how it surprises you in such an unexpected way that it makes you depressed. The ending is insane, and when you thought it couldn't get any crazier, it got crazier.At the beginning, the plot was about a poor family who would slowly integrate each other into a rich family's household by use of manipulation. I love the original plot, it was clever and original. It also brought in a lot of dark comedy and excitement. The second half is completely different, it was about the poor family trying to keep their secret from the rich family. The second half brought in the intensity after a pretty relaxing first half. Because of such a drastic change in themes and moods, it feels like a roller coaster full of emotions. Very few movies were able to make me laugh and smile to just sadness and intensity in just 10 minutes. The pacing was also a really big contributor to playing with your emotions. It's very slow in the first half, then it speeds up extremely quickly in the second. All of these techniques were specifically done to play with your emotions, and it's done so well.The acting was great, everyone gave a very solid performance. No one did an Oscar worthy performance, but there was no need for it. Parasite focuses on real life emotions and how people would actually react in such circumstances. Kang-ho Song gave the best performance in my opinion, as he brought so much melancholy to Ki Taek (Mr. Kim). Overall, everyone had a great performance that was realistic and funny.The biggest reason why Parasite won so many Oscars was because of how well shot this movie is. The cinematography is very slow, and since the set is primarily in a lifeless house, everything is very depressing. The directing is also very well done. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in South Korea, if not the best. He truly deserves his awards, as he puts all of his talents into Parasite.I love and hate Parasite, but I don't hate Parasite in a bad way. It really plays with your emotions in a crazy way. Everything in this movie was done to simply toy with your emotions; the pacing and mood changes were so effective. And in a modern cinema where adapting screenplay is more common than not, Parasite will go down in history."

Parasite is based on a poor Korean family who thanks to their son tutoring a family's daughter con there way into a rich family's life but not everything is great as it seems. WOW what a movie, one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen, so many good things to talk about here so let's get started here.First of all, the performances and the Kim family were very interesting. Everyone's performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here. Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out. I also found the Kim family very interesting. I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house, and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated.Next the film-built tension really well and used gore effectively. This film balanced so many tones well, but I think it balanced the tenseness very well. Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters. And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved. They also used gore very effectively as well. It wasn't overused but it didn't need to be, but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way. They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling.Next the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic. Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes, whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch. The set pieces were also fantastic, I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well, the poor house of the Kim's was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like, but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic, it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes.My next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act. Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places, similar to the gore it wasn't overused and I am glad it wasn't as otherwise the film wouldn't of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me. I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected. I didn't know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next, and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible, huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here.My final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today's society. Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness. The films messages about the class conflict in today's society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do. How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent. The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away. But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think.Overall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen, with masterful directing, cinematography, screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system."
PARASITE,11 July 2021,8/10,"Director Bong Joon-ho has created an unforgettable masterpiece. Not only has he portrayed this Korean dark comedy in a way that'll haunt us, but he's involved such entertaining and shocking intensity that'll we'll never ever let go of. Parasite without a doubt lives up to the hype of being one of the best films of 2019 and pretty much the whole decade!It's just impossible not to enjoy this creepily hysterical gem! That's right. ""Creepily hysterical"". One thing every audience will remember is the fact that it's darkly funny and disturbing, but they'll mainly remember how creepy and unsettling this social satire was. Parasite includes scenes and elements that manage to make us admit that some short moments in this movie are scarier and more creepier than 95% of horror movies. The majority of horror films today aren't scary, and a dark comedy succeeds to terrify? True.But of course the performances are great and the storyline grabs our attention. Don't focus on the fact that this movie is a foreign language, because it's almost perfect if it weren't for being a little extended. If you're planning to watch this chilling thriller, you'll truly need to avoid all spoilers and prepare to be amazed, shaken and shocked.Both halves of the movie are great. ""Halves"" means the comical and chucklesome first hour being connected to the shocking, thrilling and disturbing second hour. You'll surely enjoy this excellent award-winner with intelligent ideas. Make Parasite a must-watch.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,8/10,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."
PARASITE,7 September 2020,,Absolutely the best film of the year. An amazing blend of all genres. What wonderful execution.
PARASITE,18 March 2020,8/10,"There should be such a journey in the course of everyone's life. It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life. ""Aunt"" is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie. In the tenderness and tenderness, Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle-aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup. Teacher Huang Meiying, who plays her mother, is both acting and funny. Every move makes people shout ""It's too subtle""! The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan. After she separated from Xu Yiwan, the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes, striding among a group of exotic faces. That was both the liberation and rise of a woman, and the best ending of the whole story. I really like this adaptation of Little Lady. As a kid (actually until growing up) I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together. Because it's too long apart, I can remember very few details, except for two places, one is Laurie's tassels on Jo's apron, and the other is the secret code of their pillows.
Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong, giving the director a personal explanation: this is the needs of the times, and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster. And I asked my question in a publisher's tone: I can't see why she wasn't with her childhood sweetheart? I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood. (Well, because of this I'm willing to give this movie five stars, even if it doesn't meet my expectations in a few places.) Once again, I would rather embrace such an open ending. I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period, but I do n't accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person (to his sequel).
The genius of the film is non-linear narrative, which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light. Some transitions were very genius, especially the comparison between Beth's first scarlet fever and his last death. Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong, and it really made me cry. It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth's body in the book, which kept me upset. And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb (also Beth said write for me. Amy said Beth is the best of us). Through a story, it deeply tells the social reality, and will make you automatically, think of more social reality, and make you dissatisfied with all the rich and poor. Its ability to arouse empathy and extend the association has been achieved. What you and I come into contact with every day in our society and experience every day. What this movie does not talk about, all broke out through the perception of this movie. This is the real power of this movie.
The film finally leads to a very sad ending. In the end, fate returned to zero, and all changes returned to the original point. After getting his father's Morse code, Jiyu vowed to make money and then bought the house in an attempt to make his father see him again. Of course, all this was realized in Jiyu's dream, but can it really be realized? Not to mention whether it can make enough money, even if it is done, can Jiyu's father really see the sun again? Isn't it a real cage waiting for him? Don't forget, he is a murderer.
You will find that the real scary part of this story is why Jiyu's father, driver Jin, finally killed President Park. The social phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has made the poor intolerant, but the internal grievances are extremely deep, in this psychological and mental state. The slightest disrespect of the rich will cause a chain reaction of torrents and tsunami. He noticed that the uncle who rushed out of the basement waved his butcher knife towards Kiting, and driver Kim, after his middle-aged uncle fell, had nowhere to vent his anger. He eventually inserted the knife into President Park. However, killing President Park can really eliminate his anger? Can he reverse his fate? I'm afraid the answer doesn't need me to tell, everyone already knows."
PARASITE,24 August 2021,7/10,"""Parasite"" is a smart, highly entertaining black comedy, and it's good to see a good film getting some recognition for once. However, I feel like all the people who praised it as an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of all times must have been watched ""Transformers"" and ""Avengers"" all their life. The film itself is solid in most aspects, but conceptually I don't buy the cheap social critique and easy populism that one more time depicts the rich as spoiled, dumb, and not worthy of their wealth. Perfect food for the envious middle-class that dreams of living in big houses, driving expensive cars. Retrospectively, the last season has been full of this kind of ""us vs. Them"" films, and while ""Parasite"" might actually be the only one to be any good, it's not thanks to its message.Actually, it would have been alright if the movie ended with the party scene without all that subsequent melodramatic crap to glorify the working class who ""lost"" gain. Up to that point, both families are almost equally ambiguous, with even some interesting reflections on how this generation's weak spot for resonant brand names and exclusivity, as even the humblest servant now is supposed to have a resume full of renowned names or belong to elite companies to get a job. The vertical depiction of society is also effective in its simplicity, with the Parks' physically living above everything else, but at the same time unable to see what lies beneath due to the high walls and trees that entirely cover the view from their garden. The layout of their house also mirrors this verticality with rooms and hallways they are not even aware of.An above-average film overall but definitely no masterpiece, not even Boon Joon-ho's best."
PARASITE,30 December 2019,1/10,"I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""Don't waste your time, trust me on this.I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"I watched this film last night, just before the night when it woukd win 3 oscars. I can understand why it did win, though personally I can not say that I was blown away by it.
Certainly it is entertaining and very very symbolic.
At times I thought that they were inspired by Emir Kusturica's film Underground.8 from me"
PARASITE,6 September 2021,9/10,The plot was good . There were some funny scenes and it was a simple and decent movie you can go for with your family anytime. Definitely a good time killer.
PARASITE,30 January 2021,9/10,"Parasite is like no film I have seen before, for a very long time, despite enjoying it, I was questioning just what this film was. There was comedy, obvious drama and a little romance too, but it all accumulates into a thriller. It's surreal, but brilliant.Overall, Parasite is a stark commentary on the class divide within Korea, yet it doesn't paint either extreme as the lesser, the evil, or impose certain stereotypes. The difference in lifestyle and mindset is evident, yet putting these two seemingly amiable families in the same space displays the ultimate division. It's difficult film to explain to another, yet it's apparent why it won the Oscar for Best Film. Watch it, I don't see how anyone could be disappointed by it."
PARASITE,1 December 2019,8/10,"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder._________Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."
PARASITE,21 January 2020,,"Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is an awesome movie. I would totally give full 10 star, but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal, I didn't like the end of the movie...I was not sure who actually the parasite was, the family, or just the guy in the cellar? Who was actually supposed to be the hero, bad and good guy in the movie? somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad-ass..."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,"The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - ""Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?"". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!"
PARASITE,10 March 2020,8/10,"...generally interesting if you bookend the acts and scenes.Interesting that it's coming as a series as it seemed more suited for such. As if there was more to see which would make it more compelling. I've had that recently where a ""meh"" or neutral film would make a better series.For instance, the whole process of the poor family getting themselves jobs took up too much time for a movie. Although they're introduced quickly and likeable, I didn't get the full sense if they were just struggling or were grifters. My guess is grifters. But I shouldn't be guessing. Tell me.The second half when the former maid shows up felt very manufactured. Why'd they let her in? The underground bunker was original but how we got there was more trying to write itself out of a corner. Both would have worked in a series, though.The maid turning the tables on them was fine once you were in the underground space, but arriving there was forced. Then the rich family returning was a bit much. Plausible but a bit much.When the maid is kicked down the steps, I thought she was dead from the head wound. So it was odd when the poor husband said ""Thank God"" when he checked if she was breathing after seeing the blood on the back of her head. Conversely, being that she was bleeding but still breathing, he didn't take it seriously enough.The element of the rich father saying the poor father smelled like radishes was a set-up for the ending, but it wasn't enough. When it came, I didn't buy it.The sex scene between the rich couple was awkward and unnecessary.I did see the motivation of the underground man attacking the poor family. But like I said before, I didn't see why the poor father would attack the rich man. And it was obvious where he went afterwards.Not sure why the mother and the son were prosecuted as I didn't see any direct evidence against them. The underground was still unknown to the police. Confused if the rich man died. The father's morse code attempts were very awkward, much less the son seeing them. A big stretch.In the end it was very well made but whatever the message was muddled. Clearly suggested classism but only touched on it at best. I've seen Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer, his segment in Tokyo!, The Host, Memories of Murder and Mother. (Surprised there was so many when I looked him up.) Thought about the same of those: well done but not seeing the hype."
PARASITE,22 April 2021,9/10,"I just finished watching Parasite. Ir was phenomenal. It's story had me hooked from the start (hype from others helped in keeping me tied in the first 30 minutes too haha). But nonetheless, my heart was beating at certain points and my eyes were burning from staring at the screen so intensely (I wasn't wearing my red blocking glasses). I love the way it started without much detail and ended in the same place it began. I LOVE full circle movies.The movies theme lit a fire under me. It was bouncing many places with my emotions, but it ultimately made me appreciate growing up with little in certain facets of my life. By no means, did I live like this fictional family did. But I can relate.The director did a PROFOUND job on it. Seriously. What a thrilling movie."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,8/10,Its not often I go to see subtitled films but given the reviews I thought and I had to see this one and I am so glad I did.It's fantastically different and a great story that really draws you in but never stops surprising you with a laugh or shock around every corner.A great film and well worth anyone's time to go and see it.
PARASITE,16 May 2020,10/10,"I've been thinking, how do you avoid tragedy? It's better if they don't open the door, or go to the police, than if they do. Because to avoid the real owner of the house to get things must be ""shady"".But then again, maybe it was in the moment of alcohol-induced happiness that I really thought I was rich and had a kind heart that shouldn't belong to me."
PARASITE,19 October 2019,9/10,My first Korean movie in US theater!!! Great script & surprise storyline and funny too. Very entertaining! Even though I am not familiar with any of the actors but they did a wonderful job to keep me engaged to the movie. No wonder this movie won many awards!!
PARASITE,26 December 2019,10/10,"Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.
Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.
This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.
At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all ""."
PARASITE,19 March 2020,10/10,"This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars.
Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place.
That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them.
Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'"
PARASITE,29 August 2019,7/10,Cannot understand why it can win important award???
PARASITE,7 January 2020,9/10,"I agree with a lot of the reviews for Parasite. Parasite is a wonderful work of art that is open to many interpretations. One interpretation that I haven't read yet, which I found throughout the film is...karma.The poor Kim family struggles to make it in life. However, the Kim family cuts corners i.e. they lie, manipulate, cheat, etc. And as the old saying goes, 'you only get what you give in life', and that's kind of why the Kim's are where they are. The Kim's are good people in some way, as Mr. Kim demonstrates, expressing his shame about the driver they got fired. The Kim family has a conscience and they have some values, as most of us do.However, if you cheat, lie, deceive--it will always come back to get you i.e. the scene in Parasite where husband Park and wife Park are on the couch thinking of the underwear and they start sexually going at it while Husband Kim and daughter and son Kim are hiding under the table, listening to this. How awful that must have been for father Kim to hear that with his children right next to him. How embarrassed husband Kim must have felt at hearing he smells terrible, from husband Park, in front of his children--and how their was nothing husband Kim could do about it as he and his son and daughter were hiding under the table. The metaphor being that most of us in life can do nothing about it.But the Kim's did manipulate and cheat their way to the top, therefore their karma came back to bite them. And oh how it bites the Kim family in the very end. And it bites the Park family too. As the Kim family uses the Park's, the Park's use the Kim family for cheap labor--which in turn is a metaphor for the class war and for the war of employer vs. employee and how we all except such crummy wages and demands as a part of our society.In one scene, Mr. Kim says, 'no plan is the best plan.' Which is the same as the old adage, 'If you never have any expectations then you will never be disappointed.'Also, you could look at the stone like the story 'The Monkey's Paw.' Just like in The Monkey's Paw, the stone brings the Kim's good fortune...but at what price.Parasite is brilliant on so many levels that it's really a film you need to see two or three times to take it all in. It's a film that demonstrates that there is always someone worse off and Husband Kim gets his ultimate karma by taking the place of the person who was worse off than he was. Karma. It will always get you. And Parasite demonstrates this beautifully.Wonderfully acted and spiritually directed in the genre's most clever form. Parasite is not only a must see, it is a film you will not forget."
PARASITE,17 August 2020,10/10,"The film had me from the beginning and the very end of it was disturbing and sad. I didn't expect the dad to just hide underground for the rest of his life. Great film, reccommend it."
PARASITE,17 August 2020,10/10,"The part where the dude was in the bunker killed me. I was shaken and did not expect it to do that. Anyway, watch it."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,8/10,"I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy."
PARASITE,3 January 2021,8/10,"One of the best scenarios in recent years. Very smart, full of symbolism and links. The first half of the film was perfect for me, as they infiltrated, a funny and rounded story. The quality drops a bit in the second half of the film when the genre and tone change. The very end of the film was also not the end to the end and when it ended I had no sense of delight. I think it is a great satire and a critical society, the division between the layers exists and is quite pronounced today, it is not possible to move from one layer to another, there is a big difference between them. It is said with us: A full does not believe a hungry man."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,7/10,No doubt this was a great film with a strong plot but not that awesome to win an Oscar award - otherwise this film is definitely worth that watch showing some humor and suspense.
PARASITE,8 April 2020,8/10,"I watched this film after the latest Oscar ceremony but I didn't expect a lot from this film. So, I was really surprised. Firstly, the story is really interesting, it seems very simple but you will be a little bit shocked after middle of the film. The plot has some good twisted moments. Secondly, all cast showed the great performance, I believed them. Thirdly, I want to line cameraman's work, the frames looks awesome. I think that some scenes are too long, it's a reason why I didn't rate it more than 8.
So, it's wonderful film about our society, family values and, at the end, love."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,8/10,"This is where I get all smug and talk about how I remember when ""The Host"" was released, and in fact I've owned the DVD for well over a decade now. And at that time I wanted to see ""Barking Dogs Never Bite"" as it starred Bae Doo-na, who was popular among me at the time; and I'd heard ""Memories of Murder"" was worth a watch, but my limited attempts never found an available copy - a film that now seems criminally under-promoted in the UK. But after the release of 2009's ""Mother"", as I am neither a Netflix or Jamie Bell subscriber, Joon-ho Bong's name hasn't been in my consciousness a great deal over the last decade.Until about a year ago, when talk was of his latest work being really quite good - tipped, and then fulfilling promise, to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Now South Korean cinema is all popular and that and Oscars are being won - breaking new ground along the way.But, despite my interest in his first two feature length films, I have still yet to see either. ""The Host"" was an entertaining film, but is somewhat clunky in parts; and the dancing on the bus finale from ""Mother"" stayed in my memory, but I had to re-watch it to have my recollection of the rest of the film restored - a tidy little film. But, while good, he was not a director blowing my mind, and after a relatively meagre last decade in terms of the volume of output, I was surprised by both the hype surrounding ""Parasite"" and its ground-breaking achievements. Is it really all that and a bag of Oscars?Well, the premise, is a nice one.The Kims are a poor family living in a basement flat, looking out at the rest of the world from street level. They are more-or-less living in the gutter. Working by pre-folding pizza boxes for a local takeaway, they steal wifi off their neighbours or local businesses - the toilet their wifi hotspot. The son, Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi), has two things going for him: while completing his military service, he learnt English to a good standard; and his friend Min (Seo-joon Park), a suave and sophisticated young gentleman about to travel abroad.While he is away, Min asks Ki-woo if he can take over his role as the wealthy Park family's daughter Da-hye's (Ji-so Jung) English teacher. Ki-woo will be able to pass as an English teacher, and as a failed college applicant, poses little threat to Min's designs on Da-hye. Enlisting his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park) to forge college certificates for him, Ki-woo goes for an interview with Park mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo), exploiting her simple, wealthy naivety.Quickly, Ki-woo learns that the son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung) also needs a new art teacher and recommends his sister for the role, though denies their family connection, of course. Through mischief, Ki-woo and Ki-jung soon get their father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song), recruited as the father Dong-ik's (Sun-kyun Lee) driver and their mother, Ching-sook (Hye-jin Yang), as housemaid. Soon, the Kims occupy the splendidly modern house as much as the Parks, unbeknownst to their hosts.But ousted housemaid Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns when the host family are away, finding the Kims enjoying a night of luxury, unearthing a dark secret kept within the house. Complacently, their cover is blown, and the Kims must do what it takes to keep their real identity, among other things, hidden.As stated, ""The Host"" was an entertaining film, though like any comedy, can have moments where the script feels a little clunky/awkward/Swiss cheese. ""Mother"" was a step up in overall quality, with better storytelling, while maintaining entertainment value. With ""Parasite"", Bong has created a near perfect balance of good storytelling with entertainment value. The first hour is an introduction to each of the nine central characters in what is quite a light comedy drama about con artists.But throughout, Bong leaves subtle references to what will become the film's climax. These start off small, but gradually become more frequent, and when literal push comes to literal shove, the bubbles rise to the surface and boil over. Tension is brought in as we switch to the second half of the film, when the Kims start to enjoy imagining themselves in a life of luxury - another subtle hint, perhaps. Happy-go-lucky tricksters soon become criminals, with Bong pacing this development well.In their showhome advert for the way of life of the mega rich, the Parks are not portrayed as horrible for it. Yeon-kyo is nice, if a little slow, and the Kims recognise this; Dong-ik is complimentary enough; and the two children are normal kids - Da-song deserving of some sympathy. The Kims are more relaxed and likeable, but also manipulative and criminal in their work. Here, the poor appear more immoral.But, as things progress, the Parks begin to show their disgust at those from poorer backgrounds. What start off as seemingly minor comments about how Ki-taek smells, become more frequent references to it, comparing it to the smell of people on the subway, and we all know what that means. Ki-taek is increasingly disturbed by these comments, repeatedly hearing it on a stress-filled night, returning home to his flooded basement apartment. Dong-ik refers to Ki-taek getting close to crossing the line, and returning from his fantasy to his reality, it may be time for that move to be made.Despite exploiting them, the Kims initially liked the Parks; but the more they get to know them, the more they realise the Parks will never truly like them back. The stunning view from the window of the Parks' house is contrasted by the view from the gutter the Kims have from theirs, with Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography telling a story in itself. As the Kims are punished for their crimes, sympathy grows for them, and indeed their whole neighbourhood destroyed by flooding. While they try to rescue their children from the floodwater, the Parks casually watch over Da-song as he sleeps in his teepee in their garden - it won't leak, it was ordered from America.Both families are left scathed by the end, but which do you feel more sympathy for? Who was really exploiting who? Bong weaves these questions in subtly throughout, sucking you in.Now, where's that subsequent ""Early Bong Blu-Ray Boxset"" we all know is about to come?!politic1983.home.blog"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,8/10,"I liked Parasite very much and had predicted that it would win the Oscar for best foreign language film - as it rightfully did !However, I could never have imagined that Parasite would also win in the best picture category as well. Shouldn't the Academy's eligibility rules permit a film to enter in only ONE of these two categories ? ? ?"
PARASITE,3 January 2021,7/10,"In a hurry, I finally saw Parasite and it wasn't sooo great.
I was not convinced by his grotesque / black comedy style, certain repetitions, some too long scenes, his low blows and some formal gloating.
And the worst: a lot of concern about the MESSAGE: the characters are almost puppets at the service of a message ..., but a message that came out, moreover, frankly reactionary.
Visually brilliant."
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho is an absolute genius and has struck once again with the masterfully twisted Parasite. All four of the central performances are wonderful in depicting this fantasy like film that depicts a family slowly gaining the trust of and infiltrating another, upper class family. Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it. This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising."
PARASITE,6 December 2019,10/10,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"The director seems obsessed with the battle between the have and have nots...Parasite.in essence, was similar to his sci film Snow Piercer, where the poor battle to reach the home of the wealthy.in Parasite we have a poor unemployed family trying to get ahead at the largesse of a wealthy family, which they con into employing them. Things eventually go bad because they abused the breaks they had given them.In the end I was left with an unsatisfied feeling...as if justice had not been done."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion.
The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards."
PARASITE,8 June 2020,10/10,"In Bong Joon-Ho's game-changing social critique, the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic, comical, and horribly grounded fashion.Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades. Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum, stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies' minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries. Ranging from Michael Bay's greedy paradox ""Pain & Glory"" to Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white gem, from Sean Baker's thoughtful portrait of post-financial crisis in ""The Florida Project"" to Paul Feig's Oscar-nominated powerhouse ""Bridesmaids"", capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival.In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho's latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d'Or win, ""Parasite"" has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony- golden ticket Cuaron's ""Roma"" lost to polarizing, preachy ""Green Book"" back in 2019 -but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, ""Parasite"" feels like the ""Inception"" of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan's towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures- it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan's pic -comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ""Get Out"" and ""The Invisible Man"" are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.Script-wise, ""Parasite"" is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These ""think-again"" premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition.Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony.The film succeeds at it, mainly, from hugely magnetic characters. When first we met the Kim family, they leave their banjiha's windows wide-open in order to get free extermination. They are poor, unemployed and Wi-Fi-needed. The film develops them one by one in a highly audience-catching way, picturing them as both victims and victimizers as the film evolves. Later on, the Park family steps in. They are wealthy, intellectual, picture-perfect individuals. However, unlike the Kim family, the Parks are not portrayed as villains until the masterfully executed final sequence, where each missing piece fits in. For most of its running time, they are naïve, nice elite people who do not want to get sick by their long-time loyal housekeeper. And that feeling of correspondence the film gets from its audience, regardless of origin, race or social status, comes from a core aspect: empathy. We care about them, we are invested in their tragedies, we are as worried and shocked as the characters themselves. Empathy is paramount for wining audiences over, without it, most of the film's purposes would be directly trashed out, and the South-Korean director knows it better than anyone; if not, just take a look at any of his previous works.Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which- by the way -became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.Bong Joon-Ho's pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, ""Parasite"" spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors- make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; - however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail: sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces.""Okja"" composer Jaeil Jung plays an important role as well, shaping the mood and complementing the atmosphere, endowing the film with rich, elegant, horror-like sound scales, getting a heart-stopping, small yet often disturbing soundtrack by adding up layer after layer of complex composed sounds.""Gisaengchung"" by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as ""the picture of the year"" and, even if it is tout à fait true, ""Parasite"" transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele's ambitious allegory ""Us"" reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: ""Parasite"" is a groundbreaking work of art."
PARASITE,21 August 2019,8/10,"It was a really tight movie, well written. At that phases they barely miss a glimpse of stories. Personally i think there's a really conversation that seems not really needed but the rest was perfect.the scene was good in every aspect that i understand, pay attention to every scene and you may end up surprise with the detail that gave. Tone was really beautiful. scene story portions was easy to understand.my first thought from the poster was it can be really dark, but well you'll see... it will be nice if we got a little picture post event from Ki-woo best-friend to see how he react after all of this."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,10/10,"It is difficult to not spoil a movie when all you want to do is to talk about it, specially when it is truly astounding.Bong Joon Ho, the acclaimed director of Snowpiercer brings us this amazing masterpiece, a grueling story of the lengths people will go to come out of a desperate situation.All I will say of the story is that in its core it's the tale of two families, a very wealthy family that has everything, yet they have nothing, and a very impoverish family that has each other to a fault. But when their worlds collide there is bound to be a catastrophic catharsis.In the age of remakes, sequels and reboots it is very hard to find a movie that is not only very original in its premise, but that it also manages to amaze you and shock you to the very core, to your very foundation.The movie is very well shot, and it has amazing performances, specially from Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park, who is rapidly becoming a rising star among Korean actresses.The film won four Academy Awards, and it deserves every single one of them, it is well-paced, the story is engaging, it has amazing performances, an astonishing photography, and it is masterfully put together by a visionary director, whose unapologetic take to show the ugly side of humanity makes this movie unforgettable.It would almost be a crime not to rate this movie a 10 out of 10.There have been talks to make an American adaptation: do not mess with greatness!"
PARASITE,28 February 2020,6/10,"Oscars best picture, Cannes winner, lauded and acclaimed, and a good and engaging film from beginning to ending. Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook. An engaging premise. A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme.I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes, by itself, for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the ""vigor"" of its animating conceit; it's 'reason to be' (made).Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea, hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema, but it's a neat idea.Essentially a pursuit, in dramatic film, of the degree to which ""upstairs-downstairs"" conditions the life choices, circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides, how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input.This ""have and have nots"" and ""how the other half lives"" drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction.The manner of this drama is in two stages: firstly the ingratiating ""invasion"" of the rich households retinue by the Kim family; eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition; all transpiring almost entirely under the noses, and beneath the awareness of the ""upstairs"" 'haves', the Park family.That's it. That's the best idea. The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor.It's a good film in its runtime: reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships; an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching; and a missed opportunities to illuminate the 'host' family of 'upstairs': the Parks.The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance. A major problem was scenes of drinking, 'drunk' acting was unconvincing.Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring. Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park's house.Certain limitations in writing include the Kim daughters character, who I found utterly unconvincing and unbelievabile as presented: she is intelligent, resourceful, outgoing, manipulate, skilled and also beautiful, young, female and single.....and yet none of this seems remotely relevant to the young woman we meet at the films inception...was she being kept in a freeze dried bag until the day before the narrative opens? How can she exist in her environment without these character details having very pertinently pressed upon her life?
As the film proceeds she serves to help other family characters but otherwise she is a doll in a costume after that.The Kim mother is barely recognizable as a full human character with genuine characteristics and a independent life. Her marriage is seldom testified to, is it good to bad, or bad to good, how do they feel to each other and about each other, what little closenesses do they share unique to them....I dunno.
Compared to the Kim men the two females are badly nourished as characters and conspicuously so in the case of the daughter.The Park's family hints having real human people in it but by the end of the film even the husband, who seems quite human at times, is left uninteresting and unconsidered. The idea that they have a real life with skeletons in cupboards was absent. Only the phrasing of the husband to relate about his main encounters with the Kim's father to his wife, with phrases about ""crossing the line"" and ""subway people"" seemed to expand their humanity.There are 3 marriages featured in the film plus a teenage relationship and only the third and final couple, of the displaced housekeeper, actually seem to have a ""lived in"" married life that feels like it proceeds the story concerning the film.The full attack upon maximum employment by the Kim family seemed to me to be an extremely ungainly insistence for the film to impose on my disbelief but it had to do it to develop it's plot line.Finally, in passages the film hints at metaphorical depths such as its talking about ""light"", it's use of rain storms and catastrophic floods, underground dwellings and the rock ""scholars stone"". These metaphors interact with the upper class airy people and the ground dwelling lower class people: but here I would have appreciated some 'second unit' type environmental photography to tie the human story with the metaphorical levels with the films physical reality. I'd have accepted an extension of the runtime to achieve this extra footage on the edit.In summation I rate at a lowish 6/10 and I would reserve my agreement that this film deserves such rewards as it has garnered for what is basically a neat idea for a particular treatment of standard themes and subject matter which is amiably delivered on screen but suffers from varied failures in execution in the writing."
PARASITE,30 August 2020,10/10,"I absolutely loved it, the screenplay and story are really creative and tons of unexpected things happen.This movie is like a luxury handbag or watch, extremely well crafted on all aspects.10/10"
PARASITE,23 January 2021,7/10,"O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock: from a ""Western"" perspective, very few people will have seen a film like this. The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too."
PARASITE,21 February 2021,8/10,"8.5/10 is my rating. This is South ean thriller thriller drama that runs 132 minutes.Two worlds collide when members of a poor family struggling to make end meet go to work for the wealthy Park family. In the same genre of dark twisted tales as ""Basic Instinct"", ""Gone Girl"", ""Pacific Heights"", ""Momento"" and ""The Game.""Kim Ki-taek, Mr Kim; (Song Kang-ho)
Head of the down on their luck but looking for their next mark Kim family. He poses as an experienced chauffeur to gain employment with the Parks.
Park Dong-ik, Nathan (Lee Sun-kyun)
ERned his wealth as a successful business man and mostly allows his wife to manage household affairs including hiring household staff.
Choi Yeon-gyo, Madame (Cho Yeo-jeong)
The easily manipulated wife and mother of the Park family.
Kim Ki-woo, Kevin (Choi Woo-shik). Ki-woo's friend approached him as he was leaving to study abroad and wanted him to fill in his tutoring job and keep other boys away from the girl he is tutoring and likes (he is waiting for her to get older). While Ki-woo does not have credentials he has studied for and taken entrance exams enough that he has gained expertise. He is the first member of the Kim family to be employed by the Parks.
Kim Ki-jung , Jessica (Park So-dam) Upon mention the Park family is looking for an art teacher, Kevin says he might know someone who can appreciate the Park son's unique art style and introduces Jessica (secretly his sister who also has phony credentials).
Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin). Matriarch of the Kim family her other family members work behind the scenes to get her hired as the head housekeeper (all the while pretending not to know each other)
Park Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) High school daughter of the Park family who is being tutored to prepare for entrance exams.
Park Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) youngest member of the Park family. He receives art lessons from Jessica.
Son of the Park family, who is obsessed with Native Americans.
Park Seo-joon as Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) Ki-woo's friend who gets the entire Kim family in the door (unintentionally) by recommending his friend, Ki-woo to replace him as
Da-Hye's tutor.
This was a very dark story in that the wealthy family was conned into giving the entire Kim family positions which they were not qualified for. Through careful manipulation and deceit they were able to eliminate existing staff and obtain high paying jobs with the Parks. At one point the Kim's collected information on all relevant personal and financial details leading to the conclusion rather had something even darker in mind. Things took some very unexpected twists at the end. I liked this movie and it reminded me of some very dark American dramas I have seen over the years. i felt like the change from one up man ship to murder happened more quickly than the situation warranted and felt it would have added suspense if things had built to that point a bit more slowly. It is a very good movie in this genre and I understand why it gained recognition."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon Ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night - four. On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.But what exactly is Parasite? Described on its official website as a ""pitch-black modern fairy-tale"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature - part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the Ulysses of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like Ulysses, it's exceptional in just about every way - screenplay (co-written by Bong and Jin-won Han), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things - it lives up to the hype.The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (So-dam Park), and son Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Seo Jun Park), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Sun-kyun Lee), mother Yeon-gyo (Yeo-jeong Cho), daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung), and son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.Obviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth - the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and completely bonkers third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, Parasite feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics - the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families - as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect.There are no heroes and villains here - Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect.It's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. A parasitic organism lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well - they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship.However, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Ha-jun Lee's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways - one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which will have huge narrative and thematic importance.Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie - a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich - but Bong is far too talented for that, allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,7/10,"Every detail of the film is in the hands of the director with incredible precision, presenting an absurd social fable that is easy to dismiss as bloody-eyed. Audiences will be fascinated by the plot of the film, and they can easily understand the class gap presented by the film. Bong jun-ho USES techniques to largely eliminate the absurdity of the story into absurdity. It has the halo of the palme d 'or of cannes, but it has no cinema threshold, which is the ideal result of balanced art."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,9/10,"The only reason I watched this film was because of the great reception it got at film festivals this year and word of mouth from the indie film scene. I'm not going to lie I don't watch a lot, if any, non-English language films...........don't ask me why I don't know. However after seeing this my world has been opened to the possibilities of other films that could be out there.Bong Joon-ho has directed a bloody fantastic film from start to finish............it is impeccable, I don't have a fault just praise.......His camera work throughout the film is ever changing, there is so much uniqueness to it.........I really don't think I've seen a film like it before. Coupled with some gorgeous cinematography, the film is amazingly beautifully shot............outstanding!!I'm not going to name names with the performances for a couple of reasons, firstly they are all incredible for their own reasons and also the fact that I have pretty much no idea who any of the actors are. That last point is actually a major positive for me because I didn't seem them as actors I just saw them as people on the screen, there wasn't the movie star or famous face that I had to get past.........in all english language films there is a I'm familiarity with those actors. It can sometimes take a while to buy into their performances, but by not knowing any of them it meant I bought into all the characters and their relationships straight away.The story is horrific...........but not in a gruesome way, this is the definition of a smart psychological thriller period. The story of a low-class family of con-artists who invade there way one by one into the lives of a upper-class family is genius, the film definitely deserves its english title. That is the central message of the film i think.......class and the gulf between the classes in society. Its not just spoken in the dialogue but subtly played on throughout the film, building towards a climax at the end. Trust me the end of this film is breath-taking and extremely clever. But not only the end there are so many twists and turns throughout the film that it always keeps you guessing..............especially the basement !!!!!!!The film has everything, tension, comedy, drama, seriousness, addresses societal issues, family relationships, sad endings and happy endings. Plus a lot of Kubrick esque stuff throughout..............However it is definitely its own film by a long long way.I am speechless after watching it and cant wait to watch it again 90% out of 100 it is simply brilliant from start to finish. Bong Joon-ho has opened my world to foreign language films...............my naive little British brain has been blown up. This film as well as its actors deserve all the acclaim and awards attention they get!!"
PARASITE,14 November 2021,8/10,"While I do think that it is ever so slightly overrated, I can't help but acknowledge the very artistic directing, symbolism, and acting that went into this film. Some parts make you laugh, some parts make you feel very sympathetic, and many parts make you feel oddly uncomfortable but in a good way that makes the movie pretty enjoyable! We definitely do live in different parts of society with different luxuries and experiences that are misunderstood by the other."
PARASITE,30 December 2019,8/10,Wonderful foreign movie I've watched this year but doubt I can rewatch cuz of how I cringed for the family the whole time.
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades."
PARASITE,26 December 2020,10/10,"I have to admit originally I wasn't much interested in watching this film in cinema cause at the time I was to lazy to read subtitles but my friend really wanted to watch this film and kept on insisting for me to go along so I just went and watched it in cinema and i did praise my friend alot for his choice what a great entertaining movie this was it kept me gripped through from beginning to end. At the time it was the best Korean film I had seen at the time and it is what got me to watch more korean movies and tv shows. I've seen this movie 3 more times sins in total 3 times in colour and 1 time in black and white. All the ratings and praises are there for the films but I would still encourage people who haven't seen parasite to definitely give it a try you will not be disappointed at any point. It is really fast moving and the performances are spot on all cast and crew have done a fabulous job.
this is definitely 10/10 for me."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,"Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"With engaging performances, a deft use of dark comedy, and thrilling twists that add up, Parasite is a smart and haunting take on conflicting social classes, showing how both the poor and the wealthy can equally be the villains in their respectively desperate and callous ways. It's not impossible to respect each other and co-exist. Parasite has really opened my eyes to foreign language films and rightfully deserves its historic Best Picture win. A stunning film."
PARASITE,17 September 2021,5/10,"Parasite failed to grab my interest near the start. Later on it picks up momentum and becomes quite engaging. But this is less because I liked it and more because it manages to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions. By the end, it felt like the exercise was a waste of time or worse. Worse because I worry that the filmmakers and many fans actually sympathise with the murderers, just because they're apparently poor.The premise falls apart when you think about it. While it's somewhat entertaining at first, seeing the main family lie a bit to get jobs supporting a rich family, it really sinks in that there's no reason for them to be poor. If the girl can fake university documents, if the boy can tutor English, if the father knows streets well and can drive confidently - why on Earth can't they get proper jobs? They can fake being qualified and well-off so they can succeed in job interviews!Little lies are one thing, like faking a degree to get your foot in the door. It's wrong, but it's not that bad if we're meant to believe there's some kind of unfair system. But after that, we see more and more how immoral, selfish and ungrateful the ""poor"" family is. As Dickens might put it, however poor they are in terms of wealth, they're much poorer when it comes to decency and morals.The girl lying about art therapy to manipulate the mother is appalling. Are we meant to find that funny? The way she talks about the rich family behind their backs is also very demeaning. The main bad things the rich family does is 1) be rich (so what?) and 2) complain about smell. Nobody likes bad smells. It's very reasonable that a part of progressing economically is taking care of personal hygiene. It's a practical thing, not a class thing.What they do to the previous maid is also terrible. Abusing her allergy. And planting underwear to frame the driver. The boy flirting with the girl he's meant to be tutoring.They don't care about the lives they ruin, as long as they get ahead. We never once see them apply for jobs. They use their intelligence to manipulate others and only progress by bringing others down. I felt that the only happy ending would be one where they all get killed by some psycho killer, or at least where they all get exposed.The best section is in the middle where a single night spirals out of control and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But even this was somewhat predictable and convenient for the writers. Why are they partying at this house? Who couldn't guess that an emergency would arise and the family would return early?The maid coming back and having her husband locked in a cellar was a nice touch. You don't know where the story is going from there. But while this could make for a decent horror or thriller, it doesn't gel with the rest of the movie, which is more of a comedy/drama.The ending is frustrating. I hated the poor family. They've now killed a woman on top of everything else. I understand the cellar husband's desire for revenge. But when the poor father kills the rich father? There was no justification for that. I liked the rich family. They were nice people. The father earned his money. The mother cared about her children and was very open and kind. The kids are normal kids.It makes no sense. The dad hides in the cellar. Sure. But you're telling me the police didn't look there? The son's bloody body was right next to the cellar entrance. They didn't search the room? Look at blueprints for the house? This guy comes out of nowhere, probably presumed dead, and goes on a rampage and they don't search the house more thoroughly?And it seems like the filmmakers want us to empathise with the murderous father. Sorry, but he should rot in jail. Along with his whole family who were complicit in all this. The maid was pretty crazy too, keeping her husband in a cellar. Wasn't she earning enough? Couldn't they pay off the debt, even if it took years? Why not be honest to the rich family?Parasite is misguided and extremely overrated. It's decent as a thriller/horror, at least for part of its running time. It has good acting and directing. There are a few funny moments. But the message is deeply confused and immoral. Poverty doesn't justify murder. Or lying or destroying other people's jobs.And if you have so many skills (the girl seems very smart and good with computers), why are you folding pizza boxes for a living? They can't get proper jobs? I call BS. Even when they all get jobs by lying, they don't move to a better apartment or improve their lifestyle. They're only poor because the script says so, not because it's remotely believable."
PARASITE,7 May 2021,8/10,"Not gonna lie, the Overrated-ness of Parasite is starting to get to me. When I first saw it at the cinema I was very impressed, but after some thought I think it's probably closer to an 8 objectively. The last 30 minutes in particular drag it down somewhat. Not really a huge fan of the direction it takes. I simply don't get what on God's Green Earth made this one of the highest rated movies of all-time on some websites and listings. It's pretty baffling and far from being a flawless movie. That being said, I still like it. The Black and White Version added nothing to it though. If anything it made it pretentious for absolutely no reason.7.5/10."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,6/10,"I will admit that Hung is a master cinematographer, and can tell a good story for the most part, but like the movie Mother, which I believe came out in 2012, that he also wrote and directed, it just Falls flat at the end and doesn't really end, but more or less just stops mid sentence.For the most part, this movie had me on the edge of my seat, and the middle of the film had me biting my freaking Nails because it was so exciting and embarrassing to watch. Parasite really delivers and is a very intriguing film that is beautiful shot and really is one heck of a ride, but that ride comes to a sudden stop at the end, which is both jarring and jaw gaping considering that this movie was such a thrill, only to become a shoe being thrown at your head.I wish that the ending was better, but I will take it oh, because I don't think that every single story needs to end on a high note, but I do believe that the story at least needs to have resolution in order for it to be a success."
PARASITE,1 November 2019,8/10,"Slow burn, gripping, tension and feeling uneasy while watching. Best performance by Kim, his father Mr. Park and their family. And the other family mother is also. And everyone in this movie did their best in acting. This story can be dragged more and more. Than we could watch a better ending. I think, here the makers should have to do more research about the ending. Otherwise a solid screenplay and story.It's all about class difference or class inequality.
It's all about greed.
It's all about karma - Tit for tat."
PARASITE,8 March 2020,8/10,"Surprise surprise, they have poor people in South Korea too!Every news story from South Korea carried by our Western Media shows glittering highrises , gleaming, if crowded, cities and fabulous transportation systems.Everyone is slim and good looking, everyone has a great job in the electronics industry and it's capitalism at its best, or so they would have us believe.Underneath this glamour is the same societal structure as there is in the West.... fabulously rich people and the wretched poor.The story, and we've seen it many times before, is that the wretched poor want to even things up by stealing from, or conning, the rich. It's just human nature at work.If only the socialists studied that same human nature, instead of being angry at the rich, they would be able to come up with workable solutions to the injustice, but I digress, let's move back to the job at hand.With the backdrop of South Korea as our tableau we get into a pretty good plot with the underclass pulling a scam on a rich but naive family.The scammer protagonists, Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, are living in squalor in a slum, with no real hope of getting out, when they have a stroke of luck by scoring an introduction to a wealthy family.They use their devious talents to infiltrate the family and before you know it they have all been hired by them to look after their domestic needs, with well paid, luxury jobs.From there on in we have the wonderful juxtaposition of the wealthy family living a Kardashian type lifestyle (only much more refined) against the ""we've hit the jackpot"" mentality of the slum dwellers.Of course there's no ""off"" switch for scammers and the beauty of this film is the way they manage the story as it spirals out of control.......... it is really well done.The acting is superb and the mise en scène is just fabulous. The pacing is right on the button and it's no wonder the film attracted so much attention.Even with the subtitles it is a very absorbing movie and although I wouldn't put it in the ""classic"" category (as I would with ""A Separation"") it's one I could easily watch again and enjoy it just as much.I have no doubt that it must have been the best picture from the choices that the Academy had.It's head and shoulders above ""The Irishman"" and head and shoulders above any other Hollywood movie I watched this past year.Well worth watching!"
PARASITE,24 October 2019,3/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I didn't read too much about it, but watching the trailer and having seen this director's previous work 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', I was expecting something in the horror/sci-fi genre. But that's not what this movie was.
Sadly, whatever message the director Joon Ho Bong was trying to convey, it was lost in the tonally uneven mess of a script and direction, that starts off as a light hearted comedy, but then drags down into a dark and depressing disaster.
When the movie starts, we are shown a working class (more more like poor) family, the Kims, who seem to be hard on their luck. We see they work together folding pizza boxes (i don't see how the fumigated boxes were still good), to earn a few bucks.
Anyway, luck falls upon them when a friend of their son hooks him up with a sweet tutoring gig at the home of the Parks. And as the movie progresses, the members of the Kim family slowly insert themselves into aspects of the Parks lives.
Now, I think the intention was to portray this as some sort of social commentary and class struggle. But it definitely doesn't come across like this at all. All we see is The Kim family using tricks and deception to get their way, while the wealthy Park family, while a little naive, is portrayed as actually fairly nice. They don't mistreat any of their workers, they don't even do background checks on the Kim family (who are masquerading as non-related individuals). The father seems to be hard working, but is willing to take time off, along with the whole family, to take the young son out camping for his birthday.
The movie then takes a dark turn when we find out the husband of the previous maid was living in the basement of the home. Not as a prisoner, but of his own choice, to evade the law. Now, this turn of events is NOT a twist. I was expecting the twist to be more like it turns out the original architect/owner was locked down there, and the Park family was also a bunch of imposters.
Anyway, this movie devolves into scenes of violence where the Park father is killed, and really, I don't get why he had to die. His only crime was he didn't like a particular smell. It wasn't a metaphor for poor people, because poor people probably don't like smelly people either. It just seemed like the whole basement bunker/garden bloodbath was shoehorned in for the little 'twist' ending where we see the lights flickering on and off in the house because that's where the murderous Kim father chose to hide.
The whole movie premise was just bad, one dimensional characters who we never learn anything about, so we don't feel any sympathy, except maybe for the Park family who were too nice for their own good.
This movie really doesn't deserve the high praise it's been getting. It's a clumsy effort that doesn't execute it's themes very well. I just gave it a 3 because it's pretty to look at and some of the dialogue was funny. But as a whole, it's an unrewarding experience to sit through."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,6/10,"See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.And the ""wealth rock"" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one ""scot-free"" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets ""lesson learned (maybe)"". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, ""aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan"". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. ""The whole notion of ""why bother"" makes no sense or point thematically in art."
PARASITE,14 June 2021,10/10,"I am going to keep this very short and spoiler free, this was beautifully filmed, great acting, great script, it was laugh out loud funny and enormously dark. It also had a social commentary, it was simply brilliant, it is a good while since I enjoyed a film this much."
PARASITE,21 April 2021,8/10,"I don't think this was one of the best movies of all time. I havent seen many East Asian fims before, Parasite was the first Korean one I've ever seen, so for regionally Im unaquainted with the style.I really enjoyed the movie - it was a great watch thru-and-thru, but I feel like the second half twisted too darkly too quickly, and the pacing in general, besides that, just seemed... Off to me.I definitely think it deserved all of it's awards and it's acclaim. Maybe I need to see it again, like I said I thought this was 'truly great'."
PARASITE,8 December 2019,10/10,"It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did."
PARASITE,31 July 2021,10/10,"With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.MASTERPIECE!"
PARASITE,28 February 2021,7/10,"It's tough to hear something about your smelling. The smelling of person clung by what they eat and where you live. I have a better sense of smell than the others, so I know how sensitive this trouble of smelling is.Even if they lie their identities well and live off a wealthy family, it's hard to disappear innate lowlihead. So, smell is the metaphor. They just made fake identities and depended on their authority and goodwill, so they weren't raised up by themselves. After all, the fake position is worthless. It smells only like the fake. It can be told from by smell because it's questionable.Although the first part was good, it was so unrealistic that I lost interest with the development at the last part. Or rather, I was excited by good going undercover drama at first!I would say that it's not an unrealistic content at all. There's parasites like them around us. For example, some women who condescend because of the high status of her husband. And others arm themselves with luxury bland goods which are given by sugar daddy. There may be parasites in place that are closer than you'd expect."
PARASITE,8 June 2020,10/10,"I have watched this film a total of three times now. First time with English subtitles and twice without. I have absolutely no idea what this movie is supposed to mean, but it feels like two social classes clashing against each other in a very strange yet interesting house.
I'll admit that I have never seen a Chinese or Korean made movie until now and Parasite is the first film I've seen from Korea, but the sheer artistic direction and enigmatic structure of it all is incomparable to any other film I've seen come out of the year. A very select few movies that come to mind that has a plot structure or story direction style that I can relate or reference this
I can only guess what the main theme or score of this movie is supposed to mean, I am listening to the music of the Blu-Ray menu as I'm typing this, trying to decode meaning from the notation structure of the short yet extremely memorable of this song. I'm still trying to decipher what emotion the theme is trying to convey. Could you say the film has a serious tone, it is hard to say?
The movie definitely has a serious tone, with a very strong burst of violence in the final 15 minutes of the movie's running time, but the theme is surprisingly happy and carefree, even joyful, yet overshadowed by an ever lurking hint of sadness, that never lets go. The sadness melancholic feel of this movie is always present throughout, despite the emotional rollercoaster this surreal absurdist - drama/comedy film only known as ""Parasite"" takes you on
This short theme is actually very true to emotion in real life. Melancholy can never fully be escaped from in so many facets of life. True happiness can only be achieved in fleeting moments and sometimes only in short bursts only to fall back into a stabilised state of emotional equality that is where most people reside in most periods of life. Never truly happy yet not depressed or sad. Simply reasonably content.
The third light at the top of the stairs meaning to me is the unstoppable and indescribable drive to try and achieve a higher state of happiness beyond normal human comprehension. An emotional ascension, which can also be heard in the main theme is you really start to sit down and think about the music in the film, and start mulling over the notes in your head and how they really make you feel. How does the theme make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Melancholic? Confused? Joyful? Maybe all at once. Maybe none of these emotions are good enough for you anymore. Did you ever think to yourself that you deserve a higher state of feeling that you always wanted but could never grasp?
If there is such thing as an afterlife or heaven, how would the souls that live there feel like. I would expect It would be a higher state than what most of us experience in life.
The rock to me is the object in the movie that symbolises the emotional weight which all the characters revolve around and are effected by which also radiates a strange gravitational like force that influences them, kind of like Sauron's Ring from LOTR but in a different way.
The true form and meaning of happiness is something that is always in my mind when I think about this movie. What is happiness even supposed to mean and who out there is brave enough to say that modern society's definition of true happiness (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean) is just simply not good enough. The man in the basement is an enigma. He is a man trying to create and send a message of how to escape the confines and prison of being trapped inside the normal comprehension of human emotion. The balance between Joy, Depression, Melancholy, Depression, Fear and True Happiness.
He cannot accept that true happiness, at least the way he feels it, is the best and highest form of happiness that a human mind can achieve. The three lights symbolise an upward stairway for the emotional mind. Emotional intelligence followed by ascension to a higher state of feeling and sustained happiness.
Parasite also touches upon Schizophrenia is some parts and offers a quick window into what it might be like to suffer from Schizophrenia. The definition of Schizophrenia itself is simply ""a breakdown between thought, reason and emotion""
Funnily enough this movie is split between three genres. Absurdist/Surreal Comedy and Drama.
The movie feels oddly split which is a purposeful directing choice which is the most obvious thing that you take away from this movie. The film could have been called ""Split"" to me and still would have not lost any of its impact, but unfortunately ""Split has already been taken by Shyamalan.
Something of a parasite is formed in this movie, but what it is I still have no clue. Parasite IS going to be one of those movie's that is going to become exponentially better the more times you watch it which will not lose its interest, charm or unique appeal with repeated viewings. The film truly feels multidimensional in its direction and communication of its ideas that leaves massive room for the viewer to make their own interpretation of those so-called ideas and messages in the film. The movie at times has a very enigmatic feel, reminiscing of certain video games like Myst, Riven, Portal and Abduction. Parasite is an experience that is going to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people
Anyway, what do I think of this movie in terms of quality? The answer is simple. 10/10
This to me is minimalistic yet multidimensional filmmaking at its absolute finest and I really have no issues or gaping flaws that I have to say about it, It's pretty much as perfect as a modern movie gets and transcends so much that has came before it. I loved it. I loved every single goddamn minute of it and I don't even understand what I watched or even why I enjoyed it so much in the way I did. If you didn't enjoy it that is totally fine as well. It's one of those movies that is not going to be everyone's cup of tea and that is also okay. But to me, Parasite is the next step as we are beginning to experience a new advent in visual storytelling. This does feel like merely a prototype that will be improved and expanded upon by Boon Jong Ho. If anyone who might be reading this who worked on the movie, well done. I mean it.
Anyway, just watch it if you have not already. It will be one of the fastest and most interesting 2 hours you will have this year. Watch it without the subtitles first, then watch it with subtitles on. Also try to watch it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos if you get the chance. I currently have not, but I'm sure I'll see it in a theatre somewhere since this still hasn't been officially been theatrically released in the country I live in.
Also, I want a Parasite themed rock birthday cake XD"
PARASITE,21 September 2020,9/10,"I am not typically one for being big on foreign films, however given the notoriety of it winning big picture and all it could not be ignored. And for good reason, this was simply just great movie making! It has so many elements such as comedy, drama, and hold your breath suspense. And a very original story.While watching, my wife stated this almost seems like a much better version of Jordan Peele's 'Us', which I would agree with. I feel like both movies try to deliver the same message, though Parasite is far superior in doing so.This was satire at its finest as the film looks at two very different families, one being rich, and the other being poor. These two social classes will clash, but just as you think to have it all figured out, a huge wrench is thrown into the plot and it goes from crazy to ludicrous. The tension is huge throughout because you don't even know who you're cheering for. There's no defined bad guys or good guys, all have their qualities you commend, but also flaws. Every character is beautifully acted as well.Not at any time was I bored. The characters and story lock your attention up, while you wait in anticipation on how this whole wild ""situation"" will turn out."
PARASITE,9 October 2020,8/10,I was captivated at just where all this was going and how it was going to resolve it's issues and in the end i marvelled at the technical aspects of the storytelling more than i engaged emotionally with the main protagonists and if a drama is to be successful in my eyes you really have to care about the characters. Its not that i didnt care but there were many ideas and subversive elements going on underneath all the drama i felt that it ultimately pulled in too many directions at once to be a masterpiece.
PARASITE,12 January 2020,8/10,"Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence.
A fabulous director."
PARASITE,31 January 2021,10/10,Incredibly well directed. Strong narratively with a consistent tone throughout. Unique.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"With ""Parasite"" Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary, not unlike his praised ""The Host"" (2006) - for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues. It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder.""""Parasite"" is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works.""Parasite"" is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared."
PARASITE,5 May 2021,1/10,"I watched this film because of the awards it 'Earned'. Yeah right! But despite its accolades, it was not worth 1 minute of my time. Not all foreign films are bad, but this one was slow, boring, and lacking any sensible plot. In other words: A Total Waste Of Time."
PARASITE,21 December 2019,10/10,"Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"Review:
'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho.
I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different.
The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around.
The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin.
Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film.
5/5"
PARASITE,30 March 2020,5/10,"I watched Parasite on Prime Video, expecting it to be an above average film. It really was not.The initial build up was too slow, the story thereafter was interesting but certainly not great cinema. It was just okay. The violence towards the end was too gory.Overall, I found Parasite over rated."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,9/10,"I must confess to a long time bias against sub titles, like many lazy Americans, I felt like having to read while I watched a movie was just asking too much. Then, a few years ago, I sat down and viewed a DVD of the fully restored SEVEN SAMURAI, and really understood what I had been missing out on for too long, especially when it came to Asian cinema. So when Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE won the Best Picture Oscar, I didn't feel any of the dread at having to listen to a foreign tongue while reading along with the screen that might have come a few years back. Now, after watching last year's Best Picture on Blu Ray, I say that for me, PARASITE is so good, I wasn't aware that I was reading anything after a first few minutes.Set in South Korea, the film works both as a thriller, and at times, a comedy of manners, along with a strong social commentary theme. I could see strong influences of both Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder in the script, which centers on two families, the Kims and the Parks. The former are stuck in poverty, living in a cramped basement apartment, while the latter are quite wealthy, living in a spacious house, attended by a housekeeper and chauffer. When the Kims' son manages to snag a job as an English tutor to the Parks' teenage daughter, the family has a foot in the door, and soon the rest of the Kims, under false identities, have infiltrated the household, taking over the jobs of therapist to the ADD afflicted younger son, housekeeper and chauffer; finagling to have others fired from the last two jobs in order to obtain them for themselves. The Kims are soon enjoying a newfound prosperity at the expense of their obliviously self absorbed employers. But their deviousness has consequences, and when the former housekeeper shows up one night when the Kims have the Parks' house all to themselves, the story takes a turn no one sees coming. Giving away anymore of the twists the story takes would be unfair, needless to say, this is one of those films that goes in a lot of unexpected places.There were some things that really stood out for me in this film. One was how well it works as a suspense film, liberally borrowing the situational irony that was a hallmark of Hitchcock - a scene where three of the Kims have to hide themselves in the Park house and attempt to sneak out while Mr. and Mrs. Park go about their intimate business is a great example of this, along with Hitchcock's patented voyeurism. Characters practicing deception was one of Wilder's signature themes, with the consequences of such deceptions playing out in the finale. Second was the theme of class warfare, how the Have-Nots, with their cunning and guile, easily manipulate their supposed Betters, while the latter feel wholly invincible in the superiority their wealth has brought them, making them easy marks. Third was how well the characters are written. The Kims commit reprehensible acts in a cold blooded manner, yet they really do love each other in a way that makes it impossible to totally condemn them. Even the fired housekeeper, who is revealed to have a skeleton in her closet, is motivated by love for a family member. I love films with complicated characters who are more than what they appear to be. The screenplay, written by Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won is a masterpiece of storytelling, especially in the way they introduce a plot twist late in the second act that has only been slightly foreshadowed, and how they get so much story out of small everyday things, like a food allergy, the Morse code that a Boy Scout learns, and the musty scent of a damp basement. This puts me in mind of Vince Gilligan, and his masterful TV shows BREAKING BAD and BETTER CALL SAUL. Lastly, if there is a theme to PARASITE, I would say it is that no matter what the difference in culture may be, human nature is universal.The acting, especially Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam, as the devious Kims, is exceptional. But real star is director Bong Joon-ho, who won the Best Director Oscar for his work. My choice for Best Picture would have been ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, but I can't be too bummed out when my favorite lost to a movie as good as PARASITE."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,9/10,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.hipCRANK"
PARASITE,2 January 2020,10/10,"I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end"
PARASITE,9 July 2019,9/10,"I went into this this film only knowing the premise. An unemployed family worm their way into getting jobs in a wealthy families home. This film starts off fun and it is very satarical, it then takes a very dark turn. The direction is amazing and dialogue is very funny and twisted. The acting is top notch, but the real star of this film is the Korean director, he wrote directed and produced this film. The music and compasitions of scenes are so well thought out. You really didn't know what was coming next. That is so refreshing and exciting as a film goer. This is a really strong commentary on the class system and what you would do if your deseperate to live the high life. Its hard to review this film without giving too much away. I will say be warned the violence is not for the faint heart hearted. If you love to be entertained and watch something different this is for you. This film will not be forgotten come Oscar season. A masterpiece of cinema, 4.5 stars"
PARASITE,20 May 2020,10/10,"This movie is honestly a masterpiece. I was so happy when it won best picture. ITs pacing is great, it has so many twists and turns that you are constantly invested in what is happening.It looks gorgeous too!The characters are so well formed and the script is just great. It funny too.People are often put off by subtitled films but i wish they would give them a chance as they miss out on films like this and more importantly foreign films fail to reach commercial success.So if you are at all interested in what you have heard about this movie, watch it you will love it."
PARASITE,17 October 2020,9/10,A slow paced thriller that highlights the social class divide... superbly directed and esp a powerful development of characters... a great movie with little disappointing conclusion...
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"This was like watching the Godfather, Inception and The Panic room in a refined version of the 20's... but with its own bizarre, funny, and at the same time beautiful unique style that only Bong Joon could make... 8,6/10???? this is a 10/10 film, Bong Joon is one of the best writers/directors in the world, Okja was the ultimatum film that defined he was a genius, his first ""masterpiece"", and he did it again this time! such a elegant film, with such a perfect timing and edition, for moments it looked like an orchestra more than a film, actually, the whole film has beautiful classic orchestra in the background, a beautiful piece of music called orchestra that hides another orchestra but more complex, creepy and sad called life, it's like a methaphore inside a methaphore, inside of a more complex methaphore, u get it??? IT'S FREAKING GENIUS!! the first minutes of the movie were a little slow, like all the Bong Joon films, but I knew the rythm will come, and how it arrived was brillant, the tension was exquisite, the photography is so clean, the art of this film is so refined as all the other elements, script, acting, plot, HOW CAN SOMEONE GIVE THIS BRILLANT FILM SOMETHING LESS THAN 10??? WHO LET THAT PEOPLE VOTE PLEASE!!! 8,6/10 IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE SHARKNADO MOVIES IN THE RUNNING TIMES :/"
PARASITE,5 November 2019,10/10,"I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.
The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."
PARASITE,19 August 2019,8/10,"I liked this movie. Actually, when i first heard it's a joint collaboration of Joon-ho Bong and Kang-ho Song, again, it was a must watch. And then, I was observed with the film's roll once I started watching it. How climax crawled from a creepy space to reveal itself was fabulous.The film shows a slum family with obvious big dreams from all its family members while a totally opposite side of hyper rich family with lost kids and bizarre wife. Film showcases smooth turns and in a real well crafted way of how those Four family members occupy their positions in new Employer's house within few days. Apparently, things all go well until an unexpected situation turmoils everything. Story, I would say, did ended OK. Maybe I expected something more out of it but that's OK.Now, why come 8/10. Their are a couple of glitches which apparently din't convinced me. Like for example:
Why wasn't a single scrutiny done of the remaining fellows other than Kevin. He gave so good impression through his way of teaching Da-song that everything was cool after. I would have appreciated more if some more work was done. Like before hiring a new employee, his/her SSN or some other proof submission is atleast required. Ya, they could forger those proves too, but again, did they? I think people in today's world, especially Rich, are more superstitious and overcautious. Wouldn't they want anything like that or atleast give a hunch to get some background check? Or their friends could have opened their eyes.Once Kevin gets recruited within a few days, like within a wink of your eye, all the other problems in old workers start forthcoming. A nanny cum maid working from 4 years never showed a single sign of TB in her whole stay and all of a sudden, she started Coughing and splitting blood. Again, I won't say its not impossible but i wasn't much getting into it. Means, isn't the onus on me to alteast listen her up?Those two above points were thin thread, if broken, the whole climax is gone into toss. Anyways, above expectations for Director's creative work, cinematography, chilling thrill and a different aspect of story."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,9/10,"POSITIVES:1) The film perfectly blends genres of drama, comedy, thriller and even horror at times
2) The entire night time sequence, where the rich family come home early from holiday and our main characters have to hide and escape, is cinematic perfection
3) The film gets you fully invested in the characters and the plot and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time
4) Fully deserved that this is the film to make history by being the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the OscarsNEGATIVES:1) The ending is the only reason why this film isn't a 10 for me. I found the violent killing spree to be too sudden and not to gel very well with everything that had came prior"
PARASITE,20 March 2021,9/10,"Well deserving to be the first non-English language film to win best picture, especially at a time where the title is given to films that by far don't deserve it. Excellent criticism of class divisions with strong metaphors. It's the type of movie that will stay in your mind and make you think about the world as you go to sleep at night, or maybe several nights."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,7/10,"It's a film about class struggle in society. At first you get angry at poor characters. They cheat all the time. But after a while, the film makes us accept the truth. It's easy to be good for the rich. The poor don't have much choice."
PARASITE,6 September 2020,10/10,It has a perfect narrative and good moments of tension. It is one of the best films of recent years. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
PARASITE,23 October 2020,7/10,"This is certainly unique. It's strong points are excellent central performances from the ensemble cast and some good laughs in the first half. It's stylishly done, but ultimately it's a tad too silly and has a fairly bitter taste that isn't for me. If you like dark comedy though it may be for you."
PARASITE,19 April 2020,10/10,"Some stories are plain and simple, a line from A to B. Some are convoluted mindgame mazes that force you to solve riddles or to stay forever lost. And then there's this film. A traditional Asian gift of layers upon layers of wrapping, each concealing and disguising not just the shape but the essence of what's inside. And in the end, the gift might not be what's in there, but the act of unwrapping itself.I'm amazed how Bong Joon Ho tricks us into believing that this is a cheap con artist comedy at first. It was almost natural to shout ""No way! This can't be the film everyone's raving about!"". Had I recalled that this man has also written Snowpiercer, I would not have been so simple. Just like the rich family whose house the parasites have invaded, naive and gullible, ready to call the number on the first business card given, we fall into the traps of easy interpretations, and Bong knows it well enough, giving us all these hints we understand only after a while.Parasite is definitely not about the action, and maybe not even about the visual brilliance, although the scene of running down the stairs, equally physical, social and psychological, under the rain is a phenomenally executed message, just like a scene of an elevated toilet bowl regurgitating back what it's fed up taking in is an image only a person who made two Oscars kiss could come up with. In terms of graphic expression and witty dialogues, Parasite could make both Tarantino and Miyazaki proud, all at the same time.This is no doubt a fancy wrapping, but the best thing about this film is what you feel through it. From condescending disbelief, to light interest, to full engagement, to the sense of watching a social message play within a movie, to feeling as if no borders of genre or common sense exist at all, to feeling dumbfounded and uncomfortable, to a sudden calm. As if a petty half-penny story has taken you into a Zen parable.In the end, nothing remains. An experience that leaves you blank as a mountain side under the snow. So if you do see a light in the distance, don't rush to decode its signals. Just enjoy the scenery while it lasts. After all, it's what you came all the way up for."
PARASITE,10 November 2019,10/10,"I'm going to put it simply: There's not a single thing this film does wrong.The comedy is on point. The drama is on point. The moments of tension are on point. The commentary on social class is on point. Acting, writing, filmmaking - on point.Parasite totally deserved the Palme D'Or and I want this to win all the Oscars, all the Golden Globes, and any other awards it gets nominated for because everything in this s**t was incredibly on point.Parasite is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE."
PARASITE,18 December 2019,8/10,"I'm not sure I would have seen this film without my wife's prodding, and it's partly because of the title. It's accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it's a bit creepy in tone. I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean. But on to the film itself: obviously it's a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho, who's the writer, director, and producer. I didn't know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine, and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles. I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing. (and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I've seen in recent times.)For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy. A slum-dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs. Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they're getting. (The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver, tutor, housekeeper, and nanny, but they're not uber-rich like the Crazy Rich Asians -- they actually do work hard and have their own issues. Not knowing any better, I'll take it for granted that their ultra-modern Western-style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class.) For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor. But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways , leading to a rather shocking final scene. Quite a lot hinges on the maybe-improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story (no spoilers). There turns out to be more than one ""parasite"" at work, and it's more than just the young rich folks who don't know what they are getting into.It's a complex, multilayered story (2:12 run time) and the director throws quite a lot at us. But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes. A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm. The rich folks (on the high ground, as we notice for the first time) just sit inside their beautiful garden, while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away (complete with raw sewage in the streets). It's excruciating to watch, and this is where the message hits home. Basically decent people are forced into doing things they shouldn't do by their own circumstances and there is in the end nothing they can do to escape. The message that class determines destiny was quite a bit more overt in Bong's previous effort Snowpiercer, but it's present here too throughout.At the end, everyone is left damaged, but we're given a wistful little coda that holds out just a tiny ray of hope. That's only human."
PARASITE,22 April 2020,8/10,"Slow moving at the beginning, but it picked up quickly to a gut-wrenching climax at the end. Comedy of errors, serious social commentary, human emotions and a horrifying climax. All the ingredients of a prize winning film."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,9/10,"This potently weird dark dramedy was the surprise hit of 2019, and even took the Academy Awards by storm - the first non-English language film to win the best picture wtf?? It starts out like a satirical take on class differences and tensions, and ends up going its own loony way, with a secret bomb shelter playing a key role in the plot."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,6/10,"Yes its a good movie but not nearly as good as Snowpiercer. That has lower rating for some unknown reason. Script is predictable and does not display any direct critique on the class conflict. so it could be easely missenterprited! The poor actually look unworthy in this supposed masterpiece. if thats not major flaw i dont know what is. acting is extrimply poor. camera -not bad but nothing special. overall ark is childish , no suspense or dramatic high points."
PARASITE,27 November 2020,10/10,"""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" - Ki-TaekParasite is fantastic.It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act.It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene."
PARASITE,15 November 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."
PARASITE,4 December 2020,5/10,The Korean version is more dramatic and have a cinematic feel to it. the script was fined tune and fused with universal themes that may also won it an Oscar.
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"I'm not really sure why this film is so incredibly well regarded? I feel like it was hyped up heavily pre-Oscars based on momentum / buzz, but the end product has me confused because there's absolutely nothing ground breaking here. Was it the fact that it was filmed in South Korea? Maybe people are so used to the K-pop fluff garbage coming from SK that when something of actual artistic substance is produced via their pop culture it gets blown out of proportion, when compared to their usual fare.
Let me say now, Parasite is in no way a bad movie. It has something to say, the plot is decent, and it is well shot. But the plot line and story itself isn't really saying anything new or different that hasn't been done via Hollywood in the past. I also felt like some of the performances weren't A+ material, probably why the film wasn't nominated for any actual acting awards. The main male child and dad did good enough work, the daughter and mom, and the members of the ""rich"" family? Not so much. Basically throwaway performances.
Again, not a ""bad"" film, but if you are looking for a revolutionary vision and message, keep looking."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,9/10,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
PARASITE,10 September 2019,9/10,"""Parasite"" directed by Bong Joon Ho is a fine film about one horrible family taking horrendous advantage of the wealthy Park family, and a strong message to our global culture.I was deeply impressed by this gem of a film, which only strengthens the creative vision of Bong, as well as the fascinating cinema of South Korea.Fantastic direction - Bong Joon Ho is a master at building suspense from simple scenes and shots. Formidable cinematography. A sovereign effort in production design. Deliberate and effective pacing throughout. Taking all this together with a very interesting script and characters, and an excellent film is realised.Highly recommendable."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"After watching the Oscars I was curious about Parasite and knew I would have to watch it. I wasn't disappointed at all, most times when people hype something up I tend to think it's overrated. I was rooting for this down on their luck family even though they were technically committing a crime. Who hasn't lied on a resume to get a job ? I didn't see the ending coming at all so that was a shock."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,8/10,So watched the Korean movie Parasite. It is about poor family conning their way up into a wealthy family and things just go wild as the mystery unfolds.The chains of class created by capitalism is felt same by everyone. This is what everyone connected to. The chaos we all thrive for is served well. The whole movie is the buildup for this and he has been able to do it in his own chaotic way! Chaos?!
PARASITE,1 March 2020,8/10,"I must say quite bizzare movie. Very twisted with the story and also with the end. I'm not sure it deserves for Oscar,not movie like that,anyway. It's quite a entertainer"
PARASITE,20 October 2019,10/10,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,10/10,"PROS:EVERY SINGLE THING.The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines.
The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.CONS:Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending."
PARASITE,1 November 2019,9/10,"In the latest film of Bong Joon-Ho (Salinui chueok (2003), Snowpiercer (2013)), we are given a story that, in a brilliant turn of events, sees the day-to-day lives of two Korean families intertwined. These families couldn't be more dissimilar; one makes money from folding pizza boxes & steals the wifi of nearby cafes while the other lives like royalty, served by maids and taken around by drivers.The income disparity is quickly made apparent to us and in a string of events I don't want to spoil here, the poorer family finds themselves usurping one role at a time of the richer family until they all find themselves employed by the rich. And yet they have to act like total strangers with one another. How this is all written, directed and acted plays off incredibly well.""Parasite"" really surprised me in that it takes you on a whirlwind of emotions. It's storytelling is ambitious and takes chances in veering off-tone and off-the-book, so to speak. I found myself dying of laughter at some parts, tense or sad at others and purely enchanted throughout. All of this while showcasing some of the most unique storytelling I've ever witnessed.Certain to nab a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Academy Awards and perhaps even a Best Director & Best Picture nod, ""Parasite"" is certainly one of the year's best. Arguably even one the decade's best. It's all in the little details whether it's using a keen sense of lighting, composition or blocking to reveal something. Give this one a watch and you'll see what I mean. Masterpiece!"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,7/10,"This is a bravura and surprising thriller, with a fancy modernist brutalist house as one of the leading stars. There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household, their early success cannot hold.I'm a fan of Korean films anyway, and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through. While the film is totally accessible, there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer - which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising.The film does not perfectly handle it's different layers - the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly. The pacing doesn't always work either - the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors.This is not the best Korean film I've seen - Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior - but the setup, cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success. (I don't reference the classic Old Boy accidentally; that too was effectively a double layered film, and on reflection it was a little better at it.)"
PARASITE,8 September 2020,,"This movie is bolstered in it's ratings by ""piling on"", but in this sense, it is a piling on of unearned praise. This is a mixed, it will examine the good qualities, some of the misnomers of other reviewers, and the bad qualities of this film. In case anyone wonders, this is not my first Bong Joon Ho movie, I watched ""Host"", which Parasite is so far ahead of ""Host"", which was a 5 at best when all things were considered. ""Host"" is also a movie that gets far better reviews than it deserves, it totally squanders its good ideas, and ""Parasite"" does the same.""Parasite"" is expertly made technically, outside of it's script(which is sophomoric at best), ""Parasite"" is not a classic, it isn't groundbreaking, and it is not that good; although it is a mildly interesting film by the end, it cannot make up for the fact that it is boring because it is completely predictable if you have watched even a few films. ""Parasite"" may refine what Ho did with ""Host"" and irons out the kinks, it isn't enough to rise about a 7 when all things are considered. I have watched enough Korean films to know they are quite different from their Western counterparts, and even other countries such as Japan or Hong Kong. Parasite is relatively dull and predictable for the most part, but it does have a cohesive vision and tone that, for your average movie goer, it will set it apart from almost anything they have seen, and for those unfamiliar with Korean cinema, this will seem a lot more unique then it is. I've seen movies similar to this from Korea, it really isn't too unique. If you want to see a truly unique Korean film, see ""Save the Green Planet"", which is about 14yrs.I too watched ""Parasite because of the hype, but I could not stop watching the clock up until the last 20 minutes, other than a minor twist or two, it was totally predictable, and it was highly irritating to see the movie dragged out to over 2hrs, it just wouldn't end Had it been 100 minutes at best, this might actually be a 7.5-8, even with it's unoriginal storyline. Despite it's overly long run-time and predictable script, the direction is Ho is vastly better here than ""Host"", the cinematography is well-done, beautiful music, good acting(those saying the acting is bad are wrong, this is an absurdist film, the acting is supposed to be, well absurd), the lighting and sound are great, so from a technical standpoint, it is great, but it is a very predictable script with too much padding, the script is also largely devoid of any real character development(there is only a little bit towards the end), and is filled with cliches, which some are probably confusing for clever. Better characters would have driven home some of its main points better, and this script is in desperate need of some trimming.In terms of the story, unlike others, I do not feel it is far-fetched what the family did, per say; people get conned every single day While others saw the poor family as being portrayed as dumb and lazy, I saw it differently. What struck me was the father wasn't lazy or stupid, he is the typical hapless and bumbling father that is so prevalent in Asian films. Mostly he appears to have lost the ability to care and was aimless, without purpose; and doesn't actually care about his family, which makes him hard to like. He has a small progression in this film, it just isn't enough. The son, on the other hand, was shown as cunning and selfish from the beginning(in the incident with the pizza company), and once the family saw that he had been able to complete this ruse as a tutor, and they got on board with his plan. The father and son of the poor family, are by the far the most fleshed out characters, but that isn't saying much. While I didn't like the stereotypes on either end either the rich or the poor families, and it does seem to make the rich people the bad guys, which is pretty absurd given they were swindled, and far worse by the end of it. The film, despite other's claims, had nothing meaningful to say about class struggles, it is simply the same rote nonsense that is in most films these days.Unlike some, based on the slow-burn of the events of the film, the violence here felt natural, and it didn't feel out of character for these people; it felt like a natural progression of the script and the feelings these characters have bottled inside. This sudden outburst of violence at the end after a long slow buildup, doesn't feel as shocking as maybe it was supposed to be.Do not come to this looking for traditional comedy, you don't find it here. It is more what would be called a black comedy, or even a dramedy it just isn't in the traditional sense This film is extraordinarily absurdist, however, it doesn't get absurd enough. The closest Western relative I can think of, which really does have extreme and cartoonish violence, is ""War of the Roses"", a movie that does extraordinarily well in making you feel how horrible divorce can be using absurdities. ""Parasite"" also contains elements of a typical thriller, yes, there are some bad things and some violent things in it, but that does not equal a horror movie. It maintains a consistent tone throughout,with the exception of a portion in the middle and the end where it tonally takes some left turns, and these elements actually feel a bit out of place, in a bad way. Fir the most part, it blends the genres together and maintains a consistent tone.On the whole, I don't like this film, even though it is such a leap from ""Host"", which was mostly awful, and wildly tonally all over the place with downright awful pacing. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, sets it's tone from the beginning and it really never changes much, the pace also stays the same, and that is quite a feat. As previously noted, the predictability of the events in the film, minus a few blips here and there, makes it an extremely dull ride unless you've watched very few movies. I cannot fault it's technical achievements, but it is painstakingly dull in others because of its predictability. I would rather go watch ""Save the Green Planet'' again instead of this film, it is a much better example of absurd Korean cinema. With only a few events to really keep you interested it is impossible for me to recommend this, even the twists feel more like cheap tricks than an organic part of the story. Granted, I am not against gimmicks, but this movie is not deserving of 4 or whatever Oscars that it got, nor an 8.6. I can only guess it won due to Tarantino's incessant lobbying, he loves this guy's films.Don't buy into the hype, watch it if you want to, but don't accept the hype, scrutinize it endlessly, it deserves it."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,1/10,"First off the film is half and hour too long, most of the dialogue is simplistic and repetitive. how it won best screenplay is beyond me. the film has no heart or soul, we do not care for the poor family, as they are all self serving, uninteresting and as the title says parasites. they go from bumbling incompetents to master con artists, as other have pointed out the rich family are presented as really stupid, unaware of what is happening around them. the ending was just silly and implausible, mind you most of the film was like that. like shape of water, roma and others the film seems to have hoodwinked critics and audiences alike into believing that this is some form of great social comment and insight. IT IS NOT whilst it is good that a film from Korea has won the plaudits this has, it is also very indicative of the times that everyone has read into the film, when really what they are seeing is just not there"
PARASITE,19 January 2021,8/10,This family is so entertaining and real and the story is so so real and engaging and it has such a strong message about status and class!!! I really enjoyed it!!!
PARASITE,21 February 2021,1/10,"A movie without weight, with poor and rather unrealistic story, with childish directional mistakes, was awarded Oscar, I suppose, dictated by politics to the Academy according to ""politically correct"" idea.
Unfortunately in the real world of free people, artists do art and politics do politic.
Mixing them is disastrous.
I made the mistake not to turn it off after the first 8 minutes, losing 2 hours of my life."
PARASITE,22 August 2019,10/10,"Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. This film is a milestone for Korean cinema. Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.
""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."""
PARASITE,30 June 2019,10/10,"After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off."
PARASITE,7 May 2020,10/10,"Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the thingsVery intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)"
PARASITE,11 October 2019,10/10,"An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: ""Who is living of whom?"" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless."
PARASITE,18 August 2019,5/10,"Not sure why this movie score so high in rating. Been seeing korea drama many years, just a drama plus a movie call (US) version. No one in my cinema was laughing its lame joke,I prefer the US way of telling the lower class try to overtake upper-class story."
PARASITE,30 October 2019,10/10,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
PARASITE,20 November 2019,9/10,"I saw the film without any expectation. Sure, I watched the trailer, but thank god it was one of those rare unicorns that show the TONE of the film but do not anticipate the story line. Thank you for THAT, editors!Bong Joon-Ho mastered the art of slow character development, complex world building and creating subtle tension throughout the story... yet I did not know what to expect (remembering MOTHER and SNOWPIERCER). I just knew: there will be a GREAT story inside - and wasn't disappointed.Light, bright images, well constructed use of space and overall clean visuality suck us deeper and deeper into the character's game. They play it bravely, they risk it all. It never gets boring during 2 hours - many unexpected plot twists, executed well with the genre methods of suspense and thriller movies. He uses his main elements well. The story ends at a completely different point (perspective?) than where we started - I had great fun watching it.I am still not sure if there's a political message or social criticism hidden behind it all - for sure it shines a light on individual fate and visible (and invisible!) differences between the rich and the poor.Unexpected, thrilling and a lot to think about!"
PARASITE,19 February 2020,1/10,"PARASITE (2019)I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,,"How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years."
PARASITE,13 October 2021,8/10,"I had heard so many things about this film that I was afraid to watch it. People were extreme about it and I wasn't sure I wanted to have that kind of experience. I'm not into over-the-top stuff.At any rate, it so happened that I rented the film and because I live in Japan and have a Japanese husband, I knew we'd be watching it with Japanese subtitles. So, I read the script in advance -- and I have to say, the script was brilliant. It was a page turner. It was, in fact, I think, better than the actual film.Nonetheless... the movie was a unique experience and I had never seen anything like it. It starts a bit slow and you think, ""Okay... and...?"" But it quickly gains steam and starts running. That said, there were still moments where I thought, ""Get on with it!"" Especially the scene of the ""parasite"" family eating and drinking in the ""rich"" family's home, as if it it belonged to them. That went on and on and on.Also, the entire story hinges on two events; one is believable, the other is questionable. The first one is when a friend of the parasite family's college-age son tells him to take over as English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, because he's got a job (or something) and he will come back and marry the daughter in two years (or something). This didn't really make any sense, because if he really wanted to marry the daughter, he could have already put things in motion. Instead, he passes this job off to his friend. Granted the ""parasite"" son was extremely handsome and soon the daughter falls in love with him. The ""parasite"" son is very, very clever, and through him, he manages to get the rest of his family (his sister, his mom and dad) all jobs working for the rich family. It's best to watch the movie to see how this unfolds.That said, the rich family seemed awfully gullible, but on the other, it is conceivable that the things that happened could actually have happened.Basically, this is a black comedy and there are hysterically funny moments. But there are also shocking moments and mid-way through a huge plot turn that dictates how the rest of the movie plays out.All actors were uniformly good (the ""rich"" family's young son was not given much to do, so his acting ability can't really be judged), but to me, the best person in the story was the ""first"" maid, Lee Jeong-eun. She was really brilliant throughout and I don't understand why she wasn't nominated.I didn't see ""The Joker,"" but I did see ""1917"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" -- both superb movies, and also ""The Irishman"" -- which I detested. So, of the 3 that I saw, ""Parasite"" was definitely the most unique.I'm not sure this is a film I could watch more than once, but on the other hand, it might be worth studying.Very clever, very different. Yes, a bit slow in the beginning, and some questionable moments, but overall two thumbs up."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,7/10,"Good story that is fun to follow - 1 StarMemorable dialogue - 1/2 StarFeel a pull to watch it a second time - 1 StarMusic/Score stands out - 1 StarNo noticeable plot holes - 1/2 StarStory gets resolved in some way - 1 StarI personally like the story - 1 StarMemorable likable characters - 1/2 StarMost things about the story are believable - 0 StarsDoesn't get boring - 1/2 Star
This is an awesome movie that will hold your attention with a complex story and a lot of subtle foreshadowing. The characters are well thought out and the twists are constantly around every corner. I forgot I was reading after a while too the story speaks for itself."
PARASITE,1 August 2021,9/10,Absolutely incredible movie it has a little bit of everything but it's the ultimate thriller. It slowly ramps up and never lets off until the final moments. Even if you aren't big on foreign films or subtitles just give this one a chance.
PARASITE,1 May 2020,3/10,I agree with the reviewers who did NOT rate this as a 10. Incredible waste of 2 hours plus watching it. I don't even know why I gave it a 3 as I found nothing in it that really was of interest. How the Academy could give this Best Picture is beyond me. Ok I see it could get Best Foreign Film but NOT Best Picture. 1917 was a much better and well made film. If I wanted to listen to the babble of dialogue in this I just have to step onto the street of any major city or town.Another thing that gets me fumed these days is why credits are so small they can hardly be read. Even the title PARASITE is so small it cannot be read on. TV screen at least. And when will Producers realise RED CREDITS (not in this film) can never be read when shown on TV.I know I will be condemn by many reviewers on here but we all have a choice in what we want to watch. Actually I quite enjoyed this Director's SNOWPIERCER.
PARASITE,28 July 2021,10/10,"Standing out as the first non-English film to win an Oscar for Best Picture, this movie is both revolutionary as well as a thourougly fantastic picture.Combining black humour with a cleverly written narrative of a family tricking its way into riches, it manages to be both incredibly funny as well as shocking, tragic and subtle in the way it delivers its message.The actors are all fantastic and everything from cinematography to the cutting and scenery is outstanding.I am very proud to have seen this on its 2019 premiere, and will watch it many times in the future. The Oscars have evolved marvelously thanks to this beautiful movie!"
PARASITE,3 November 2019,7/10,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.7/10"
PARASITE,18 October 2021,10/10,"This movie is so traumatizing that I had to stop at one hour and resume its viewing the next day, but guess what: the second half of the film is even worse, in a GREAT way..."
PARASITE,30 November 2019,8/10,"The manner which the story is being told here, combined with some very intriguing characters, make this one of the best movies of the year. A lot about this film is very well done, from the acting to the shot composition. I also love the social commentary undertones. The ending is a bit unnecessarily violent, but overall this is a very good movie I would say."
PARASITE,25 October 2021,9/10,"This is a film that stays with you long after you've finished watching it. I still find myself thinking about some of the dialogue, realising there were little hints in dialogue and nuanced character actions that I missed the first time round.The story of a family of impoverished con artists infiltrating the lives of a wealthy upper class family in South Korea, but with a few unexpected twists and turns along the way!The story is a clever but straight forward black comedy, however everything about it is appealing. The sets, lighting and cinematography, especially in the house of the wealthy Park family are beautiful, and the actors playing the family of con artists are just brilliant.You want them to succeed even though you know what they're doing is wrong, at at times they're just terrible people.It's an absorbing film, you're either on the edge of your seat or chuckling as events unfold. At the same time, some of the social commentary is quite jarring which gives the film some depth and gives it more impact than a straight out and out comedy.Best film out of Korea since Old Boy, loved it!"
PARASITE,16 March 2020,9/10,Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.
PARASITE,27 November 2019,8/10,"The obvious question, which might not have an obvious answer, is who or what is or are the parasites in Parasite? Maybe it is easier to determine who or what is or are the hosts? The first hour plays as though Adam Sandler had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about the poor serving, or parasitically suckling upon, the rich, separated vertically so those on high do not, or even cannot, observe the filth of the lower classes as they struggle to acquire the most basic necessities, such as a good and free wi-fi signal.The second hour plays as though Sam Peckinpah had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about desperate times and desperate measures, uncertainty about belonging, and a lesson about the fleetingness of a good situation. The mood of Parasite runs somewhat tangentially to that of A Serious Man, a slightly anarcho-nihilistic tone that despite anyone's good or bad intentions, or even lack of intent entirely, there is a dark hole tugging at the back of our brains whispering sweet somethings of impending, unavoidable, and utterly passionless doom.Given this background, one might argue that there is no message, no meaning to a movie like Parasite. At the least, it is an investigation into whether a host or parasite can change its behavior for the better or for the worse."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,7/10,"The story telling, and general themes of the movie work and are worth its praise. However, I don't see how it won best picture with other aspects such as cinematography being good, through not amazing.The movie is enjoyable, though not for everyone. There are some light comedic moments, introspective reflections, and evening some thriller surprises. The movie works, but I can't say it was the best picture I saw from 2019."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,"In the year 2019, Parasite a
Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of
cinema.
The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie. I'll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more. The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra-ordinary. The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime. Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time, strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem. Hats off to Bong Joon-Ho & Han Jin-won for creating this masterpiece."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,7/10,"A poor family works their way into the lives, and the pockets, of a rich one.I enjoyed the movie and there are many good comedic moments and the families dramas are well played out. The shock ending isn't shocking because you've been warned by the cinema rating, 'strong bloody violence,' but there are still some surprises. It's typical of the better non-English films that make it into the English-speaking cinemas: quirky and original.You'll have heard all the reviews that say, 'I won't spoil what happens but, a poor family con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family.' Well; that's all that happens. How they get there is very entertaining and there are some twists but there's not much else to the story. It's good but not a ""perfect movie."" Palme d'Or ok, Oscar what?I liked, 'Do it clockwise.'"
PARASITE,23 January 2020,7/10,"The movie Parasite directed by Bong Jon Ho focuses on rich and poor, haves and have-notes. Unemployed and poor Kim-ki taek and his wife Moon-gwang live in very small apartment with their 2 smart young kids, son Kim ki-woo and daughter Kim ki-Jung who will go to any part, any height of apartment to get WiFi/internet connection. The conversation between son Kim ki-woo and his friend Min who wants him to tutor a rich girl Park Da-hye is very touching . Min sees Kim ki-woo as a weak competitor and prefers him to his smart, rich friends who may make advances on Park Da-hye. Then pretty, smart daughter Kim-ki Jung starts teaching Art to rich girl's younger brother Park Da-song. With lies and deceit, the 4 members of poor family end up working in same beautiful rich house owned by successful young man Park Dong-ik and his beautiful , simple wife Park Yeon-kyo. Differences between the rich and poor and the conversations between rich husband and wife describing smell from their new chauffeur are very touching. The constant reminder of class distinction keeps reinforcing humiliation and disrespect of the rich for the poor and the 4 family members from poor background lose control. Excellent Direction even though the story is far fetched. Entire cast did very well. 2hrs 12 minutes too long. Really got bored with story."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,9/10,"Poverty and prosperity, hope and despair, this is a story that profoundly reflects the bottom of society, absurd but realistic, human beings struggle in despair and look for beauty in hope. A liar family mixed into the upper class for making a living, step by step shocking. Borrowed space, deceived wine were all temporary. The rich surface is glamorous, behind the drug, the children are rebellious and morbid, and the poor put down the patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complex, human nature is difficult to ponder, I hope that fantasy becomes a reality."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,7/10,"Now it's the time to stop that longing, Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. Since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished. The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie."
PARASITE,23 December 2019,9/10,"Calling it a masterpiece would be an offense. This film offers a story that we have already bitten in the past, but in this way and direction: NEVER. Bong Joon Ho is confirmed as one of the most interesting directors of the decade and with Parasite he gets the global attention he deserves. The film is based on an impeccable direction, colorful and intriguing with a cast, as in a Cluedo-game, they are all perfectly characterized to ensure that the viewer never ceases to look intrigued at the work presented to him. Parasite proposes itself as a satirical film about a society that many times looks down on and beyond the impeccable narrative for cinematic pleasure, it offers us food to think on where we are going as a human race."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"I came here to say that the movie is decent, but getting pretty goddam overrated. It's a perfectly good watch, the plot revolves around a poor family worming their way into a rich household by getting the employees fired, but at this point, it won the Palm D'or at Cannes, Best picture and Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards, and no doubt collected a whole slew of other trophies and ribbons and participation prizes and good-job stickers pretty much everywhere else, but at some point enough is enough. It's good. Hell, it's perfectly decent. But it's quickly becoming one of the most over-rated movies of the past half-decade. ""Masterpiece!"" calm down, a little early to call it. give it some time. ""Phenomenal"", ""Amazing!"", ""Astounding!"", ""breathtaking!"", ""It cured blindness!"", ""It made my cancer recede!"". Every year you get that sort of movie and morons jumping on the bandwagon without giving it some space first. It's a likeable movie, but it seems like it could become one of those cases where it's gradually soured by the obnoxious fan-base overdoing it. Give it a watch, sure, but take the opinions of the easily-impressed with a grain of salt."
PARASITE,23 September 2019,9/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie on the big screen!The suspense of an entire family trying to weasel their way into service of a rich family is just the top layer of this movie about life choices, social class and the depths of what you're willing to do for your family."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"4 oscars? 4? For what? This is what you get when you falsly sue real movie makers and let amateurs work. I'm shocked seeing thos mediocre movie gets such praise. Did we truly lost our minds? This just shows how political everything got. 4 oscars for this? This is average B production movie. It is not comoplete garbage, but 4 oscars. You lost your mind."
PARASITE,29 November 2019,9/10,"Bong Joon Ho once again delivers a great film with unexpected twists along the way. Parasite is a film about a poor family of four that slowly but surely worms their way into a rich family, by mostly luck and subtle persuasion. The son becomes an English tutor to the rich girl, the daughter becomes an art therapist to the young boy who can't sit still, the father becomes the driver for the successful man of the house and the mother becomes the housekeeper for the rich family.It's a family affair of course and things are well for a while as their employers are none the wiser. Then the old housekeeper comes back and it's revealed that she has been keeping her husband in the basement for about 4 years. Then, well. Things go downhill from there. There are death and murders. Some accidental, some purposeful. But in the end, I think they had a semi-hopeful ending."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,,"I went into Parasite blind, I literally almost knew nothing going in and that was probably a good thing. Parasite is flat out a work of art. A lot of films can be considered brilliant or a masterpiece but this film is definitely one of them.Parasite is one of the freshest films I've seen in ages. It's a story which is executed so well. It's a work of art and the whole film is complex, funny and somewhat terrifying at times. Both the first and second half of this film are both works of art. It is one of the best written films of the year and of the decade.Everyone is terrifc. Kang-Ho Song and the cast are incredible. There is no faults in the performances. The cinematography is also absolutely wonderful and it's seriously well directed.There isn't anything negative to say. It's one of the best of the year and decade. It's whatever everyone has been saying and I wouldn't mind this winning best picture."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,8/10,"What a story... It's really hard to say anything without spoiling it but it is so worth seeing. Lots of of genres in one film. Amazing acting, a little gullible but within common sense/It definitely makes you think even though it feels like an interesting adventure with a little bit of a comedy but that's just a start... hold on to whatever your sitting on...It's gonna be one of a kind ride..."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,8/10,"South Korea, one of the colonial countries in East Asia, has a history of colonization."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film."
PARASITE,24 August 2019,10/10,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?
PARASITE,17 November 2020,8/10,"I would not rate this as the ""Best Movie of the Century "" like some hyperbolic reviewers. But. It is excellent and very well done. The story keeps you engaged throughout. I would rate even higher, but I thought the ending did not live up to the quality of the story which led up to it. Nonetheless, no arguments here about its status as the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the year. It probably deserves that title."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,8/10,"Pros:
Great emotional beats, the three family units were all well written and the actors were great at communicating their roles and motivations
Entertaining writing, the conflict in the first half was genius, while the second half was very unique
Lots of moving parts, small stuff contributed to a larger society or culture
Themes of class, wanting and deserving were expertly communicated, characters and story did a great job relating to them
Very pretty settings, well shot throughoutCons:
Second half is not as entertaining as the first
Morse code stuff at the end is a little sillyBest part: getting rid of the old housekeeper, height of clever writing, entertaining family unit, was a great exercise in making the viewer want bad people to succeed
Worst part: the mom threatening to involve the police with the underground people, I think they were trying to say the good life corrupted her to become a piece of crap, but it seemed out of character because of how quickly she responded like that"
PARASITE,30 May 2020,6/10,"It was horrible till we reached midway.
But I've to say this is the first Korean movie which has so much mention of Great Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
I frankly didn't like these kinds of movie.
I mean c'mon man, four members working in one house. Ka song was the favorite.
Father technically gives signals to his son and sort a everytime press same button.
How come he know that someone's getting it. If he knows, how come he pressed like he's sending the same signals?
Unanswered questions!"
PARASITE,13 December 2020,9/10,"This is one of the most well written movies I've ever seen, it was just great! The camerawork was amazing. I also didn't expect this movie to be nearly as funny as it was even with subtitles I still laughed a fair amount. I really enjoyed this and only have one problem with this movie and it's not that bad, I wish the it ended a bit earlier, just a few minutes. Besides that the only reason I don't give this a 10/10 isn't because I thought it was worse than others, I just won't give anything a 10/10."
PARASITE,12 June 2020,8/10,"I really enjoyed the plot.
Very clever.
The ending could have been a bit more in regards to the violence.
The most heartbreaking part of the film is when he is narrating the letter to his dad and then you find out it's just a wish.
Great twist."
PARASITE,9 October 2019,9/10,"I promise myself i wont get one myself when i'm older, for a good reason.Yes, One might argue there are plausible plot-holes, still the movie is easily one of the best thriller this year."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!"
PARASITE,21 January 2020,9/10,"Palme d'Or winner Parasite is a masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. That movie is so skilled. Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job. Actually I can't find any bad things to say about Parasite. It is great."
PARASITE,13 February 2021,9/10,"I mean from the first shot this movie is breath-taking, I saw about how Bong Joon-Ho storyboarded every scene in the film and it definitely payed off, everything about this film is amazing, the story is genius and as someone who knows nothing about South Korea it's really cool to see someone from that country making a movie telling people what it's like. I don't want to get into spoilers but I will say that the whole thing with the basement is just amazing. I loved this fil and everyone should watch it."
PARASITE,15 June 2021,2/10,"While the first part of the movie is quite interesting, the second part is just ridiculous and doesn't make sense at all. It's so obvious the twists happens for the sake of drama, which is so flimsy and laughable that WON'T HAPPEN IN REALITY, yet the critics fail to see that. Also the a lot of reviews are pretentious about all its meaning, which is such a joke, the meaning of this movie isn't deep its just complete idiotic, that's it. A ton of korean movies are better than this trash for a mile, like cold eyes, battle of Incheon, always etc just to name a few."
PARASITE,23 January 2020,8/10,"It is great. The comedy element is working across the movie, there are many unexpected resolutions of situations but in the end I find it containing too many unresolved moments / elements which might have some additional interesting spins.It's like the movie teases something really really complex and then resolves everything all of a sudden. It's good, but it could be even better."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,"Wow, I'll make it short and sweet. A must watch! Paradise is the best movie i've seen in a long time. Thank you for making this."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,9/10,"I'm a little biased in that I've seen all of Bong Joon-ho's movies and have a heart for Korean cinema in general, but I can say without bias that this movie delivers on the hype. I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"".Bong Joon-ho has a special talent for creating 4 dimensional characters, larger than the circumstances in the film and when the payoff comes for them it's likely to cause heart palpitations.Parasite is a film about grifters who invade a rich family's home, but this is no simple film about ""Oh no when will the family figure them out!?"". This is far bigger and far more shocking. Obviously it's an amazing movie. This little blurb is more here to be a warning. Gird your heart strings when heading into this."
PARASITE,27 November 2019,8/10,"I saw the movie Parasite quite blindly, I hadn't seen the trailer and had barely read the synopsis, but I knew that the director and cast couldn't disappoint me, and the interesting cover attracted my attention to see the movie.And I made no mistake. Parasite is a quite particular and diverse work, which is responsible for building a story original and charismatic, attractive and yet slightly disturbing, but in a way that leaves us a strong emotion at the end of seeing it. With a fairly solid and interesting start, the film takes a complete turn in half and becomes even more entertaining and fascinating than it seems at first, showing a quality good enough to attract my attention, the unexpected.However, it's not just the interesting plot, but the provocative narrative and beautiful cinematography that builds the characters in a deep and realistic way. Creating palpable characters full of mistakes and at the same time humanity. Finishing with a strong and emotional escapeist ending, a unique film that is sweetly welcomed into the small collection of original and fantastic 21st century films.PS: Korean cinema never ceases to amaze, how great."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,10/10,"Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,1/10,"When your daughter is stabbed or your son is unconscious, you won't focus on other's expressions or a man's smell. If you do, either you're a fake parent or mentally unstable.
This movie has very unreal scenes.
If you are nice, why are you eating other's jobs? If you are not nice, why are you letting old household inside?
This movie shows lower class people as dirty parasites, scheming & looting others. I don't think everyone is like this.Poor people can stab others but rich people can't even talk about a body smell?? That too with their wife, in private??? You listening to their private conversation in intimate moments, reading personal diaries, lying about yourself is alright because you are poor?You can't stand anybody peeing in front of your house but feel bad when your boss doesn't feel right about your smell.Carrying a rock alone in that basement was really stupid.
This movie made no sense at all after second half. I'm torn that joker didn't get Oscar."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,7/10,"I did enjoy this film and im not dissing it but it defo should not have won the oscar for best film in my opinion as i can name a couple that were much better films but if we all liked the same films it would be boring , saying that it is a good film good acting quite amusing and good story defo go watch if you get chance.....!!"

PARASITE,5 January 2021,10/10,"Parasite is, without a doubt, the most talked-about movie of 2020. It's also the highest-rated film on Letterboxd. Indeed, no matter the source, I had only heard great things about it and to say that my expectations were high, would be an understatement.Thankfully though, despite the popularity of Parasite, I had no idea what it was about. I knew, of course, that it was about the divide between the rich and the poor. However, as far as the plot or any significant moments went, I was clueless. As such, I want to start by talking about how unpredictable this film is and how drastically it changes tone when it needs to. While there seems to be significance in every moment and every shot, there were four moments that particularly stood out to me, or should I say four periods.
The first, and most obvious one, is the beginning. Those moments where we get to know Kim Ki-taek and his family. Those early moments of happiness despite struggle and despair. A family that, if nothing else, had each other. Those early moments were filled with a sense of longingness and intimacy, simplicity and even to a certain extent, hope.
The first tonal shift, and the beginning and what I would consider the second period, comes as Ki-woo, the son of the family, gets a job tutoring the daughter of rich parents. What follows is a period of deceit and urgency. Those previous tones are forgotten as they lay a path for a fast-paced, comedic period that promises a better life, despite the dangers associated. As the family starts to settle into their new roles, and as their lives start to change, the sense of despair turns into one of greed and ruthlessness.
While the first and second period were often humorous and light-hearted, the two last ones are the opposite. The second shift in tone and the start of the third period comes as the family learns of a hidden truth inside the house they now inhabit without permission. This is perhaps the most significant shift in tone, as it not only introduces a certain level of violence, but it also blurs the line between good and evil even further. It's also the first time where, despite how Kim Ki-taek and his family hope to see themselves, they have become what they once despised. They have turned from those looked down upon, to those who look others down. With this change in roles and tone, the film increases in tension and leaves a sense of uncertainty in the air. A sense that won't go away until the fourth, and final, period.
Indeed, the third, and arguably final shift in tone, comes as the family find their own home destroyed by a downpour of rain. It is after these events that Kim Ki-taek and Ki-woo, especially, turn into different people. They find themselves looking back at who they once were before they got a taste of 'the better' life. Attitudes change back to what they once were, and the actions fuelled by these attitudes are ones of despair and hate, hopelessness and spite.Now, as I mentioned, it could be argued that there is one final shift in tone at the very end. And indeed, it might be the most interesting one. Every action prior to this point was fuelled by self-interest and a sense of right to something, that others possess. However, as Ki-woo tries to find stability in his and his family's life, the actions, while still driven by self-interest, do not attempt to benefit from others. It is perhaps the most significant change in the entire film, which mind you is full of changes in the first place. It's a change that pits all the preconceived ideas against one another. No longer do the poor feel unjustly abandoned and the sense of hope that was apparent in the beginning returns. Despite everything that has happened, it's that hope that shines the brightest and leads to a promise of a better life.
The reason why I feel that those final moments are so significant is that the whole movie, prior, has spent its time creating a chasm between those well-off and those not. However, as it progresses, and ultimately reaches its conclusion, that chasm has diminished and blurred into one that can barely be seen. And indeed, by the final shot, it seems to have disappeared completely.While the divide between income classes is central to Parasite, there is an endless number of other such divides. Another central theme, and one that plays throughout, is the goodness of people. At no point is there any clear indication about who is good and who is bad. And interestingly, despite their claim to be bad and unkind people, it's Kim Ki-taek's family who is, at first, the group that you root for. However, as the story moves forward, and the lure of money turns into greed, it becomes clear that it might indeed be the rich family that we should be rooting for. And by the time the film ends, it's impossible to define what is good and bad, anymore. No one, despite their background and wealth, is just good or just bad.
But alas, as much as I would like to delve deeper and deeper into all the various examinations of human nature, there are so many to dissect that it would take me hours upon hours and days upon days to do so. Even on a first watch, there seemed to be so many layers to explore and unpack that, quite frankly, I'm a little overwhelmed. As such, it's no wonder Parasite is so incredibly highly regarded. It's not the type of film that many will consider their favourite, but there is no doubt about its excellence and perfection.Parasite is, without a doubt, one of the most special movie experiences I have ever had. It's a masterclass in filmmaking, but it's also so much more. Rarely can any film so honestly examine and depict human nature, let alone make it into a film that, while often heavy, is enjoyable. While it will never be something that I will consider a favourite, it more than deserves the praise it has garnered, and quite frankly, I can't wait to watch it again to see just how much I missed the first time."
PARASITE,25 November 2019,9/10,"This is brilliant satire. I laughed a lot, like a looot! The jokes are better than most comedies I've watched in the past 10 years. The story is captivating. There is nothing in this masterpiece that will leave you bored, dissatisfied, or wanting more. Bong Joon-ho has been on my radar for years, I've seen his best work and so far I have never been disappointed.There are only a dozen or so perfect movies, and Parasite might be among them. It's a comedy, a drama, a thriller, a documentary in some way. It's amazing. It's my favorite movie of 2019, and that despite Once Upon A Time in Hollywood being one of the best QT and 2019 movies. Do yourself a favor and watch it! It's an easy and enjoyable experience.I know lots of cinematically uneducated people think this is a pretentious, boring film, but their opinion is biased from all the ADHD, sugar and corporate advertising in their brains. They also don't like subtitles. Anyone who knows their movies will truly appreciate Parasite. Bong Joon-ho FTW![Edit: Looks like I called it early on, Parasite is officially 2019s Best Picture.]"
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!"
PARASITE,30 January 2020,7/10,I realized that the family's plot to replace all employees of the rich family when they plan to replace the driver. So the rest of movie is expected. Then the basement secret is really a surprise. Wish the ending can be more touching. Parasite: is the poor family or the rich family?
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film.
It will certain open many others for others to follow him.A must watch.PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,This movie lives up to the hype. It's a work of art. Every single element is perfect. Must watch!!
PARASITE,15 November 2019,9/10,"The window looks like a movie screen. At the outset, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho immediately evokes Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", the 1954 mystery thriller about the man in a wheelchair who diagnoses a neighbor's murder plot against his wife from across the courtyard of an urban apartment complex. On a subtextual level, photographer L.B. Jeffries(James Stewart) is a voyeur; he glimpses scenes from ordinary people's lives that were never meant for his eyes. Film theorist Laura Mulvey, in her essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"", linked with moviegoing with voyeurism. We like to watch, more or less, is what Mulvey surmised. When Lars Thorwald(Raymond Burr), the surveilled man, does nothing integral to the cover-up of his wife's murder, Jeffries naps with his body faced away from the mini-dramas unfolding in each apartment square. Ki-woo(Choi Woo-shik), in ""Parasite"", the 2019 winner of the Palm d'or at Cannes, would rather squint at a tiny screen, as demonstrated by the camerawork, a downwards tilt, in which we see the young man staring into his phone instead at the world outside from the sofa of his family's semi-basement apartment. Just like everybody else, Kim Ki-Woo would rather watch a movie on a five-inch screen, instead of the communal experience you get from traditional movie exhibition. But Bong, for the sake of contrast, replicates Hitchcock, with four voyeurs, not just one, watching a man urinate in their alleyway, a nod, perhaps, to Italian neorealism. Later, the same man returns to relieve himself, but this time, Ki-woo's college friend, Min-hyuk(Park Seo-joon), defends their garbage area with thrown bottled water. Both projections of liquid, the water and retaliatory pee, are subjected to slo-mo, transforming narrative into spectacle.Ki-woo is unemployed. So are his parents and older sister. To pay the rent, they fold pizza boxes; they copy the woman on the pizzeria's website. This repetitious task may look mundane, proletarian and unsexy, but there are people with fetishes, and these fetishists with a predilection for androgynous-looking women who convert cardboard into boxes are voyeurs, too. The Kims don't use Microsoft cell phones, but if they did, the Lumia would run Windows, an apt description of what Jeffries sees from his vantage point; open windows, which run in diametrical opposition to his rear window. Mulvery recognized that the photographer with a leg cast was a peeping tom. Jeffries ogles a woman he identifies as ""Miss Torso""(Georgine Darcy), who does calisthenics in what looks like a proto-sports bar. The moviegoer identifies with Jeffries; the moviegoer also likes to look at women in various states of undress in the dark. The ""male gaze"", as she coined it, because of wireless streaming, no longer, in filmic circumstances, is no longer confined to a theater seat; the female image went mobile and saw light. The woman who is good at making pizza boxes has no control over her own image.Min-hyuk tutors the girl of a very rich family. Ki-woo's old high school buddy needs a replacement, somebody he can trust, while the English-speaking student attends college abroad, in America. To get the plum job, Ki-woo can't show that he's overawed by his luxurious surroundings. At the Park family's domain, he has to be Ki-woo in italics, an actor; a cool customer. Yeon-gyo(Cho Yeo-jeong), the girl's mother, insists on observing Ki-woo conduct her daughter's first, and potentially, last college preparatory session. When Da-hye(Jung Ji-so) errs on a practice test question, the tutor grabs this rich girl's wrist with two stern fingers, and reprimands her for lacking confidence, which, in effect, levels the playing field for Ki-woo by being the man made out chutzpah, not money. Ki-jeong(Park So-dam), Ki-woo's sister, hired as an art therapy teacher for Da-song(Jung Hyun-joo), the Parks' young son, is even bolder; she banishes the micro-managing mother from the room. Yeon-gyo would never guess that this pair of young adults live in the ghetto. If she knew how disparate the socioeconomic gap between both families were, both Ki-woo and Ki-jeong would probably be fired on the spot. Along with the meditation on voyeurism, ""Parasite"" shares with ""Rear Window"" the depiction of class-consciousness. Although Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly), a Manhattan socialite, gives L.B. Jeffries an inferiority complex, this strained relationship withstands the photographer's emasculation, because the female fashion tastemaker, a seeming first lady of haute couture, believes that ""there can't be much difference between people and the way they live"". In ""Parasite"", however, it's not just class consciousness, it's class warfare, since money matters to both the Park and Kim family alike. Park Dong-ik(Lee Sun-kyun), an information technology firm CEO, talks repeatedly about lines that the ""help"" can't cross. The chauffeur, Ki-taek(Song Kang-ho), Ki-woo's father, overhears Dong-ik telling his wife that he smells; an odor which could be more metaphoric than literal. In ""Parasite"", all the compromises to fit in are made by the Kims, whereas in ""Rear Window"", it's Lisa who has to change, slumming she does, as exemplified by being interested in the book ""Beyond the High Himalayas"", for the sake of the fragile male ego. She has to remake herself in L.B. Jeffries image of an ideal woman. That's not how the world works anymore. All the splendor in this rich family's house turns the Kims into parasites.The window at the Park residence looks like a movie screen, too; and this window is in the backyard, a rear window. Nothing but green grass, a perfect lawn with tastefully chosen plants and flowers at its borders. But then, after the Park family comes home from a camping trip ruined by rain, Da-song pitches an Indian tent, transforming the performative soundstage into a western. Now there is a genre film waiting to happen, a western, just like how ""Rear Window"" turns into film noir, when he realizes the machinations of Lars Thorwald. The point-of-view shots in the Hitchcock film all come from Jeffries' perspective; the audience never sees L.B. from Thorwald's vantage point. In other words, Hitchcock doesn't employ the shot/countershot when Thorwald understands that somebody is watching his every move. Joon-ho, on the other hand, shows the Park house interior, not as a POV shot, but as a reverse shot; an omniscient one, in which only the real audience, not a diegetic audience of one, sees the melee between the Kims and Moon-gwang(Lee Jung-eun), the former housekeeper, and Geun-sae(Park Myung-hoon), her husband, who lives in a bunker secreted away within the house. Although Moon-gwang and her imprisoned husband share the same class status as the Kim family, the ex-housekeeper, who once doted on the house's famous architect, judges not just her former employers, but the help staff, as well, for being philistines. Moon-gwang narrates a flashback scene in which we see herself and Geun-sae not just inhabiting the place like riff-raff, but experiencing the living room as aesthetes. With a great sense of nostalgia and loss in her voice, Moon-gwang describes the sunlight, when it hits the glass, the reflection then casts a lovely glow upon the entire house. It's coded talk for celluloid. A reminiscence that is starkly contrasted to the mis-en-scene, in which the aesthetes and philistines fight over incriminating digital footage on Moon-gwang's cell phone. You can watch ""Rear Window"" on a cell phone.Ki-taek tells his son: ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. Because life cannot be planned.""Lisa goes off-script. Stella(Thelma Ritter), L.B.'s housekeeper, tries to stop her, after they discover no evidence to support foul play when they dig up the courtyard flower bed. She climbs the exterior staircase to Lars Thornwald's apartment. Lisa crosses the line, echoing Dong-ik's words, but in an extra-diegetic sense, as she transforms herself from spectator to subject; another actor in L.B. Jeffries' movie. He watches his girlfriend find proof, Ms. Thornwald's wedding ring, just before the murder suspect returns. Lisa's ad-lib results in the conviction of Lars Thornwald. Conversely, in ""Parasite"", the lay of the lawn is sandwiched between a rear window and, quite pointedly, rear bushes, where Ki-taek and his boss hide, dressed as Indians for Da-song's birthday party. Unlike L.B. Jeffries, his cross-generational counterpart, Ki-taek, despite being positioned as a voyeur among voyeurs(his wife and children), never was the spectator, because the relationship between spectator and subject is a fluid one, always interchangeable, the two positions. Technology transformed the world into a movie screen. The Park family is an aggregate of Lisa, but unlike the clotheshorse, Dong-ik, the IT CEO, especially, believes that there is a difference in how people ""eat, talk, drink, laugh, and wear clothes"". In the chauffeured car, Dong-ik sits in the rear seat, a barrier, but at the birthday party, hiding behind the rear bushes, without a visible barrier, Ki-taek knows that it still exists, even though they are dressed identically as Indians.The voyeur doesn't have to sit in a darkened theater anymore. It's not 1954. The voyeur carries with him a cellphone. The Park living room, metaphorically speaking, is the theater. But nobody has to be on the sofa to watch the ensuing melee, in which Ki-taek crosses the line and stabs his employer in the heart with a large knife. Films are mobile now. The voyeurs are in the backyard, close to the murder; spectators and subjects, sometimes one, sometimes both."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,9/10,"Performance: Both Kim and Park family members did brilliant job in their role. Kim family was full of cunning and witty one however Park family was simple and soft one. Both family depicted their side perfectly.Direction: Bong is the captain of this dark comedy with lots of thriller. Just like he baked dark comedy cinema as a cake and added thriller like a cherry on the top of the cake. Execution matters a lot when you are talking about top quality cinema and this is one of them.Script: This is the main USP of this movie. Although this movie available in the English subtitle, still you are able to relate and enjoy this cinema completely. Great showcase of the difference between elite class and poor people. Some small object played pivot role e.g. Smell, Morse CodeBackground Score: As movie flow, background score provided perfect combination to it. For this genre, great background score is key to entertain the audience.Last Words: Don't miss it otherwise isme tera ghata."
PARASITE,31 August 2019,9/10,"Last year we had Shoplifters which gave us a taste of how Japanese capitalism looks like, this year we have Parasite to show what South Korean upper class smugness looks like. Its a well deserved Palme D'or winner and potentially the first Korean film to taste Oscar glory this year."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,1/10,"I know it's unfair to review a movie after watching only 20 minutes. But I can't be the only one who won't watch a film if they can't buy the premise -- even if it's revealed later it wasn't what you thought it was. That the members of the family could be SO sharp as to insert itself brilliantly into a rich household but couldn't figure out how to get out of a dump where it's desperate for free wi-fi makes no sense. One minute they can't fold a pizza box and the next minute they're the best English and art teachers on the planet. None of the characters had any appeal, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. I know, I know...it tuns into this great revealing movie about class, etc. Maybe it's just as well -- I don't like looking at disturbing scenes, which this film apparently has no shortage of."
PARASITE,1 December 2020,8/10,"Devious , cunning , ruthless, greedy people. All the characters were amoral. I enjoyed the whole story very clever. Much better than I expected."
PARASITE,27 January 2020,9/10,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out."
PARASITE,2 September 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a bleak and harrowing movie, symbolising the ever growing gap between the rich and poor and the social class structure. The direction is superb and enticing as we follow a poor family attempt to infiltrate a richer family's household by posing as qualified individuals. Bong Joon Ho utilises subtle symbolism and metaphors throughout to further emphasise the unfair system between the classes, such as the rock that Ki Woo is gifted from his richer friend, the poor man who is 'literally' living beneath the wealthy, and even the title of the movie...All of the symbols used helped paint a powerful yet dark picture of Bong Joon Ho's main message. The camerawork and cinematography were genius in conveying the stark contrasts between the lives of the rich and the poor, whilst creating an unsettling and anxious tone, making us feel like parasites ourselves. The movie was incredibly cold and bleak, as we are conveyed the selfish and naive nature of the Park family, set against the backdrop of their extravagant lifestyle, in contrast to the Kim family who are fighting for their survival through their association with the Kim family. The plot twist halfway through was incredibly shocking, switching to an entirely new atmosphere and story with a whole different meaning. What began as a clever con-family scenario, turned into something much more disturbing and brutal, thus leading to a consequence that none of us could predict. There were so many little details and realms that were delved into during the movie, making it incredibly complex and thought provoking ; It felt almost like a puzzle where by putting all the pieces together you are able to decipher the main message. For example, I loved the fact that the Kim family were all presented as being far more intelligent and worthy of their roles than the Parks could ever be, and yet they were the ones who served them. It really showed us that it doesn't matter how intelligent you are, it's only your background that matters. The tragedy lies in the fact that Kim Ki Jung was a genius in art design and fraud, and could have easily made a career out of it. The ending was masterful ; It was unapologetically bleak and honest, and served as a powerful reminder that the class you're born into determines your future and dreams. The film was not only a clever insight into deception and manipulation within a sneaky family, but also a social commentary on class divide and the hurtful truth that remains in our society. Highly recommend!"
PARASITE,4 December 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho, the South Korean film director, producer, and screenwriter, is known for using social themes, mixing genres, and including black comedy with sudden shifts of tone in his filmography. Although Parasite (2019) is the first movie of his I got to enjoy, Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013) have been on my watchlist for quite a while. I should seriously consider watching them when I'll have the chance. One of his trademarks is that his films are socially and politically conscious and he displays that strong subject matter while using black humor and bold saturated colors. He's only the second Asian director to win the Oscar for the best director (the other one is Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Life of Pi (2012)) and the first one of Korean descent to do so, and I want to discuss the success of Parasite and why the movie is highly appreciated by most of the critics.Writing nasty but lovable people isn't an easy task, but Parasite executed this trope perfectly. The movie follows the Kims - a poor family, who makes a living by taking odd jobs, such as folding pizza boxes. Things turn around as the adult son Ki-woo gets recommended as an English tutor for a teenage daughter of an upper-class family, the Parks. That's when the long-con started to take motion - soon after, Ki-woo sets up his sister Ki-jeong as an art tutor for the Parks' youngest son then both of them land their father a job as Mr. Park's chauffeur and their mother a job as the housekeeper, while keeping the fact that they are related a secret to the parks. This mischievous behavior would be fraud during most cases, but over here - you just couldn't help but root for the family as the way they set this whole plan in motion is impressive, to say the least.
The other thing this movie managed to accomplish is displaying something that isn't common in popular media. The plot of a low-income family infiltrating an upper-class family is unheard of to me, and this new experience is a part of what made this movie great. Other than that, the other great factor is the way multiple genres, like family, drama, dark comedy, a political thriller, and horror are used here that question us what to expect from this movie and where the plot will lead. The serious major switch in the genre comes as the Kims have successfully infiltrated the home of the Parks and they take advantage of the upper-class family's absence to live in the mansion as if it was their own. Much to their surprise, the previous maid returns to the Parks residence and reveals that her husband has been living in their secret shelter for several years. Conflict arises between the Kims and the previous maid and her husband with Kims being held hostage. The situation quickly gets out of hand as the previous made is left in a critical situation back in the secret shelter, where her husband is tied up and the Kims have little to no time to clean up this whole mess as the Park are returning in a jiffy. This whole sequence, that consumed the middle of the movie, was the tensest part of the movie that shifted the mood of the movie while complimenting the plot masterfully.Bong Joon Ho is no stranger to burying political and social comments here and there in his films. Seeing how the poor family and the upper-class family view some issues, you can notice a drastic difference, which perhaps influenced the decision made by the father figure in Kim's family Ki-taek. After they narrowly escape being caught in the Parks residence, they return to their home, which is ravaged by the storm, and everything is flooded. They're forced to spend the night in the homeless shelter, while the Park sees the storm as a blessing, as the next day is beautiful and they can make an impromptu party for their son. They don't even think about those damaged by the storm and the Kims are all invited to the party, either for work or entertainment purposes. All is going according to plan until the husband of the previous maid gets out and goes all out on Kims'. After he stabs Ki-jeong, the youngest in the Park family faints (as he has seen the husband of the maid before, thinking it's a ghost, there was a whole sub-plot around this than I skipped over) and Mr. Park wants to take him to the hospital pronto, barely even thinking about the stabbing of Ki-jeong. Ki-take makes an unexpected decision and stabs Mr. Park out of the blue. Now thinking about it, a lot of factors that we're going outside the plot lead to this decision but it was more due to the social injustice than the actions of Mr. Park before the incident. At least I'd like to think that's what leads to the result.Overall, everything comes together perfectly in this film. What Bong Joon-ho accomplished here is a story with multiple layers that is entertaining without sacrificing its social commentary and themes of classism, social justice, capitalism, and greed - not only in South Korea but the whole world. It begins as a simple heist film unlike we have ever seen before, but it soon expands into multiple genres and takes a lot of unexpected turns. I want to applaud everything, the acting, cinematography, music, use of horror tropes, and all the messed up stuff that I'm not totally sure I understand yet, it all works together beautifully to bring an unforgettable experience."
PARASITE,17 September 2020,7/10,"One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards.
I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won? Not that amazing and the other nominations was not that bad. Academy Awards only well chosen on Actor and Actress awards."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,7/10,"It's a pity that Parasite is attacking inequality with the poor's wrong face and choice. This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film, because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper. The structure and technique of the film are shocking, but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand. If you want to say what it makes people think about, it should be the most basic respect between people. No matter what class, status, or situation, you can really treat the other person as a person, not those inferior ones."
PARASITE,28 November 2019,8/10,"Great acting and beautiful camera. Surprising plot turns and very good suspense that oftentimes gets released with a lot of humor. Crazy culmination and somewhat open end, not sure what the story ultimately wants to tell the viewer."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,5/10,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.
PARASITE,28 April 2020,9/10,"Watched this movie by renting from Google Movies.It is difficult to say the genre of the movie as it has elements of mystery, romance, thriller, dark comedy, sentiments etc.Story is very unique and exciting. It mentions about how the poor depends on rich and vice versa.A thought provoking movie. It will make the audience think about the movie even after it ends.There are so many hidden thoughts and meanings in the movie.Direction is different level and acting is great.There aren't much negatives.I would say the first hour of the movie is better compared to the second hour.Final Verdict: Must watch movie which should not be missed. A movie which can be watched multiple times."
PARASITE,29 June 2020,10/10,"Pros:A completely immersive film from start to finish - A Modern MasterpieceBong Joon-Ho's DirectionPerformances from virtually everyone was top notchEnding.. WOWCons:..... I don't think there are any hahaOverall, 'Parasite' is a tremendous thrill ride that everyone, never mind film fans, should see. If someone asks you what film you recommend they watch, immediately say 'Parasite' you will be doing them a big favourQuote - ""If I had all this, I would be kinder"" - Chung-sookScore 10/10"
PARASITE,28 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite first don't expect something beyond your thinking (Connection between human and money) this is top in drama category, Oscars Worthy? Hmm yes it is, what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn't lose it's value the original script that doesn't fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn't leave any real plot holes, showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting, emotional, and unexpected series of events from the three sides, surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings, wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes, if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category, every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie, highly recommended for drama fans, 9/10⭐"
PARASITE,10 May 2020,6/10,A normal film with a non-credible story that has been idolized by the masses for frankly no reason.2 hours where the best parts are one only: a beautiful italian song from the 60s.Assigning a 6 as total score I'm generous.
PARASITE,21 June 2020,8/10,"I liked the movie, but it's not the best of 2019 !!!
In my opinion 1917 should have won the Oscar for best film.
But this is a good and interesting film."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,9/10,"Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.Strong 4.5/5"
PARASITE,11 March 2020,10/10,"I loved it. LOVED LOVED loved it.
Wow just wow. Everything in this movie is just so damn captivating. Parasite was directed Bong Joon Ho and man....you sir...take a god damn bow. This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917. This along with my top 10 list is the best movies of all time. 10/10 Brilliant absolutely brilliant"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,8/10,"The movie is very good and very entertaining you will not feel boring during watch it
The ending was little dissapointed and the fate of some character was unfair"
PARASITE,1 September 2020,6/10,"This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,8/10,"Dear movie freaks, watching this Koran movie does not make you die hard Korean fans, so take it easy. This movie becomes popular in my country because the news telling that this movie had won Cannes Palme d'Or 2018. For the very first of the scene, it took us on the daily live of lower class in Korean big city, how they survive, how they are growing up, and how money comes to them. Then the audience will surprise with the originality of the story and will never know the ending. The movie has not plot twist, but still will make you close your eyes in some scenes. I believe all the actors here are very talented theater players, because the words, expressions, and how they interpret the story are so natural, then also will make you laugh in some serious scenes. The title ""Parasite"" will be understandable if you also concentrate on what the core idea of the Director wants to deliver, about being a family, a partner in crime, group of friends, etc. Even people clap their hands at the ending of the scene. Now my curiosity have been pay off and still I am wondering this movie could be new standard of Asian irony-comedy. Irony because of the originality of idea and comedy because audience can still laugh while Director put them in some critical scenes. Palme d'Or could be a very good step for Director career and also Korean film industry. So congratulation."
PARASITE,17 August 2020,10/10,"I was hearing so many good things about Parasite in December before the Oscar win but after it won the Oscar I knew I had to watch Parasite and boy was it a great experience. All the characters are fleshed out Bong Joo did a great job with the direction, the cinematography is top notch, acting awesome. The class divide story and the plot twist at some point (I won't tell you when go watch the movie) was all a great critique of the poor vs the rich and how they view each other. This film didn't necessarily have any heroes or villains just poor and rich and sometimes both sides are evil."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,7/10,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. I just don't see why it's soooo hyped. On the other hand, I appreciate this type of dark comedic movie getting recognition even if by the Academy. I stopped watching the awards years ago because the movies are sooo predictable or pretentious or big budgety but not a lot of soul. So by that standard, and the fact it introduces more people to the awesome world of Korean cinema, this movie is really good.The story is great, the characters were fun and you got to know each, and the acting was spot on. The settings were great as wel.I thought it was a sci fi flick, but I truly knew nothing about it. I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that. What I got was not disappointing. Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies. He's definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio.Again, very good movie. But won't change your life. It may stick with you a little afterwards, but it will fade so you can move on to the next."
PARASITE,7 April 2020,9/10,"This film got a lot of praise going into the Oscars season this year for not only being a commentary of society in the same way Joker does, but doing it through the lens of a Korean family. by doing this it forces the film to have a different feel from any film of its type. Many Americans don't understand the class system of other countries, and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel.In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods, and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it.There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it.Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,9/10,"This movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy,
This year the Oscar Awrd is very interesting, there are wonderful movies and Parasite is one of them"
PARASITE,2 November 2019,8/10,"I have not seen such a movie that is so bold and daring in its originality in a long time, and that helps make this the most gripping cinema of the year, more so than any Hollywood horror and thriller movie.Though the movie is not without flaws, such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists, the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience.Toward the ending, I had to think to myself, ""This director (I could not quite remember the name, but will memorize following the end) is a genius...whatta crazy movie"". That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality.I don't know about the political, social and economical situations of South Korea, but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe, Australia and North America, without losing the tonal cohesion and heart-rending message of supposed inequalities.Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade, and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative, mildly, subtly or obvious. It's also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift's work, on par with ""Joker"".Certainly, Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me, but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon-ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist, and no one else, not even the veteran once-great-turned-hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann, can try.Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot. I did not even watch the trailer, and I assiduously avoided reading the reviews prior to this screening. The astonished thrills and incredulous disbelief at the directorial and storytelling ingenuity are worth it by watching this film blind without advance knowledge.*** 1/2"
PARASITE,15 November 2019,8/10,"That was my reaction. Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected, much darker, almost surreal direction.The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family. Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist, who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up. Mom is solid and practical, a one-time high school track star, who keeps things together. The mid-20s daughter and college-age son are smart, quick, glib and nervy, willing to do whatever it takes, but they don't seem to have found their footing. They don't always agree, but they stick together.The Kims live in a cramped, squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street. The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria, none too competently. As we meet them, they have just lost free wi-fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router. Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal. They do, up on the ledge where the toilet sits. That's Dad's strategy for life in a nutshell.Deliverance arrives in the form of Son's high school buddy Min, now in college. Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family. He's going to study abroad for a year, and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back. Min intends to start dating the girl when she's old enough, and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute. Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam, and Min assures him that he can bs his way through.The rich family, named Park, live in a gorgeous, spacious modern mansion on a hill, formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris. The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times. Mrs. Park is described by Min as ""slow,"" which isn't quite right. She's an oblivious but nice lady, more ornamental than useful, who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son. You might call her street dumb. The same is true of her husband, who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is.The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money, and they think the world works the way it's supposed to. Park is always concerned that the family servants ""don't cross the line"" into familiarity. He and his wife assume that anything American is automatically first class and, to show their sophistication, they pepper their Korean conversation with scraps of English the way Miss Piggy uses French.With the help of a diploma forged by Daughter Kim on Photoshop, Son aces his interview with Mrs. Park and gets hired to give English lessons 2 or 3 afternoons a week. In short order, he and the girl are also making out when Mom's back is turned. Son sees the boy's weird paintings pinned up on the fridge. He suggests to Mrs. Park that the boy could use art therapy and that he just happens to know an American trained art therapist. Mrs. Park swallows the bait, Daughter Kim bluffs her way through the interview with a combination of arrogance and art therapy buzz words she's picked up on the internet, and in short order she's having regular sessions with the little boy. Now that they're through the Parks' gate, the Kim kids manipulate things so that the chauffeur gets fired and is replaced by Dad, and the housekeeper gets fired and is replaced by Mom. They never let on that they're all related. The Parks don't have a clue. When the little boy notices that the new driver smells just like his art teacher, Mr. Park brushes it off because all the people who ride the subway smell the same.""At the halfway point, this has just been an amusing and quite enjoyable story of the clever, scrappy poor putting one over on the clueless, entitled rich. The Kims are making a very good living off the Parks and eating better than they have in a long time. Of course we know that the Kims will somehow screw up this honeypot and be threatened with discovery and disaster. Things do spiral out of control, but in a completely unexpected way. I can't say how without a major spoiler; let's just say that the Park mansion conceals some extraordinary secrets and that the injuries that the Kims have inflicted come back to haunt them. Their struggle to stave off detection starts as slapstick but gets more and more desperate, and it builds to a climax that you don't see coming but is completely foreshadowed and leaves you wrung out. Definitely worth it.One sidelight for American viewers. Mr. Kim and one other character have each gone broke in the ""Taiwanese Cake"" business. I googled that. It turns out that there is a pattern in South Korean life of fads giving rise to a large number number of opportunistic but undercapitalized small businesses that fail when the fad runs its course. Taiwanese Cake was one of them, the equivalent of the US cupcake fad of 10 years ago."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,8/10,"On one side is a flooded room and on the other is a birthday party. On one side is the icy and hard stadium and on the other is the luxurious soft back garden. Money is an iron, which irons everything. They scour the net, live in the basement, and do whatever they can to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, they are even worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into three, six, and nine. This wall, standing in the wind, the sun and the rain, stood still. The Park couple looked stupid, but they were still getting richer and richer; the Kim Ji-zee family was clever but couldn't stand up. You thought you could get a good job, get a good salary, and get rid of your poverty status. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that is already in the blood. You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone's basement. They are bugs, so they have a hard life; they are bugs, so nothing kills them."
PARASITE,28 November 2019,6/10,"Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,9/10,"This is one of the rare times I whole heartedly agree with the Oscars. Since I saw this film yesterday, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and it still have left a feeling in my gut and its visuals still lives in my mind. This is what movie making is all about, it's artistically beautiful, it's entertaining, it manage to capture your attention and is interesting and thought provoking. It makes you feel and think, simple put.It reminded me a little bit of Get Out, even if very different movies also. I haven't seen that many Korean movies, 5 perhaps, and some of those are some of the best movies I've seen, so perhaps should check out some more Korean movies? And Kang-ho Song has been in 3 of them I've seen, so I must believe he's a very famous actor in South Korea, but I wouldn't know. Anyway, the cast of this movie is fantastic, a bunch of very likeable actors, that portrays the absurdity, darkness, drama and comedy of these characters and situations, in an excellent way. This movie is entertaining because of the absurdity of the situations, that these people come to be within, but also still so impactful, beacuse it at the same time it all feels so realistic in a crazy way. The film, with all it different events and character projection, flows perfectly and also with beautiful, just delicious cinematography and set design. Some visuals of this picture will be in my mind for a long time.And, off course, the underlying meaning of the the film, as I think everybody knows by now, even those that haven't seen it yet, it's about class, poverty VS wealth. Something that has been going on in this world for thousands of years. As present today as it ever been, I suppose. The gap between rich and poor, it is very much a gap, that alienate the classes from each other. And what this film so intelligently does, is that it isn't hitting you over the nose with this message, it's just there, embedded in the story in an obvious but at the same time sublimely way. I think that's masterfully done by the director, beacuse I think that's a hard thing to acchive. To make such a strong comment on society and the human condition, without being obvious or preachy. Just beautiful actually.There is sympathy and distaste to be found against the personalities in both familys, with distaste perhaps being a bit of a strong of a word, their human, their very very human, and you can understand both sides. Humans are selfish by nature and both sides just does what's in their best interest. No one sets out to be, or wants to be, immoral or evil, people just live in their own worlds, their own bubbles, and only cares for their own immediate occurrences and problems. Why wouldn't they? Why shouldn't they? Not being either rich or poor myself, I can relate to both sides in this movie. This movie also portrays so well, how different these lifestyles are. How the living conditions of the poor family (don't remember their last name) is just straight up unhealthy, and how secluded and oblivious the luxurious conditions of the rich family is, from the travasties of the poor, the contrast of these two extremely different living conditions is shown again and again, but mostly by imagery in subtle ways, but also so obvious in their subtleties, so it's even more obvious and impactful. On top of that, the film is dark and humorous for entertaining purposes. Witch great acting.And also, without giving anything away, how the occurrences unfolds towards the end, is not only to give the movie an entertaining and impactful climax/conclusions. It also portrays the real tension of the underlying currents these gaps and problems in society creats. How the big differences and separation of living standards for people, can lead to drastic and devastating outcomes even. But think this movie can probably be interperted in many different ways, and these are just my own interpretations."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,10/10,"I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure."
PARASITE,20 December 2019,10/10,Parasite is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2019.
PARASITE,25 March 2020,9/10,"One side is the flooded cabin, the other side is the birthday party.
On one side is the cold, hard gymnasium, on the other side is the luxurious, soft back garden.
The money was the iron, and it smoothed everything out.
They surf the Internet, live in basements, and do whatever it takes to get a job.
Just when you think they're bad enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they're not the worst, there's worse.
If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you. If you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you.
The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into groups.
The wall stood immovable despite the wind, sun and rain.
Mr And Mrs Park look silly, but they are getting richer.
The Kim family is brilliant, but they still can't turn over.
You think a good job and a good salary will lift you out of poverty.
You can wash the sweat out of your clothes, but you can't wash the smell out of the basement where it has melted into your blood.
You've climbed ten floors, twenty floors, and you've probably just arrived in someone else's basement.
They are worms, so they have a hard life;
They're bugs, so nothing can kill them."
PARASITE,12 February 2021,10/10,"I'm a guy who was born in 1961 and had never watched a film with English subtitles before.
"" What An Entree "" & what was I waiting for !This film is fantastic in so many ways.Quite simply, devote your time to this, it is a must see."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,7/10,A fascinating story really. It just gets truly absurd towards the end and pretty much ruins what held out great promise.
PARASITE,22 April 2021,10/10,"This movie was really good, interesting, unique, engaging, etc. Then the second half hit and it became phenomenal. I knew nothing about this movie going into it and I think that's the best way to go into it. I actually thought it was a sci fi/horror thing based on the title. It's not. It's socio-economic commentary, which I'm sure doesn't make it sound interesting but it is an absolute must watch. Up there with Oldboy in quality."
PARASITE,18 December 2020,8/10,"It's easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars. It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,4/10,Prepare for a big letdown if you fall for all the hype on this one-long and slow and extremely pointless and downbeat. Avoid.
PARASITE,27 January 2020,10/10,"Movie starts off with a very intimate portrayal of the poverty and the vigor of the first family. Mastery is very evident.The rich family is portrayed next with just as much intimacy and depth.The story starts unfolding, the deviousness is a bit disturbing when it begins. Intimate portrayal is about showing everything, not just the stuff that gets the audience to like the protagonists. Bong Joon Ho is ruthless in his script and making.The excesses of the rich is contrasted sharply with the abysses of the poor.There is so much to this movie that the various departments of the movie like cinematography, music etc don't make it to the plane of consideration on the review table. Shocking movie. Must watch. Amazing content, amazing execution!"
PARASITE,1 December 2019,9/10,"This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It's one of the best of the year!"
PARASITE,20 January 2020,1/10,"It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar.The primary flaw are the subtitles. The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English. Grammar is out the window. Literal word translations miss the meaning. Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them.The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists. The overall plot is clear by the movie's end and decidedly unremarkable.The cinematography is excellent. The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan.Overall rating a one ... of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree. Don't bother watching this unless you understand Hangul."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is slow to start but an enjoyable movie that takes you on a ride. It is a contender for the awards definetly and even though it won I am happy it did as I don't think there was a huge choice to be made. This year for me it was Joker, Richard Jewel and this.There are some flaws but overall a wonderful piece of cinema beautifully crafted."
PARASITE,18 July 2020,3/10,"Can't believe it won both foreign and america best film.
Some sloppy writing for instance. The Kim family is drunk in the Parrks home..All of a sudden they become sober. They throw glasses and bottles on the floor, then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it. When the two kids are under the ottoman hiding, theres no sign of broken anything. Also, the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years (why) and she's been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years. Then when she returns she can't open the secret door so the Kim family can see her. How did she manage all the years before this particular night. The film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed. Again, sloppy writing. The premise is good but the execution is bad. Oh, and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock. He recovers with nary a scratch. Again, poor writing. Movie makes no sense. On the plus side, the acting is good."
PARASITE,9 June 2020,6/10,First half does everything right and keeps you intrigued and laughing simultaneously. The second half and finale of this movie leaves you amazed that someone can botch such a work of art simply by not keeping it simple and consistent and opting for an attempt at a deep shocking firework conclusion. Rookie mistake. By giving this a 10 out of 10 you are simply dropping your standards and succumbing to media bias.
PARASITE,17 April 2020,10/10,"Hollywood's ""foreign"" classifications should be immediately done away with. What does the designation tell us about this extraordinary movie to call it ""foreign""? Foreign to whom and in what way? Yep, I get it, not made in America (Hollywood) and not in English. That designation means nothing used for a movie of such universal themes so easily accessible to the viewer. The director has observed the Kurosawa principle about balancing all the elements of the film's language, in addition to keeping to his own approach of keeping the narrative and dramatic aspects simple. Even with subtitles I was laughing out loud at the humorous bits. Can western movies claim that when they're subtitled in other languages? This sublime simplicity results in a movie so finely calibrated that it wipes out in one fell swoop the tiresome arthouse talking head cinematic tradition of the west. The South Korean film isn't ""foreign"", it's smack in the middle of a filmmaking tradition that respects the story, the viewer and the very medium of film. Think Kurosawa, again. How sublime in their simplicity are his movies? Critics carry in about what genre it is? What political and sociological commentary the director is trying out. None of that matters when a movie is so tonally pitch perfect. The ""change"" of pace about half way through is so seamless, one gasps long after the last frame that it couldn't possibly have gone any other way. It's the power of the impeccable story telling via the medium of film that elevates this movie above the fray.
Editing, acting, cinematography are all pitch perfect. Hollywood, go cry in your pretzels, with your endless commercial blockbusters and franchises. The centre of gravity has shifted and you are now the ""foreigner"" while the South Korean holds court in the center of the global cinematic universe. Thank you for giving it the ""best"" picture award full stop. It is one of the greatest films of all time in its tone, seamlessness, simplicity, and both the humour and tragedy of the human story it depicts. A great, great, great cinematic experience. Ten stars barely begins to convey the greatness."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,6/10,"Spoiler free review: My family watches 75% Korean shows so I'm very familiar with what's on offer here. Is 'Parasites' head and shoulders above 99.99% of what the country produces? Yes. Does it have a cool twist? Meh, I saw it see more as a sudden a genre change well towards the end of the movie. Is it accessible to western audiences? Absolutely, but we'll never know if we missed anything from the original korean.But ultimatey it's a very light hearted comedy for 1h52 hours, followed by comedy horror for 5 minutes, and drama for 10.Expecting a deep social commentary from SK is like expecting a critique of the CCP coming out of China. At no point is the 'system' that created the situation depicted criticised in any meaningful manner. There was far more depth in 'the platform'.Enjoyed the goofy, light hearted laughs, the heartwarming , well depicted family interactions, and the dramatic bittersweet ending. 6/10"
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."
PARASITE,25 July 2019,10/10,"Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,8/10,Sticks to you and sucks you dry till you drop out in confusion asking what the hell did I see.
PARASITE,22 March 2020,8/10,"For an average movie afficionado, I have to admit that while I liked Parasite, aside from the obvious I had to read up about the movie in order to fully appreciate the message it wanted to convey. On the surface, we know what's it about: the story about two families from extreme ends of the social ladder. The Parks with their high-tech mansion and luscious front yard that hides them from the outside world and the Kims with their sub-basement apartment and a window that allows them to look at their sad reality just enough to keep fighting and surviving. What is not obvious though is the why. What transpired in the movie is believable, but the why is what makes the difference. Maybe it's a cultural thing, where here in the Philippines as depicted in soap operas a million times over the Have-Nots are automatically nice people, hopeful that things will get better as long as they keep working hard. Meanwhile the Haves are depicted as calculating and manipulative, taking advantage of those that they can. In Parasite, it's the other way around. And this is very evident when the head of the Kim household commented that the Parks are rich but still nice. To which his wife countered, they are nice because they are rich. That money makes living easy therefore they are not as stressed, that's why they can afford and have the time to be nice. Which is true. I related to when she said that if she had what they had, she'd be kinder too. Of course it's not automatic though and there are always the exception to the rule.Everyone were well-casted most especially Choi Woo-Shik (Fight for My Way) as the young Kim with whom the chain of events started. I mean I know I'm supposed to hate him but the combination of his cunning and naivete makes him appealing to me and even to the Parks. Cho Yeo-jeong as Mrs. Park was also a standout, playing a balance of a simple yet hands-on head of the household. You may also notice Lee Sun-kyun (The Coffee Prince) as Mr. Park and Park Seo-joon (Fight for My Way/ Secretary Kim) in a supporting role. The last character of note is the the Parks' house itself. It has a personality of it's own, commanding your attention whenever you're within it's premises.Winning the 2019 Cannes Palm D'or award and besting 20 other foreign films, submitted to be South Korea's entry for Best Foreign film at the Oscars, a 99% Rotten Tomato rating and 8.5 in IMDB, you can not go wrong with this movie. It was well-written, the ""infiltration"" of the host by the parasites flowed naturally. The cinematography was beautiful, charming even in the squalor of the Kims' situation. For all that Parasite tried to do, at the end of the day the world appears the same, but it has definitely changed. For the better or worse, it will all depend on the next set of people assuming the roles of hosts and parasites."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,5/10,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10
PARASITE,22 January 2020,8/10,"What a great movie. No words. For very long moments I was so immersed that I forgot I was watching a movie. The plot is greatly crafted. It always moves forward and escalates. When the story requires it, the tension is remarkable. I think the father's reason to kill Mr Park could've been established a little clearer, but anyway the movie is great."
PARASITE,22 November 2019,10/10,"At first sight I gave 10, but being close to the end of the movie I was thinking...""no, no 10, but 8"", because I doubted how they could miss what was with Moon-gwang, and then the story mentioned what was with her and I moved back to 10. :) The whole concept is great, from the story, music and photography to acting and style. Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially."
PARASITE,28 October 2020,7/10,"I watched dozens of Korean and Japanese or Chinese movies. I am aware that to fully enjoy them, you need to understand the culture of the country and you can't just judge it, based on your own culture.
Keeping this in mind, I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. My ex and my friend considered it ""boring"", but they usually don't appreciate subtle storytelling.I wouldn't say that the movie is boring. Parts of it reminded me of Bin Jip (the parasite aspect of living in someone else's house or family), a small part reminded me of the family in ""The Host"".I understand that the movie is about money, about social class, etc. That being said, I do feel the movie is a tad overrated. It is by no means a bad film, I did enjoy watching it, especially how good the family is at conning the family so easily and how blind their ""host"" family is to their true intentions (take for example that the youngest son actually did notice the morse code and could have prevented things, but his father or mother are so distant from their own son, they didn't even bother to check his Indian tent).This is a typical Palm d'Or movie, like Suzhou River. It rewards the patient viewer, but will bore those with short attention spans who can't appreciate subtlety. Personally, I think ""The Wailing"" is a far better Korean movie anr ""Brotherhood"" the best I saw so far. Parasite is good, but those who know Korean cinema will see that although good, this movie is barely above (Korean) average (which says a lot about the high quality of Korean cinema though)."
PARASITE,21 June 2020,5/10,"I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"SYNOPSIS:
A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.REVIEW:
This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film.
POSITIVES:
As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance.
NEGATIVES:
Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10.
CONCLUSION:
This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,1/10,"I kept waiting for something to happen...wow, really? Someone living in the basement? That was the big reveal? You didn't need two hours to drive home the point that rich people think they are better than middle or low class. It was a two hour long snooze-fest, you should have just made the title ""eat the rich"". It would have saved us all time."
PARASITE,7 December 2020,10/10,"Fully deserves the best picture Oscar this is the best film of the last few years and easily in my top 10 of all time, it's truly a work of art."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,7/10,"A very different film. Parasite is one of those movies that you'll probably not watch again. Once you've seen it, there is really no need for further viewings. It's not entertaining enough. It has some pretty good twists, but there not like twists in Us, Sixth Sense or Book of Eli where on second viewing things make so much more sense. It's more of a twist like in the first Saw. The movie is also a little slow. The first half is funny though, and it's always very intriguing. Good acting, great cinematography and a good ending. I understand all the hype the movie has and I think it's a good movie, but in my opinion it's not phenomenal."
PARASITE,5 December 2019,10/10,"This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,1/10,I assumed this movie would be good because it won an Oscar but it's just overrated anti-capitalist tripe. Don't bother.
PARASITE,23 February 2020,10/10,"I don't what to say about this film apart from how this film is masterful film making. I don't even want to give a synopsis for this film as this film is best experienced with no knowledge whatsoever.The plot is amazing and extremely gripping with every twist and turn. Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie.THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,9/10,"I saw this on Hulu and I must say this was definitely worthy of all the critical (haven't seen 1917 and loved Once Upon a time in Hollywood and JoJo Rabbit; 2019 was a verynice movie year)/commercial success it has achieved. Most Americans don't bother with foreign language but hopefully this will help to alleviate that. The melding of differing genres kept me intrigued for the duration, definitely worth watching again!"
PARASITE,19 February 2021,10/10,Amazing Movie. The movie depicts the grim reality in an unusual funny and sad way.
PARASITE,20 February 2020,7/10,"Curiosity about this film - two families - one very rich and entitled and one very poor with little hope for the future. The poor family appear to be street smart and the rich just more entitled. Slowly the entire family become entwined with the rich based on lie after lie.
As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens.
The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home.
The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not.
I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no."

PARASITE,13 January 2020,9/10,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
PARASITE,7 March 2021,10/10,An engaging and thrilling masterpiece from the great Bong Joon-ho.
PARASITE,28 November 2021,10/10,"The movie is great movie, unique and exciting. I just think it was too hyped up. I believe this is first time Americans saw Korean Thriller. That could be the reason it won so many Oscars. I can name several other Korean movie with actually same Actor in it, that are better movies. Don't get me wrong this was great movie and I really really enjoyed it but the way every single person made it into the greatest movie they've see ...well it's not or probably those people haven't seen enough videos. It's fun and exciting movie it's a must watch for any movie lover."
PARASITE,7 April 2020,10/10,"A great movie with outclass direction,Script,Story,Acting,Music all was too good,even before this movie south korea produce many masterpiece but we surprised win first time Cannes Prestigious ( Palm Di""or Award ,France) BAFTA( UK) Australian Academy award,Golden Globe , Screen Actor guild award & Oscar award etc this the only movie was in Oscar(2020) was tottaly deserve to win Best direction,Best movie,Best orignal script award"
PARASITE,18 March 2020,7/10,"As the plot progresses, the differences between the two families become more apparent and the concept of ""parasite"" becomes more acute.Bong joon-ho's genre films are remarkably transparent, part modern fable and part family drama from a distance, while up close they oscillate between satire, dark comedy and thriller, deftly managing transitions and shifts in style.Uzan's big house has played a huge role in spatial design and vertical positioning -- highlighting the upper and lower classes of society.The use of stair, window, insect, rainwater, sewage also is very advanced.As the name suggests, bong joon-ho once again proves that genre films are real movies, and that popularity is closely related to the author."
PARASITE,20 March 2020,2/10,"The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar."
PARASITE,7 January 2020,8/10,"The Stream: Are you going to complain that this is a foreign language film? Okay, fine.The Big Screen: Completely surprising at every turn.The Final Bill: Enjoy the ride.Trip FontaineParasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies. It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters. Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix, Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about... well, this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don't want to spoil anything. Um... it's about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur.There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal.A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I'll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors.Parasite is an absolute must see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,3/10,"Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month, also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to."
PARASITE,12 November 2021,8/10,"Parasite has received rave reviews, it appears that no one is willing to say anything against it. I thought it was fantastically enjoyable if you want to just simply follow the plot - full of tension and fully fledged characters. There is also an entire other layer that one can see the film through though, so this appeases the thinking crowd too. I must admit that I thought the second layer was not always clear about what it was trying to say. However it is clearly one of those films which is MEANT to raise more questions than it does answers and that is fine (though can be frustrating for some). Ultimately it is one of those films that is difficult to mark down from a technical or artisitic or even entertainment standpoint. However, it has to be said that it is not hugely emotionally affecting. And this is not necessary a fault. But in my opinion for a film to be 10/10, despite its technical brilliance, has to be emotionally affecting and really make you feel something and teach you more about yourself and other humans around you. Parasite doesn't quite do this which stops it form being in my list of favourite films. But I fully respect it is an excellent movie (entertainment) and also an excellent film (art)."
PARASITE,18 December 2020,,"Like everywhere else, there are the successful and the not-so. In this film, the bottom dwellers (the Kim family) live in a basement suite and do odd jobs. One day, they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family (the Park family).In typical Asian manner, the employers don't check job references or do a criminal background check. Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview. Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships.Naturally, the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs. Park. Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants.Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement. Preferring self-imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground.Eventually, there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them. Bringing death to the Park family.Excellent direction and acting. Quite convincing.Like the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this film offers insights into Confucian society. About ideals and the failures to meet the standards."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious."
PARASITE,9 November 2020,4/10,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as:What happened to Ki-woo's friend who went abroad? And, what did he make of it all at the end?Why did Ki-woo's father do what he did at the end?What was the point of the love interest between Da-hye and Ki-woo?.... the questions go onIt's all a little silly really.The film will appeal to:
Supposed 'film critics' (i.e. the type who claim certain wines go with certain foods) who more often than not follow the norm of other 'film critics'.The 'eccentric'Millennial's who:1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign.2. Think being 'politically correct' is a political party.3. Think transgender-ism is choice not a biological state.If you haven't seen this, you're not missing much."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of the decade and my 2nd favorite film. It's not as simple as it looks. It has hidden meanings and metaphors. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the screenplay, all were excellent. I didn't see any flaws in them. Maybe, for the first time, a deserved movie won the oscar for best picture.So, the story is basically about how a poor family makes their way to become the servant of the rich family. Just like how a parasite attacks their host, they attack the rich's house. The whole film is filled with metaphors and easter eggs. You must watch at least 2 times to understand the hidden meaning. Well, even if it's in korean, the subs are okay and you can live up with em.The film tackle the class division with a satarical tone. It's a must watch"
PARASITE,3 April 2020,2/10,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.
PARASITE,28 June 2020,4/10,"... that his movie was not for me. But i can see how this is my problem and not the problem of the movie. I love immersion and the movie did nothing to immerse me in any way.But who am I to judge? I don't know anything about cinema, I only watch movies for entertainment. And this was just not entertaining for me."
PARASITE,13 September 2019,8/10,"Unusual but interesting story with great characters.
I'm still uncertain if this is an excellent or just good movie. On the other hand I have no doubts it still keeps my mind busy with its twists, drama, subtle humor and hidden messages.
In conclusion:
If you like korean filmography you should definitely take the time to watch it."
PARASITE,15 August 2020,,"The film was ok, I think a LOT of people tried to read into it too much and find way too much symbolism. It was ok for a movie to watch when you can't find anything else."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,6/10,Subtitle were a bit hard to follow. But overall unique and creative. Deserves best picture.
PARASITE,6 April 2020,8/10,"Parasites and hosts, inferior migrants and upper classes, masters and helpers, basements and mansions, south and north Korea. Parasites are always contained and marginalized, and hospitality and hostility go hand in hand. Binary opposition, there is always a third party in it. Third party intrusion and interference, resulting in the old sequence collapse, system reset, balance collapse, course deviation. < / p > < p > Kim family while the host left home, carnival feast, before the housekeeper wen light to ring, interrupt the party. Another group of parasites showed up to stir up the situation, just as the Kim family had previously expelled wen guang and Yin drivers. < / p > < p > park jubilantly for his son's birthday, invited guests, wen guang husband with a knife, the parasites fight, the last feast sounded the death bell, the guests scattered, the main guest died. Kieser has once again replaced his predecessor, hiding out of the shadows. A true parasite is often an intervening third party, like a third party in love, inhabiting a relationship and disrupting the original pattern. Only the parasite can crowd out another parasite, says saihoe."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"It seems like a simple story,but really makes me think a lot.Human nature is complex,we can't understand it completely."
PARASITE,18 April 2021,5/10,They all smell the same.It's the semi basement smell or the subway.Point of this movie is - don't get greedy.It doesn't take money to be nice.Who gives a cleaning service all that info ?!?!
PARASITE,10 February 2020,2/10,"So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar."
PARASITE,23 March 2021,5/10,Give me a break! That should be a film which deserves 4 Oscar's? Heavy handed directing and foreseeable script! Sorry don't get the hype! Only good thing: the film makes you uncomfortable!
PARASITE,17 March 2020,9/10,"Bathing in the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the darkroom will only lead to flesh and blood. Holding the stone of poverty can not be sold for life, and the smell of cheap can never be eliminated. Bedbugs curled up underground, using potions to open windows to sterilize themselves; hosts on high, using money to hire people to sterilize themselves. The rich suck the blood of the poor and rise, the poor live in the rich man's house, the ghosts share food in the same room, and the worms parasitize and develop enmity."
PARASITE,26 November 2020,8/10,"Most people will be intrigued as to how this movie won so many awards before they even watch it. Most people won't watch as they can't be bothered with subtitles.
It's worth it.
A well constructed story of a family scheming to live off another family. It's fun as the story unravels with a comedy yet sinister fashion.
Great acting all round with a decent script, remember its subtitled but you get used to that and its not that demanding to read and the acting being that good makes it very easy to follow.
Parasite is a refreshingly different and keeps you watching with some twists and turns that make you wonder how its going to end.
Its well worth a watch and you'll enjoy."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,2/10,"How in God's name this got an Oscar is beyond me. Starts very well as a concept and even holds ones attention for the first hour. After that it becomes simply daft and corny. In fact it becomes pure Kari On. Definitely a big mistake to throw Oscars at it, I'd throw Soy Sauce. Give it a miss."
PARASITE,14 July 2020,7/10,"It's like the world, for the first time, found a box of Korean movies. Having never seen a Korean film they eagerly grabbed one off the top and watched it, and said, 'oh my God, this is the best thing ever'. My advice is to keep digging in that box. There's a lot more that are a lot better in there."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,9/10,"Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies."
PARASITE,24 February 2021,6/10,"I was looking forward for Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. there is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.
but I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.
The actors do a good job. it is watchable to kill time.yes. some scenes are fun. yes. some people claim, it is one of the best movies of the decade. really? for sure, it is not one of the best of the decade. not a bad movie by any means, just overrated."
PARASITE,17 October 2021,7/10,"Parasite is one of good movies directed by boong joon ho, but I think the best from him was ""memories of murder"" movie, and this movie is number 2.The lead character acting was flawless, especially kang-ho song. He the only one that brings thrill to the story.I think this movie is lighter than memories of murder, but i think more people like it. I think parasite a little bit overrated."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,10/10,This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.
PARASITE,6 January 2021,10/10,"This thriller from South Korea shocked the world in 2020 when it became the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn't necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy: a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive. When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family, their situation suddenly turns around. As a result, events turn upside down.Contrary to other mainstream films, in which the main - supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through, in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level. All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something. If you had to pick a stand out, it would be Kim Ki-taek as the father of the poor family. His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches, but once he comes out of his shell, he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability. But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho. Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker, he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate. Not only is the ensemble of actors spot-on, but everything else, from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well-chosen dialogue, he has done everything right with this film.Parasite's success should never have come as a big surprise. Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years. Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach. In parallel, there is also the influence of other genres, such as drama, mystery and even some action. It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes. The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well. Sometimes discreetly, but mostly transparently and very clearly. This is especially thought-provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact. Wonderfully acted, grandiose direction and many genres colliding - Parasite is perfect and rightly the best film of 2020!"
PARASITE,2 April 2020,,"The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,8/10,It was great. It wouldn't call it a masterpiece since I'm familiar with his work. The Host was clearly more entertaining to be and it was still imperfect so it'd be unjust to give this more than an 8 since it was great but not perfect and not the most entertaining work of the director.
PARASITE,23 May 2020,7/10,"It's straight up an exploitation thriller, where the equivalent of korean rednecks, finally getting their chance to exploit and abuse the well to do. ( which in this movie is not even portrayed as being amoral or deserving it in some other ways )filmed well, acted well, good thrills, but as expected in this genre, a shocking ending and a messy denouement.But nothing specialfor professional and amateur critics to comment that this is a rumination on class struggle, oppression of the poor and the comeuppance for the rich, just shows that they either never watched the film and allowed whatever political prejudice they have to write the film criticism for them, or that they are easily swayed by these professional critics."
PARASITE,15 February 2021,10/10,"Draws you in with a scheming family trying to make it and unfolds into an incredible and biting film of social commentary. Using a brilliant embedded visual metaphor of vertical space for class relations, there is always more underneath than what you see. The film has a pace that reaches fever pitch and packs a punch of shock and serious reflection."
PARASITE,1 December 2019,1/10,"Before watching this film, I wondered and strongly believed that the title ""Parasite"" referred to Kims' family - an obvious choice for them being the ones feeding on their host (and rich) family. But the hopeful ending (for Kims) made me realize that Bong Joon Ho does not see Kims as villains. He imagined this movie as a class warfare. And like any war, this one had the winner too - the Kim family. Apparently, for Bong this movie is about the shortcomings of (late) capitalism.And I am here thinking how is capitalism the villain in a story of a murderous, cheating, fraudulent family of Kims who decide to get rich at the expense of others (i.e. work in a non-capitalistic way). But in a world where socialism is on the rise; where the poor demand the rich to pay for their living because why not; where an individual is responsible for everyone else but himself/herself this movie is the type of crap that would sell."
PARASITE,4 July 2019,8/10,"Parasite probably is one of well-advertised Palm D'Or recipient when it is commercially released in my country, even some of our famous directors like the movie. However, after watching this movie, my friend is confused because she can't point a finger about what's the topic of the movie.Advertised as ""tragicomedy"", Gisaengchung probably doesn't have a firm genre to stand with, since dramedy is heavily used in the first half before continue the movie with more thriller solution. In the surface, we understand what's this movie about. A poor family starts to ""leech"" on a rich family without told that they are one. Some scenes provide laughs and eerie feeling, but it's not escalating until the second half, when more bloody scenes are showing, but not with much explanation.Since the second half aren't that long, I found that as an audience we must dissect the nature of the action, making a real difference than the light first half. When thinking, I slowly understand that this movie is a rich vs poor act that have to be buried because it will makes chaos. The chaos, gives a ""dark"" approach to the theme, but sugarcoated with some tragic and comedy nature of the movie.The dissecting itself what maybe can't swallowed at one time like my friend. Unfortunately, upon having the realization, this movie doesn't give me that much impression like the others say. Nevertheless, it's still a highly recommended viewing option."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,A good movie with no jarring flaws. The only trouble I have with it is that it could've been better. I'm guessing a lot of the film's subtlety is lost in translation because I wasn't overly impressed by all of the metaphors. I feel like I got a firm grasp of everything that went on and what it meant while I was watching and it hasn't left much of a lasting impression on me. I could be failing to see things but I wish it was a bit more dense. I kind of think the movie is a little overrated and think that some people like it so they can say they like foreign films.
PARASITE,30 August 2019,,"This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."
PARASITE,25 December 2019,4/10,"The Rich. And the Poor. In this one the poor family is neither fighting for their rights nor are they fighting for their future. They try to go along as the parasites of a rich family. I guess, this script shows perfectly, how a saturated generation X sees the stereotype of poor people in today's times. Nothing to like in this movie. The story is inhuman in every sense."
PARASITE,19 December 2019,10/10,"With this tough genre mix, South Korean cinema has created a masterpiece. The complex and fascinating examination of the class struggle once again underpins the ingenuity of its director Bong Joon-Ho."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,9/10,"If you're poor your place is the bottom. You can fight and win sometimes, but you'll stay at the bottom. Even if you get to be ""up"" for a while, that won't last. And when you make a plan, that plan won't work for long. This film is powerful."
PARASITE,28 June 2020,8/10,"This story shows how possible is making a low cost film with great results. It is simple, but the trama is original. Well, not so original but very well directed. This film represents the low-income people of Korea, as any other country has its social problems, and let us know how far people can go when facing hard times."
PARASITE,4 November 2021,9/10,A poor family all scam their way into the service of a rich family. It all seems like a madcap caper and then the film just turns into a terrifying and unpredictable thriller. The middle part of the film is set against a heavy downpour of rain. The flood sequences are very impressive. Very good film.
PARASITE,2 January 2020,8/10,"When it comes to social satires, directors often push their awareness to the viewers as if they are unaware they are preaching to the choir. Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" will definitely agree with the director's populist political stance. Now only if someone would've told him that as well.Without spoiling, I can tell you that ""Parasite"" is definitely satisfying. This is a thriller calculated to the nano-meter, equal in precision, pressure, unease and focus. It revolves around Ki-taek and his family--poor, unemployed and living in a ""semi-basement""; some sort of small place halfway underground. Forcing the metaphor, I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear-cut line between the lower and upper classes. They are poor, which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive. So their plan is to ""attach"" themselves to a rich family.For the sake of not spoiling, I will stop here. But know that ""Parasite"" touches on every single social point it tries to make. It is a well-defined story of class and the lack of social awareness. This works in the first half of the film, in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented. This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which, by definition, is a ""simple story"". But if this heavy-handed approach pays off, by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary, inexplicable, sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage.""Parasite"" is undeniably cutting-edge and modern. Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity. Throughout its complexion, it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place--a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,3/10,"Gorgeous, memorable, and even startling cinematography, but surprisingly underdeveloped as the ""deep"" character and class study it pretends to be. Depressing nihilism. Director/writer clearly has given up all hope of modern civilization ever rising above the swamps of despair and manipulation. That's his right to an opinion, of course, but in this particular film his vision feels simplistic and seems to exist for no other reason than to provoke and wallow."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,8/10,"This whole film reminded me of ""10 clover field lane "" . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the ""parasite "" or someone is to you .Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone ."
PARASITE,17 January 2020,9/10,It was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why I gave it a 9. The only con I had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and I had an ending playing out in my head that I thought was going to happen and thought it would be great. I was way off course. Which is also a great pro at the same time.
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,People can be parasites is what is it about this film and have lots of messages!
PARASITE,5 November 2019,7/10,"Many plot holes, illogical scenes at times...
i was hoping for a better plot twist, to be honest.."
PARASITE,1 June 2020,8/10,Parasite ...the life of a poor family when they get a place where they were wishing and willing to get ..the poor who livetheir lives in the dream that they were dreaming forever..excellent screnplay in every inch of the movie..unexpected climax ..
PARASITE,12 January 2020,4/10,"I just cannot understand the reason for such a high rating this movie has got. It is a less than ordinary movie.
A family getting employment using fraud means and in the process kicking out the honest ones. No laughing matter.
And the violence they unleash to stop getting exposed, is hard to comprehend.
The old housekeeper is killed mercilessly by this family to protect themselves.
And in the end, when one of them kills his own employer, whatever the reasoning..it spoilt to all.
The second half and esp the end are horrible. The movie made no sense."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,7/10,Let's make this quick. For a korean movie it's an absolute 10/10!! All day baby.Now comparing it to all movies ever made.....it's a 7. And I'll say a very solid 7.I'm glad people are loving on it so the Korean film industry gets more recognition. I think they are doing great things and soon some truly wonder greatness will pop its little head up out of there.
PARASITE,29 September 2019,,"My rating: A-plus.
(Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)
Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
PARASITE,31 December 2019,5/10,"This movie is not a ""masterpiece"" by any means. And all the apparent hype it's getting? Why? Is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an ""American film""? (That is, trying to be an American ""genre"" film?)THE GOOD:
The actors are good.Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.THE BAD:
We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, ""Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a ""what if."" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry."
PARASITE,6 May 2020,7/10,Short and simple review: I had fun watching it but I don't see the greatness. It was somewhat original and the actors did a fine job yet I'm still trying to figure out why it swept the Oscars. Not a bad movie but far from top 100 material.
PARASITE,3 November 2019,9/10,"There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking. Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,9/10,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."
PARASITE,4 June 2021,2/10,"Parasite is a shockingly overrated film that provides no likeable characters for the audience to root for. If anything, the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of. This can be forgiven, movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride. There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character. I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film. I know I am in the vast minority here, as every other person I have talked to loved the movie, but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is already an International sensation now, the four oscars are icing on the cake.I used to watch dubbed versions too, but from last 3-4 years i am watching movies only in Original language and with subtitles.I will suggest everyone to do the same, avoid dubbed version and watch in original language with subtitles (Intitially it can be tough to read but you will catch up soon).As director Boong Joon Ho famously said ""Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,""
Talking about the film, Parasite is kind of a revolutionary film.The first half seems like a smart con movie, but 2nd half is a big surprise. It talks about class division, discrimination on poor. It talks about limits the poor can go to live a better life and earn some money. Boong Joon-Ho's direction is flawless, the story is relevant to international level.I liked it very much.Asian movies needs more recognition Internationally"
PARASITE,20 October 2019,,"Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches."
PARASITE,20 October 2019,9/10,"""Parasite"" is freaking awesome.It is a comedy, a family drama, a thriller, a horror, a political comentery, a social drama, a an action piece, you have to watch it to believe it. It is just every cool, fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter, some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet.The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone. The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle, the framing, the long shots, it is just so fun to watch. The lighting is beautiful, the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone. It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made-up story.The soundtrack is another thing to praise of. Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film, the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie.The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits, I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle. You grow with them and graually start to care, in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions. Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot.The humour is there mostly during the first hour. It is seet and it feels genuine, it what family members would talk and joke about. It creates an intimacy and a fun time. Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go, it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment...and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible.The political comentary is perfect. There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed... ""Burning"". Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way. Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way. In the movie, we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow-minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all. It is what ""Us"" went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way. The ritch use the poor and the poor try to become the ritch. You either leave in a fancy house with a garden and a maid or in the ground floor with insects and a smell. It is like two different words that slowly destroy each other.
I will not say more. Watch this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I laughed, gasped, fell into thoughts, I was moved and always wanted more. It is a genius fraud, it has several ""peach scenes"", a crazy artistic kid, a birthday party and just make a plan and go watch. In fact, don't make a plan. Just watch it."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,8/10,"This is one of the best movies of this year , what i like about it is that from the very beggining until the end you never blink an eye , the events getting more exciting as you watch , and the idea of the movie is brilliant , classism in this movie is perfectly displayed and the idea is different , i really enjoyed it and highly recommand it"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,4/10,"Two families exploit each other with dire consequences. Beautifully shot and well acted, but devoid of emotional engagement. Little comedy, horror or tension and at no point did I care about anybody involved - which amounts to a wasted trip to the cinema, in my book. Very disappointing, given that it beat some truly exceptional films to the Oscar."
PARASITE,10 December 2020,9/10,"The Academy is generally hestitant to give the Award for Best Picture to a foreign film, and this movie was in fact the first movie with foreign language to win Best Picture. Did Parasite deserve it? Yes, yes it most definietly did. The direction is amazing, there is so much meaning and symbolism conveyed through simple imagery. This of course ties nicely into the script, which I think is exceptionally well written. The characters are wonderfully three-dimentional, and the contrasts between the rich family and the poor family are pretty interesting to observe and think about. This movie's greatest strength however, is the way it portrayes the differences in the lifestyle of the two families, and how the moral boundries differ from person to person. Watching the plot unfold is endlessly entertaining and engaging. The movie also manages to juggle all the symbolism with a pretty straight-forward story line, and how it manages to be powerful and funny at the same time is beyong my comprehension. The one thing I didn't completely like about this movie was the ending. Not that it was bad in itself, but the way many character arcs were scrapped annoyed me a little. I know that that was the purpose, to showcase how plans fail and all that, but I still wanted a few characters to get better conclusions to their arcs. That is practially my only real complaint though, and it's not nearly enough to ruin this fenomenal film. It is almost the complete package, it's a wonderful mix of comedy, drama and thriller, and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes movies."
PARASITE,20 August 2021,8/10,Everything is well done and well thought out and the actors wow the scenes wow the movie wow.
PARASITE,2 September 2019,9/10,Complicated but beautifully told movie. The struggle for getting a better life for the Kim's (Parasite) family is shown strongly in this movie. Very very good movie. When will Indonesia could make such a movie.
PARASITE,23 September 2020,9/10,"The dialogue fits the rhythm and pace of movie very well.
I have seen many movies with subtitles .... some work, some don't.
The scriptwriters did a great job and probably knew they had a global hit.I am glad I didn't do any research before hand.... Like a Sherlock Holmes movie.... The journey is actually better than the ending.
Enjoy ..."
PARASITE,30 March 2020,6/10,"Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public.
In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is.
The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.So I just watched Parasite too.It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess.
If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.Other factors of the movie are no special neither.Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all.
For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,9/10,"The powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. Parasite clearly portrayed what class division in a society. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!
Highly recommended if you like korean movies."
PARASITE,3 August 2020,10/10,"Outstanding balance between arthouse and mainstream. Solid acting, impressive direction, beautiful shooting, intense narration, unconvetional humor and story development. Brilliant."
PARASITE,29 March 2021,10/10,"Starts as a brilliant, tightly constructed comedy drama, and becomes something totally different and extremely special. Watch it as blindly as possible. Can't wait to see it again in black and white."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,5/10,"Engaging and bonkers film that is worth it for the adrenaline alone. The film had so many good performances and the charcters were well developed. The sequences and reveals throughout kept me engaged. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of the story that unfolded as it got unfocused but it was very enjoyable. The impression I got from reviews is that it is totally unpredictable and unique. I didn't get that impression from watching the film as it included plot arcs that I have seen in other films. The ending is pretty hard hitting though and one that I won't dare spoil. Please seek this one out if you can, it is very much worth your time."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,9/10,"The acting,the story, the surprises and tension of the film is amazing. Shows the poor side of South Korea as well and the difference between rich and poor is ironically presented in many scenes. Watched 2 hours in one breath. Applause for this movies to creators."
PARASITE,3 November 2019,,"A parasite is a metaphor for a human who uses another human for their personal gains.From that point of view, not only the poor are the parasites of the riches, the riches in some way are the parasites of the poor.My advise: Go blind. Enjoy the ride."
PARASITE,25 October 2020,10/10,"Top 10 movie of all time. The movie is hilarious and tense. There are no short cuts in life. Actions have consequences. And, family is really all one has in the end."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,10/10,"I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got ""Snowpiercer"" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend."
PARASITE,5 March 2020,2/10,"I couldn't wait to watch this film after reading several 10 ratings reviews before, but after watching it today I've been compelled to agree with almost everything the 1 stars are saying here today.The film did not live up to being a great Korean film, or best anything, and especially not Oscar worthy, where the only thing I enjoyed about this film was that view from their living room because the plot was an insult on a few levels.And I'm not sure if anyone else had the same issues I had with the subtitles being extremely small to the point I was squinting trying to read the lines while watching it on Amazon Fire tv. That was a first for me, nevertheless, I understood enough to know that this movie was highly overrated!What a huge let down, I think I want my 4.99 back."
PARASITE,1 October 2019,10/10,"It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece."
PARASITE,9 December 2019,6/10,"I thought it was a well made film, decent twist at the end but it's no where near as much of a ""masterpiece"" as some fanboys are making it out it be."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,10/10,"This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite will go down in history as one of the best comedy and international films of the century.The film stars Korean celebrated actor Song Kang-ho as Kim-taek the head of a poor deprived Korean family living in a basement; with his wife and two children.
The film tells the story of a poor family living in a basement without access to basic utilities. The head of the family is Mr Kim. He wants the best for the family. But he cant afford the cost of university education for his intelligent son, Kevin and brilliant daughter, Jessica. Min is a friend of Kevin. He also wants the best for his friend. He recommended Kevin to take his place as a tutor. Kevin became the personal tutor of Da-hye, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Kevin was able to grab this life changing opportunity. First he brought in Jessica as an art teacher. The two worked intelligently and perfectly by bringing in their dad and mum as driver and househelp respectively. But nothing is so perfect in this world. What would happen it comes to knowledge that they are related as family?
The film is set in suburbs and high class residential area in a typical Korean city. This gives it the affluence versus poverty touch that underlines the theme of the film. The script was suspenseful and full of excitement. The performance of Song Kang-Ho was spectucular. He blended emotions with intelligence. Directing wise, individual performances raised the bar.Everyone knew what they were doing and delivered with aplomb. The quality of the film's video editing gave it a polishing and glossing visual impressions. However, I was not impressed with the films dialogue. It did less than enough to convey the theme of the film to its audience.
Paraite is going to be a film you would not quit watching. It is emotional and funny. No matter how hard life maybe there will always be a time to laugh. And if you want to laugh very well, then I recommend this film for you."
PARASITE,14 December 2019,9/10,"The stories about the social classes, have been interestingly often explored in the books, television series, movies and so on. Especially to see how the main characters, would get through their difficulties by facing them, in the line between poverty and wealth. These stories often explore the theme about hope, to see how the main characters, who have so much will in their souls, would try in all the way to help their family. Some of these stories would end, with the main characters who become wealthy, to help their family with satisfaction. Other stories would end with the main characters, who are still struggling with what they are facing to, without losing any hope even it would take a long time to accomplish something important. The auteur filmmaker Bong Joon Ho have been interested, in making a story which explores this theme. As the audience have been really curious, what the new movie of the filmmaker would be about, once it has been announced. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Parasite by Bong Joon Ho with Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik and Park So Dam. The movie's plot: The unemployed Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) takes the opportunity, to work as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park Family. Then Kim Ki-woo would slowly bring his whole family, his father Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho), his mother Kim Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin) and his sister Kim Ki-jung (Park So Dam), to get each of them a job in the Park Family. Until something unexpected is going to happen, to get a dramatic consequence. From the beginning to the end, the movie would surprise the audience, through the most unexpected twists, especially if something wrong is going to happen, then the Kim Family must find new solutions to not get in trouble. In the same way, the movie gets emotional to see how the Kim family, is so united to never let anything to divide them. The monologues and dialogues were elaborated, to see how the main characters would find new plans, for what they are looking for. Also to let the audience feel the deep meaning of the dialogues and the monologues, especially between the Kim family when they talk about important topics. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in ever single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, to make the sequences look like paintings needed for the Mise en scènes. The editing was specifically elaborated for the narration's rhythm, without ruining it, as well as to build tension in the most unexpected moments. Song Ka Ho was extraordinary as Kim Ki-taek, who would be then the one to tell his son about the meaning if it is necessary or not to have plans. Choi Woo Shik was excellent as Kim Ki-woo, who once works for Park Family he would try to make sure his family have a better life. Chang Hyae Jin did a very well done job as Kim Chung-sook, who would do anything just for her family and not for anybody else. Park So Dam was excellent as Kim Ki-jung, who in the course of the story would just do whatever is necessary to take important decisions. The score by Jung Jaeil was elaborated, to let the audience feel the thrilling moments as well as the emotional moments, to be unforgettable in every single musical notes. Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019, as well as one of the greatest and most unique masterpieces of all time."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,10/10,"This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,"Just like most movie goers, I didn't know what the plot was about. Despite the urge to google it, I stayed away. Now after watching it I realized I still wouldn't have been prepared for what was ahead. A fast paced thriller centered around two families. Like two sides of a coin, they're polar opposites, yet they are crucial for the coin to spin.Along with the unnerving feeling you have trying to figure out this movie, it's also filled with a lot humor, thrill and some family drama with a social message that is cleverly stitched into this feature. Brilliant acting and amazing set décor and intricately designed sequences make this a classic on its own.A masterpiece by director Bong Joon Ho. He has his own directorial style and this movie is probably the best of them all. Adopting certain aspects from all his other movies while creating a uniquely critical film for ages to come, he has added his name into the directors hall of fame. He won the Oscars for best director, best original screenplay, best international film and best picture matching a 67 year old record set by Walt Disney.If you plan to watch it, don't read about it, just latch on to the host and don't let go."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,"A well crafted film that does not confine itself to a genre. Equal parts thriller, drama, comedy, and suspense. While it is a scathing indictment on classism, it does an amazing job of condemning the institution and not necessarily the individual. It is in identifying with characters that Joon-ho really exposes the psychological hold economic class has on the individual and society. The pacing is brilliant, always engaging and playing with tempo nicely. Loved it."
PARASITE,18 June 2021,9/10,"A friend recommended this to me. I was excited to see it as it won Best Picture at the Oscars two years ago, but I was also a little hesitant because I am not the biggest fan of subtitled films and sometimes Oscars simply reward the wrong movies big gold.Well they got it right this time. In fact the movie is so good that the subtitles certainly didnt bother me and added to my enjoyment of it.Lots of people I am sure will dismiss this film as a boring flick that the Oscars went nuts over but I say please trust the Academy on this one.This film is not slow by any means it remains entertaining throughout with very witty dialogue and situations and fine acting.If you are not a fan of dark humor you may want to skip this one as there is a lot of it but if you are it doesnt get much better than this.Highly recommended. It doesnt disappoint."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,2/10,"After seeing all the glowing reviews I feel like I am in an episode of the Twilight Zone. This movie was awful. The only reason I even gave it an overrated 2 is because it was weird. I like weird but this was goofy weird. Most of it didn't make any sense at all. The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself. The poor family couldn't even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight. Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after - they let him attack the mom and they don't even try to help her. The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn't even try to help. Then instead of attacking the attacker, he runs over and kills his boss! It make no sense whatsoever. One of the most bizarre and goofy movies I have ever seen."
PARASITE,7 April 2021,9/10,Moive tell about different between poor and rich people status how rich people think about the poor peopleThis moive great and masterpiece 👍Watch moive with family also.
PARASITE,22 April 2020,6/10,It's a good movie. But nothing so great. LOBBYING SHOULD BE BANNED in any film award process for impartial decisions.
PARASITE,25 March 2021,8/10,"I did enjoy this film, but it didn't strike me as a worthy Oscar winner."
PARASITE,26 November 2019,10/10,I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.What a film.
PARASITE,15 April 2020,9/10,"With his easy control of time and space, Feng Junhao's interlinked parasitic relationship between a poor and a rich family constitutes a social fable of the ""parasite"" against the antagonism and differences between the rich and the poor. In this sad and happy story, the film is not only seen from the despair and helplessness of the lower class, but also hits the nail on the heart of the class contradiction."
PARASITE,19 November 2020,8/10,"This film was... a lot. I mean that in the best way possible. It was the first movie that I watched in a long time that genuinely wanted to make me stand up, take a deep breath and scream ""WHAT THE-""This is one of the first films I have watched in a language other than English with subtitles. I thought that I had this movie more or less figured out at the beginning, but it escalated just so damn quickly and turned from a comedy/heist film into a pretty messed up thriller/drama. Like, when it all started up, I was like ""oh, haha, funny comedy about a family scamming their way into the household of a richer family using entertaining and complex tactics, yay"" and then about halfway into the movie my brain just did a hard reset which went something along the lines of ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE""This film is so beautifully original and well-crafted, and throughout the entire thing there were so many levels which spoke truths about classism and the rich-poor divide. Bong Joon Ho is brilliant at creating an air of deadly suspense, and i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Only after you finish the movie do you realise just how potent and genius that title is - who truly is the parasite? Wait - it's both of them.The cinematography and the clean, modern feel was beautiful visually, and juxtaposed strikingly with the horror I kept seeing. And almost all the time, especially in the second half I had no idea what was happening and I had no idea what came next. And oh, the suspense - the way it was built gave me that sinking feeling in my stomach that something was about to go horribly, horribly wrong.People have got to get over themselves when it comes to subtitles and discover the great foreign films such as this that are out there.-Sasha."
PARASITE,10 March 2020,10/10,"Third rewatch later. Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted. A slow-paced thriller that keeps you on edge, whilst never quite becoming sinister, just powerfully developing the characters' stories to the ultimate conclusion. Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.Mitchell Bulfin"
PARASITE,17 October 2019,10/10,"This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece."
PARASITE,18 July 2021,10/10,"No ones movie can logically explain and tells a story about a social class cases. How the director create a deep message the meaning of ""parasite"" about rich and poor. The ""parasite"" things begin to the movie when the previous housemaid ring the doorbell and then the movie turn from funny and bright to scary and dark. And the disturbing scenes of the movie when the basement guy come out from his place and trying to kills all the parasite family member and everything turning into blood. Then years later the father of kim face his fate to living in that basement and live a lonely life."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,7/10,"But the biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on excellent performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable and cheating, with deceit,overall performing is immersing rich families. Until the emergence of another parasitic family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot. The final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, made me feel suffocated."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,9/10,"I heard a lot of praise for this movie and decided to watch it.
I was quite apprehensive because it was a Korean film and I had to watch with subtitles.
But the film proved me wrong.
What's good:
1) The story and screenplay are great. There are no unnecessary scenes in the movie.
2) The performances are great especially Kang Ho Song who played the father in the movie.
3) The twists in the movie are really entertaining. There are moments where you will be shocked.
4) The message in the movie is really great.
5) The direction is really nice.
What's bad:
1) You can't watch the film with family.
2) The ending was good but predictable.
I would recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something different."
PARASITE,10 August 2021,10/10,"My movie viewing has matured over the years as it should, but still not a fan of subtitles but films like this has changed my mind and rightfully so. The movie is so good that after you watch it twice(which you will if you loved it) you barely have to read them not because of predictably but because it says exactly what you're thinking and its brilliant screenplay and directing. Sometimes reading subtitles and culture of other countries are hard to put altogether, not this time. The film is emotional, funny(dark), endearing, suspenseful, and exactly what movies are supposed to hit on. It's a home run and don't let the low ratings steer you away from this, it almost did me but, once again I overcame my angst and settle in for actually one of the best movies I've ever seen--definitely the Best Foreign movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Give that Parasite a hand and A OSCAR well deserved!"
PARASITE,6 November 2019,10/10,"In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great .
This movie can thinking everything many type of question & ending is super-level...."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,9/10,"The Parasite is very close to what I would consider a perfect movie -- I mean, it's technically, scripted, and performed at a fairly high level of artistry, but it's also something that most mainstream audiences would definitely enjoy, even for someone with a busy work and family life who just wants to relax and enjoy a movie."
PARASITE,10 July 2019,7/10,Enjoyable ride through class differences in modern South Korea with an unexpected kick. It's very cleverly constructed and well acted. It's a fun ride and has a hint of Tarantino about it.
PARASITE,7 November 2019,9/10,"This film slaps hard- go see it fool!So the music is absolutely fantastic, the direction, the technicality, cinematography, acting, script- god this is such a great film.I had expectations set high because of the trailer I saw for the film. What? The movie didn't meet my expectations? It didn't exceed those expectations either because those expectations were for a film that simply doesn't exist.The more I think about it, the more I realize I enjoyed the film. Leaving the theater, I already knew I loved this film, but I keep loving it even more.I simply can't recommend this film enough. There is a high chance you won't enjoy it as much as the hype is making it seem like the worlds best film of ALL TIME, but this one is a masterpiece. Go in with expectations, you will enjoy it. Remove all expectations and enjoy the ride- you are gonna have you socks blown off your feet.Go see this one ASAP."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,Course after all the fuss about this winning best picture I had to see what it was all about! Surprisingly funny and depressing all in one go..... the end really got dark... loved it.
PARASITE,18 February 2020,6/10,"I won't go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions. Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long.People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated.I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess."
PARASITE,25 October 2019,10/10,"After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,"The resemblance to the famous ramshackle Kettles, to me is hilarious. I'm not sure at all that this is Oscar material but it's quite funny in a cynical sort of way. I certainly would not have rsyedbit better than many of the others in the Oscar list. Personally speaking, I would have given next picture to The Irishman."
PARASITE,7 August 2020,2/10,"How in the world did this movie receive an Academy award? I absolutely hated it. They did such a disservice to the lower class making the whole family a bunch of grifters, liars and basically thieves. This movie was too long and I would never recommend it."
PARASITE,17 December 2019,10/10,"Director Bong Joon-ho, the wildly innovative foreign director behind ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"" has outdone himself with ""Parasite""- An original and profound look at class warfare that among many things is meticulously crafted, seamlessly blends drama and dark humor with several of the best performances I've seen all year.If you can get past that this isn't spoken in English, fellow film fans will be in for a real treat come awards season (or whenever it comes to streaming, because missing this would be a crime).This may just be favorite movie of the year, depending on after I see ""The Irishman"". Review for that coming soon!
Grade- A+"
PARASITE,21 August 2019,9/10,"*Son...*Channeling Lanthimos, Dogtooth on a cat's jaw -- and panegyric applause to the cinematographer for a job flawlessly done."
PARASITE,17 October 2020,7/10,"This movie got so much hype that it's always tough when you go into something with sky-high expectations. I wasn't blown away by the film, as I thought the setup was slow to unravel yet too predictable to maintain that leisurely of a pace, but I did think it did an excellent job of maintaining tension and building the dilemmas and conflict to a point that the whole story becomes so twisted and insane that you're watching it wide-eyed. Good psychological thriller."
PARASITE,4 May 2020,10/10,"While I'm not finished with the film as I right this, this film is a social study of the wealthy and the destitute. A poor family systematically infiltrates a wealthy family, essentially taking over the house in a sense. I have a feeling that this won't end well."
PARASITE,9 August 2019,8/10,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
PARASITE,12 October 2019,10/10,"First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,8/10,"I hadn't read a lot about this film before watching it, so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew is it had won a lot of awards and was talked about for a long time.A film focused around a poor family who trick a highly wealthy family into hiring them for their skills.I had no idea where this film was going to go, there was so many different twists changing things up. It's a brilliant film, and the actors all did so well. If I had to fault anything, it would be that I didn't really see a tight family connection between the poor family."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,8/10,"Much less, not a Hitchcockian one.
Perfect performance of all actors, specially Yeo-jeong Jo (the rich mother) and So-dam Park (the smart sister of the poor family).
The movie is a perfect mix of black comedy with a little suspense. But it's not a thriller.
Perfect contrast between the rich family and the poor one. The cinematography is perfect when it shows this contrast during the storm.
After I watched the movie, one question remains to me: who was the real parasite in the movie?"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite was awesome. From the screenwriting to the acting, this was a film. This was a beautiful film. From the twist and turns it makes, to the surprise ending. Parasite had it all. I wish I was able to have seen it sooner but no theaters near me were playing it. But it's ok because I watched it and loved every second of it. The world this movie brings together, between wealthy and poor. This was a beautifully shot film and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I don't want to talk too much about the film because I don't want to spoil it, so please. Go see Parasite, you will not regret it."
PARASITE,25 August 2019,10/10,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
PARASITE,5 June 2020,9/10,"I really enjoyed this film, it is such an interesting look at what one is willing to do to get out of poverty. Everything I look for in a dark comedy."
PARASITE,10 February 2021,9/10,"The most deserving best picture movie ever. this film is not only entertaining as a comedy turned horror, it weaves commentary on class divides throughout. peoples reaction to the climax scene definitely tells you a lot about their personal ideology and perceptions of those living in poverty."
PARASITE,30 September 2019,,"This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly ""tragic"". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale."
PARASITE,2 July 2019,9/10,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
PARASITE,4 February 2021,1/10,"Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation.
Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices.
Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious."
PARASITE,21 September 2020,9/10,"A film that is generally given positive reviews is SE7EN, the fateful tale of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman chasing Kevin Spacey through a labyrinth of human depravity, leading to a conclusion that is still referenced to this day. Regardless of how well the film was made, how good the acting was, and how the twist worked to serve the story...I HATED SE7EN. And while I don't necessarily hate PARASITE, I'm quite certain I'm not going to be rushing to see it again, nor will I be adding it to any library of movies I might have.It starts out with a family of have-nothings getting inter wrapped with a family of have-everythings, at first in the vein of comedy. There's a dark thread that runs through each step the Kim family takes as they get more and more involved with the Park family, their house, and their valuables, but for the majority of the first two acts of the film, the general levity is well kept. You play along, wanting to see what will happen next.But then, there's a twist, one that ends the comedy in a single strike. The Kim family, whom we don't necessarily support in their actions but try to find reasons to accept why they choose to do to the Park family what they do, suddenly raise the bar on their pursuits, at the cost of any level of ethics. The humor is, at a single point in the movie, lost forever, leaving us only with the same vein of horror that one might have found watching SE7EN, which is why I brought that film up in the first place. Where you might have started the film smiling, you spend the end of the movie battling a kind of nausea, as the characters change from semi-decent misunderstood people (on both sides of the spectrum) into NOT so decent people (on both sides of the spectrum).I have to give chops where chops are due. Bong Joon Ho masterfully directs this film, from the choice of lighting and shots to the actors chosen for their performances and the extreme conditions that they are put through to really make the point of this film stand out. And in truth, the point that is trying to be made here IS the reason to watch this movie, and in that regard it is a success. Once you've seen PARASITE, it may be a long time before you forget about it, and maybe it will give you some interesting food for thought, as it did me. You've never looked at the world through a lens like this, I promise you.So, just like SE7EN, nobody pulls their punches here. Everyone delivers a damn good performance. The flow is perfect (even if the mood shifts), and everyone here does their best to make this film work.And overall, it certainly does. It's impressive, in so many ways.But if you're looking for any kind of lighthearted fare, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. This one's not for the faint of heart."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,2/10,"At this point - and I beg you, if you are not going to read all of my arguments, don't just downvote this so that others won't see it - Parasite has become highly overrated. It has got a lot of stuff going for it in a masterclass manner such as the editing and beautiful production design (as well as just people's curiousity, it being an acclaimed foreign film suddenly sky-rocketing in attention worldwilde). But overall the story is bland. It is extremely unrealistic, especially! at the end.
Like, I suspended disbelief with a lot of stuff in this movie to enjoy it, and it's fine, we all do that sometimes. When that certain character was still alive at the end, being able to go out unnoticed by police or really anyone, and understand and perfectly read a huge monologue made by morse codes from a lamp. The amount of just-the-right timing and ignoring common sense in terms of movie logic and even character logic... It's insane. You can suspend disbelief and have a good time, but that is beyond ridiculous. And to be frank, it was unneccesary.
The point the movie wanted to come across was already made at the climax, so giving us two long final monologues arguing them again was more than not needed.
It's also shallow with its message, and missing the point of having something specific to say. At the end, the message becomes something like ""plans are not good, you'll fail if you're from a low social class either way"". Yet in the beginning, their clear laziness yet cunning way of corrupting the rich family is what got them into this mess. Not that lacking a plan and staying the same (feeding off of others) would've made it better. It's really just that the plan they did make was unbelievably insane and not very long-term sustainable. So, what is the point and message again, and how does it count here? I'm sure you can spend hours yourself coming up with some different things which are taken out of this scene and this scene and make sense, but the movie is just too unclear and too unspecific to really get it across overall as a story. Especially! since the situation these people make up (and weren't even forced into) is not really related to how low class people actually deal with stuff such as their place in opposition to the higher class. There's been cases of this, but it just doesn't fit with the point and have any moral or commonsense value. It seems more than anything than an attempt to make us feel pity for people who were low and somehow got themselves even lower. (Which, making us feel pity succeeds, but please, pity is one weak goal for a story when you leave behind the actual fight to get past it. Then what is the journey? For one, I don't like the Joker comparisons, but in this case the main character in that movie tried to get out of the pity before he became corrupt, hence making a point of the hopelessness; no matter how he did the right thing, he would've ended up like that. This?...)
It felt like Suicide Squad writing in the way of moving from one point to another, an explosion here and a twist there, enough to keep you from figuring the whole movie out, but when one sequence is introduced (peach sequence) you quickly figure out that the end of that is going to be the whole family taking over, and these sequences keep happening over the course of the entire movie: *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening* *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening*. And it doesn't make for much organic, fluent storytelling overall, or delivers a message along with it, although the smooth and undeniably masterful editing and rhytm will try and convince you of that.
The symbolism is also very in-your face and sometimes outright stupid. The whole going up and down stairs thing to demonstrate class system etc. is cool enough especially watching it as a brilliantly mood-grabbing visual, although obvious (and seriously unavoidable considering it's just how you go down into a basement, and rich people houses usually just live on the higher grounds). Throwing in a rock and leaving the audience to come up with something to say about it is, to me, disrespectful. I've looked up so many interviews with the cast and Bong himself, but they don't seem to know or care about explaining it themselves, they never dig into the actual symbolism, they just go ""here, this is symbolism, it's great right?"" and go to the next thing they love but appear humble about in their movie. A lot of saying that there is symbolism and meaning in everything, yet being very hollow about it, or it's something that is obvious and you'd do in most movies to get a point across. Then I looked up audience interpretations of everything from the rock to the weather and dialogue, and there's nothing mindblowing nor very impressive about it. Especially that rock and what they do with it in the movie, it's just...wow, thanks, makes sense.
A lot of people are praising this movie so highly, yet it's a very decent film without anything too much to say, and an unbelievablity factor that's offensive at last. I don't know why people praise it so highly. If it's just the momentum it's been building up. Rated #22 movie of all time over Silence of the Lambs, The Green Mile, The Usual Suspects and a dozen of other classics which put so much more obvious work into their scripts and therefore the solids of their movies? Winning Best Picture *and* Best Director over 1917, a cinematic war piece you'll simply never see at the same level again, and Joker, a movie that was actually clear with its message - that there is a certain hopelessness in class systems no matter how hard you try? It literally makes no sense except for the momentum and everybody downvoting and ignoring anyone who has got anything negative to say about it. Scary stuff.
Parasite worked on multiple levels, but to me, the writing simply tore much of that apart. It's very sad that other masterpieces were almost completely or completely ignored at the Oscars, while something like this gets away with not only the biggest prize of them all but also several other big ones (Best Director and even Original Screenplay), when there are major issues in all of those departments.
That said, the Oscars are known for doing what it takes to stay relevant and out of too much danger, as well as voting with sometimes anything but commonsense. I hope that in time people will calm down, step down from their high horses and actually take in some of this. And I really hope that some of the other movies which didn't get the same amount of attention and praise at the Oscars, will live on greatly.
A sad disappointment. Thank you sincerely if you've read this much. I appreciate it whether or not we've come to the same conclusions."
PARASITE,29 November 2021,7/10,"Given the overall rating on IMDB, I was expecting something a little bit more. It's a nice idea, and well executed for the most part. The ending...hmm. Perhaps it works in Korean culture but I found it disappointing, and it seemed to me that the writer just ran out of steam.But overall worth a look. The humorous touches were great."
PARASITE,27 June 2021,10/10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my whole life! I'm not into a Korean film making, but this masterpiece blew my mind! It's actually impossible to categorise it cuz it includes many diverse genres - slasher, suspense, drama, comedy, thriller... To my mind, all the cast delivered a great performance! So eye-catching contrast between wealthy and working-class people who have different needs, outlooks and values. The director extraordinarily carried this out! Impeccable!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"Great story! Beautiful film
Great acting.
Make sure to plan just don't go with the flow.father waits...but not sure how long.
Watch it on 4K, Oled."
PARASITE,17 August 2019,5/10,"3 observations came to mind after watching this film:When you have a film whose sole purpose appears to be to make some sort of metaphorical analogy of society, you will invariably find gaping holes in its plot, which the director will simply expect you to overlook.There is no longer a ""safe"" outlet where one can find honest reviews of any sort, for any film, including forum sites, where people are supposed to share honest, unbiased opinions. And definitely not this site!The goal of the army of ""recruited"" reviewers is to get you, the consumer, to watch the film. Period."
PARASITE,7 November 2019,10/10,"As Jordan Peele is to race, Bong Joon-ho is to class. He creates strange, shocking scenes and stories from the seemingly mundane. A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,10/10,"For the first time in history, a movie which actually deserved an Oscar, received an Oscar!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"The way that this film respects its own characters is mind blowing. I really enjoyed watching this movie it's such a brilliant story with brilliant storytelling, it made me laugh cry and be scared in that order.. loved it, definitely gonna watch it again."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles."

PARASITE,21 August 2019,9/10,"Dark comedy with a very natural plot. Somehow all the fraud shown could happen in real life.
What gets me is my culture has certain similarity with Korean, perhaps it is asian curse.
Actors are so deep in their roles. And well done directed. I even could sense the body scent issue, frowned at the social gap, the misery of faking our real life for others in the name of greater good.
God, I laughed and swore at same time.
100% recommend this movie to all my friends."
PARASITE,17 August 2019,9/10,"This is one of the best foreign language films I've seen in a very long time. It's funny, sad, dark, clever, edge of your seat stuff. Its filmed & acted beautifully & the story is extremely entertaining. A must watch!"
PARASITE,26 December 2019,10/10,"Not perfect, but it's brilliant in many ways. The director should be awarded."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,10/10,"The whole process from ""sneaking into"" the rich family to ""parasitizing"" the upper class is full of a lot of cold humor processing and stage scheduling, exuding the charm of black comedy."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,2/10,"It has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,"A movie has a capability to move you, into the very inside. A movie is a mirror that shows you the darkest places with brutal honesty, if done right.I'll never forget this film, for the very simple fact that I could see people around me in the characters portrayed. I can see a human life and it's worth, in his own eyes and in the eyes of the world.We are always in a fight to live in a fair society, where we are just and do everything asked from us honestly and hence we'll be safe and pious and everybody will love us, but that's always your story. I won't get surprised anymore, no matter what someone does to me, as this movie shows what humans are capable of in given circumstances.I've seen and admired Mother India, and numerous Indian films dealing with the social divide prevalent in our society, and it always hit me in my heart. I saw this in times when I thought things have changed, but the fact is that they can not. Life is lived in levels, at one level you smoke a cigarette sitting on the broken toilet seat through which sewage is leaking and filling your home, and at another moment you are stabbed right into your heart by someone living in a dark pit for 4 years, while your dad wearing an Indian dress because his boss said so, whom he is about to kill in a few minutes in a house that the driver will go on to own.Every situation in the movie could be just elaborated immensely upon, and this is a movie one must watch to explore the power of cinema and it's reach. It has already went on to set an example, and I'm sure it will be among the greatest films of this century."
PARASITE,13 September 2019,8/10,Film does not have a mouthwatering end or twist to cover up the slow and quite obvious build up. Story line is quite simple and nothing really boastful is out there. There are films made before and will make after this on the same story line.Film is categorized in Comedy category but it does not have any justifiable point to prove it belongs to that category. Comedy is visible only in some here and there scenes and actors/actresses really failed to maximize the comedy factor. Story line and acting both should be responsible for average comedy in the film.Camera Direction seems to be a quite successful area in the film. Director has managed to capture some really nice angles and views to catalyst the current scene. Final scene where camera comes down through a window of snow can be cited as an example.Costumes are pretty good and did not actually disturbed the viewer to immerse mentally into the fictional scenes. The chosen luxury house is also great and it always have that rich cliche in it. Fantastic work by the directors to nail that location.I am 50% alright with the movie but it is average in the sense of story line and acting. Its average guys not poor so jump in and see it for yourselves. It would not be a waste of money for sure. Entertainment wise I m not sure everyone will enjoy it like a 10 star movie.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,8/10,"This is obviously an excellent movie - great acting and directing and production and photography with excellent dialouge and a tight script. It seemed to me that the ending was 'rushed' and it was far too predictable. But this movie has some great moments that will go down as movie moments for a long time - no spoilers.
I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such. The lead role is Kim the father, but in many contexts it is also about the son, daughter and mother - the parasites."
PARASITE,23 January 2020,1/10,"Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me."
PARASITE,7 November 2019,10/10,"This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,8/10,"The biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on ""excellent"" performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable, with deception, It is deceitful, but on the whole ""performing"" is very immersive for rich families. Until the emergence of another ""parasitic"" family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot, the final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, people felt suffocated."
PARASITE,23 October 2019,8/10,I do feel this movie is really well made. Alot of things worked well and the movie was enjoyable. I liked the mix of humor and darkness. I really enjoyed the actors and the way the movie was put together.I'm still working on what the movie was trying to say. Maybe the message wasn't supposed to be clear to the audience.. but some aspects just felt a little muddled and cliche.Despite the story issues which I felt didn't all make sense.. still a really powerful and interesting movie. Well done.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect nor did I have any expectations. This is brilliantly written, acted and directed. The viewer gets sucked into thinking it's a comedy, then there are subtle messages in the beginning that turn dark, then the entire scenario changes and it's nothing like you expected. I love when a movie takes you to places you didn't see coming and this does exactly that. I haven't seen anything like this in a very long time and this will be a classic. It deserves all the awards and acclaim. Just brilliant."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"I loved this movie. I was laughing almost the whole time and when I wasn't, I was holding my hand over my mouth with surprise. Every twist and turn of the story is paced and delivered. Every character is spot on.I love a film with a message, and this one is loud and clear.You should watch it. I don't care that it's in Korean, you should watch it."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,10/10,"Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"
PARASITE,19 August 2019,4/10,"Just like with Snowpiercer and Okja when I think back on this movie I am forgetting it faster than I can remember. There are just too many different Genre's happening here to really give anything any sort of devoted attention.Aside from that my, oh my, how predictable. 15 minutes into the movie I knew what the first hour was gonna be about, and I was not wrong. The second act got slightly less predictable but only because it was really trying to not.It could have been much much better had the finale come up with a more interesting solution."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,5/10,"I was so looking forward to Parasite. What a disappointment. Is this the movie that has won all these awards and put Korea on the map? I sat through it waiting for something to spark my interest, anything that would raise this oriental potboiler social comedy of manners into high art. It failed to materialise. The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor. It was neither satirically funny enough or dramatic enough to be a stunning black comedy. Far too aware of itself. I did want to like this. I was anticipating another ""Roma"" but all I got was a frantic mess."
PARASITE,30 June 2021,8/10,"This movie is really really well made. The actors are superb, especially the believably ignorant rich mother, and the camera work is Wes Anderson good. In general, I'm not a fan of watching something that's subbed because I find it difficult to not get distracted, but this never happened for Parasite -- it's almost like they made it knowing that the Western World will be watching.However, I feel like so many things about the ending could be nitpicked. Like, for example, given that the police couldn't see anything on the surrounding CCTV footage, surely they would've checked the house more thoroughly (ie, looking for bloodstains and, perhaps, looking behind a bookcase). Next, the ending surely wasn't as grim as it was made to be. Like, the father could just leave the bunker after a few months when the trail cools off, right? He could just live with some of his family and never leave the house. There's always a chance he'd get caught, sure, but is being caught really that much worse than his current situation? I don't think so."
PARASITE,3 September 2019,8/10,"Being an Asian myself, it feels great to see Asian films win the Palme d'Or for two consecutive years. Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story. Most spectators, while watching the first half of the film, might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs. Well, the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer. The second half is full of vehement conflicts, as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared. The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric. Educated and civilized as they are, the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy. Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe. Impoverished people, despite trying every means they are able to get hold of, be it wily tricks or honest labor, will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder. Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,8/10,"I get it now. I understand the hype. This movie is tremendous. Its clever, intentional, and gripping throughout. Every line. Every set piece, every shot is on purpose. It works so deliberately toward its goal without being predictable. Its so absolutely tense, and crescendos in satisfactory fashion.A deep study on class and its implications in society as a whole. It asks questions like what does class hierarchy do to those who suffer from it? The story centers on people who are on the margins of society and are (forced?) to make some unseemly decisions. Who do you root for? And why?This movie WILL stand the test of time."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,9/10,"Well conducted, superb performance, the movie seems to catch the futility of having too much money and still being blind to others not so fortunate.
I really enjoyed the movie. Recommended."
PARASITE,20 August 2020,6/10,"Being an american it is difficult to know when foregin films are released and how to watch them but this film was a surprise. The picture quality was probably one of the best ive ever seen and really complimented my television. The acting was excellent for such a varied age cast and the story was unique, it kept me guessing and definetley cements South Korea as a movie up an comer in my mind."
PARASITE,13 October 2019,4/10,"I truly cant believe this movie was placed in the same iconic tier as Pulp Fiction and illustrious famed prize of the Cannes Film Festival.Im looking for reasons to love this movie and cant pin anything that made this film stand out.The Beginning: 8/10
The film starts off like any other, everythings going just fine. Then you begin to see how things can possibly get twisted. The director gives those subtle clues when this dark plot may soon reveal itself i.e. the rock, when the english tutor repeats his friend on dating this girl, the art tutor making the son behave out of nowhere and pointing out a mental disability, the ghost and much more.The Middle: 5/10
With all these subtle clues that force an audience to question the ""why"" was...brilliant. But to our dismay, none of these ""clues"" actually lead to anything. They were cheap thrills to pass the time. Horrible.The End: 3/10
Apparently the end was some kind of twist according the raving reviews. Expect the unexpected. I was left in my seat saying ""hmm ok, wtf?"" Yes, completely unexpected as to the driver killing the father. But because he hated the smell? You're gonna have to dive deeper as a writer or director to actually pull any emotion from an audience as to why he hated the idea of him smelling how he did.Nothing special, nothing worth remembering...a come and go film as it is."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,6/10,"Parasite starts out with a rather familiar gritty arthouse vibe. Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the ""host"" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie? Not completely gone in the second, but you have to look for it."
PARASITE,23 April 2021,10/10,Can be a bit strange if you only watch Disney movies (MCU included) and I'm seriously shoked that this movie doesn't have a higher rating.
PARASITE,20 August 2019,8/10,"Problem with Bong's movies is that they have very strong message. Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say."
PARASITE,10 January 2020,7/10,"This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some ""drama"" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it."
PARASITE,5 January 2020,10/10,Saw this movie today after keeping it for shelves for 2 months......a reality in today's world...... acting was top notch. Don't have any words to explain the story. It's simple mind-blowing. Keeps you on hook till the end. One of the best korean movies of the last decade. Hopefully no one will remake it and spoil this classic
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"This is the first movie that can take me places, from comedy to drama to romance to action to thriller to horror to all the combination that grips me speechless at the end of it. I watched it three times and it feels as great every time. Camera works are very structured, scenes are orchestrated almost mathematically they fill my heart so right. Acting is evenly of quality, no one outshines anyone else. Superb!"
PARASITE,25 March 2020,8/10,"Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like ""Breaking Bad"" it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!"
PARASITE,8 February 2021,9/10,"This movie is pretty good,
The score and cinematography combine to create a lucid sense of reality bringing a more artsy nature that is just jaw dropping,
It's genuinely beautifully shot. The camera angles combined with how the focus shifts depending on the characters' feeling or emotion is something to marvel.
Also manages to transform a fairly bland aesthetic to a dream-like image through the lighting and focus, making bland canvases into something they aren't, an idea through the movie.
The way Kang-Ho Song and Bong Joon Ho create emotion through the facial expressions, twitched and little reactions is superb.
I do feel the final act was slightly forced as he almost feels it needs to happen, but this is negligible compared to the rest of the movie.
Probably the most invested and immersed I've been in a movie for a while.
It also creates tension and suspense up there with some of the best ever. It also creates an uneasy nature the whole way through, keeping you in the edge of your seat the whole time.
The humor ranges from really dark to almost slapstick which perfectly exemplifies the characters development through the movie, giving a greater understanding of the characters"
PARASITE,9 February 2021,7/10,It was a good drama movie with some comedy mixed in with it. I thought the ending was far fetched but it still was a powerful ending. Amazing acting!!
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is ""Parasite"" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,7/10,"We see a family that gradually starts to feed off of a privileged family which is clear. But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite, the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way. The rich generic family needed a 'help' for almost everything in their life. For tutoring the kids(and much more than just tutoring academics), for making food, for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion, for driving the father etc and even...for the dynamic between the husband and wife. It showed that most of their conversations were about the 'help'. This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them, and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives.
It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co-dependant relationship. (E.g. The man adoring the master). And many times it costs a lot, for the underprivileged. The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else's family, instead of in their own, because they need the salary. The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this.The dynamic of the 'poor' family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie. The story started out very interesting, but - to me - it fell flat towards the end. It could have been so much better , with a better storyline. Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clichés. I just wanted it to develop more. It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat.
A nice movie, i don't care about awards (its all politics anyhow), a good one time watch, and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie. Favourite character : the poor dad."
PARASITE,1 June 2020,9/10,"Hollywood wishes it could make a movie like this. Perhaps if Paul Verhoeven was still allowed to make slick satirical blockbusters like he used to, they'd have a shot at matching the Best Picture winner PARASITE.Without going into heavy spoilers, the movie follows the Kim family who are a lower class clan of con artists that have no qualms about fleecing people. But they are close knit and love each other dearly. Their latest scheme is their most ambitious and riskiest one yet: each Kim family member will get hired by the wealthy Park family for a different occupation and pretend not to be related to one another.The acting is excellent across the board. The first half is very enjoyable to watch how crafty the Kims are at tricking the affluent if foolish Parks. But then the second half takes a few shocking twists that threaten to upend the Kims' new social standing.I strongly recommend this movie, it's definitely worth the hype."
PARASITE,21 August 2020,9/10,"Seoul, a basement dwelling. Having access to someone else's free wlan is one of the main concerns of its residents for not being cut off from the world of WhatsApp.Seoul, a private fallout shelter in a modern luxurious villa. The only way left to communicate with the outside world is the light of a bulb by using morse code.In between these 2 scenes we get to see 120 min of a freaky class conflict, in which a family of unemployed sneaks access to a mansion of the riches. They get the first foot in by chance but from that point on, they show great manipulative and deceitful talent to get all feet in. Everything seems to work out fine until the former housekeeper returns in a rainy night. From that point on the story is turned completely upside down and becomes an entirely unpredictable hullabaloo.I liked the fact that the movie does not side with either of the parties. Neither poor nor rich are presented in a very favorable way. Especially the patronizing behavior of Mr. Top Manager towards his new chauffeur is quite striking and doomed to create a backlash ...Not all parts of the story are fully convincing. In my eyes, it is quite unlikely that a family of low social class has the ability to show such good manners and education as presented in the movie.Oh well, it is still a clear recommendation. You shall be surprised more than once."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,Loved this Film from Start to End! The Parks n Kim's playing the role of Rich & Poor perfectly. Great Cast! Loved the role of up and down shots n those stairs!!! Best Film of 2019 easily
PARASITE,21 December 2019,9/10,"At the beginning of the close to the real life segment, is a very common introduction technique in Korean films. The long, slow shot passes through the cramped living space on the ground floor, and the characters are drawn one by one. In the cluttered and narrow semi-basement, the plot of searching for network signals and pizza boxes soon leads the viewer smoothly into the narrative atmosphere of life. The combination of deliberate camera speed and quick message delivery is so precise that it has proven the power of director bong joon-ho.When stepping into the mansion that moment, ""parasites"" and the real story gradually away, but into the structure and framework of social fable. That doesn't mean the director has given up on story and suspense, though. It's certainly not the freehand brushwork of burning, which won critical acclaim last year but lost popularity, but it's similar to the metaphors and hints in snowpiercingly, and even to the themes of class and destiny. An undetected basement, like that set by many science fiction works, becomes a space device that isolates the class and tests humanity.The passage about family education can naturally get heated discussion from domestic audiences who are in the middle of anxiety. The depiction of high-asset families in the film is a kind of deliberate label misreading, which makes all members look silly and indifferent, which is obviously not true. But the director quickly deflects the viewer's confusion with exquisite technical expertise. First of all, the suspense and conflict in the script are constantly pushed forward, which makes the audience hardly pay attention to the serious injury in the life picture, which also becomes an important evidence to question its commercial genre. But I have to admit that this is the subtlety of the script, every character has realized their own appearance, deduction, transformation and account, every props given to the camera, whether stone, secret door, tea table or induction lamp, have been effectively used, become an important force to promote the story.What is exquisite is the scene itself. The three important locations of poor families, rich people's villas and underground secret rooms are all arranged in a very real and rich way. The seemingly random close-ups can accurately present the emotions of each scene and the differences between each other. The stylization of the scene also serves as a metaphor for the theme, just like the ""strange smell"" that the host keeps saying, which is the smell of poverty and the significant difference of different living conditions. It brings out the heart of separation hidden under the surface of kindness, builds up estrangement and hatred, and finally promotes the explosion of the ending.Of course, technical sophistication was not enough to get the jury's approval. The emotional tension at the heart of the film comes from the characters' examination of their own lives, from the warmth and kindness that cannot dissolve the estrangement, from the tears in the eyes of a poor father as he looks back at his home in the flood, and from the tragic conflict facing the family of four after a brief period of joy. The film also jumped out of the suspense genre, with some depth to cause thinking. The mislabeling of the high class is also highlighted in these passages, which is an unavoidable wound in the film.But like snow train, bong joon-ho has always been reluctant to disrupt the plot with lyricism and pauses. This preserves the tension and integrity of the story, but it can also hurt the meaning and attitude that the fable itself hopes to convey.Butler's rainy night visit to the line and joy and sadness both before and after contrast so bright, even fantasy is over the boy out of the warmth of the segment, the film to be presented by the split, opposition and despair has carefully through setting suspense infiltrated the viewer's heart, it's almost no moralizing paragraph, but through the story of extremes, is like a knife cut the surface of society, will be more deep vein and the body.When the story is over, who lives in a dark room and who travels in the sun like an insect, everyone may have found the answer. The reflection and emotion gained from the fable can also provide richer support for the following life choices."
PARASITE,28 April 2020,8/10,"Poverty and prosperity, hope and despair, this is a story that profoundly reflects the bottom of society, ridiculous but realistic, struggling in despair, looking for beauty in hope, a liar family gang mixed into the upper class, each making a living, step by step shocking. Borrowed space, deceived wine, a moment of happiness, the most beautiful is not the villa courtyard but the family, the rich surface is glamorous and beautiful, behind the drug abuse, the children are rebellious and sick, the poor put down patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face, just like this Going into the room becomes falling to the bottom. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complicated, human nature is difficult to ponder, and I hope that fantasy will become a reality ~ The Palme d'Or is deserved!"
PARASITE,31 March 2020,8/10,A story with interesting characters will keep you glued till the end. It portrays people in the society in a very simple but clear way. A film worthy of the Oscars.
PARASITE,28 February 2020,9/10,A very nice plot with lovely actors and an unexpected twist.
PARASITE,29 January 2020,10/10,"Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!"
PARASITE,23 August 2019,9/10,"#Parasite #KoreanMovie #SouthKorea #Drama #Thriller #Mystery #DarkComedy #JoonHoBong #JinWonHan #KangHoSong #SunKyunLee #WooSikChoi #IamnrdurjoyMy Personal Rating is 9⭐ out of 10⭐Plot:
This is the story about the fall of excessive greed and arrogance of two different class family.In this film you will find how an unknown family tricked a wealthy family and entered into their life what caused great loss of them.A Masterpiece Dark Comedy Thriller Mystery Drama."
PARASITE,25 May 2020,8/10,"This movie will turn out really great for those who focuselly pay attention to every scene, because this movie is very detailed. On the other hand, this will turn out really boring for those who just watch the plot not the mathaphore that has been put together. The main character (the son) has explicitely said the word of methapore at the beginning of the movie, if we take that and put it throughout the movie, this movie will turn out really briliant. I definitely watch this for the second time just to understand every detail."
PARASITE,7 December 2020,9/10,Exposes the contrasts in society. Ive already watched the movie several times. A very well thought of story and a creative output!
PARASITE,9 December 2020,4/10,"I watch a lot of films. Many are good. A few are great. Sadly, this one was barely watchable. I persisted until the end, but it actually got worse. Odd film."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,6/10,"Parasite is without a doubt a well-thought good movie. It's clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape. It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea. It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life, be it positive or negative, it has a huge impact. In addition, in general i love Asian Cinema, especially Chinese and Korean films. BUT saddly, this not for me.I did not like it. Did not enjoy it. Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up. Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews.Korean movies are just fantastic, and this might not be the exception. I have seen many online and in cinemas. they are AWESOME.Parasite to me was annoying, depressing, negative.... a total tale of betrayal... Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others... or at least be super careful..?? could be.You can watch the movie and make up your mind. You might be among the 99.99% of people who loves it. I am in the 0.01 % who do not :)(my humble opinion)"
PARASITE,2 March 2020,10/10,Bong Joon-ho delivers an engaging film that continues to get more engaging by the minute and lives up to and exceeds it's hype. The story goes from funny to thrilling to dark in the 132 minutes of a genius plot.
PARASITE,11 August 2019,4/10,Just like a daytime soap opera for 90 mins then a drama for last 30mins! I want to be entertained for the whole movie ! Big yawn
PARASITE,11 December 2019,9/10,"Just a masterpiece of filmmaking.As far as pacing, dialogue, camera work, cinematography, and acting, I thought this movie was absolute perfection. Every scene and the entire film carries intrigue or excitement. Never a dull moment, or even a dull second, throughout. Just astounding; as someone else mentioned, watch this with a minimum of knowledge about the plot.The overall narrative is also exceptional. For me, personally, there were a couple of elements of the plot in which I would have preferred to be different, which is why I give it 9 stars instead of 10. However, that's not a significant negative, just my own preference and it still is an astounding film."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,8/10,"The house is the main body, and all three families are parasites of the house.The mobility of the three families did not affect the house.
Class can be said to be eternal, and the falsehood of society is eternal.
The film, just the fate, the social truth in the form of fable, to the audience"
PARASITE,15 February 2021,9/10,"This movie give us a full satisfaction after watch, leaves us no question because everything happens have an answer inside the film.Its been a long long time since i watch a movie like this, every moments make sense."
PARASITE,22 May 2020,1/10,"I started to watch this movie because it has 8.6 IMDB Rating,I cant believe how this movie get that much high rating,
Sorry guys this movie not good for me,very bad storyline,wasted my time,"
PARASITE,1 June 2020,9/10,"A lie always needs to be rounded with more lies, be yourself, one step at a time. There's still a slight logical flaw in the plot. The lies from the suffering are pinned on the goodwill of others'homes, and the accidental interception in the middle forces a sudden change in human nature, and finally ends in tragedy!"
PARASITE,22 November 2019,1/10,"A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...
It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.Post Oscars Addition:
Technically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I'm sure that most fans don't care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money. But think about that: someone did build the house where we all want to live in, right? And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn't it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?"
PARASITE,17 June 2020,7/10,"Parasite (Gisaengchung) by Bong Joon Ho is a tragicomedy about class division and the social struggle in between. Wonderful cinematography and storytelling. Though so surreal, at the same time the story felt very real. Great direction and technically a fantastic movie. The cast was great, too.Comedy-wise it was sometimes hilarious, but I believe due to language-barrier some language-specific comedy was lost for me. I wouldn't be surprised, if otherwise the movie had topped my expectations.What's so exciting for the majority is probably that Parasite is not so heavy on one genre and yet doesn't feel forced. In Hollywood there are only specific directors handling multi-genre movies and the audience became used to their direction.In many Asian film industries due to companies who only know the commercial value of film making, movies are often forced to handle a very wide audience. So it's rather common to see movies by directors who have mastered movies that handle multiple moods very well. South Korea is already known for great movies, but I guarantee you that if you loved this movie, you can find some gems in the other Asian countries that aren't cliched."
PARASITE,3 June 2020,10/10,"Funny, absorbing, dark,and an original screenplay I loved this film. At just over two hours in length it never felt that long at all, and the subtitles the film obviously carries being a Korean production have never bothered me as much as dubbing has done for me in the past as they just do not capture the movie the way it should !! hearing the original language is far better in my opinion.The direction and the cast were superb and as for the beautiful house its mainly filmed in is just so perfect I want to live there now. The film deserves the accolades it rightly as been getting,and Is a worthy best picture Oscar winner for me."
PARASITE,16 December 2019,7/10,"There's a lot to Parasite. A very complex story, only a few sets, but dozens of strands.In some ways, it's a very good film. For example, the imagery is outstanding. Also, it's one of the most original films I have ever seen. I never guessed what was going to happen next. I was completely surprised remarkably often. Bit this also brings with it a negative. So much happens that the film started to drag for me. I noticed I was getting restless and was genuinely grateful when the film ended.The acting is good for the most part, but occasionally reaches theatrical heights, which felt tonaly wrong.Overall, I'm glad I watched it."
PARASITE,20 November 2020,10/10,"When I first heard of this movie and everyone recommending it I was some what skeptical. When I finally decided to watch it it instantly became one of my favorite movies. The writing, the acting, the directing, the set design. Everything about this movie screams perfection. WE all need to start appreciating SK movies more. I give it a 10/10 because its just that good of a movie."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,4/10,"I am sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this."
PARASITE,4 December 2020,10/10,"There's so much to love about this film. From its acting, music, set piece, cinematography, props and more, Bong finds some way to compress so much into a 2+ hour film and the quality is still perfect. The many themes and genres this film has, comedy, satire, drama, horror, thriller, family, you still don't get confused on what your watching no matter the theme or genre the scene is centred around. The films main message about rich and poor was portrayed comedically and horrifically. There's just too much to write about in one preview that a reader will stay attentive to, but the film very much deserved it's 4 oscar wins. no English remake please thanks"
PARASITE,10 January 2020,7/10,"An interesting and unusual plot. Excellent atmosphere. The film shows the hypocrisy and ingratitude of people. I also liked that there is no cliche in the film, such as: The rich - evil, greedy, cold-blooded and smug or The poor - kind, brave and sensitive. The biggest minus is the ending. I expected something more interesting and unusual. The end was predictable."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,10/10,"When I hear the words ""A Korean film about class conflict"" I think it's gonna be something stupidly pretentious and needlessly experimental. But no, this film is a masterclass in direction, acting, suspense, camerawork, beautiful scenery, and even comedy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film. I did feel the peach thing was a bit stupid and it's dumb that it was a huge plot-point. Bravo Bong Joon Ho. 9.4/10"
PARASITE,28 March 2020,9/10,"Although the poor family is poor, the family enjoys it! The relationship between the adults of the rich family and the children is very tense. The son is pretending to be stupid. The parents are difficult to control (although they are frightened on their birthday). The daughter is not valued at home. From the scene design of the noodles, the daughter is at home. Status! Bong Joon-ho is a genius, since childhood, he reflects the contradictions of various classes in Korea (including family conflicts)! As long as you look a few more times, you can find more details every time, and the response is very reasonable!"
PARASITE,31 August 2020,10/10,"I saw this film in an empty cinema with my girlfriend around a month ago now and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. If you can, see this film without having any idea about what to expect and i guarantee you'll have a more enjoyable viewing experience. The twists and turns throughout are done crazily well and almost everything that happens within the film comes as a surprise to the viewer. Easily the best film of the last 2 years for me and should be talked about in cinematic history for many a year to come."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,10/10,"Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances."
PARASITE,30 September 2020,9/10,Holy crap this movie surprised me a lot. At first the movie seemed more of the tone of a mild comedy with not much of suspense happening. But then holy shiz nuggets it starts to get more tense and then so much crap happens at once. I can see why this won best picture. I was engaged and no moment was dull. It really sets how unequal classes of the rich and poor are and the truth of it just hits hard when you realize it. Please watch it is a must!
PARASITE,20 February 2020,8/10,"What we have here is 2 movies in one. The first half of the movie seems to be an Ocean's Eleven style long con. That was the part I liked, it was very fun and not overly preachy. Then it goes full blown drama about class wars, ending in tragedy.I wouldn't have had a problem with the movie if the tone had kept consistent, if I wasn't being set up for a Rian Johnson style ""subvert your expectations"". Also the portrayal of class differences is taken to ridiculous levels here, it's just not realistic. ""Oh look, feel bad about these people because the rich people literally wrinkle their noses at how they smell"".Definitely not better than Joker, but then Slumdog Millionaire won the Oscar instead of Dark Knight in 2008, so what do you expect?All in all it's a solid, good, well acted 2 movies you're getting. The first one is unfinished."
PARASITE,26 November 2019,10/10,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.
In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."

PARASITE,19 March 2020,6/10,"I had high expectations for this film, sadly I was dissappointed.I enjoyed most of the film, and the characters. I thought the unemployed family was clever...to a point. Unfortunately, they got too comfortable, and too greedy and their arrogance led to their downfall and tragedy for at least three families.I am old enought to know that life isn't fair and not all endings are happy, but I didn't expect the film start and end on such depressing themes."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,8/10,"The first half is a bit of comedy. The transition of the painting style in the middle scared me. I thought it was frightening (of course not). Next is a series of lying slots ... The plot is cleverly distorted, but the look and feel is not bad. Every emotional point of the audience is well grasped!"
PARASITE,19 March 2020,9/10,"The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually did nothing wrong. The couple loved each other, their children were pleasant, they didn't cheat, they didn't have cold violence, they didn't abuse children, they were generous to drivers and servants, they were really kind and simple, but you just can't help hating them, hating them, hating them."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,9/10,"For me, as an Asian, I have to appreciate that film which expresses the wonderful story about social stratification. It has the inherent reason why it's a good film. You know the ability to tell a story meanwhile the story comes from our life is difficult. I wanna talk about a different point of view thinking about the kernel of the screenwriter. let's focus on the ending of this movie, such a spicy satire we saw. The envelope represents an impossible dream. Reality mixed up with the unreal, so the multiple-layered ending appears. And this ending tells audiences some principles in philosophical level at last.😊"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.
PARASITE,2 November 2019,10/10,"Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻"
PARASITE,16 January 2020,9/10,"Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.
The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,"Quite how this managed to win best picture at the Oscars is beyond me. How it won best director is truly daft, especially up against the magnificent Sam Mendes.
It's a really good first half of character set up, though they themselves are never really developed, witty and fast paced, followed by a let down of a second half that doesn't deliver on its midway point revelations."
PARASITE,21 August 2021,7/10,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own."
PARASITE,21 October 2019,8/10,"Highly recommended! A refreshing and unconventional genre-mix of comedy, drama and thriller elements, based on a strong social commentary about still existing class struggles in highly industrialized societies. Sounds a bit weird? Well, yes it is, but that makes all the fun of it, especially when serving here as a great example for the importance of intelligent screen-writing. A highly inspired ensemble of actors join and you have the surprise-of-the -year-film!"
PARASITE,19 January 2021,5/10,"Pros: A very good, interesting, 1st half, and fantastic cinematography.Cons: Descends to unintentional farce in 2nd half. Plus entire premise of movie is flawed, as South Korea is a thriving economy. The family is intelligent, presentable, makes zero sense that their only option would be folding pizza boxes. Esp the son, as he knows English he'd be in high demand.The family was so clever In setting themselves up in the luxury house. But then why did suddenly turn dumb, by not realizing the rich family's camping trip would obviously be cancelled in that huge storm, and by letting the former maid in to have the run of the place? The idea of that guy living in the basement was just stupid, and esp that the father suddenly turns into a murderer. And what's with that undoing thing about the family smelling bad? They knew enough how to get over on the rich folks, but didn't know it's a good idea to use soap and deodorant ?Obviously Park's wanting to make some big point about unjust income inequality, but points like that are better made by not using dumb and ridiculous situations, and a main premise that makes no sense."
PARASITE,25 October 2021,9/10,"Wow, i've never seen a thriller like this, the storytelling is just brilliant, with a thrilling plot reveal aswell. This movie just got more and more intense for every minute and i was so captivated at the second half of this movie. The cinematography is outstanding, the scene i remember most for the cinematography is the basement scene. That scene is filmed brilliantly. This is one of my favourite foreign movies ever (Still not the best, that still belongs to La vita é bella(1997).9/10."
PARASITE,8 May 2020,10/10,A fantastic dark comedy with unpredictable twists and turns.
PARASITE,31 March 2020,9/10,"When I first saw Parasite, I expected it be a pretty standard Oscar bait movie where nothing much of interest happens. But from it's opening seconds, I knew this would be different. And boy, I didn't know the half of it. Parasite starts one way, and it goes a very, very different direction than you think it would. And while most movies would struggle to balance the drastic turn of events, Parasite manages to expertly keep you guessing whilst still staying grounded in reality. Combine the phenomenal plot with great acting, some laughs, and a shocking ending, Parasite is one of the greatest movies of the 2010s.Final Score: 94/100."
PARASITE,31 May 2021,8/10,An original dark comedy about class struggles A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots. Very interesting plot! Really good movie.
PARASITE,21 February 2020,,"Went and saw the film in a theater after it was re-released because of the Oscar win. And....like many reviewers here, I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood. It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over ""Bread And Chocolate"" (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try ""Ugly, Dirty and Bad"", 1976, for great fun!). I don't think i will remember Parasite in 3 days."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,5/10,"This movie strongly reminded me of several different things as I watched it, the first was American Beauty. A film with a strong experiential component that is not matched by its actual message or ""literary"" value, and as such overrated in the moment and forgotten with time. Parasite is a very well composed and executed film, in terms of emotional engagement with the story and characters it gets you all dressed up and it's easy to feel as if you must have had somewhere to go. But you didn't.The second was 'Let the Right One In'. That was a good movie that was basically rated 2 stars higher than it deserved by everyone in the United States because it had subtitles. Exotic and slightly more challenging to watch is easily conflated with quality by people who aren't especially self-perceptive in their thinking. Had Let the Right One In been in English and set in New York, well, the dumb and silly parts would have just seemed dumb and silly, and it would have had to stand entirely on its own quality, and not an imagined quality. Parasite is the same way. If it starred four American actors trying to get jobs as household help in LA, people would be quite meh about it. Actually given the nature of the plot, I think most people in America currently giving it a 10 would probably be a little insulted by screwball comedy plot that simultaneously seems to fawn over its own profundity, and would give it a lower rating than my 5 stars.And third, this movie can't help but make me think of America's original class conscious, degenerately poor sitcom family, the Bundys from Married with Children. They even match by character: the intelligent but lame son, the beautiful but still poor sister who connives to get what she wants, the dead-eyed father crushed by life, and the ball-busting mother who really doesn't make anyone feel better. Just like the Bundy's they're comically poor while placed in a real life setting where anyone with their talents, willingness to work, and lack of any significant vices means they would at worst be regular poor. And probably decently well off.They're also selectively stupid when required to be in order to make the plot work, which seems a little more forgivable in a weekly sitcom where the writers are forced to create drama dozens and dozens of times a year, but less so in a movie where they don't. The writers of Married with Children were also smarter in allowing their comedy to shoot for simply being funny, where here the slapstick situations lead to completely unfunny, dark, but still stupidly slapstick conclusions in a badly planned out gambit to give the movie ""meaning"".Reading others' reviews, including some of the top ones on here, gives a good impression of why people liked this movie, as they discuss how it opened their eyes apparently to the relationship between the rich and their servants and perhaps the rich and poor in society generally. Which tells me that most of the people who really liked this film are for the most part, very inexperienced in life, and also not yet well read. I'm sure for someone with no first hand knowledge of the world and who hasn't delved into quality literature ever before, this is pretty profound stuff. It's easy to forget that if you're not just now crossing the starting line of life.On the other hand, that hardly qualifies this movie as being great. If those who gave this movie a 10 are blown away by Parasite's subject matter, they need only head down to their local library and begin reading 19th century English literature to get a thousand times greater picture of what it is like for the serving poor and the separation between them and the rich. Victorian authors living in England included these basic facts of life out of course in their storylines without even meaning to have them signify some message, and if you liked that aspect of Parasite you'll quickly find the movie put to shame in its shallow depth of portrayal on the subject.In the end what we really have is a dark comedy that misses it's own setup, and ends with a flailing attempt to create a message at the expense of creating a good story. It won't be the first Best Picture winner to lose its luster with every passing year as people look back upon it without hype and blindness for objective quality, but it at least is another to be added to the list.5 out of 10 stars!"
PARASITE,19 October 2019,10/10,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!"
PARASITE,15 May 2020,5/10,Movie is excellent till 1st half but in 2nd half you get bored irritating and may be scratch your hair
PARASITE,1 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite thoroughly deserved the best picture Oscar and for once in a long time it's a winner that will be remembered as a classic. It's a master class in film making!Don't read reviews or a synopsis, just watch the magnificence unfold before your eyes."
PARASITE,24 December 2019,10/10,"This movie was spectacular.I was hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, but once the film got rolling the brilliant subtitles allowed the viewer to read them and look up and see the rest of the action for the scene.This will win Best Foreign Film. It should also take home the Oscar for best film of the year. The cast was brilliant, the story was amazing, and the writer-director at the top of his craft.(The trailer shows a scene where one of the actors speaks in English. Perhaps that was done for a fickle American audience, of which I admit to be a member. But except for 3 or 4 lines in English, the rest is in Korean. I can just see the Hollywood studios gearing up for an American version, with Margot Robie and Brad Pitt. But whatever they do, they won't be able to top this magical film and utterly astonishing film making.)"
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,5/10,Art house movies aren't my thing really so I struggle with this sort of thing regardless of where it has been made. If I knew more about Korean culture it would probably help.
PARASITE,16 June 2020,7/10,"Very close to an 8, definitely recommended. Well-made well-directed"
PARASITE,29 February 2020,7/10,Fun thriller and It's got good twist. Nothing mind blowing. Am i shocked this is best picture? yes.
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,"I was reluctant to watch this. I could see from the trailer that it has good production value, yet I was worried it would be too weird, being a Korean/an Asian language thriller. Eventually I did watch it and I am glad! I'm also glad it won all those Oscars.The blend of dark comedy in this social thriller definitely attributed to an enjoyable and entertaining experience and made me more engaged with the story. It is very well made and it deals with various interesting subjects/issues of our society, all in the premise of a collision of social classes (extreme poverty with extreme wealth)."
PARASITE,5 September 2019,9/10,"Parasite was such a mesmerizing piece of film. It's storytelling was weird, absurd, unexpected and somehow came together really nicely. It's hard to describe this piece due to how many genre's of film it covers, but throughout the film I've felt like there were multiple layers of metaphors that I was missing. It's not your typical film, that's for sure. All I can say is that you should go in blind, it's worth it."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,Quick. Metaphorical. Social. Postmodern. Beautiful.You miss if you don't watch it.
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"In some ways its kinda scary and its because you never know who you think you know. Also, this movie in some ways reminds me of Sweenie Todd and The Family in one. Anyway, better than both and is a must watch!"
PARASITE,3 January 2021,1/10,"I have been watching (and trying to watch) Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police/authorities hilariously incompetent. Both of which (no surprise) showed up in this film. They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism.The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar.The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?Everything about this movie is frustrating, it's like watching 90s hollywood action flick. All emotions, no realism."
PARASITE,22 September 2019,10/10,"When we were student in art faculty, our teachers use to say to us ""art or artist can't be unbiased, you pick a side and tell your story."" I never agreed. This film approved I was right."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens."
PARASITE,16 September 2020,9/10,"Went into this thinking there's no way it could live up to the hype after it's Oscar and BAFTA wins. Couldn't have been more wrong.An incredible piece of storytelling. Script is great, performances awesome and visually stunning. Even if you're not a fan of foreign language films and reading subtitles you need to give this a try. Very deserving of all the big award wins."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,I'm not really sure what this movie tried to To tell. Well the movie move very quickly between the scenes and there was some thriller it was not comedic in anyway. I'm still confused as to why the father decided to kill the other father however the ending is quite emotional and shows the in quality of life between the rich and poor and the hard work that comes from trying to be wealthy
PARASITE,17 November 2019,10/10,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,7/10,"Parasite is a very enjoyable film. There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,2/10,"So it started well with the first hour, then they didn't know what else to do with this so it became incredibly dumb. None of the characters had any substance or any interesting dialogue or anything really happening. It was very bland. The only enjoyable parts were when they showed the doggies. Nothing funny or suspenseful. I cannot believe theres this many Asians in the states that this turd won Oscars."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,"The movie 'parasite' was harrowing. Greed and envy - thats what it is about. Lying, cheating family traits, inflicting these lies on a kind family who employs them. First the son - lies about his tutoring qualifications and he cheats his way into manipulating the underage daughter he is tutoring. Through further subterfuge, his sister, father and mother all end up working for the family. Unbeknownst to them, the family of lying 'good for nothings' have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees, they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown.Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them? I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next. If enterprise and cunning got this family into employment, why were these skills not used for employment from lawful means?
The story is skillfully told but it is still a horrible story. There was little justice in the end, so it does make you regret watching it."
PARASITE,19 March 2020,6/10,"The story was good. Acting is great. It basically shows the reality of rich and poor difference that exists in our society no matter what. My only reason to give it 6 star is with all the hype this movie has, My expectations were way too high and sadly it didn't live upto that."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10"
PARASITE,5 January 2020,10/10,"This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,10/10,Stunning screenplay and wonderful acting by the whole team members. Director took the story to the next leave of film. The ending and the start of the story is obviously awesome. Thanks I enjoyed this Movie and loved it . The best Korean Film I have ever watched in this decade.
PARASITE,2 August 2020,1/10,After the hype train of this film hit critical I avoided this as I didn't want the hype to taint my view of it long enough I forgot about it. I recently watched it and boy oh boy was I disappointed. I think if it weren't for the edgy champagne socialist clique that controls the opinion of the world this movie would have died in obscurity as it rightly deserves. There is nothing good I can say about this. It's everything pretentious and wrong with those who think they are so in touch with what's cool and everyone must obey and see the world as they do.
PARASITE,6 November 2019,10/10,"""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,"""Snowpiercer"" is certainly the most competent Marxist allegory I've yet seen, so I looked forward to ""Parasite"" as a more ground-level discussion of how vast wealth warps society and leads to dire results.
It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: ""trickle down"".
""Trickle down"" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom.
Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen.
There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with.
But they're not happy, and anyone who believes ""trickle down"" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision?
A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,9/10,"What is most impressive should be two plots. The first was Jin Jiyu, when the family found the basement and knew each other's secrets with the Wenguang couple. As my eyes snuck into the dark basement along the fast follow-up lens, the similar techniques in Flash gradually appeared in my mind, which also made me feel very frightened and surprised. The stairs that continue to turn step by layer. In this portrayal of the lives of the bottom people, I feel strongly how terrible the word poverty is."
PARASITE,23 February 2021,8/10,"I watched this with no preconceptions - I knew it was Korean, and I knew it was laden with awards. But I didn't have a clue about the story. So I won't spoil anything in this review.It's easy to be be seduced by the style of this film. Calm, controlled camerawork and beautiful cinematography that makes full use of the available light, colour and weather.The story draws you in too. Perhaps a little slowly at first, but it reaches a fantastic climax, navigating through various genres as it gets there. It's an inspired bit of storytelling.But there are a few things that stop it from being a true masterpiece. The first hour is a little too slow. The combination of the subtitles and the low-key performances of several lead characters make it quite hard for a non-Korean speaking viewer to understand their motivations. And the greatest shame is that the final act is unconvincing when compared to what has preceded it.But well worth watching. The second hour is a stunning piece of cinema."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,2/10,"I watched Parasite with an open mind. I deliberately avoided reviews (far too many fake ones out there) and even the trailer. After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of ""Best film EVER!!!"" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done. Films you actually don't want to end, rather than praying for them to finish one hour in."
PARASITE,13 December 2019,9/10,"This was intriguing from the start, but I was worried that the different cutural values might prevent my enjoyment. My concern disappeared as the film became more and more bizarre; I was completely caught up."
PARASITE,27 September 2020,7/10,"I think it's fair to point out that this film goes off the rails at the end. I'm not sure why the director thought it needed a big climactic ending. It's a pet peeve of mine when a writer can't think of any other way to close a character arc or plotline then to literally kill off characters who no longer serve a purpose. The finale here feels forced and out of place considering how methodical and slow-burning the first hundred and twenty minutes were. When your themes are so simple and messages so obvious, plot and characters are all you've really got to hang your hat on. And in Parasite it falls flat.And for those snobs who accuse everyone who finds any fault with this movie as some cinematically-illiterate fool who only watches Hollywood blockbusters, I think The Servant (1963) handled this same basic plot with more nuance and emotional impact."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,"To link and tie the story together which starts as comedy - then to drama - and then thriller, and ends with crime seamlessly is simply phenomenal. The only reason why I gave it a 9 is I am not a fan of subtitles. It truly is top-notch brilliant filmmaking by Joon Ho. He deserves all the Oscars wins. Bravo!"
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"The vague incisions that are carved in your mind as you navigate through the elusive metaphors within the movie become clearer as the plot develops and unwillingly grips you with a truly unique plot, charismatic characters, sagacious dialogue, and unexpected events that last from beginning to end. The complexity of the plot resists in helping you answer questions like: Who has the higher moral standpoint? Who deserves to get the upper hand? Is the Kim family truly malevolent? If you were in their position would you do the same? Do you feel compassion and sympathy for Ki-Taek even after killing Mr. Park?The movie accomplishes a feat that most movies nowadays are not able to: every single character is complex enough to merit forgiveness, understanding, and redemption. One character, despite all the deficits and obstacles, is attempting to survive to be able to get an education, wealth, and prestige, be secure financially and equally valuable as the Park family is; he is trying not to be a parasite. Another character is freer and careless, even self-destructive, acceptant of that fate that life has bestowed her. A bit more lost, but ultimately only guilty of attempting to have enough money to help the family. In the entire movie you cannot find a single instance of sadism or even malevolence from any of the ""parasites"". They are fervently trying to survive and equipped with sufficient cunning to achieve their goals and can you blame them?After an hour of receiving the earnest nature of the message of parasite, I recognized that the movie is not particularly expressing a message about meritocracy. If there is a central element of this movie it is social mobility or the lack thereof. The Kim family was attempting to survive, yes; they deserved better circumstances, maybe, but their main juncture was the fact that they are attempting to progress and elevate themselves in the social hierarchy: social mobility. Anyone with a modicum of empathy can empathize with the ruthless suffering of the lower class or underrepresented = the Kim family. The director tries to demonstrate in creative forms the insensitivity of the wealthy class to the precarious nature of the poor. The movie is basically a metaphor of class struggle with comedic, dramatic, and violent gestures.How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances? This is, in straightforward terms, the dilemma of the movie. I am going to be your parasite, because you do not respect me nor help me, quite the contrary: you think I'm lesser than you, dirtier than you, and smellier than you. As a parasite I will inhabit your body and nourish myself taking advantage of you, while possibly murdering you. It's a harsh message, but a real one. Many people are living in untenable conditions, while the wealthy class excuse themselves with meritocracy while they enjoy their opulence.In the movie as the Kim family understands the crude reality of social mobility they eventually become desperate, violent, and homicidal. The inhumane elitism of the Park family becomes more apparent even after traumatic situations happen. This is one of the morals of the narrative. Elitism will usually triumph against the working class and the myth of social mobility proliferated in class struggle might have to be debunked with bloodshed and imagination. There is a line in the movie that expresses the other moral really well: ""If I had all this money and freedom, I would probably be a good person. Heck, I would probably be a much better person than Ms. Park"". Finally, Ki-Taek reflection after escaping the flooded house is the last moral of the movie: ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" In this case, Ki-Taek reflects on his situation and tries to justify his failure by habituating his son to a life of no strategy, plan or ambition. He wants his son to love him, but in his desperation he is also habituating him to failure: make them believe that chaos and degeneracy is their only option, and they will attempt to live happily within their exploitation."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,9/10,"This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.The movie was good. Lol."
PARASITE,14 September 2020,8/10,"Went in with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least. Didn't know much about the movie prior which is the best way to go into this. The film takes you for a ride with moments of comedy, terror, suspense and everything in between. Very well done and solid acting all the way around except for the ""simple"" wife which I didn't care too much about."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,3/10,"Since Hollywood is hosting the Oscars , they have different categories ; ie such as foreign film. Now that is the field this should have been in , and only that.
Since The Oscar is intended for the USA not the world. Hollywood needs to rethink giving away the farm.
Case in point Slumdog Millionaire , stole the Oscar from Benjamin Button
likely because of a sense of pity.
As for this film , it was ok , not spectacular , subtitles were annoying.
Likely won't be seen much, due to lack of interest."
PARASITE,11 March 2020,9/10,"Ok, the korean guys are always seen as the second or third best movie makers in the hollywood and bollywood businness but hold on.I started watching with the idea: why the damn a korean movie earned so many academy oscars, what did the US movie makers have forgotten that this movie stamps it.It doesnt show it clearly at the start but after all the movie scenario been stablished something good is not right.US - Learn from it, please"
PARASITE,15 December 2020,6/10,"The one thing I got from this movie is that Bong Joon-ho must really hate rich people. This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing. Rich vs poor. This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars.
This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family. In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process. And yet at the end of the film we're supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified.Or maybe we're not supposed to feel that it's justified because I sure didn't.Not really sure why it got so much praise. Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots. Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it. It was entertaining and well made but I didn't like the ending at all."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises.
The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone.
Satirical, metaphorical, genius, paradoxical, impulsive, genuine; watch this movie!!!!"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,6/10,"An OK movie, but it's light years away from even being a nominee for Oscar not to mention wining it."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,"Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?"
PARASITE,17 January 2021,9/10,"Plot is perfect. there is just no flaw that is even slightly noticed. acting of all cast members are good. music accompanies scenes very well. the movie covers all genres without making any too much. funny, touching, suspending, sexual, family moments are all there, even horror ones. what left in your mind is a subtle yet powerful message about class discrimination in Korea. It truly deserves the Oscar without needing to employ politics or racial issues."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,This movie is amazing! One of the best films I have ever seen. Parasite definitely deserved to win Best Picture despite no matter how much a certain somebody disagrees. Don't let subtitles keep you from experiencing this wonderful piece of movie art!
PARASITE,18 January 2020,9/10,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker
PARASITE,17 May 2020,5/10,"Besides the storyline, all other aspects in this movie including actings, cinematography are good.. but for all the hype i thought it has a clever storyline.. but its not.. the development of the story depends on one silly mistake.. which for me a sign of a weak plot..How could the whole family which could not even fold the pizza boxes properly could suddenly be shown as so good in what they do? and if they are really that good how come they could not get proper jobs at other places all these while?so does the movie trying to tell us how selfish the rich people are and we should be emphatic to the poor?.. I did not get that at all.. its just a simple message that if youre a bad person, youre a bad person no matter whether youre rich or poor.. because its so obvious kim's family are greedy, selfish immoral people too.."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,6/10,"Pretty simply, I was expecting a slow burn thriller with an jaw dropping ending...I mean, this did beat out 1917 for best picture and that movie blew me away!So i watched with anticipation, waiting for that screw to turn...waiting and waiting until the final act when the resolution hit and I was like...uh, that's it?? I wont say what it is, but it was very underwhelming.This is not a horrible movie, but its in no way a 10 or worthy of an oscar."
PARASITE,11 September 2020,10/10,"This film possesses a little bit of everything. Beautiful cinematography, intensely thrilling, poignant and funny, this is Bong Joon-Ho at his scintillating best. It's the type of film that film students will analyse for years to come, and the type of film that would make even a complete newcomer to cinema want to go out and make a film.The best film of 2019, and easily one of the best films of the decade. An unparrelled thing of beauty."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,10/10,"I hate myself. I hate myself for not seeing this movie sooner.Holy hell...that was just...INCREDIBLE! This is seriously the greatest film I've sat through. This was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I've ever been through. Give me any genre, this movie will cover it masterfully. This was a masterpiece. A masterpiece that greats like Martin Scorcese have yet to feat. You have no idea how hard that is for me to say because I adore Scorcese's movies. And like many, I regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of our time next to Spielberg.Bong Joon Ho can't get more possible praise because his work, and his breathtakingly talented cast was just amazing! I think I just watched a classic. A modern classic that will be studied for all time to come. I was happy that Parasite won most of their awards at the Oscars, including establishing a landmark for the Oscars by being the first non-english film to win Best Picture. But after watching this masterpiece, If Parasite didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it went to films like Joker, 1917 or OUATIH, it would be the worst Oscar year in history.I'm telling you, if you don't watch this, you can't consider yourself a true movie lover, because this movie has made it practically impossible for all succeeding Best Picture winners to live up to this.WATCH IT!
Final Rating- 70/10"
PARASITE,13 May 2020,8/10,"When there are differences among people, and such differences have led to some people have the status, power and privilege over others, it is called social class. In this way, the society classifies all kinds of people into different classes or grades"
PARASITE,5 July 2021,5/10,"I don't know how to describe what I watched. Mixed feelings. Starts good but as the plot goes by it totally changes. There are not the known ""bad ""and ""good"" characters. Everyone in this movie act for his own good trying to protect his family. A totally allegorical movie with some weird morals.Sorry but I wouldn't like to watch this movie again."
PARASITE,2 May 2020,10/10,"I've had my eye on this movie for quite a while, because I have to talk myself into watching movies with subtitles. I'm am extremely grateful that I did. I now understand the multiple reasons this movie garnered it's acclaim. Name a genre and this movie covers it. If you haven't seen it, do it."
PARASITE,5 March 2020,9/10,"Funny, Dark, Weird, Wonderful, Predictable, unpredictable.This movie literally had everything!I was't even sure I could do two hours + of subtitles, but it was easy in the end. Nice fast pace, bits of humour and bits of darkness.Nothing not to like, whatever genre of picture you prefer."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,9/10,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,7/10,"I thought it is a movie talking about a disease ot a parasite which will end the world but i found that they were the parasite 😄
A good movie may be I underrated it because i was preparing myself to watch something different"
PARASITE,28 March 2021,1/10,"I LOVED Snowpiercer, I LIKED The Host!But this one... oh my my! The Parasite is such a disappointment after the above mentioned movies. Dull dragging preachy drama. You'd fare better and find more excitement attending a Catholic Mass or reading Encylopedia !!!"
PARASITE,22 May 2020,10/10,"With every genre this movie steps it's foot in, it knocks the performance out of the park. Whether it be comedy, horror, thriller, you name it, this film delivers. Films of this nature can oftentimes be predictable, leaving the resulting action to feel, dull. This film will have you on the edge of your seat for more than half of its duration, and leave you shocked at the end."
PARASITE,3 May 2021,5/10,"In the last few years I pretty much exclusively watch Korean television (apart from a few good Chinese dramas) and this is why...
Incredible story telling, brilliant acting and an ability to create a story where warmth, kindness, humility, villains, tragedy and decency are skilfully blended into a story that takes you on a journey with enough realism and fiction to leave you satisfied and happy. They don't have to be rom coms, it doesn't seem to matter what the genre, most (of course not all) leave you not just entertained but are thought provoking too.With this in mind and all the hype and awards this film received, I felt that I should watch it.I can take weird, some parts of many K dramas are a bit weird but in a good or at least tolerable way. It wasn't that I didn't understand what the writer was trying to convey, I just felt it was all over the place, with no actual storyline. K dramas are not like US or UK dramas, they are basically one long film divided into episodes which allows complex characters, touching and thought-provoking moments and interesting story lines to develop. For this reason, the film felt really short to me. I'm so disappointed. The acting was good but I felt the sofa scene and ending in very poor taste not to mention the unbelievable recovery of the son! I think I will stick to my well selected K dramas and definitely avoid this writer from now on. Don't judge all Korean television by this drama unless of course you loved it which surprisingly many seem to."
PARASITE,2 December 2021,8/10,"This movie was fantastic from the dialogue to the great scene presence of some of the characters. There is great humor, sadness and terror from this gem. Amazing story telling that really shocks and excites you as a viewer."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,9/10,"""Parasites"" uses a family of four to find ways to parasitize the exaggerated acts of rich people, slowly showcasing the opposition and impending crisis of the upper and lower social classes of the Park and Jin families due to wealth. Both films start with joy and end with sorrow, and the starting point for these social events is money."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,6/10,"The great thing about this movie is that rich people actually do nothing wrong. The husband and wife are loving, the children are gratifying, there is no derailment, there is no cold violence, there is no child abuse, and the driver and the servant are generous. Judging from the movies, they are stupid and have more money. They do not have their own main ideas. They are turned around by the poor, as if to play a role in highlighting the poor."
PARASITE,17 September 2020,10/10,Contains every genre u can think of ..desrved oscar
PARASITE,1 November 2019,5/10,"I am being generous with the 3 stars because films like Charlie's Angels exist, but this has to be one of the biggest disappointment of films I have ever seen based on reviews. This has like a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 95% on Metacritic...are people smoking crack or paid off? This movie is just plain stupid, it's like a teen ""caper"" movie, just ridiculous stupidity being called ""satire"".What annoys me most are these holier than thou critics who are slamming a brilliant, iconic film that is one of the best to come along in 25 years, calling its irresponsible and violent while praising a film about lying, cheating, stealing and actually killing to get ahead in life. Actual children are killed, some bashed in the head, multiple people stabbed, and this is somehow okay because somewhere some darling critic said it was good and the rest of the sheep followed. This film is silly and the message is disgusting. At least some of the folks here at IMDB aren't brainwashed.Yeah, so a film about not being holes to the mentally ill (or anyone) because it hurts, can aggravate their conditions and drive people to suicide or murder is ""bad"" but a film about falsely accusing people to get them fired so you can steal their job, then murder them along with their employers for no reason but greed is ""great"" in whacky CriticLand.Nothing from this film will be remembered next year. Nobody will be talking about it. Nobody will care. Save your money and just watch a teen movie on cable where they are trying to sneak into someone's house and get out before the parents get home. Same level of nonsense."
PARASITE,17 September 2021,7/10,I didn't feel their was enough buildup to justify the abrupt criminal act at the end of the movie. Felt contrived and forced.
PARASITE,4 February 2020,9/10,"This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,9/10,"Saw ""Parasite"" yet again and was once again entranced by the movie's brutal depiction of the ramifications of being vulnerable. But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. ""Parasite"" is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black & White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved ""Parasite"", watch Jordan Peele's ""Us""."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite seizes our expectations, breaks them down, builds them up, and knocks them down once more.
This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre, refusing to pigeonhole its ambition.
Straddling the line between comedy, thriller, and horror, the production presents the conceptual 'parasite' as the underlying motif; it's a profound, tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical, sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host.
Decorated with multidimensional metaphors, signs and symbols, it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo-ho's flavoursome visual poetry.Should you laugh or cry? Take sides, or simply observe the events unfold? In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive.
In stirring and string-pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clichés does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have.While slow in places, and with an occasional plothole, this was overall a gorgeously shot, satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment; presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy.8.4/10"
PARASITE,9 February 2021,10/10,"Not sure why I'm leaving a review here as everything that's to be said about the film has been said. So all I'll say is watch it, and be happy that movies like this are still being made."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,1/10,"I don't care about the Oscars, this is just not a good film at all."
PARASITE,14 September 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!"
PARASITE,4 November 2019,10/10,"I generally never watch foreign language movies because I'm annoyed by the subtitles. But this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals, the acting, the premise the shifts in the tone, you never know what's going to happen next. I don't understand Korean but still I could connect and realte to the characters.
After watching Joker, I wasn't expecting any other film this year to even come near it. But this came out like an underdog! Both are 10 on 10 for me.
I wish such movies are made more. I hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films. This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear."
PARASITE,17 December 2019,10/10,"This film is a masterpiece, a cinematic slap. Parasite is cinematic perfection. It's not just my favourite film of the year, it's in my top 5 of my best movies of the last decade. Just when you think you know what type of movie it is, it suddenly becomes a completely different movie when you least expect it. Crazy, funny, incredibly smart. I loved it. I've tried to keep my review to a minimum because the less said about this movie the better, everyone needs to see this movie !"
PARASITE,18 January 2020,6/10,"This is not about the first half or weird second half of the movie. Personally, I don't like stories that are so ridiculously unbelievable advertised as plausible. A good premise, that turned into a dumb plot twist that worked for the writer director but not me. In the end it made no sense and if all that happened it might have been news worthy but not cinema."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,10/10,I've never watched a movie like this one. It's a masterpiece.
PARASITE,29 July 2020,8/10,The film wasn't at all what I expected but it was great. Realize bizarre story with great acting.
PARASITE,22 March 2020,4/10,"I often watch Korean movies, and they do have a style that is proper to them. I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art.
This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry ... even got an Oscar ; by watching the cover and the title, i didn't want to watch this movie. But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie.
To me, i didn't find the ""humour"" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour).
The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like ""Parasite"").
The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy.
All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped.
I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois."
PARASITE,5 September 2021,5/10,"Nope. I care nothing about these characters nothing. This is something happening in a lot of current film and television, the inability for me to care about the good or the bad characters. All these people's story are for me just average. I've seen these stories told before.The movie needed editing. Could have easily been 1.5 hours. The end seemed drawn out and rushed all at the same time.The camera work and color is beautiful. That's about it. Best picture...please give me a break."
PARASITE,28 October 2020,10/10,"Wow, what can I say? It started out as a very clever comedy and gradually gets quite dark. I was very moved at the end. A hard film to describe really.
The longest film I've ever watched with subtitles and it kept me engrossed all the way through, you never really know where it's going. Watch it."
PARASITE,31 March 2020,8/10,"If this movie wasn't the top movie that its name is telling the entire story then at least it's one of the top five!
The idea is totally new and it's just exceptional
It was recommended it to me by a friend and I would recommend it to everyone in return!"
PARASITE,23 January 2020,9/10,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,8/10,"To be frank on my first watch I didn't feel much great about the movie... But then I read, watched some videos and now I enjoy the movie very much... It's an artistic beauty... I guess for usual audience (like me) it's just an okay movie but we need to dig this movie deeper to enjoy it completely"
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,I didnt get carried away it was a brilliantly crafted film showing the haves as a bit dense and the have not far more clever but because they had to be. It had brilliant twists and turns and deserves all the accolades. But best film. No. Films that should get best film are those you should visit a cinema for get the whole experience. Parasite will be remarkable on DVD which some films lose that cinematic experience that's why I don't rate it as 10 but that's me and I respect those that think otherwise.
PARASITE,14 February 2020,6/10,"Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical."
PARASITE,9 November 2019,8/10,"This was a throughly engrossing film. Certainly something all movie lovers should seek out and see. Funny, Nuanced, Suspenseful, and poignant. It really has something to say and the performances are all just great. This is why we go to the movies"
PARASITE,8 July 2020,3/10,"Exaggerated acting ( which even in Korean standards were terrible ) , really long unnecessary guilt trip to poverty. Most of the viewers will bored before the second half and the ones that say they loved the movie are just afraid to be labelled as ignorant or racist. I am not saying this is a terrible movie , but before declaring this one as One of the greatest in Asian cinema , try watching several Asian movies . There is nothing new or nothing eye opening about this movie. It is just another marvel of marketing. Anyway I will not suggest this one to anybody. Go watch les-miserables if you wish to watch a guilt trip movie with a style and quality."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,9/10,"I had no idea what this movie was about and I suggest you watch it knowing the same. I loved the twist and turns, the not knowing what was going to happen next. At times, It had me on the edge of my seat, other times it had me laughing out loud. Don't let the subtitles put you off either. I got so sucked into this movie that I forgot they were even there. This movie is so different to most, I feel I haven't watched anything like this before. Ignore the negative reviews. I have read some saying this movie is overrated and terrible, then i noticed the grammar and the spelling and it all made sense. They didn't understand it. This movie is VERY good. Enjoy.
9/10"
PARASITE,19 August 2019,10/10,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
PARASITE,24 October 2021,5/10,Like many korean movies - this is flush with good actors and great visuals - but the story is twisted - at least there is a certain amount of sanity from the wealthy family - strangely enuf - while the desperately poor family at the heart of the film - are so depraved that i thought they deserved their station in lifethe first half of the film showed this miserable family displaying such skill and intelligence and adaptability - that it didn't seem possible they were the same people seen at the start of the filmi quickly got bored waiting for the axe to fall - and their plans to go awry - but it took many dreary minutes for it to happenthe second half was action filled - and tense - and chalk full of unexpected moments - if the story had moved more quickly to this part - i wouldn't be so down on the filmbut it didn't - it's 2 hrs 12 minutes - much of it in the accompaniment of unpleasant people - who don't all get what they deserved.
PARASITE,2 November 2019,9/10,Holy crap this movie was fantastic I've never been so invested in a foreign film before. Go see this immediately.
PARASITE,6 February 2020,6/10,"Why is it that foreign, sub-titled movies, get a higher rating? This was just a plain dumb movie. All hype - no substance. What was with that ending? Artsy-fartsy, wish-in-one-hand, crapolla? I actually liked the businessman's wife. I really hoped that ALL the leach's would be exposed for the skum they were, suffer miserably, and die. Society already rewards dishonesty, and the last thing I want to watch is some farce that almost justifies it."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,9/10,"The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually do nothing wrong.The couples love each other, the children are happy. No cheating, no cold violence, no child abuse. They are really really kind and simple, but you just can't help but hate them."
PARASITE,4 March 2021,1/10,"Self-righteous, preachy, and completely awful. Slow year in movies I suppose. Shouldn't have won anything besides a Razzie. Blech. Barf. Bunk."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,4/10,"The first half of this movie is soooooo slowww. Takes forever for the exposition. Easily a half hour could have been edited out.Then, with no forewarning, the guy in the basement turns out to be nuts. The slasher scene that follows is unexpected, unnecessary, and ridiculous. Way too gory.This film is obviously the flavor of the month, but the plot holes don't hold up."
PARASITE,21 June 2019,7/10,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,9/10,"Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!"
PARASITE,15 November 2019,1/10,"In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!"
PARASITE,23 September 2020,9/10,I loved the movie and it's concept. I felt the ending was a bit disturbing. I would personally recommend for teens who are 15+. Kids might find this movie a bit disturbing. Loved how the family got themselves a job.
PARASITE,10 November 2019,10/10,"At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other.
Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,9/10,Amazing movie i loved it so much i think this movie is revealing for us the other side of movies we don't care about because it is just did not made in Hollywood it is legendary and i think i will remember every detail of it even if i saw one time because simply it is special. Great job.
PARASITE,30 December 2019,10/10,"Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,1/10,"Maybe it's because I watch KDramas but I did not like this movie. One doesn't leave this movie and say, ""Oh, I wish there would be a sequel!"". Or, dream happy thoughts about the joy of watching it. All I can think about is who reviewed this movie and what were they thinking when they awarded it? Is this ""Top Drawer"" for what people want to see? Is this ugly, uninspiring and violent film one we want the next generation to prolificate? I hope not! Give me, ""Crashing Down On You"" as a movie and it would probably bring in as many dollars as Downton Abbey. This movie hasn't gone off the charts with numbers of viewers. It was slow, off kilter, bad language and unreasonably violent at the end - it was like a bad ""Chuckie"" movie. This film has probably ended some to watching Korean films."
PARASITE,12 January 2021,8/10,"I loved this film! It's one of those films that astonish you and make you think about the film much after it has ended.
It studies class divide in a post-modern world and has so many elements to it that one needs to watch a video explaining the film.Sometimes it may feel over-exaggerating, but I can't fault the director for this style, which does truly make him the Kafka of our times.Thank you for the film of the year and congratulations on being the first foreign language film to win the Oscar!"
PARASITE,22 March 2021,7/10,"I had a few expectations about this film but I was a little concerned because I dont like to lose time. Decided to give it a try and was surprised by the trama until middle of the film, when it changes completely from drama to futile violence. Really disappointed."
PARASITE,26 November 2021,7/10,"I enjoyed the film and yes the reviews are a little overrated. Regardless it was a fun watch,
Plan to read the whole movie, at times the subtitles were a little hard to read because the color would blend in with the color of the scene. I wish I could have dubbed the language over to English."
PARASITE,30 March 2020,9/10,Bong Joon-ho delivers a biting satirical thriller about class warfare and social inequality.' 🎭🇰🇷
PARASITE,7 March 2020,8/10,"This is definitely worth a watch. I think this film is going to be a catalyst for an appreciation of foreign films given the Academy Award. For us that are accustomed to foreign films, this film the the type of quality we generally expect and I personally wasn't blown away but I do believe that it's important this film won Best Picture(especially given where we are culturally). This film is actually an easy access as well as a great starting point if you want to go down the wormhole and discover even greater foreign gems!"
PARASITE,7 January 2020,9/10,"""Feels good movie... Family movie... Masterpiece... Survival... Lifestyle... Life lessons... Morality...rich and poor... humanity... love... peace... Movie lovers must watch this movie."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,6/10,I could not quite grasp the idea of the movie because of the inconsistent characters. Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script. Unfolding of the events push the credibility of the movie to the level of cartoons watched by the kids. Watchable but not an Oscar movie in my opinion.
PARASITE,5 September 2019,10/10,"I had a very high expectation for ""Parasite"", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!"
PARASITE,19 August 2021,10/10,"Like Rahman's songs, its a movie that lingers on your mind long after you watched it. The lower class struggle and the way they see and feel jealous of the upper class even unknowingly is beautifully presented. Must watch for any human nature observer."
PARASITE,1 July 2019,6/10,"I have high expectation for this movie, but end up it was just ok. I can see the rich family is rich but not too luxury as I expected and the poor family still can buy beers, they should made the gap more dramatic. The acting is good no doubt, but the story just okay. The plot twist didn't surprised me at all tho, I still can figure how this film will end."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,7/10,"In the opening scene of Parasite, a family struggles to get the WiFi signal in their phone. Ki-Woo gets on top of the shelf and manages to catch the singal. This scene describes the entire film: a family of poor people trying to reach the top. They devise a cunning plan and the entire family gets into the house of a rich family, fooling them in the process. What follows is a story that sometimes struggles to maintain a brisk pace.
The film is loaded with metaphors. Beneath all those metaphors, is the concept of disparity between the poor and the rich. The rich, oblivious to the plight of the people who work under them, continue to lead a life sucking on the blood of the poor. This is shown in the scene where a man hiding in the basement of the house of Mr. Park switches on the lights in the stairs everyday when Mr.Park comes home. Mr.Park however believes that is the work of the motion sensors.
There is even the fight among the poor to get their hands on the wealth of the rich. The entire second half of the film is not about the tensions between the Parks and their servants. It is between two groups of servants of the family, each trying to suppress the other.
The idea that the Parks live in a house unaware of a man living in their basement is an allusion to the perpetual, simmering tensions between the working class and the affluent.
The final moments of the film are a complete mess with violence and bloodshed. Critics of Joker should have spoken about this too. The hate the poor have towards the rich is more pronounced in this film than in Joker.
Leaving aside the social commentary, the pacing of the film is very irregular. There are scenes that bursts with energy and freshness and there are those that test the patience. Also, the reason why Mr.Park gets killed is obscure. May be, Kang-Ho song was pushed to his limit. May be, Mr.Park crossed the line, which Kang-Ho song didn't. May be he was anguished when his daughter gets stabbed. May be, it is the combination of all those reasons.
Parasite is a disturbing film that will leave an indelible mark on you. Still, the screenplay loses its focus in a many scenes."
PARASITE,12 August 2019,10/10,A film talks about class dividends. performance wise all actors makes their job perfect.technically best all technical aspects are top notch. Bong joon ho delivers a gem.perfect film for palm d or in Cannes.
PARASITE,31 December 2019,9/10,Terrific performances. Very much enjoyed this film. Beautiful camera work. The cast was nearly spot on. The direction was outstanding. Great work to all of them.
PARASITE,1 May 2020,7/10,"The allegory of Parasite is well understood by everyone. The rich live in a big house and enjoy a prosperous life. The poor live in a semi-basement, exuding the smell of poverty. The poor imagine that they can also be the masters of the big house , Can also climb relatives of the upper class, but do not know that there is a more desperate place in the underground of the mansion, the bottom floor does not see the sun, live a cockroach-like life, the upward path has been sealed, and the downward path is like a black hole Clutching you like that. The film shows an almost epitome of life in a contemporary society in an almost absurd and desperate style. At the bottom, the upper class is a kind of almost Stockholm-like worship, but resent the poor who live better than him. The dream of breaking the class barriers shattered and fell into the abyss of fate, but the son dreamed of buying that house so that one day his father could walk up from the ground and into the sun. The plot of his son's letter was filled with the most desperate emotion in the film. We all know that this is impossible, they are Sisyphus pushing the stone up the mountain, they are destined to be trapped in this fate."
PARASITE,21 June 2020,8/10,Creative good character development. The story moves well . not much else Tbh
PARASITE,30 April 2020,8/10,"In the delicate flowers lie down on the wide mountain to sit down
Wake up in the new house and the screen opens
Just think of the former house
""The human soul can live in the past and in the future. I hope my soul can bloom on the decay like this basement."""
PARASITE,13 May 2020,10/10,"What begins as a comedic social satire soon descends into sharp absurdism depicting the apathetic and degrading treatment of the poor by the economic elite. The escalation of violence is understandable once it is made apparent just how apathetic the house owners are to those dying right in front of them... With the rich father being more disgusted by the smell than the carnage itself. It is a very wonderfully crafted depiction.While the caretaking family does commit fraud, their actions are simply to survive and create a ladder that has been otherwise made inaccessible... Although they too themselves are not immune to the allure of the niceties of luxury... Ultimately a night of reckless greed inadvertently leads to their own demise.The ending is icing on the cake and highlights the futile struggle of those born at the bottom to ever hope to own what is held carelessly by the top. The son of the caretaking family hopes to someday purchase the luxury house as his father has been forced to hide in the bunker to avoid persecution by the authorities. Of course, save for some miracle of chance, there is no hope to achieve this in their economic situation.Performances are masterclass in this film by the entire cast. What is in essence a mundane situation is made interesting and thrilling by the excellent direction and screenplay."
PARASITE,15 May 2020,10/10,"I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie, or anyone I wouldn't want to show this movie.(Okay but the soundtrack is really good though. Like really good. Like really really really good. Like re"
PARASITE,2 June 2020,9/10,"Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing movie. And in my opinion could have been perfect."
PARASITE,8 March 2021,6/10,"It's a Will Ferrell comedy. Yep, a Will Ferrell comedy.""Poor family outsmarts a clueless, out-of-touch rich family and takes over the house"" is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot.Ignore how beautiful the movie looks: the poor family's cramped, dirty house and the rich family's pristine, futuristic house.Ignore the fact that it's a foreign film: There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it's in a different language and liking the film makes them smart.If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes, you would think the movie was average. Or maybe even terrible. One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents' car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it.Maybe the Will Ferrell/Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic. My point is, if you set aside the fact that it's an immensely well made foreign film (on a technical level!), Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling.There are no memorable characters in this movie (except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film, but only because he was so over-the-top). A perfect example is the poor family. They're basically the same person.For the most part, the rich couple are the usual snooty, dimwitted suburban snobs we've seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies.Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family. The back-and-forth between them was interesting, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.It's a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language. As far as I can tell, the acting was just okay. No groundbreaking performances. Just people sitting (or standing) around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments.Oh and there's a murder at the end that feels out of place.Obviously, movie isn't terrible. The visuals were incredible. The scene where the poor family's neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous.I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"What ever brought this movie its Palm and its Oscar, I couldn't find it on the screen, and no I am not offended, neither by its story nor its violence.
Try to catch Harold Pinters/Joseph Losey's The Servant (1963) starring Dirk Bogarde and you'll Se a similar theme screened in perfection, with better actors and a much better camera work.
Sorry,"
PARASITE,31 October 2019,9/10,"I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"This won BP because it was the best overall movie based on all of the nominees. It had good: acting, directing, original screenplay, score, and cinematography.All of the other nominees were good in only one or two categories, maybe three. But this movie checked all the boxes.If you only wanted acting, you see Joker or Irishman; if you only wanted visuals and cinematography, then you see 1917; if all you wanted was acting and set design, then you see Once Upon a Time; if all you wanted was actresses, then you see Marriage Story, Bombshell, or Judy.But if you want the whole package, then this was the best movie of the nine nominees as a whole, and that's why it won. When voters vote, the ultimate winner is also decided by how many 2nd place votes a movie gets, so the winner will gets lots of 2nd place votes in addition to the 1s, and that's finally why it won."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"This movie has lots o technical merits from writing to music to cinematography and editing, directing and acting. The story is interesting and weird, but in a good way. It was different and fun, funny, and suspenseful.But the implied suggestion that there was depth inside of the movie was not very accurate since the movie never really identifies exactly who the parasite is in the class dichotomies; common sense would assume it's referring to the poor people living in the basement or that just finagled their way in, but if the movie was really trying to be artistically grey or ambiguous, it didn't do a good job of portraying the wealthy as that bad of people.For example, the only thing the wealthy did wrong was imply minor drug use and make fun of the way the man smelled, and frankly, who doesn't like good hygiene? They weren't overly mean about it. They were paying the man good money and were professional and nice to him. And for the drugs well, there are all kinds of drugs and it's not uncommon for any classes of people not to experiment once in their life if not more. So if the film was trying to suggest rich people are equally abhorrent as the poor people in the movie, it didn't really stand out.No, to extrapolate that kind of conclusion, one would have to step back from the movie and just analyze the title itself, Parasite, and then evaluate, speculate, and rationalize on their own in a way the movie only grazes, yet doesn't facilitate. Since the wealthy family is simple hard working and earned their wealth and all they are trying to do is make their children happy and healthy, there is nothing wrong with that. They earned their money through hard work. The other poor family was mostly lazy. Sure they had some bad luck with the economy, but they weren't seeking work until the son started the whole scheme.To say that both families were Parasites based on what was shown would conclusively be erroneous, as a result. However, since the movie does raise the subject, perhaps not the Parks themselves, but apparently wealthy people can be parasitic; yes, they may earn their wealth despite having a leg up head start in the world with wealthy families themselves, but that doesn't make them perfect or overall good people. They can abuse and exploit poorer people, or in this instance they can feel no empathy for a family like the Kims whose circumstances were originally based on bad luck, or the byproduct of the bad economy. In other words, the film doesn't really portray the concept accurately, but yes, there are wealthy families worse than the Parks who despite their money are also Parasites. Not sure the movie was trying to metaphorically or ambiguously hint at this, but it didn't do a great job of it, although it does raise the subject.It was a good overall movie though nonetheless.8/10"
PARASITE,22 March 2020,9/10,If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Bong Joon Ho and everyone else put in to make this happen.I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.Thank you.
PARASITE,17 March 2020,5/10,"This movie just wasn't for me. It's very symbolic, which means you can interpret almost every scene and give it some special meaning. But at the end of the day it was such a strange movie with characters that weren't likable at all, and whatever message it tried to convey, it wasn't doing it in an appealing way. I feel like this is one of those movies suddenly everyone is talking about and so it became bigger than it deserved. And that comes from someone who admired Korean movies for almost a decade now."
PARASITE,12 December 2019,9/10,"The Film starts slow and steady, with Nicely captured Visuals, as the film proceeded it Gets intresting at some point there're some unexpected turn arounds and during the climax the film leaves you anxious, one of the finest films that i have watched"
PARASITE,10 January 2020,9/10,"This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,10/10,"A lot of people don't think it's fair that parasite won at the 2020 oscars. But you know what, I think they absolutely did. The cinematography is just out of this world. And just when you think you got the plot all winded up your finger the thread spins right off and the movie takes a MASSIVE turn. Like holy the fact that the old maid came back was weird but when her fricking husband was just chilling in the basement.... DAMN. The script is just so gorgeous and detailed. The way were everything is planned out, the way it should be with a good movie. Each line fits perfectly in every scene and everything is so balanced out. From the beginning of the movie i felt like everything had already fallen into place. The actors are so good. Obviously i'd never heard of them but omg... so good. You should really watch those cheesy videos about '10 things you've missed in...' but in this movie it's actually really interesting. Like the part where there is always a slight 'line' in shots between the wealthy and 'poor' people, which makes sense to the line that the rich dad said 'he always seems to cross the line but ends up to just not do it..' It's a small detail but when you pay attention to it it all starts making sense. Or the realisation point in the end where Kim was now hiding in the basement was so mesmerising. The way they played back every move he took to get there. Also when they needed to get rid of the maid, every scene perfectly balanced out with the previous and next one. Everything fitted into everything. Just perfect!"
PARASITE,26 October 2019,10/10,"Although Bong Joon-Ho's American movies have been subpar, his Korean movies still continue to be must see, especially on the big screen. His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at. Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background, which most certainly was not put there by accident. If you have seen Joon-Ho's other film, you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts.
Honestly, this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it. I can't stop thinking about all the excitement, agony, disturbance, turmoil, and sorrow that was brought upon me. Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters. It certainly deserves the Palme d'Or (I haven't seen The Lighthouse yet) and all the praise that comes with it. I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I'm most certain it won't because it's an international film (bunch of cowards).
This film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs. the poor (a common theme for Korean movies). At the beginning, the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people. Later on, after making money beyond their wildest dream, they slowly started to change. For example, before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house, they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be. After the money had been rolling in, they decided that they had enough ""status"" to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out. Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image.
My favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette. For some reason that scene just resonates with me. She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded. Her home, the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone. So she sits there on top of a toilet that's now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste. She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard.
The dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film. He had for the longest time, wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him.
From what I just said above, I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house. Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status. The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes. The son, after he gets out of the hospital, went back to the house to check on, I presume, the girl. They are all drawn to the place.
As a cinephile, I was pleased to go into this blind. The less you know, the better and the more suspense you will feel. There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act. The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone.
The only drawback I have for the US release is, the film was very limited in my area. It wasn't too bad for me but from what I read, other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away. I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films, but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,10/10,"As director Bong Joon-ho said during his Golden Globe-speech after winning best foreign film for ""parasite"": ""Once you overcome the one-inch tall barriers of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."", and I am so happy I did. Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot, but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold.Firstly, the writing is incredible. What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty, changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected, interesting and absolutely brilliant. The pacing is on point and from start to finish, the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including, but not limited to: sadness, a feeling of well-deserved success, hapiness, guilt, unease, discomfort and fear.Secondly, the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more. For example, the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down.Finally, the ending is absolutely wonderful, although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie. After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending, but they did, and it was not what I expected. Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn't neccesarily feel right. I do however think that's the point and it brings a very intriguing point about the movie's theme into question.In short, ""Parasite"" is nothing short of a masterpiece."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,6/10,"I have never hated the main characters so much and have no sympathy for them, because my selfishness has brought trouble to others."
PARASITE,20 October 2020,10/10,"If you didn't like it because of the subtitles, stop watching movies :("
PARASITE,21 March 2021,2/10,"Other than that nothing much to see here, over the top dramatization as per Korean standards and I'm fluent in Korean, watched in its original language in Seoul, so not a problem of culture misunderstanding. That director is always so overrated, and people be gobbling down dull stuff like that everyday of their life, rationalizing it as the next form of art cinema. Close to some endgame avengers mashed potatoes level(of course marvel is still winning over this) I can understand Trump was outraged at this winning something and I'm not a trumpist."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,6/10,"This is not the first movie ever to try and combine 5-6 different genres and be jack of all trades. Each one I've seen so far failed, and this one is no exception... The story is rather simple and movie is simply too long for such simple story. If they made it like, let's say a 90 minutes long gory comedy it would be just fine.  probably worth seeing but definitely not a masterpiece or the best movie of 2019"
PARASITE,8 January 2020,10/10,"If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes.
Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me.
""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way"""
PARASITE,30 June 2021,,"How did this beat 1917? Another terrible Hollywood film only made to over correct some
Misguided California value that means nothing. This movie sucked."
PARASITE,7 April 2021,1/10,I would agree if it was best picture at the Razzies.This was woeful. I hated every second.
PARASITE,27 November 2019,10/10,The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.
PARASITE,28 January 2020,10/10,I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.
PARASITE,16 January 2020,7/10,"I liked this film even though I consider it overrated. There were several things that I found stupid while watching the film.The idea that someone is living in your home and you don't know it is not something new in Korean cinema. It has been explored before in Kim Ku Duk's 3-IRON.Having worked as an English teacher in Asian countries for two decades I found offensive the notion that someone with no credentials and no English skills will be able to pass off as an English teacher. Sorry folks, rich people are not that stupid.The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz. The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration. This film is nothing but pure fantasy.The ending where the daughter dies but not the son, reminded me of the ending of The Host. In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother. The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a messier finale.The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house is quite stupid and does not make any sense. It's more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film.The movie kinda fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people in this film are more likeable than the poor. You can't help rooting for the rich folks because they're the victims although if you're one of those antifa types you will most likely disagree.The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle. It has been replaced by the ""Let's Get Rich"" mentality. No matter rich or poor everyone is equally greedy, however the low class peasants are generally looked down upon not because of their origin but because of their poor taste."
PARASITE,21 April 2020,6/10,"Nothing special. Decent, but could have cast more actors that didn't look like they were acting. Kang-ho Song (Ki Taek) and Hye-Jin Gang (Chung-Sook) were great. Not one scene of theirs looked forced. Can't say that about anyone else as they all had moments where they looked like they were ""acting"".I understand the metaphorical meaning and depth of the film which made it decent. I can handle ""can't-place-it-in-just-one-genre"" idea. However, there just is not enough there to make it Best Picture of the year. The powers that be were reaching to award something just to make their own point I think. It's not even in the same category as Joker and I typically don't like films that are gloomy and 70's-ish looking, but Joker was much better and was even similar to Parasite in some of it's lessons on humanity. I'm not saying Joker should be Best Picture either because I didn't see hundreds of movies last year to make that call, but it was the best I saw in 2019. If you can either understand the spoken language of Parasite or don't mind reading subtitles, then it's worth seeing--partially for the meaning, partially to say you saw it, partially so you can see for yourself that an ok movie can win Best Picture. Tune out the idea that you'll watch a comedy or a drama or a thriller or a horror movie--its a blending of a lot of things."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"After watching some good films in 2019, there were only a few that really blew me away. I'm a big ""Avengers - Endgame"" fan, but ""The Irishman"" and especially ""The Lighthouse"" really touched me. And now we have ""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho, the South Korean director of ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"". ""Parasite"" was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews. Recently it also won four Academys, amogst other things of course ""Best Picture"". Logically, I was interested.The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation. How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family ...The less you know about ""Parasite"", the better! Nevertheless, I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away.What is the best way to describe ""parasite""? It´s not easy, because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp. The film works here and there as a satire, can surprise with some really funny moments, but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting. And that's all an understatement. ""Parasite"" always surprised me. In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is, but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised. Few films can do that. Joon-ho stages a masterful, socially critical film that works on so many levels. The visual level, for example, is fantastic, ""Parasite"" works with grotesque, but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations, which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength. The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect.All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition, because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make ""Parasite"" so effective. I especially liked Song Kang-ho as father of the Kims!Technically, ""Parasite"" offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings. Some spectacular sets were built for the film, such as the Kims' family home. The editing is great and Jeong Jae-il's score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals; everything just fits here!Conclusion: You have to see ""Parasite""! It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone, but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience. Without a doubt one of the best films of 2019. A masterpiece, a must-see and in a way also an important film, I think. Terrific!"
PARASITE,12 April 2020,7/10,"""Parasites"" is not about a class or a group of problems, not about the parasitic relationship between poverty and wealth, but that everyone can have problems.In fact, the shortcomings of human nature is an inherent phenomenon left over, the human gene is from the competition for resources and competitive selection, is engraved in the blood of the bad history and relics, even if one day to achieve unlimited energy technology people no longer worry about livelihood, this feature is difficult to eliminate in a short time.But modern people are people because of the ability and rules of self-restraint, and if there were a criterion for distinguishing between the top and the bottom, it would probably be the capacity for reason, intelligence and empathy."
PARASITE,27 April 2021,7/10,"About lower classes fighting over a place ""below"" upper classes. Social. Hadn't get references."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,"When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is."
PARASITE,30 November 2020,,"I feel like I've learned something from watching this, I'm not sure what yet, but I loved it!I didn't realise it had comedy in it, but feel like I laughed in all the right places.The acting was superb and the whole concept of the had me fascinated and completely immersed.I'm going to recommend it to friends but not sure how yet. I guess I'll tell them have an open mind and go with the flow, as it's an original and fascinating experience in film making and class culture. Something like that, I'm going to have an enjoyable rethink about what I just watched.In fact I've decided I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point very soon.Bravo 9.5/10"
PARASITE,26 November 2019,8/10,"An exceptional, very unique in it's approach with no clear out ""bad"" or "" good"" guys. Tackles what it quickly becoming a common theme lately, the class divide, but does so in a clever and disarming manner. Very good and sure to lead to plenty of discussion afterwards. Snowpiercer is still my favorite though, lol."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,"No spoilers in this review.
I hope that every film buff sees this wonderful piece of art. Not often does a filmmaker pull off this amount of creativity. Bravo!"
PARASITE,2 January 2021,1/10,Dumb. Fact that this was oscar winning is as sad as our world's current state.
PARASITE,8 February 2020,10/10,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"
PARASITE,23 January 2020,6/10,"The movie has high ratings and after what the director said about getting over subtitles, I had to give it a go. Parasite is not bad but I wouldnt give it a 10. Its a beautiful film and I loved the comedic storyline. However, I did not like when they introduced the ex-housekeepers husband hiding down in the basement. I felt like that whole plot felt messy. Like they started something and didnt know how to finish it so they just did something random. Maybe that was supposed to be the point, but it messed with the comedy that the movie began with. Parasite went from being witty and funny, to trying to be a suspense-horror film and it just didnt go well together."
PARASITE,27 May 2020,10/10,"Absolutely flawless a simple example of a perfect film
The kid was drawing the picture of the the man in the bunker"
PARASITE,29 March 2020,7/10,"I mean it was pretty good but nothing to get so excited about. The plot is solid and keeps you engaged throughout, maybe dropping off a bit towards the end. The overall acting and cinematography was pretty solid too, it's definitely worth a watch. However if you're going into it expecting some Oscar winning movie experience then you may be disappointed as it is very much overrated."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,8/10,I'm prejudiced against Korean movies. It sounds like simple imitations of Hollywood movies. But this movie is really different. Congratulations they made a very good movie. He definitely deserved Oscar.
PARASITE,4 November 2019,6/10,"The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade.
With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling & acting) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it."
PARASITE,1 December 2019,6/10,"The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade. With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling, acting, script etc) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,10/10,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!"
PARASITE,21 November 2019,10/10,"This movie completely surpassed my expectations. This is a stunning piece of cinema. I gave it a chance because of the incredible hype surround it and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very unique experience. The vast spectrum of genre covered in this movie is almost unheard of. It's artistic, irreverent, creative, beautiful, funny, shocking, violent, emotional, inspiring, and compelling. It holds the viewer throughout and it continually build atmosphere. The absolutely insane and unpredictable nature in how things unfold and escalate was so much fun. The fact that the movie could navigate so many genres successfully whilst balancing a consistent tone, maintaining the entertainment, and never becoming boring is a rare achievement. The movie keeps you guessing and and it crawls under your skin exactly like a parasite. The ending is a wonderfully beautiful touch to the story.I particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light, sound, and suspense to great effect.I cannot recommend this enough.GO. AND. WATCH. THIS. MOVIE.
10/10"
PARASITE,19 November 2019,10/10,"There will be movies after parasite and before parasite. There are not enough words for me to describe a movie like this, and i'm not gonna even try.
it's a masterpiece comes in once in every generation."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,8/10,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
PARASITE,30 January 2020,9/10,This movie shows desires of poor which is all same in any country of world. well acted and well made film.
PARASITE,10 April 2020,9/10,"It is said that parasite won the grand prize as a result of the unanimous approval of the jury. As Asians, I think Chinese fans will also be proud of it. Fengjunhao's efforts and creativity also prove to the world that genre films can do good-looking and artistic, which is the most important contribution of Korean films."
PARASITE,16 January 2021,4/10,"Can't see the hype. Totally overrated. I predicted the plot all the way through. I knew the cleaning lady would return, I knew for sure the family would return, and I knew there was someone in the bunker. And that is like the meat of the story. So, I was bored. 4/10 for being below average."
PARASITE,12 March 2021,10/10,"After hearing everyone go on about this film for almost a year I finally caught it last night and was blown away by the craft. Parasite was clearly made by someone who loves cinema and puts a lot of thought into shaping characters and plot. The first half of this film is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen.We are introduced to the very human, relatable Kim family, forced to hustle due to their extremely limited means. The steal wifi and fold pizza boxes for money. And then they get a foot in the door to gain various types of employment from a wealthy family who need an English tutor. I won't spoil the plot any more than that, but this film buzzes along from one exciting and interesting event to the next in a way that's logical, humurous, compelling and occasionally dark.The first hour or so is the set up, and the second half of the film is a murky thriller that borders on horror. Some people find fault with the second half of the film and I will say it has some very minor issues with shifts in pacing and some slightly abrupt exposition (EDIT: just watched it a second time and the pacing in the second half is fine - I just didn't take it all in well the first time around) but these are minor quibbles and not enough for me to deduct a point. The film had such a likable, warm centre that I simply don't want to take away from it.In terms of meaning, I saw Parasite as being about the extreme difficulty of upward social mobility. The son of the family is shown climbing stairs to a higher social station, only to descend them again later on in the rain. The Kims stare up at the world from the window of their semi-basement abode and enjoy better surroundings on a higher level later on but seem destined to return whence they came. It also deals very explicitly with the lack of solidarity between members of the working class during conflict.You get the sense, too, that the movie is saying that being good or bad has little to do with where you land in society. The Kims do bad things but you completely understand why they do them. The rich family they land jobs with, the Parks, actually seem like nice enough people, although they've allowed themselves to become detached, snobby and insulated against the feelings of others.The Parks don't have to hustle and lie because they're already well-shod and well-fed, and the director makes sure you realise this: that people hustle and scheme at times when they're desperate, not because they're terrible. And that if you're lucky enough to be doing well you can afford not to get your hands dirty (it's implied there is an element of luck in the Park family's success because they are depicted as pretty naive and gullible, and not as wildly talented geniuses - the father is apparently doing well in a good company but on the whole they come across as fairly ordinary or even doltish).Anyway, I rambled on about this movie but I enjoyed it so much I want to encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to check it out. One final word: the acting, sets and music are all fantastic and the movie is great to look at."
PARASITE,17 July 2020,3/10,Just another black humor Korean movie. There are much better Korean Movie's. Don't waste your time on this one.
PARASITE,23 February 2020,5/10,"I've watched South Korean films most of my adult life. Films such as ""The Way Home"", ""The Handmaiden"", and ""Train to Busan"" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests. Yet, this concept is nothing new in SK films."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,9/10,"This is a great film, it made me laugh, it made me think, it surprised me continuously. All the actors are consistently real and interesting. The story line progresses nicely and then hits with a number of surprises that I did not expect. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and do not want to say more that might give away any of the interesting twists that occur. It has been well reviewed by many and should do well in the theaters."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,The film is funny most of the time but i think they were better films to win the oscar...
PARASITE,27 October 2019,10/10,"This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed.
If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,4/10,"After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all.
I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice.
I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie."
PARASITE,15 May 2020,5/10,"It's a beautiful film, but it says nothing about class struggles and upward mobility that hasn't already been covered. I say this from a Western perspective, so I cannot speak to how the film was felt in South Korea. But as a Black American, I was... bored? I think the film's resonation with White American audiences speaks to this point even more. It won the Oscar because it is a criticism of Korea, not of America. We sit at a safe distance and revel in the ""bravery"" of the film because it allows us to ignore our own flaws. It is by no means a bad film. Just not a particularly interesting one."
PARASITE,8 May 2020,9/10,"NOW THAT'S A MOVIE. Everything from the opening to the closing was quite the spectacle. This is a modern day masterpiece. Masterful Cinematography. Bong's a genius when it comes to building up tension in this film. Everything from color grading, angles, and mise en scene were done with intention, providing a treasure trove of symbolisms that draw up a larger social commentary about the state of poverty in Korea. The best part of this film was its ability to bend genres, serving up comedy and drama so naturally."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) is directed and written by Bong Joon Ho. It is a thriller that tells the story of a poor, Lower class family that slowly worm their way into the household of a rich, upper class family. One by one the family get hired to do a job, with the employers unaware that they are a family. Things take an unexpected turn in the third act and I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the way that this movie ended up. I really enjoyed Parasite and in my opinion, it deserves the Academy Awards that it won."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,6/10,"After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"
PARASITE,26 November 2019,9/10,"This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap. However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail.I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by. I had only heard good things going in, but nothing of the actual plot points. I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo's friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park's house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias ""Kevin"" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song's artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song's art therapist.Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park's Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim's present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim's settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim's fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they're all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song's birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park's residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park's call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don't find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.Overall, Parasite gets a 10."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"This movie story is very much new concept story.. I can't believe one can write like this story.., everything in this movie is great.. Every upcoming scenes are perfect in it.. I think it has best story ever... Just go for it.. You will say.. ""Wah... What a story"" just watch it.. You will love it.."
PARASITE,10 March 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Hoo is at his best! The peach scene is a masterpiece of 21st Century... And the final, god, is epic and godamn sad!"
PARASITE,12 January 2020,3/10,"Yes, this movie is well-filmed and well-acted. yes, if you have the time and interest, you can speculate about what the movie might mean as an allegory. i'm sure the theory and politics of the movie are admirable. BUT... 90% of the film is simply unpleasant to watch.
none of the major characters is likable - much less heroic; no one succeeds or even grows. every character is amoral. one small example out of dozens: a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15-year-old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18. our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student.
i read that ""get out"" originally ended with the hero dying, that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie. parasite feels to me a horror movie like ""get out"" without the redemptive ending. or think ""inglorious basterds"" without the redemptive ending."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,9/10,This is a very wonderful story.I have a lot of feelings after reading it.
PARASITE,14 April 2020,7/10,"Art, music, completion and drama conflict are all wonderful and impeccable. This play is a carefully crafted work of art, but I don't particularly like it emotionally. The problem is that in order to improve the plot closed-loop, it has set up a lot of slightly deliberate contradictions and coincidences, too straightforward metaphors, and it lacks a natural result, so it also slightly reduces the strength of tragedy."
PARASITE,18 May 2020,9/10,"Fantasy is beautiful, but reality is cold. The desire of the family to become different was quickly punctured by reality. It is not easy to cross the gap between the rich and the poor. Who is the parasite, the poor family who exudes the smell of the basement, or the wealthy family who is glamorous outside and ugly inside?"
PARASITE,3 May 2020,8/10,"Typical social commentary movie. Yes its good, and yes it makes you think. Their are lots of details, and I love it when a director does not spoon feed the audience. My main grip is that at the end, the social commentary overrode the movie. IE the movie was always a bit unusual, but the ending was surreal. Not that it was a bad ending, it just felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative..."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,"I really liked the movie a lot. It is extraordinary.
The plot is a unique masterpiece. Like most Korean movies, it is maybe not for everyone's stomach. It is a brutal, honest and a raw dark comedy, which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist.
It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences. So, whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality, packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them, has to see this movie."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,7/10,"I haven't left a review on here for ages, but I thought I would have to say something about 'Parasite' as I had to see it on the big screen following it's Oscar win. I had expected 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' ,'The Irishman' or 'Joker' to win best picture or maybe 'Marriage Story' as the outsider.When 'Parasite' won, it was a shock, but I was glad that a foreign film had won an Oscar even though I had not seen the film. It had to be a great piece to get an Oscar, so I was keen to see it. I saw the film yesterday and have to admit that it was a good film, however I don't believe that it should have been an Oscar winner against the others, it certainly was not a better film than any of the others I have mentioned.The first half was good, a good black comedic story about envy, scams, can't say any more without spoilers. The second half it drifted into being really silly and became a farce as the script became more and more unbelievable. It is a film that has to be seen, so it is worth the price of a ticket. Maybe I was expecting too much of it!I am giving it a 7/10, but it could have been a 10/10 had they kept it real."
PARASITE,29 October 2019,9/10,"It's rare to experience stories like this... it really drags you in. I'm surprised, throughout the film, you start to expect what will be next, but it has great twists that wash your expectations out of the ocean."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,2/10,"I think it was a film director who said that fiction is asked to make sense, when reality often doesn't. This film must be very real because it is absolutely senseless. Where does the parasite family get the fancy clothes and the cultured and educated ways? Where do they learn, from one day to the next, to behave like refined people? How do they foresee the reactions of the parasite victims to the millimeter and not fail in their plan? Wait, by the way... where does the plan come from? The plan is never created, never plotted, simply the sister takes off her panties (by the way, a hundred dollar panties) in the car and everything is already organized and everyone agrees. That's nonsense to me. There is only one thread, which must have seemed interesting to the writer, which is the smell, but then nobody pulls that thread and it gets lost. Everyone already knew that rich people are stupid. Why make a whole movie just about this? It reminds me of those movies from the 1940s where the woman protagonist to fool someone only had to dress in men's clothes, hide her hair and put on a false moustache. I think that globally people's credulity is at an all-time low and all those who consider it a masterpiece should start reviewing Cantinflas' filmography. They would find several films in it with themes very similar to this one."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,8/10,"The best way to view this movie is like the movie Get Out. If you do not know what it's about, it's to your advantage. Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention. If you're still reading this, then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line:I can't stop checking every nook and cranny of my house now. If you know, you know."
PARASITE,30 June 2019,7/10,A very strange movie. Not sure if I loved or hated it more. The acting was good but I did not get the purpose or morale of the story line. Well maybe there was none and I am just thinking too much.
PARASITE,18 February 2021,10/10,"I strongly recommend this to everyone.This film talks about the different class of people and it was very well written and directed and the acting was great too. The film created suspense very well and those who like to analyse a film in a deeper level would also love this movie. This film had lots of meaning in it and if you were to rewatch the film, you will notice certain substantial things in the story you missed at first watch."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,5/10,"I found ""Parasite"" problematic to watch. The subtitles were often difficult to read and were put on too fast. Some were posted white on a light background. That was hard to read. Subtitles take away from the visual of the film and in this case the visuals of what was happening were paramount.The good part, in my opinion, was the social commentary of the disparity between rich and poor. The difference is extreme. The poor were depicted there living in filth and squalor. The way the poor live in Korea not being able to get jobs is mind numbing. I have read that many in Korea live as the pictured in the film. The film showed effectively social class dichotomy.What happens to the rich when the poor invade their home surreptitiously is ultimately extreme violence. It is nothing short of mayhem especially at the end. Not sure if it would be everyone's cup of tea. I don't think so. Reading the subtitles was difficult and I had to bury my head to avoid watching the violence.I think it should not have gotten best pic? In my opinion the Irishman was gypped in spades."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"Really good movie, the story line of the movie was incredible and it floated piece by piece as well."
PARASITE,26 December 2019,8/10,It was the most mysterious film I've seen in a long time. The story is full of surprises. The person watching will not regret it.
PARASITE,13 February 2020,6/10,"As I watched the Academy Awards gala and wondered who and what would win in each category I never in my wildest dreams thought of or considered Parasite. But that is just because I hadn´t seen it beforehand and didn´t know if it was that good as they say. But I guess I didn´t consider it to win anything much, because in my opinion there were so many wonderful movies represented this year and especially for the Oscar for best movie. There were so many gems and yes, I had my favourites that I was rooting for. I was extremely disappointed when I found out that Parasite won best picture. And then I felt bad and thought to myself well it is not right for me to judge this movie without even seeing it, maybe it is genius and excellent and so much more than the Joker or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. So yesterday I finally got around to watching the much praised Oscar-winning Parasite.The first half of the movie was abysmal for me. Maybe because I just didn´t quite understand how to feel about it, how to relate to it and was trying to think where would the story go. There were some good moments and I liked the camera work, the angles and a few comical incidents. But mostly I couldn´t wait for it to get to the point. I know some people said exactly the same about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as well, that it was boring during the first half. But in that I don´t agree, I was fully enjoying the director´s vision in that, the actors, the dialogues, everything. But in Parasite I couldn´t really find those things to enjoy. I am not saying the acting was bad, but I also cannot say it was excellent in some way.
The second half got interesting for me. I liked the way the story progressed, how things started happening, how people showed their true colors and how human nature is sometimes just awful. And there were a fair amount of suspenseful moments where I actually held my breath a bit and wanted to find out how the scene is going to play out. So, this is all good, this is what a movie is supposed to do - entertain you.
The ending - in my opinion it was good (not mind-blowingly excellent) and morbid (also not a bad thing, but makes you think and analyze). So all-in-all it is hard to even give it a score that I am sure of.
At first I thought I will give it a 7, because as I said, at least half the time I was interested and invested on the storyline. But I guess I am a bit biased since I am still a bit shocked about the whole Oscar thing and it irritates me a bit. In my opinion a Best Picture movie should be amazing, with a wow-factor, with outstanding directing and acting, storyline - it should have it all, it should be the best of the best that there is. Compared to all the nominees for that award, I just don´t see how Parasite would or should win and why it did, I guess I´ll never know."
PARASITE,21 August 2019,9/10,"Damnation on poverty, damnation on class differences, damnation on worldly regret, is money really the standard of human superiority !!! Is it true that the poor man has no religion and does not know God? And does the poor have no mercy on the poor ?! Is the poor more guilty? What a movie I really enjoyed, it was full of concepts, thanks to good South Korean cinema and congratulations"
PARASITE,4 June 2020,3/10,"The film won four Academy Awards and received praise from so many critics, it had to great right. With its thinly disguised story line about class warfare, it's no wonder Hollywood embraced it. I watched it all the way through and when it was over I felt nothing. Didn't love it, didn't hate it and frankly as Im writing this, I really don't remember much about it"
PARASITE,20 April 2020,9/10,"This movie is magically from the beginning and thrilling until the end. It's so perfectly detailed and the plot just damn good. If you want to see some poor family just wanting to live a better life and be thrown into a moral dilemma about the consequences of lies you're right here. Every character is unique, the screenwriting is excellent, cinematography A+.
The only thing is the somehow open end... or is it?"
PARASITE,23 December 2019,8/10,"It's a layered, complex film sans any heavy-handed messaging. Uncomfortable, stressful to watch, in a way. Absolutely deserving of the praise it has received."
PARASITE,1 January 2021,5/10,Don't see the appeal in this movie at all was extremely predictably and a few things didn't add up. Why did he bring the rock downstairs? what happend to the crazy guy? Why did the dad kill the guy? Lots of things do not add up and the acting is sub par and the writing is sub par. Mediocre at best and one of the most overrated movies of all time
PARASITE,2 January 2021,10/10,"I will admit I'm a bit late but it really was a happy new year after watching this MASTERPIECE!!
Straight away I had a inclination that this film would be amazing from the cinematography right from the beginning. The story line was just so captivating and I've never seen it done before. I HATE starting new things or watching new films but I'm so glad I did with this!
No wonder it took the OSCARS by storm"
PARASITE,29 September 2020,9/10,"Parasite is an incredible and amazing film. I didnt expect nothing about it, but its incredible. One of the best films in the last decade. It deserves all the Oscars."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,10/10,"Just wanted to register my ""10"" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted."
PARASITE,4 October 2019,10/10,"After watching the most overrated korean movie ever ""the burning"", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it."
PARASITE,19 July 2020,2/10,"Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,10/10,This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it
PARASITE,28 April 2020,7/10,"I was really impressed by the direction, no doubt and few other aspects of the movie but certainly not worth of Oscar. Just a normal movie which was going good until everything went beyond reality and started going haywire. Would have been much better if it have kept the thrilling story of their play in other difficult situations without being all gory at the end! Overall good till 1:30 hrs. Later it's just not amazing. Too much overrated. Don't know why they don't consider other masterpieces coming from third world countries."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,8/10,"The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!"
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"I must be odd man out. I saw the humor the gore the deceit the regrets, just didn't add up for me. Just weird"
PARASITE,8 June 2020,10/10,Bong Joon Ho is one of the best and talented Director. Parasite was a great dark comedy movie. It was pretty much realistic movie. I'm not that great to write a review about this movie. Everybody should watch this movie.
PARASITE,1 December 2019,5/10,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"
PARASITE,30 January 2020,9/10,"""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."
PARASITE,9 March 2020,1/10,Very bad and bleak i don't no Why did it get the Oscar?
PARASITE,6 September 2020,9/10,"The dichotomy of the families involved, especially how they live, makes the whole story! What a refreshing take on an unusual theme. This seems like something made by a Tarantino fan! I want that house!"
PARASITE,3 December 2019,10/10,"My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time
One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie"
PARASITE,8 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing Director
Amazing cast
Amazing performances
One of the most mind blowing movies of the Decade
Thank you Mr.Bong.Joon.Ho"
PARASITE,23 January 2020,5/10,"If people are really this starved for quality movies, I am not surprised what with the second-rate retreads Hollywood is doing lately.However, the actors are all surprisingly likeable despite the content and actions.
You feel for them and their situation, but at the same time, I feel the director portrays wealthy people in a very unfair light. It really is the immoral ones who are impacting others' lives with their actions, not the wealthy family.Overall this is worth a watch, but it is not worth 8.6 stars. Ridiculous."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,8/10,A slightly absurd satirical comedy with a sad ending.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,9/10,"The director played out a story about class differences. How funny the first half is, how sad the middle is, how scary the end is. The skillful director's skill and precise and powerful script make the movie watching effect the most amazing I have seen for many years. The problem with this movie is that the poor are kind and the rich are good. People of different classes are doing things that are very in line with their own identity, so this kind of superficial goodness can not be the bridge of contradictions at all, only make the contradictions deeper and deeper."
PARASITE,6 September 2020,7/10,"The story is very common in Asia. But I just don't like how everything looks. So dark and scary. A good film to show the real world, but not a good film to enjoy."
PARASITE,9 January 2021,10/10,"You forget it's not in English after the first few minutes; that's how gripping it is. What a wild story and innovative idea. The movie screams our society's obsession/dependence with money and WiFi. Social commentary aside, still quite amazing."
PARASITE,16 October 2021,9/10,"Visually out of this world, Parasite is a very captivating film to watch. The artistry of Bong Joon-ho carries profound storytelling from beginning to end, rich of deep metaphors and allegories. This tragic but powerful and timeless cinematic masterpiece creates a beautiful but dark aesthetic, relaying heavy on the theme of inequality."
PARASITE,1 January 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a film that represents that cinema is best as a collective experience. From the beginning until the end of the film the audience was silent, without being distracted, immersed in the reality that the film presents.
The script, in terms of structure, works like a clock: the characters, the scenarios, the conflicts are raised, and each element will influence what happens next. The staging is magnificent: an exact combination of photography, editing and direction that manages to maintain attention and tension in each sequence: the way in which each member of the family is gets work at the house, the sequence of the arrival of the family after ""the camp"", the children's party of the climax ... They are very well executed sequences and together they manage to maintain a rhythm as I have rarely seen this year in the cinema.
The message of social class difference is clear but very in your face, especially when what happens after the storm is evident.
My only buts are that there are parts of the plot that feel forced to cause impact, and although they work, they are not entirely convincing. And that in the cinema I seek to leave inspired, not with my head down, and this film is very entertaining but ends up overwhelming the mood.
Even so, for provoking that community experience in a movie theater through the extraordinary use of cinematic language it is worth the recommendation."
PARASITE,7 November 2020,10/10,"Maybe one day I'll come back and write a more eloquent review, but suffice to say having just seen this tonight, I think it's one of the best films I've seen in years. An almost indescribable satirical-drama-thriller that gets about everything pitch perfect and surprises at every turn.Bong Joon-ho really is a genius (even if Okja was terrible)!WATCH!"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,4/10,"Well, I guess I am just a consumer who doesn't know movies but I thought this was a bow wow. Unrealistic, too many subplots and little respect for cause and effect. Take for example the flood, the next day they were all dressed like Jeff Bezos in pressed and clean clothes. If you saw the scene of the flood - no way! Not that it matters but the movie portrayed the actors as people I hope to never meet. Maybe the older housekeeper I would like and her husband. Do you believe the underground setting as even close to something that is really, not me.I was impressed with the visuals of the movie. Nice angle shots and perspectives. Good framing and all the yada yada stuff you should expect from films these days.I just don't see this as a stellar movie. I also did not like the feeling it left me with for South Koreans, yes it is a movie and I hope it only represents a portion of the people in this country but this could really be an issue. If this movie represents only a small portion of the people, what is the relevance, if this type of culture is pervasive enough to make a movie which ""meaning"" then there is an issue with this society in my opinion. I hope it is just a shock and awe movie in a format to surprise people, draw them to the theatre or dare I say the streaming services. After all Friedrich Nietzsche is gone and maybe this movie stands in for him, wouldn't that be good. The movie Nietzsche would make - see it now!.I hope the South Koreans are not really like this. Oh by the way, nice house except the dungeon. After the awards I am surprised the number of people who in general conversation mentioned they turned the movie off part way through. Maybe the ying and the yang of what constitutes quality and how we view societal relationships is the real discussion here and the perspective we all bring.I have to say it made me think but after all said and done as a movie did not fulfill what I had heard and I did not really care for it. Watch this movie, you may really like it, happy for you."
PARASITE,19 November 2019,6/10,Looks beautifully shot. But the story is slow and just doesn't progress to anything significant or surprising.
PARASITE,21 May 2020,8/10,"Seems like Oscar jury team selects favourite foreign movie based on how much poverty in it and congrats this time they get South Korean poverty and they nominated as the best movie in all categories. movie is good but not that great, no big surprise in it and kinda straight forward."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,Best Movie 2020 . Sure Shot Oscar In every Compition . Worth watching .
PARASITE,8 August 2019,8/10,"Thought provoking, self reflective, socio economic critique. Highly entertaining film that mixes genre styles or tropes giving a wholesome movie watching experience.
The agony of poverty and class inferiority is the raging theme of Parasite. At first, knowing the title of the film and the directors previous films i thought this was going to be a ""Apocalyptic virus outbreak"" kind of film, But it turns out a metaphor for the plot of the story - A poor family finds a rich family and slowly becomes a part of their house and their life and in the end the parasite does what a parasite does."
PARASITE,1 December 2019,10/10,"When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,6/10,"I found this film overlong. The film starts off well and the first half is light as the poorer family invagle themselves into the richer family. However, at this point the film takes a tonal shift and whilst this is understandable it jars with what has gone before.
The film takes an age to end which I found irritating."
PARASITE,17 April 2021,10/10,"Generally I'll avoid a foreign film, so was forced to engage in this. Thank goodness I agreed! It was absolutely brilliant. The hype is justified, so so good. It just works so well, cast great, acting great, story great. You can guess where it might be heading, clever, but then you will be super surprised. Order your takeaway and get watching."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,10/10,"The story
The title
The acting
The theme
Wow
My first exposure to korean cinema, off course after the wide International acclaim it received.
Everything aside this movie deserves evedy bit.
To take such a subject and majority of the movie shot in a house with such good acting
The director and the whole team stand out"
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic"
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,Fantastic gtreatest movie. Win the best motion picture award really.
PARASITE,26 May 2020,10/10,"If you haven't seen this because of the subtitles, get over that quickly because you're missing out on not only this film but thousands of others. Parasite tackles capitalism and classism in present day South Korea. Visually, it is amazing. Plot-wise, it is phenomenal. There are tons of metaphors and twists that make this movie so wonderful."
PARASITE,29 May 2020,10/10,Dark and humorous with an unexpected turn of events.I think one of the best things about Parasite is that for a foreign film it doesn't feel like a foreign film. At least in my experience foreign films always felt somewhat polarizing like either you watched them or you didn't and I feel like this movie is a good starting point. It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn't expect it to be that way.I highly recommend watching.
PARASITE,14 April 2020,10/10,"One of the most powerful things about this film is that at first sight, it seems that the evil of the poor is naked, while the rich family is a little innocent. But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family. The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,3/10,"After watching the movie I checked IMDB score.There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.A complete nonsense.After a hour, you start to look at the screen and say ""WHY?"".All nonsense movies gets some award from the festival juries. I think they may wanna show off something like ""we understood the sarcasm but you don't""."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,10/10,"Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,5/10,"Very violent for no reason, there are loads of other movies put there saying the same story in a much better way."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,10/10,"I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.Parasite did it in less than 2 hours."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,8/10,"What, an Eddie Murphy comedy from 1982 compared to the Palme D'Or winning ""Parasite""? Yes, because both are excellent class-distinction films but mirrors of each other.Trading Places has likable characters that, faced with Fate (the evil Duke brothers), team up to defeat the bad guys at their own game. Even the homeless black con-man Billy Ray Valentine--who is a completely decent man--can work with privileged, out of touch white Ivy Leaguer Winthorp--who is a completely decent man--and respect each other, to beat the Dukes. An American movie: an optimistic, improbably fairy tale of the American Dream.Parasite, on the other hand, has unlikable characters who have no way out of their predicament. The poor Kim family actually *aspire* to be like Billy Ray Valentine, because they have no choice in a culture like Korea's. And the Parks--basically Winthorp--cannot once consider the Kims to be human beings worthy of respect. So instead of everyone ending up on a beach eating cracked crab, we have a bloody murder scene in the back yard."

PARASITE,15 November 2019,7/10,This is my firsy review ..to be hones I am very proud to write my first review for this incredible movie .. No words can describe it . The crew the filming the story .. Wow Korea give us a great hope and open to us a big door after a lot of disappointments in Hollywood this year ... I want to give it 10/10 but I have problem with ending .. it make me a little bit disappointed at the first I think the movie have a great message that says '' every dollar you pay today tommorow in future you will get it'' but the ending destroyed this quote .. at all thx for this great masterpiece 👏🏻👏🏻
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,I remember that I put a review on this movie and talked about how great it is compared to Hollywood movies in 2019 year .. But there is a lot people disliked my review.. Now after this movie earned the Oscar how do you feel haters haha.. 7 it's a great rating compared to 2019 year
PARASITE,12 November 2021,10/10,"Director Boon Joon-ho has been slowly becoming my favorite foreign filmmaker outside of North America and the UK. He's extremely talented and a good storyteller. Snowpiercer was a surprise and now comes another pleasant surprise by him in Parasite. Well written story with a talented cast with great chemistry. The flow of the film was smooth and exotic with rich character development, acting was impressive by all. The film's emotional message at the heart of the story, was the real gem and I am grateful for it."

PARASITE,10 March 2020,7/10,"The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned.
Thats it for me. Thanks for reading."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,"It feels nice seeing a movie that's not in english from time to time. Nice, original, served it's purpose, but we won't talk about that. I like that they didn't insist on the love story between the childs, that's cringe. Here are two scenes that worth a mention, I believe: The scene where they finally got some nice food at home but they cut the stake with scissors. Nice scene, well thought. The other one is when the fat irritaiting woman tried to climb the stairs and the other fat irritaiting woman welcomes her with a ""THIS IS SPARTA"" kick. LOL"
PARASITE,14 August 2020,9/10,I actually didn't expect the movie to go in a series tone at almost half time. Normally thought it would have been a comedy entertainer like those classic Korean movies. I really liked how they conveyed the idea of rich people being selfish when a situation arises and poor people remain always poor no matter what they do. The actors did a tremendous job playing each role and their relationships with each other.

PARASITE,18 January 2020,6/10,"Good: all the actors, most of the acting and directing, hearing the beauty of the spoken Korean language, the sets (in particular, the first floor and yard of the award winning Namgoong Hyeonja designed house), the cinematography and the first half of the film.
Bad: the second half of the film.
Ugly: the overflowing toilet.The first half of the movie was magical. The storyline and setup were unique, credible and crisp. Then, it all fell apart. The punchline was a low blow at best. Too many pratfalls, way too surreal, overly silly and sadly pretentious. As a member of the (target?) audience I felt cheated. It should have been so much more and could have been with very little tweaking and tightening. Bottom Line: Parasite does not deserve the Best Picture Award or the Best Director Award from the Academy, period."

We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?"" 🍑Standing head and shoulders above its awards season competition in spite of an obvious language barrier, Gisaengchung is the smartest film about class warfare for some time, and by and large the best of 2019. A brilliantly brutal masterclass in editing, pacing, writing and everything in between, acclaimed director and now household name Bong Joon-ho does for stairs in this ""pitch-black modern fairytale"" what he did for trains in 2013's Snowpiercer, and follows in Hitchcock's footsteps by taking the movie medium to a higher level. Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly. As close to cinematic poetry as achieved in the 2010s, this sardonic social satire defies genre, clichés and storytelling conventions for surprising narrative turns, gasp-inducing horror and hilarious chamber piece exchanges, all working in service of a filmgoing experience like no other released in many years. Best watched with no prior knowledge of what to expect, yet still encourages and greatly rewards repeat viewings, show this stunning feature to someone you care about, and prepare to have them left speechless by ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains""."
PARASITE,3 September 2021,5/10,"The movie just doesn't seem to know what genre it is. If you step onto a boat, it doesn't suddenly turn into a submarine or a bus, but this movie does. It starts out so improbable that it's funny, then gets mean, vicious, violent, tragic and depressing. Others have said that it's an allegory about the class differences between the haves and have-nots. My eyeballs roll at this. So what! Life isn't fair. That is no excuse for one-dimensional characters. A family of grifters that is too stupid to succeed at anything somehow manages to cleverly con its way into the lives of a wealthy family. Of course, this must end somehow or there'd be no tension. You know something is going to eventually happen as the unexpected fortune of the poor family cannot continue, but why does it have to end in such gratuitous violence? What kind of person likes watching that? It makes you feel guilty about laughing during the comedic sections earlier in the movie."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,1/10,"....and I thought ""The Shape of Water"" was a horrible Best Picture winner. ""Joker."" ""1917."" ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood."" They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,8/10,"It's got attention through a Hollywood Event though it is a good film, quite cleverly done. It's quite violent ending takes you by surprise too. It's not worthy of 5 wins of course but not many people know what Korean films have to offer.I'm critical that The Farewell did not win anything then again the power of the Bollywood has neither had any proper reginition."
PARASITE,14 May 2020,6/10,"Interesting, yet flawed movie. First of all the movie has 0 replay value, which I keep in high regard. Second, no explanation about the obvious masterful bamboozling ability of the Kim family is given other than ms Park is ""gullible"". The movie also has some significant problems regarding its emotional nexus. Everything feels distant and random at best. In addition, even though I liked similar rapid genre swap in Miikes ""Audition"", the trick does not work here that well. Still, a watchable, yet disposable movie."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,10/10,I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.
PARASITE,11 January 2020,9/10,"Great movie, great writing, greating acting and great cinamotography. The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending.I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery. After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there, that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.

PARASITE,29 October 2019,8/10,"This movie was not at all what I expected, which is great !
I have to say the actress Jeong-eun Lee's performance was freaking awesome !!!!!!! She's the best part in the whole film. I was thoroughly convinced by her performance.
Overall, this film is great. I can't comment much on other aspects of the film without spoiling it. The final act is slightly weaker compared to other parts of the film, but still they are all great !
It's best you go to see this film without knowing anything about it. That way you can get a much wilder ride out of it."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,8/10,"Life in the dregs is unpleasant. One must learn, adapt, and get their hands dirty just to maintain life's basic necessities. All the while one must cope with the knowledge that there are those that will look down on you because of circumstances that, whether deserved or undeserved, can chip away at ones spirit.All societies have their strata, and one method of survival at the bottom of the rung is to cling to those at the top. Such relationship can be mutual, but it can also be parasitic. I assume anyone reading this can guess the kind that forms the base of this movie.Director Bong Joon Ho does not need me to sing his praises, but I will say this, Memories of Murder is one of my favorite films of all time. He has created a host of other good films as well (see what I did there) and Parasite is no different. His direction is a compelling and methodical dissection of two worlds. One if for the poor where they live surrounded by concrete and wire, and below peeing drunkards. The other is a beautiful triumph of architecture surrounded by trees and sunshine, a house worthy of a success.Parasite was a roller coaster of a watch that never lingered. Keeping the viewer engaged, the movie shifts tone at various points, and the direction never misses a step. As the two worlds collide, thanks to the machinations of the downtrodden, I was kept of the edge of my seat not quite able to sense what was coming next. Accented by some fantastically comical scenes towards the beginning, the movie manages to maintain a sinister tone. Performances blend into scenes as characters playing other characters dance around and play off each other seamlessly. It feels grimy and unsettling to watch, both because of the conditions the poor are subject to, but also at the levels they will stoop to. There is something violative about watching a family's intimate space be invaded. The forecast does not look bright for any party involved.The picture painted here is detailed and rich, and full of superb performances, especially from the youngest members of the poor family. As for criticisms, I have very little. Did I love it as much as Memories of Murder? No, but that is more a result of this film, while feeling extremely relevant in this day and age, hitting on a tone that has been explored to high heaven before, the haves vs. the have not. That is not to say Parasite has nothing new to say, although that case can be made, it just lacks a certain kind of rawness.That being said, Parasite weaves through its plot with frighteningly good execution. Through all the twists and turns we the viewer witness how one's class can sticks to them like a smell, unyielding and betraying any façade they put on. Sometimes you have to get dirty before you can get clean. And then sometimes people just never quite find a way to fit into their circumstances. There is much here to like and I recommend it wholeheartedly."

11/09/19Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:Part One:Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie ""Playing with Fire,"" will keep you company while you wait.Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.
When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible."

11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing.
I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here.
I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color."

Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention.

RATING: 4.7/5Heard a lot about this movie, so i finally decided to check it out. The name implies a possible horror movie, hell, even the main poster feels horror-ish. In reality, it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families, and even how the gap between them keeps widening.You're following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by. However, there's no doubt that they all love and support each other. Miraculously, the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family's daughter, despite not really having the qualifications. At this point, the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family, and hilarity ensues.The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family, that clearly doesn't know any better. My theater was laughing up a storm, regardless of the subtitles. Reviewers, and the director, keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half, which should be kept secret. However, i thought it was just par for the course, and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened. As you enter the 3rd Act, things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who's in the right. You have a rich family that's out of touch with the world around them. On the other side, you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive. There's even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money.This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor. Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said ""You are to blame for what happens,"" Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience, ""Who's worse?"" Yes, the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together, but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other, and society, while even looking down on others, and not realizing it. The poor family is tight knit, but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are. Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle, the movie makes you ask if they should, as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out. There's even a moment where someone in the poor family tries to make an emotional connection with the rich family, after going through a traumatic life changing experience, only to be reminded that they're nothing more than a lowly employee.Honestly, this movie is great. It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and you wouldn't really be wrong, no matter what you took from the movie. This is a high recommend from me. If you hate subtitles, suck it up because this is a movie that's definitely worth watching."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,8/10,"Simplicity is the best way to express opinion, Parasite is the best example of it ! The best part of the movie, when there have no way to live like a easy life then man take clever way despite of it is bad."
PARASITE,14 April 2020,9/10,"Three groups of families, a total of ten characters, everyone is indispensable. Put the furniture and structural features of a house to the extreme. The huge gap between the upper class and the bottom floor is materialized by the height of the living space. The scenes of going up and down the stairs repeatedly, though straightforward, are just right. What's terrible about the director is that he has excellent directing skills and the ability to write stories. When he conceives the plot, he always thinks about how to present it to the audience."
PARASITE,11 January 2021,7/10,"GOOD movie but itS not amazing
This movie is overrated"
PARASITE,13 June 2021,10/10,"It wasn't just a Korean, but a universal masterpiece.A black comedy about class in its best form!Certainly, one of the best movies of the decade!"
PARASITE,4 October 2021,10/10,"I thought it was an American film, but turned out to be Korean.The storyline is so well thought put. The story isn't slow and gets right too it. I love it. Let there be a number 2?Everyone acts soo well and i resonated with every character.Worth a 10/10.Would recommend to anyone."
PARASITE,10 September 2021,10/10,"Parasite is the kind of movie that can take place in multiple movie genres. Like Dark comedy, thriller, a slight horror, mystery etc.All the characters are awesome and this movie shows the that Rich and Poor have a parasitic relationship with each other. Social class discrimination between the two results in horrific results.Bong Jun-Hoo did his best to show the sad reality of a Metropolitan city in which there are huge class differences. His efforts resulted in The First Non-English Movie to win 'Best Picture Oscar'.Truly impressive and thought provoking."
PARASITE,21 October 2019,10/10,"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece."
PARASITE,1 December 2019,10/10,"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.This says a lot about this one.Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,9/10,"I was told before that this movie will surprise me with things i may expect. So even with this information i was totally stunned in some scenes. It's going more and more wired but you can't stop watching.First it's all about the poor and the rich. You can feel this huge gap between the families but this movie is so much more than that. Don't think to much, enjoy the ride and pls don't watch it with your kids!Cheers
Fletcher"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,6/10,"Not my cup of tea. Farce combined with excessive violence, and lots of plot holes as well as character inconsistencies, but what do I know?"
PARASITE,28 May 2020,8/10,"Cinematography is very good.Excellent acting by all lead actors.Perfect mix of art and commercial, this is how movie should be made. It entertained audience as well as received many major awards."
PARASITE,19 August 2019,10/10,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
PARASITE,10 August 2020,9/10,"I'm a little late to the party but this movie is one hell of a fun picture. I didn't see all of the best picture noms but I see why this won. It's funny, suspenseful, scary, gross, touching and more. The storyline is never boring and it keeps you engrossed the entire time. The writing, cinematography, editing, etc is perfect. Twisty and fun is how I would describe this movie. You would be missing out on a great time if you let the fact you need to read subtitles throughout. I didn't even notice. If this movie were made in America and was made the exact same way everyone would be talking about it. Parasite and Get Out! (My favorite 2018 movie) would make a great double feature night."
PARASITE,4 January 2021,8/10,"This movie covers all aspects you'd like for a film. It goes from a comedy with important subjects to feel-good, to waiting-that-something-really-bad-is-about-to-happen to a lot of other emotions.I can't even compare this film to another. It's one of a kind in so many ways. Not your usual type that is. Completely deserves all won awards.And to think I just stumbled upon this masterpiece. Everyone needs to see this one! The story is about the Kim family who try to get by in any way they can and I don't want to spoil anything because you're in for a treat. Everything that can happen basically happens and at the same time, the viewer is exposed to the differences of class in society,Watch it!"
PARASITE,5 March 2020,,"On my first watch i thought it was just an ok movie. I thought ""What did I miss? Why is everyone so crazy about this movie?"". I watched it again and i Change my mundo. It really is a great movie"
PARASITE,13 March 2020,6/10,"I don't mind symbolism. I think it adds extra depth to a story, granted you're looking for it.
But if a story cannot exist strongly without symbolism...it's not really a story worth telling. This was one of them. The locations ran old after a very short amount of time and the ending was SO long and drawn out. And to come to what conclusion? Pretty flimsy."
PARASITE,11 March 2020,8/10,I should say this is Yet another masterpiece . This movie is a combination of Humor with some tragic events .
PARASITE,25 February 2020,10/10,"The visual style and mood of 2019's ""Parasite"" is perfect. The editing, the cinematography and the story all perfectly coincide with each other. This film is the perfect example of every single part of a piece of art fitting with its other components. With the precision and perfect aspect of the rich family, is the perfectly omnipotent framing, camera movement and composition of every single shot.The static nature of the camera for most of the film shows how normal and static the status of the family is, in contrast with the family that starts to work there. The family that takes the place of the housekeepers, driver and tutors are shot with more fluid and quicker camera movements, to convey their status and attitude.I could talk about this film for days, so I will finish this review by discussing the ending. The emotional nature of the families connections to one another is perfectly encapsulated through the last line, and the last scene. The emotional relevance of such a run down family now down on their luck and half killed is touching, and perfectly fits with the beginning of the film. The very last shot conveys this perfectly, with the same shot at the beginning being the same one that is at the end."
PARASITE,18 October 2019,10/10,I have a feeling I won't see a movie this good or affecting for a long time. Funny and scary and thrilling and sad
PARASITE,8 May 2020,10/10,"Saw Parasite yesterday. Something that we missed out during MAMI. What a brilliant gripping tale this is! It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss.To start with, it makes you laugh with its comic rendering. When you see the entire movie it defies all your expectations along the line. Bong Joon-ho crafts an intricate look at modern-day social hierarchies. He keeps you flipped on one mood then drastically changes it to the other while delivering some brilliant thematic elements. When you spend 132 minutes seeing this movie you encounter and experience: clever, humorous, dramatic and every other kind of emotion.It is also a hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.It is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages. Its final moments are so unsettling, and so unforgettable and impossible to estimate. It is a test that you undergo yourself and you're most likely to fail! 😊"
PARASITE,22 September 2020,4/10,"After 30 minutes, you should notice this is not a proper comedy, as something bad must happen. Now, a lot of spoilers; please do not read the rest if unwanted.
Poor married-and-loving couple with two children get all of them hired by a rich family. To accomplish this, they use false identities, lie and deceit, what involves accusing previous servants (also poor and weaker) of evil deeds and
behaviors. Although they all have no job and don't even know how to fold pizza cardboards, they magically excel in their different roles as language teacher, (fake) fine arts/psychologist, high-end car driver, and maid/cook/housekeeper.
The rich man owns a successful business, and both he and his not-so-loved wife are basically naive, notwithstanding that they have an issue with poor people's sweat and soap.
The situation turns difficult when the previous housekeeper reveals that she has her husband hiding in the basement,what damages the staging of those who are not even shy about using the foster home as if it were a stable.
So, the joke is over and now they kidnap, torture and commit murder.
When the tortured gets released, a massacre begins. The poor irresolute dad gets finally angry, because the rich dad thinks of his own son first, and kills him. Then he flees and takes refuge in the basement, becoming the only real parasite
(he lives on what he can steal, which the previous occupant did not).
The circle is closed when his son decides to do what apparently the bourgeoisie commonly do: study, work, get rich and buy the house to free his father. Note: everything would have been better from the start if he or anyone else in the family had taken that path; maybe hitting them with a not so deadly stone would had it done.
The idea that this is an allegory about something seems to make no sense. Inequality and injustice implies that someone has no opportunity to improve or it is denied; but it is not what happens here. If we try to look for any subsequent message, we would get some quite implausible ones. For example: a) Poor people are cunning, envious and even murderous by nature (but this is untrue and not the case for the laid-off servants); b) Rich people are bad and mean as don't care about the poor (but they would not be so so naive, worry about their children or give jobs to people who needs them); c) Poor people are allowed to commit unspeakable acts because it is their right to defend themselves from the power of the rich (but there is always someone poorer and richer than you, then you would be able to hurt someone/s while tolerating being hurt by other/s). d) The exploitation of man by man explains some inconceivable acts, but only from the perspective of a decadent bourgeois morality (what would imply that the final solution is the absolute independence of the individual, transforming him/her into a freelancer whatever the society where he or she lives, and nobody - applicable also to film writers or directors - should hire work assistants or home employees, even more as they are probably poorer and will cheat due to some particular exploited's moral rules). Of course, the son would hire no one but enslave his parents.
In my opinion this plot is just a sarcastic farce, much closer related -but not comparatively valuable- since Aristophanes to Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, the Marx Brothers, Naked Gun, Monty Python, The Simpsons, Shitt's Creek, and so on. That solves many of the prior questions, as irrelevant. But with a vengeance: many viewers empathize with the mere criminals or their mean strategy, simply because of 'this world's uneveness' and/or they anticipate (or been told) that so is the right thing to do. Some others, like me, will just retain some worthy scenes and dialogues, and forget the rest as a failed attempt. And hopefully, future reviewers may enlighten us with much better insights. The Oscar, not the story, made it indispensable, at least to alert the jurors to be more mindful. Without such a prize, my rating would be one notch above."
PARASITE,3 November 2019,8/10,"Captivating, thrilling, appalling, stomach wrenching. These are words used to describe Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. At first a seemingly witty and somewhat-vulgar comedy, it slowly evolves into something much more. The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. While some subtle cultural differences are noticeable, this movie can be enjoyed by Korean and American audiences alike.The movie centers around the lower-class Kim family, consisting of a man and a woman and their young-adult son and daughter. In the beginning, they are just scraping by, assembling pizza boxes for meager pay and living out of a less-than-desirable underground apartment in a run-down neighborhood of urban sprawl. Then one day, their fate changes: the son's friend, who is about to go overseas to study, hands off to him his job working as an English tutor for the high-school aged daughter of the wealthy upper-class Park family. The Parks reside in a remarkably modern house designed by a well-renowned Korean architect. Think the Frank Lloyd Wright of Korea. The house is gated and surrounded by beautiful luscious greenery: a far cry from the run-down apartment of the Kims. The Park family closely resembles the Kims in its composition: a husband, a wife, a son, and a daughter. However, the children are much younger. The young Kim, upon providing a falsified college transcript, is hired on the spot by the remarkably naive lady of house.The house goes on to become the main setting for the rest of the rollercoaster ride that is Parasite.One-by-one, through their crafty use of deception and by playing a few dirty tricks, the rest of the family succeeds in invading their way into employment in the extravagant Kim household. The family rejoices in its new circumstances, having made this elegant house their sanctuary and having turned their financial situation around by milking the cash cow of the Park family. However, this sense of wealth and prosperity proves to be ephemeral as the dark secret of the house soon-after is revealed in a torrential whirlwind of events.This movie made me somewhat envious as to the Kim family's unity. My brothers, parents, and I have never been as close to each other as to what I witnessed in this movie. Even if the motivations of the Kims are ill-willed, I couldn't help but to empathize with the family. Their crude behavior is quite entertaining as well. From my own experience, I have never had to face poverty in the way that they did. Perhaps because of this, my family is not as close to each other as theirs.The inequality between upper and lower social classes is a major recurring theme throughout the movie. While at times a bit over-dramatic in its stark contrasts, the movie's cinematography is ingenious through its use of space. It is quite clear that the Park family's house is unnecessarily large, but it never feels quite as luxurious or over-the-top as a mansion. This concept of space lends itself to another major factor: the Park family's socioeconomic privilege and inherent disregard towards people of the lower-class, especially observable through the actions and mannerisms of Mr. Kim. This is a pertinent and powerful theme which makes the movie all the more interesting and intriguing. Similar themes can be observed in Warner Bros. and Todd Phillips' recent box-office smash-hit Joker. Sadly, there will always be the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots,"" for better or for worse, and discussion regarding the capitalist system in which the people of South Korea and we in the U.S. reside could go on for days.The film's soundtrack is very tasteful. The beginning section of the film is accompanied by pleasant percussive sounds. As the plot thickens, the music grows in intensity, mirroring the looming atmosphere of uncertainty. Stringed instruments such as violins and cellos become much more prominent and are cleverly implemented to express sentiments of unease and for a peculiar ominous effect.All in all, Parasite is a very thought-provoking journey which takes the viewer to unexpected places. As a sociological commentary which will surely be looked at differently by different people, this film may not be particularly agreeable with everyone who views it. I do not wish to spoil anything, but I will say this: it is not for the faint of heart. This film is an accomplishment in the international Korean film industry, and its commercial success will hopefully lead to more Korean movie-screenings in U.S. movie theaters. I hope the movie will make people here who were not interested in learning Korean (or any other foreign language, for that matter) more motivated to embrace the amazing and fruitful process of learning a new language. Above all, I am not necessarily aware of anything I wasn't already aware of after having watched this movie, and I don't believe it to have changed me or my beliefs. It also leaves a few unanswered questions. Overall, it was an indulgent, aesthetically pleasing, and even at times surreal experience. I would definitely watch it again, although it might not be my first choice."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"Was quite sure what to expect when I started to watch this movie ""all sub-titled"" in Korean. But before I realized it I was reading the sub-titles and watching the movie action at the same time.The story line is well written and very believable for the most part, there are some scenes a bit over done but all in all a fun and exciting movie to watch. I'm no new to foreign movies, having spent 22 years in the Navy and visited 48 countries one gets exposed to so many ""different"" things and cultures.I was quite taken by the line the movie took as it progressed until and found it very funny in some aspects but also sad in what the family had to do to survive. Then came the ""garden party"" and it blew me away... I didn't see that coming but it was a good way to bring closure to a number of things.Very glad I took the time to watch it, I very enjoyable movie."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,10/10,"The film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. I loved the experience, I loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others. Parasite (Gisaengchung), for sure, is one of the best films I've ever seen."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,8/10,"It's not what I expected the ending. But, the nature of humankind to survive, to thrive drive is seen in this movie. But the ending, it was unexpected; it's a pretty surprising ending. This movie could be a good discussion of reality, trust and the need for work."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"At the end of the film, the most desperate people, through this event, the son's life lessons are: make money, become rich.
However, the director's fable tells the audience that both are hell, and that this is a beautiful, cruel, funny and sad society."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,7/10,"Although the image of the rich man seems too simple, the rhythm of the script, the language of the director's camera and the meaning and metaphor behind it are already impressive. As a commercial film, it is undoubtedly very good, but everything is so clear that you may lose the interest to watch it again."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,9/10,"The advance notice didn't have a spoiler at all. It's a long time since I saw such a movie that can arouse the audience's mood. The audience applauded several times in the middle of Cannes premiere. From laughter to horror to despair and grief, the director once again demonstrated his world's leading ability to integrate genre elements and social issues."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,"The skill of screenwriter and director has reached this level! I really don't know whether I should feel hope or despair after watching the movie, just like this black drama of sadness and joy."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,9/10,"As a masterpiece sweeping Cannes, it is easy to understand and not dull.It is not easy to integrate commerce and art skillfully and popularize, but it has high artistic value."
PARASITE,10 November 2021,8/10,I watched this movie with my family after my dad saw the good critics of it .I particularly enjoyed it as it represented the Importance of the difference in social statuses.The movie is realistic and doesn't really differ from real life.It showed/demonstrated in various ways the true horror or rather reality in today's society .I recommend this for family or in groups as you will enjoy more than rather watching it alone .I think it doesn't depend on the age but on the maturity on the child in order to watch the movie .Read more of my reviews in order to get a good point I vue for Movies or TV Programmes .
PARASITE,25 February 2021,1/10,"This movie is flat-out horrible. Not funny, not interesting, a hard watch. Way over-hyped. Had to shut it off half way through. Zero interest to watch it again."
PARASITE,2 December 2019,9/10,"I don't want to say too much to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that I have seen lots of films and this one had me at the edge of my seat with my jaw on the floor for most of the movie! I hope you get to see it"
PARASITE,16 October 2021,5/10,"Wow I can't believe the hype. Am I the only one who doesn't like this movie? Considering the awards and the hype I was expecting a master piece or something extremely interesting, entertaining, deep and with a plot twist. None of this happened. The movie is just okay, it didn't have a goal, it's just some random stuff happening just like that. Not to mention that none of the characters were likable and you can't create the bond, respectively you don't care about them. Most of the events looked fixed, unlike other korean movies where the realism was better and the tension was real. Until the end I was expecting some great twist, similar to the Cabin in the Woods for example, but no, it was just a massacre that was actually expected and it got executed poorly and in a naive way. I really just don't get it why is this hype, the movie is ok, sometimes difficult to watch because it's long and slow sometimes, kind of watchable, but definitely not a master piece, far from it. Very overrated in my opinion. The Awards were handed for political reasons I guess."
PARASITE,27 April 2020,4/10,"I honestly can't understand how this movie won the Best Picture Oscar. I don't know if there was any controversy surrounding its selection, but if there was, I would say it's justified. Forget star ratings, I can gauge how much I enjoy a movie by the number of times I pick up my phone or go get a snack or go to the bathroom without pausing it. I spent a lot of time looking at things on my phone during Parasite.It's a somewhat entertaining movie and it's kind of interesting to see how people live in Korea but it's not believable and certainly not a great movie. The Tarantinoesque bloodbath at the end just makes it even less believable.LIke I said - I don't get it."
PARASITE,9 September 2020,10/10,"First of all: directing, acting, cinematography, story: 10!
There is no second of all. This is a masterpiece, in the same class as "" The Godfather"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and "" Pulp Fiction"" (my all-time personal favorites).
Why?...you may ask. It's simple.
A family of four, 2 parents and 2 reaching-adulthood kids, struggle to make ends meet in Seoul. Their luck changes when one meets a wealthy family and from there on, they do their best to profit from this opportunity that might improve their livelihood.
But there's much more to it. You just have to watch the movie. I assure you it's worth it!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,After watching the film I continued to run the film through my mind. The way the writers put subtle flashes to in your face current social climate issues was probably one of my favorite things about the film. Like other reviews I agree that it's almost two films in one. You will leave with internal questions and possibilities of different ending that could happen.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,"Movie was do good unbelievable comedy , thriller, all in one package with good message.."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,9/10,"I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!Almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.The production and performance were magnificent. The humour ""Black comedy"" was great, the ""Pain"" was real and the cinematography was dazzling.I'd like to thank Bong Joon-ho in person for this masterpiece!""Poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable""9.2/10"
PARASITE,24 March 2020,6/10,"First of all I want to say that this is not a bad movie and I'll talk about the good things later. I want to start with the bad ones because there are already apparently thousands of reviews talking about how good the film is.I also want the reader to realize that for a foreign movie, Parasite is extremely comercial, and easy to watch. This of course is not bad but it's important to mention.In fact, in certain tones and aspects during this film, it could remind the viewer of a Quentin Tarantino movie, in particular during the Ending. Satiric ending full of violence. Speaking of this part of the movie, I believe that certain scenes were not needed at all. For example when ""The rich guy"" aka Mr Park tries not to smell the dead body while getting the keys.It was back in 1960 when Billy Wilder (arguably the best film director and screenwriter of all time) became the first person to win Academy Awards as producer, director, and screenwriter for the same film. It was for the movie ""The Apartment"" starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine. This movie is a masterpiece. And since then not many other directors have achieved the same thing. In the 2020 Oscars Bong Joon-ho joined Wilder in such an important achievement. It wouldn't be very subjective to think that it was not well deserved.This could have possibly been done in order to expand Asian market in Hollywood, by making use of the current popularity of Korean culture.As I said the movie is not bad, it has a solid photography and editing and script that led to an exciting and brilliant tempo. I really like the first part of the movie because I think the director sets up the story in a intriguing and appealing way however after the beginning the movie looses power in many elements.Many people love this movie because of its message. I find this rather silly because it's a quite simple message, The difference between the rich and the poor? Is this a radical or new message in any way? I do not think so.In fact I believe this movie is great for pseudo intellectuals, because actually watching a foreign film and liking it (this movie is easy to like because of its commercial features mentioned above) makes your ego go as high as the empire state."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,8/10,"Starts off deceptively light-hearted, then continuously accelerates into a series of gripping twists and turns. Exceptional movie."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,7/10,"With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision, Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes, their differences and paradoxically their similarities, with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion... But at what price?
From this thesis, many themes and subtopics emerge: simulation, lies, threats, which lead to stronger ones: revenge, hatred.
Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies (cellular) into one more protagonist, who will always be present throughout its history.
So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement.
Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started, becoming confusing and anticlimactic.
""A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself, who began to distribute prizes...""
Casting includes Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park. Sarcastic sequence of the confrontation with the old housekeeper, who uses the cell phone to threaten, as if it were a weapon."
PARASITE,28 April 2020,9/10,"This film has deservedly been nominated for awards this season. It is shocking how the director presents the differences between social strata. Shades the characters. There is nothing good or bad in this movie. People are the actors. Mortal, simple ordinary people. The film cannot be classified in a single genre. Sometimes drama or comedy. Towards the end, it taps into a thriller. Displaying rich people is pretty simple. They have no problems. Unlike poorer people. Filming the film is brilliant. The film operates with very strong images. The atmosphere is breathtaking. The movie hangs in front of the screen all the way. The turns are screwed. They ignore the clichés. Simply put, this film has been well-deserved because it raises and answers social questions that are very serious today."
PARASITE,27 October 2020,9/10,"I am bored from standard and cliché movies. This movie is very different and original. It is entertaining throughout, has a few twists and the story is great. The movie makes you think throughout and at the end. It is funny at times but serious watch. Well worth all the oscars."
PARASITE,17 January 2020,8/10,"The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again.
Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point.
Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.Masterpiece? Yes.
Would I watch it again? Heck no."
PARASITE,25 August 2019,10/10,"I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)"
PARASITE,5 July 2021,9/10,"I usually don't watch Korean movies, but the hype has insisted that I delve into it. And I have to say, I don't regret it one bit. The cinematography, the secret hidden messages in many scenes, the eerieness yet explosive plot-twists- perhaps I live under a rock, but it's rare to find a plot remotely similar to this, at least in my experience. It was truly an interesting and exceptional movie. Almost a mind game, it's fun to catch what you've missed on the rewatch. Jammed packed with thriller and drama."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,10/10,"Great, Masterpiece.
This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor.
At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"The movie is so like realistic and entertaining,
I love the suspense and the acting is good and the story is so good.
It has a message to tell and the surprise is 50/50 kinda expected it but I like the overall movie."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,10/10,"To be short,this is a greatly directed,perfectly shot masterpiece with well-crafted characters that strike a balance between nastiness and sympathetic,and can be interpreted both ways;pitch dark humor that is both ironic and clever and fits the main theme,which perfectly blends horror with a satirical tone."
PARASITE,14 May 2020,8/10,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
PARASITE,22 December 2020,8/10,"Nice movie, good story, good acting.I would recommend it"
PARASITE,27 March 2020,8/10,"Bong Joon Ho had done a great job. One of the most original international script and his directing was brilliant. The plexal events leads the scipt to a wonderful inevitable ending that would both expected and harshly expected by the audience. I can't say much about acting since I don't know Korean but the story slowly swallowed me up. Mostly with the raising the complexity of the plex of the plot as I mentioned.
Personally, I have of course no doubt about its originality and uniqueness, however I still think that maybe the best international film award would go to Almadovar's Pain and Glory as Parasite was declared as the Best Picture of the year."
PARASITE,12 July 2020,9/10,"A deep and profound message ladled with twists, humour and tragedy - A must watch for movie buffs!"
PARASITE,1 April 2020,10/10,"Brilliant screenplay Strory telling
Director had done his job very very.... Awesomely
Actors act brilliant
Excellent story and concept
Must watch for everyone...."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,10/10,"Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"Precise acting,
meticulous editing,
meaningful story,
dramatically funny story telling,
inspiring ending,
unnoticeable yet tangible music,
...multi oscar material."
PARASITE,18 January 2021,10/10,Honestly this movie is definitely one that lived up to the hype and deserved every single accolade and award. if you can watch a movie without staring at your phone for the majority of the film in this day and age it's definitely because the movie is capturing .. it had me hooked for 2 hours without being distracted
PARASITE,30 March 2020,9/10,Masterpiece .Lust destroy everything.comedy thriller combination.ebery character perfect acting skill. great choice for oscar.👍
PARASITE,12 February 2021,8/10,"To be honest, I didn't know where this film was headed halfway through but I must say I was surprised in the best way. The mix of genres the underlying tones of survival of the fittest and class was outstanding. A must watch."
PARASITE,7 December 2019,9/10,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,10/10,"I came to see this hyped-out title and was expecting to see it flop, only to be amazed by its brilliance and cinematography. Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication.I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation.
This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality.It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich.In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,8/10,"I just saw the film and I went in unsure if it'd be as good as the hype. The film was enjoyable; everything was solid from story, character development, cinematography, editing. The film had a good flow and plenty of surprises. There certainly was deeper meanings to the film and great exposure to the Korean culture. The problem with this film isn't the film at all but those reviewing it. For those that swoon about the film or those that call it awful are way off base. The film is neither; and it certainly isn't a Tarantino violent style film. It is a good film I'd probably see a couple more times to find all the different angles of this complex story. It won best picture for good reason but it certainly didn't bury the competition; any of those could have won depending on what the viewer was looking for. It's a good film and should be seen and likely more than once."
PARASITE,22 October 2019,7/10,"This is a dark comedy, no question about it. But is also an almost surreal movie. Very clever thought. This is the kind of movie that a lot of people want to do and fail badly. So if you are into dark comedy, strange movie, give it a go."
PARASITE,7 January 2020,6/10,"The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
PARASITE,19 October 2019,9/10,This was simply amazing and has raised the bar unfortunately for all future movies I watch.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,8/10,"First I'd like to say that I really liked this movie. It had a plot that instantly drew me in and characters that were easy to root for. It told a difficult tale about class struggle without turning the main characters into 2-dimensional heroes. It even ended with an unexpected intensity that I seriously doubt anyone saw coming.All of that said, it underwhelmed me. It repeated things over and over again, which was a plot device, but made some parts really drag. Moreover, the film's failure to assign winners and losers in its conclusion made it intriguing, but also left each character unlikeable- and when all the characters end up being unlikeable, it kind of leaves you feeling like the time you just invested was somewhat meaningless. I probably wouldn't feel that way if I had gone into it with no expectations- I may only focus on the good, but unfortunately I only watched it after everyone said it was the best film of the year and after it became the first foreign film to win best picture at the Oscars.I can only pass along my own, subjective experience, and that was it. 🤷‍♂️"
PARASITE,14 January 2021,6/10,"What's funny is that the parasites in Hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family.When the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons. That scene where she's smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful.Although, much like Hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of Vertigo, the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved. It wasn't built up to properly. It felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces weren't placed to justify it, for the audience or the character.If your DAUGHTER just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the DAUGHTER KILLER as inspiration for killing the rich guy COMPLETELY OUT OF LEFT FIELD. Sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him, but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb.I don't believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending. This is purely a trashy parasitical rich person's fantasy.It's a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick."
PARASITE,6 March 2020,9/10,"Emotional Story...
Perfect Picture, Screenplay, Editing etc
Claimant Of Oscar...Here is a Winner Of ""Best Picture"" Oscar...."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,7/10,"It breaks the stereotypes of hollywood of course,It's a breathe of fresh air.
I think it's the fatigue of the audience with hollywood movies that helped it with the hype,Globalisation played its part as well to win them oscars.
I think their incentive was well-deserved as i haven't seen many good movies this year or movies that are built of unconventional values."
PARASITE,7 April 2020,7/10,"Originally, the Kinkize family survived quietly, poor and undignified and without any hope. However, taking advantage of an accidental opportunity, the Kinkize family gradually drove away and replaced all the former servants of the chief family of Park Society. After becoming the new servant of President Park's family, the material quality of the Kinkize family improved rapidly. (after making money, the Kinkize family became stronger than before and dared to go up and teach them a lesson in the basement where they lived. The drunk man who peed on it). Moreover, the President and his family are very good people, are quite polite to the Jin family, and are full of service to the Jin family.
Sounds like a harmonious story that each side needs.
However, President Park's politeness and satisfaction with Kim Keze are premised on, that is, Kinkize cannot cross the line. In a modern society that promotes equality for all, everyone generally maintains superficial equality and respect. This family would never think of a poor proletariat.
A man is equal to himself, just like a slave
The master and aristocrat will never think of slaves as slaves
Li, civilians and themselves are equal.Yeah. The realistic status and life of the two Convince both sides that each other is by no means equal.Wait. President Park has nothing to do with Kim Keze.To make it clear, but to ask Kim Keze to abide by it consciously.
The most important rule of the year is: no, no.
Beyond the relationship between capitalists and proletarians.Class boundaries.
President Park has always been with a huge rank."
PARASITE,14 January 2021,7/10,"There is a scene where the family sits for a drink in the house, they break a glass and spill food every where on the floor, but when the owner of the house arrives, they manage to clean everything and shoves it under the table..and luckily no one notices. Actually they are all drunk and manage to leave the floor spick and span without using the vaccum cleaner.. not really the best director..the movie was awesome though.."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,8/10,"It's strange that every design is obvious and seems to have many loopholes. It's like trying to get close to the positive and negative offsets in emotion. It's neither sensational nor critical, but it feels that there's something very dangerous hidden. I think it's very powerful, very powerful."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,9/10,Don't open the door to people in the middle of the night. Don't roll down the stairs unsteadily. Don't show too much to dislike certain tastes. Every little accident leads to the final necessity.
PARASITE,12 May 2020,9/10,"If the process is to let all families living at the bottom of the society get rich first and then get rich, and slowly let all members of their own families become housekeepers of the rich family to teach drivers all living positions, the ending is somewhat unexpected. The late night visit of the original housekeeper completely broke the beautiful dream of the family. Of course, even without this, it may slowly show its feet over time. Because in addition to the two tutors, parents on the job because of their lack of quality slowly tried on the edge of the master. It was originally believed that the goodness and goodness of the rich couple and husband originated from wealth, and life was free of wrinkles. The poor woman said that if she had money, she would be kinder than the rich couple. However, this is not the case afterwards. I dislike the different tastes of the poor. It would be more sensation to use cheap panties left by the hostess, and at the end, I only care about my comatose son while ignoring the murderer and frequently assassinating myself in my yard. Tutors and housekeepers, and the look of picking up car keys in such critical times. The close-up portrayal makes the kind-hearted people completely collapse here."
PARASITE,29 May 2020,8/10,"Here's how i rate a movie the fast way, i ask myself two questions. Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ? Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future."

PARASITE,24 November 2020,10/10,I really enjoyed this movie it was funny at times and the characters where great it was a bit gory near the end but that was alright the acting was great also it deserved the four Oscars it got including Best Picture so I would definitely recommend this to any one the best foreign film I've seen.
PARASITE,27 September 2020,10/10,"Whenever the Korean film industry gives a movie, it is sure to be the best as we can see with movies like snowpiercer and train to Busan, Parasite is just like that"
PARASITE,9 September 2021,10/10,"A true remarkable achievement in every aspect.There's so much about this movie. Name a genre; it's in it. Let it be comedy, mystery, thriller, romance, suspence, drama ; Parasite covered everything.The film keeps developing and the excitement for the upcomings never ends with multiple twists and turns. The film speaks so much about the class differences, mentalities of people having different living style to the hatred towards the people who are suffering in life. Even if we don't want to jump into those political statements, we can thoroughly enjoy the film to its core. Parasite is rare and original ."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,7/10,"Please stop with all this ""best film ever made"" rubbish. No one can see your profile, you're anonymous, it's pointless.
It's not bad. I have no idea how well its acted as I can't speak Korean. And I'm guessing, neither can most here. They could be hammy as heck for all I know.
It's quite original, and certainly well scripted. It's also a little far fetched. Well, a lot actually.
Listen, it is good. Is it gonna make you rethink ""world cinema"" (ridiculous term)? Not if it was never on your radar."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene. It elaborates the dark side of social disparity masterfully. I have not seen such a intense and impressive movie for a long time."
PARASITE,30 April 2020,7/10,"I've been watching Korean movies for more than 10 years. The only people who think this was a great movie are people who have never seen a Korean movie.South Korean movies are edgier and smarter than anything Hollywood produces.
Parasite:
There was no class discrimination in this movie. What I saw was a bunch of pariahs preying on a very trusting, very naive family, ignorant to the plot unfurling at their expense. These people ruined the livelihood of nice people who had job security. They lied to this family. And the family paid the price.As for the man who held his nose, wasnt the parasitic family in raw sewage the night before? That said this movie will keep you in suspense. But again it's not the best Korean movie I have ever seen.If you want to see a good korean movie watch The Man from Nowhere or Handphone. or A Company Man. You can watch Oldboy or Mother. These movies are all available on prime. You to see how parasite pales in comparison to just his hand for the movies. Hollywood, take note."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,10/10,"This is where the class dystopia begins, we see a story that looks as if it is false or to good to be true but it is! This movie seems to take on so many things and balance them all with perfection and grace. hats off to Boon Joon Ho for is fantastic wrtting and revolutionary direction."
PARASITE,19 April 2020,,"Parasite has it all. Direction, acting , screenplay and camerawork are all award level.This film is not boring, and the first hour is about as fascinating and attention grabbing as a movie can be. The second hour is not quite as successful as the first, in my opinion, but is still high level entertainment.The key to Parasite is the script, which is tasked with leading the viewer through a myriad of pinpoint plot developments that always seem to be teetering on a razors edge. I feel safe to say this is one of the best screenplays of the 21st century.If I had to summarize Parasite it would be , ""never a dull moment""."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,9/10,"This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so.
Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,9/10,"It's worthy of your time. No wonder its director won an Oscar, he did a great job. Also, you won't find a minute to be distracted or bored. One thing remains unsubtle, for me, I didn't get satisfied with the ending."
PARASITE,13 June 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho's latest film, Parasite, is a finely crafted potpourri. It opens with the Kim family (Chung-sook (wife), Ki-taek (husband), Ki-jung (daughter), Ki-woo (son)) in their semi-basement apartment, the perfect setting for this working class household struggling to keep their heads above ground. They rely on their neighbours for free wi-fi while they sit on the kitchen floor folding pizza boxes for cash. A friend of Ki-woo's has been tutoring the daughter of a wealthy family (the Park's) and when a replacement is needed, Ki-woo, with the help of his document forging sister, fakes his way into the job. The Parks require a significant amount of help to run their household and as such need an art teacher for their son, a driver for the father, and a housekeeper to maintain their luxurious home. The Kim's are a clever clan and find a way to infiltrate each of these positions through cunning and deceit, often usurping previous help. By this point, we understand enough to see that this is a film about class conflict. The Kim's appear to be the protagonists with a grand plan, and you'd expect the Park's to be characterized as either villainous or ignorant, but they're neither. They're quite a nice family, only they're focused on their own objectives. When the Park's leave for a weekend of camping, the Kim's take over the home, boasting and toasting their good fortune. Mid soirée they're interrupted by an unexpected visitor and that's when the action really begins. The film's screenplay is too unique to be classifiable and the twists and turns too unexpected to reveal. If my recommendation isn't enough, the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a universal festival, unlike the Oscars which Bong called ""a local festival"" as part of his press tour to the tittering of film lovers. The film is distinctly Korean, but broadly relatable as we all live under the zero sum game of capitalism. Bong asks, who is the parasite? The labour class who need a job to survive, or the wealthy, who can't survive without their labour?"
PARASITE,31 January 2021,10/10,"Even the poster for this movie is perfect. It's full of heartbreak, intrigue, suspense. There's wonderful acting and beautiful camera work. The colors are fantastic. The only downfall is having to pay attention to the captions the whole time, but I watch all movies with subtitles anyways, so not that big of a deal, and certainly not a negative when it comes to this movie."
PARASITE,18 September 2019,10/10,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,8/10,"If this film was on the BBC (no adverts) one night I would think it was good fun, well acted, slightly satirical and light as a meringue. Therefore I'd give it 8/10 if asked.
However, this film has been held aloft like Simba by all concerned within the entertainment industry as the 'thing' you need to love and that makes a rebel without a case like me peg my nose."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,10/10,It's a more hopeful and ironic Shoplifters. Dope Movie.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,"Worst movie I have seen all year, people who said good reviews need to wake up"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"Derivative and too long. Is today's audience in general so stupid that metaphors must be glaringly obvious? The story has been done so many times, and may I say, better, the acting is uneven and the surreal element has much stronger authors...think Bunuel, for example. The politics rules, once again, with a not so subtle nod towards both Koreas. Quite a good movie, as movies go, but the hype is like its metaphors forced and obvious."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,9/10,"Great movies often stay with me long after I watch them. Parasite is a great movie and one that I found myself thinking about over and over, days after I watched it in the cinema. For those that haven't seen it, it's very hard to describe what sort of movie this is. Part heist, part thriller, very 'Hitchcockian', it's incredibly tense and often very funny. It's amazing how invested you can be in a film with no clear 'good or bad guys', no one in this film is a hero.Parasite is laden with social commentary, some subtle and some not so! At times it walks the line between believable and unbelievable and will have you questioning every characters morales at one point or another. It is perfectly paced and wonderfully shot. I didn't love the very end, that's not to say I didn't get the message it was portraying, I just didn't think it was quite up to the standard of the rest of the film. I don't want to include any spoilers though and the beauty of this film is that everyone will draw their opinion.9.3/10 - I'm looking forward to watching it again sometime!"
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,"Story
All unemployed, Ki-taek and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.
REVIEW
As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..
RATING
4.0/5.0"
PARASITE,26 December 2019,7/10,A good Movie. A Little to Long but definetly worth it and also surprisingly funny.
PARASITE,23 July 2021,6/10,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie. And let me be clear here, not just specifically korean but literally any non-US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway; with a bit of luck of course. Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.P. S.: The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm, the movie is still watchable; when drunk."
PARASITE,10 August 2019,9/10,"Director Bong Joon-ho has done it again. Although, still couldn't surpass his previous masterpiece 'Memories of Murder', this film is without a doubt, one of the best film of 2019.As usual for Bong Joon-ho's film, this film is rather weird, which I absolutely love. The story is very original and smart. You'll find yourself questioning who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Is it the poor who will do anything in order to survive, or is it the rich who live their life standing on top of others, ignorance of the people under them. While the film doesn't dive into the background story of the characters much, you'll still be able to grasp the motives of each characters through their expressions and subtle hints within the dialogue spoken.Moreover, every scenes shown within the film is well thought out. The contrast between the two very different social classes within the society is well hinted throughout the entire film. I'm really impressed with the efforts the filmmakers put into these small but significant moments.The casts are also excellent (and of course, that's include my favorite actors, Song Kang-ho). They all manage to seems very convincing in this weird setting. Everyone in the film all has their moments and they all have a role to play in the film. Nobody outshines the others.Overall, this film did not disappoint. I can see why this film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes. It's an odd but simple film with a powerful message."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,10/10,Just watch the damn movie its awesome...hollywood has had its ass kicked...story is so original
PARASITE,3 November 2019,10/10,"It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,3/10,"Something new, but confusing, at times boring, not funny, off tone, off performance, makes this a 3"
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,"Golden Palm Award winning film ""parasite""There is a reality that is divorced from reality,How can the gap between classes be so easily broken,In the end it is nothing but a joy for the poor.Compared to some movie declarations,Don't care about other people's prejudice against you,Live yourselfThis movie is much more real,Don't give you hope,To expose you all this tragedy naked!Behind the seemingly absurd, it is nothing more than thinking about money and humanity!"
PARASITE,13 June 2020,9/10,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
PARASITE,15 September 2020,10/10,Only one film in the world can do that and it's this one.
PARASITE,9 February 2020,5/10,"Well, I'm shocked by other people's perception that for some reason this is a great movie. It's okay...weird, strange, far-fetched, unusual, but not the best movie of 2020. Same goes for Jojo Rabbit.I recently saw 1917 and it is by far superior and my favorite so far this year. Ford v Ferrari and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were also quite good. Have not yet seen Joker, The Irishman, Little Women and Marriage Story, but will."
PARASITE,28 July 2020,10/10,"I don't often watch Korean movies or drama but this movie was FANTASTIC !There are a lot of things that makes my mind blow : starting from finding the WiFi signal! The plan they made as a family to find a living! To survive in this life that don't have any mercy! Every word! Every sentence was covered by gold!I think that Jessica was right when she said we must find a solution that satisfy everyone and her mom agreed too! I think if Jessica gave them the food then probably we would see a very different scenarios instead of going there with a big rock!I like how Kevin planned his life, such an ambitious guy! even if the certificate was fake, He wanted to join that University! He wanted to marry that girl in the future, never lost the hope, trying his best to find his father, planned to save money and buy that house! that's what life is all about!Another aspect realy shocking was
That woman opening the window in the car when she was not wearing shoes ... It really bothered me because they were not judging them because of what they did , but because of their appearance .
I think there are sooo many things so interesting ... Go and see the movie!!!!That's all!"
PARASITE,27 August 2019,7/10,"Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,1/10,Definitely they would have given bribe to get Oscar!!!
PARASITE,21 October 2019,10/10,Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.Do yourself a favor and watch this film.
PARASITE,10 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite (2019)10/10 💸""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,10/10,"From a thriller of Memories of Murder to a monster film of The Host, Bong Joon Ho could transform a family drama as entertaining as never before.Truly an unexpected, perfect, blend of genres to satirize class division and hypocrisy.Even the dialogue scenes are not tiresome, but intriguing and often hilarious.Well done Korean Cinema, proud of you!"
PARASITE,29 January 2020,10/10,"All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing."
PARASITE,2 March 2021,4/10,"When I watched this film, I'll admit, perhaps my mouth twinged at the corners a few times (more so than most other films declaring themselves to be ""comedy"" which I rate one star on average). But this film is mere tripe, it pales in comparison to the refinement, depth and complexity of the popular Adult Swim show, ""Richard and Mortimer"" (Rick and Morty for lower IQ individuals). In fact, the part in particular that has utterly taken my fancy is an episode wherein the titular ""Richard"" transforms himself into none other than a lacto-fermented cucumber, and proudly proclaims his new designation to be ""Pickle Rick""! Oh how I laughed, for this is true comedy, this is art. This film simply fails to compare to its better, and while I consider it above average as far as modern comedic films go, I simply cannot rate it higher than 4 stars. This is probably due to my incredibly high IQ. My name is Jeurel Barton, bury me with dislikes if you disagree"
PARASITE,17 January 2020,8/10,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire."
PARASITE,7 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10"
PARASITE,25 June 2019,10/10,"Best movie i've ever seen in decade, everything is so brilliant"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,7/10,"As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,8/10,I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10
PARASITE,3 February 2021,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho and his long awaited rise to masterclass. Without doubt this director has a cabinet that cripples some of the historically best, but has been underestimated for over a decade. Parasite does what so many others cannot achieve. Successful genre-twisting, combing elements of classical horror, dark humour and enriching drama so successfully that you'd think it's a class of its own. The performances are looked over simply because, and I say this cautiously, the best movie direction seen in my lifetime.Fantastic story, fantastic everything!
Rare 10. WOW!"
PARASITE,3 March 2021,10/10,I'll give this a 10 because there is no room for improvement. My first 10. Loved it. A mix of everything in one movie. Cannot give any spoilers away..you'll have to watch for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
PARASITE,22 May 2020,3/10,"Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult. Breathing the air in the darkroom can only walk like a ghost. Holding the poor stone for life can't get rid of it, and catching the cheap smell can't get rid of it forever. The bedbugs crouching in the ground can be sterilized by medicine windows, and the hosts on the high ground can hire people to sterilize themselves with money. The rich suck the blood of the poor, and the poor live in the rich's house. People and ghosts share food in the same room."
PARASITE,24 January 2021,10/10,"This movie was lit asf. A brother gets angry cause he smells like 💩 because of the bad life that he has had, but his son and daugther are smart asf and they are going to get them out of the nasty hole they live in."
PARASITE,2 May 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I've seen in year's. Thank God
PARASITE,12 May 2020,8/10,"Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult. Breathing the air in the darkroom can only walk like a ghost.

PARASITE,12 May 2020,8/10,"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed. It's really ingenious. It's a very good story. It's linked up and reversed. The performance of the actors is also excellent. But in the end, it fell into the routine of Korean movie. Now I can understand why the director said he can't play through, because if the play through, the visibility of the film will be greatly reduced. Satire, cold humor, and Reflections on social issues are all felt. But I'm sorry, it's not the palms I'm looking forward to."
PARASITE,19 May 2020,6/10,Can guess what is going on and the way of acting of korean i do not like
PARASITE,18 May 2020,8/10,"Heaven and earth are not kind, on the basis of my humble opinion of all things. After millions of years of evolution, a small part of humanity eventually evolved into god and a large part descended into mere survival parasites."
PARASITE,1 June 2020,8/10,"This movie reflects the current status of Korean society. The huge gap between rich and poor has brought huge differences in people's mind and material. In fact, these differences have not changed since ancient times. The oppression of ""slave owners and slaves"", ""nobles and civilians"" and ""landlords and peasants"" has never disappeared, but we were born in a good era and we can't feel the cruelty. The most powerful thing is to make you feel that part --- the truth clearly."
PARASITE,26 July 2020,10/10,"I just watched Titanic and this and I saw in both movies how people who has that stupid paper ,WHICH IS CALLED MONEY, look at people who doesn't and it's disgusting. I hated it when in Titanic they put the rich people on the boats and lock the poor people deep down in the ship.
we are all humans and should be respecting each others soul as prophet Muhammad said
""All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action."""
PARASITE,27 February 2021,8/10,"'Parasite' is a solid movie through and through. The Kim's devious ""no-plan"" to get themselves from their pitiful subterranean hole into a luxurious lifestyle is a unique one. Where the comedy comes into this movie is that they never think it through as is their intention, but their fumbles don't matter because the Parks are so gullible to begin with. Yeo-jung Cho's acting gives the best portrayal of anxiety and naivety that allows the audience to understand why the ""no-plan"" is so successful. And it's Kang-ho Song's positive and respectful Ki Taek, who absolutely steers the family ship, that makes the Kim's situation relatable and their deception forgivable. I will say that the ending, albeit catastrophic, did and yet didn't grip me. I doubt many feel the way I do about it. Maybe because as lovable as the Kims were, they were not innocent. The good times couldn't last forever. No lie of that magnitude survives long. And karma came for them horribly. While all the events of the finale did grip me in its moral context and its tragic somberness, when the film was over the lasting impression wasn't there because I felt the family that played with matches got burned as expected. But it's still poetic and still a beautiful film."
PARASITE,22 July 2021,10/10,"Simply amazing, one of the best korean movies I've ever seen. There is no word to describe this. Just watch it, you won't regret
(((Somw sciences are not suitable for family or teens )))"
PARASITE,18 April 2021,9/10,"We came late to the Parasite party, watching it a year after the brouhahah, and it does live up to the hype. Despite the universal praise the film received, I was somehow reluctant to watch it, but I am very glad I bit the bullet - the film was satisfying, informative, funny, sad and beautifully made. It's a film of three halves, part Roma, part French comedy of errors, part Shakespearean tragedy. The Roma elements introduced us to Korean culture which was a refreshing insight to lifestyles I knew nothing about. The comedy of errors elements are genuinely funny and very well scripted, with sass and wit and portrayed and directed with excellent timing. The tragedy is shocking but never out of kilter with the rest of the film (I'll say no more in case of spoilers, suffice to say, it somewhat vindicated my earlier reluctance to watch the film, but I am extremely glad I overcame that reluctance.). It is a 10 star film given 9 because, realistically, I doubt I will watch it again even though it is an excellent film."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"I saw this Movie just one day after it won 4 Oscars:
Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film.
For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON...
This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society...
Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany.
The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long...
The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking.
The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story...
The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job.
This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better.
It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10.
P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL"
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,"The scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy, and I loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner. The montage with the peach was also masterful, as was the way many scenes were filmed, styled, and handled. I loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them (temporarily).The young Kim family sister is an extremely talented actress, and so is the Parks pampered wife. The other actors were all solid as well. The story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities.The movie is never uninteresting. Even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so, it remains intriguing, but this is the only part that I felt that could have been a little bit better. I also had some questions about the incident at the Parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did.The suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes, and the humor was usually landing. The artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story. This is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the Oscars."
PARASITE,30 August 2020,10/10,"Simply exhilarating! As a long time lover of classical music and a sucker for delicate frame composition and well-thought-out cinematography, I couldn't have asked for a better representation of all three.The film is well-orchestrated and at times you are not sure if you are at a classical concert or in a movie theater. The plot is tangible whether you align yourself more with the Kim or Park family. Frame composition is painstakingly crafted to deliberately imply the status of one family above the other or separate from them. Acting is stylistically directed in alignment with the tempo of the film. By the end, you are not sure where you stand within the plot and who you relate to more and maybe that's a good sign, a sign that the film was well-written.I simply can't think of anything I did not like about this film and that's why I highly recommend it to any movie lover, or even more to aspiring filmmakers like myself. There is a lot to be learnt and even more to be enjoyed."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,4/10,"To beat Scorsese,Mendes,Tarantino and Philips AND to beat The Irishman,Once upon a time...,1917, et al - I really was expecting this to be something special. I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their ""twilight"" years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019. Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its' mark as a comedy. Perhaps its' role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience.Personally, I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment. Of course the influence of Hollywood's ""wild man"", Quentin Tarantino,had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half. I can only imagine that nowadays, the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"",""Whisky Galore"",""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""Hue and Cry"". Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not ""new"" and different but is a retread of old classics.I've watched ho's ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"" and can't help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some,usually sensible, film critics claim. For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent. There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the ""industry"" were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit. The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market. Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded ""Best Picture""? I doubt it very much."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"Title says its all, starts off as a decent story and just gets totally unexpected."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,9/10,"It's hard to explain for me... at first I think it's only comedy movie but at last, it showed me I was wrong. I said to myself I liked this movie..and also scared of it..
It was interesting movie of real life. This is my first Korea movie ,so I think it good."
PARASITE,2 May 2021,9/10,"Many layered, brilliantly directed and acted. This has it all. Poverty, wealth, deception, comedy, horror, greed, humility, twists, double-crossing, life lessons.... Keeps you guessing throughout. The film's strongest attribute, is the interaction of the characters and how there lives intertwined and impacted on each other."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,9/10,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.
While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,4/10,"I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't.
I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters.
I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable.
And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas."
PARASITE,28 December 2020,6/10,"It's not a bad movie. But maybe not for me? The story about poor family attaching themself to rich people like ""parasites"" is good. I realy liked first part of the movie but don't understand the dark turn in the second part. Ok so the Kim family lost themself but still they get evil a bit to fast. And the worst of all the party at the end. Why did the father Ki Taek killed Mr. Park? Because he was a bit selfish? Ki Taek just standed there doing nothing when his daughter was dying and his wife was fighting. Mr. Park just wanted keys to the car but for both his son and Ki Taek son. Sorry I know this movie have a lot of allusions and social commentaries but it's presented poorly for me."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,10/10,"It's pretty difficult to rate a movie 10 out of 10. Either because is full of cliches, or maybe it's stupid, or too much Hollywood action, you name it.... any movie has a flaw.Except for Bong Joon Ho movies. This guy is like a total GOD of movies, a guru in it's true sense.For those of you which seen other movies of this guy, you will know immediately what I mean.His movies are unique. You can't compare them with something else. And Parasite is just one of them which has no equal.The title is self explanatory. You can't name this movie otherwise once you see it. This is true a story about parasites, how they infect a host and kill it in the end."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,3/10,"The movie starts as a funny, original idea. Promised to be a nice comedy. It could've been good, alas... it had a second half.
For no reason at all, during the second half, the comedy is completely gone and the movie becomes a sociopathic nightmare. Everybody starts killing everybody with no reason, without any sense and with extreme violence and graphic gore.
WTF???
Why did they abandon a good comedy? Could they really not find a good finish? What is the point?
I have lost any faith I still had for the Oscars. We know they are half political. But best movie of the year? The movie is quite bad. So why did they give it so many prizes? Because it shows a social separation and those movies always win big prizes for some reason. Do the Oscars judges feel a social obligation? Does it make them sleep better at night? Are their lives so miserable that they need to smile on the less fortunate for a false sense of altruism? Or is The president afraid of Corea?
This social inequality might be shocking to many people but it happens everyday everywhere. You just have to want to open your eyes.
It's a shame. Parasite won best picture because it IS a strong critic the the difference of social levels, that many countries in the world suffer. But best picture? It's no even a good picture. It's not even a mediocre picture. It's dumb. senseless and a waste of time.
To be put bluntly, it sucks!
Total shame on the Oscars. Specially with the fabulous movies it was competing against."
PARASITE,31 July 2020,10/10,"The subtitles might be a bit much for non-koreans but the movie more than makes up for it. I complained when it won eight million academy awards because of all the other great movies but now see why it is so praised. A serious contender for ""Movies better than Old Boy""."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"I knew nothing about this film until I watched it. Thank god I watch no trailers or even read a description of it. I didn't even know the plot and that made it so much more exciting. Its split into two movies. Exactly halfway the movie a doorbell rings and it changes to the second movie. I was gripped from start to end. Anyone who gave it a 1 star just hasn't seen the movie.
Probably one of the greatest movies of all time!"
PARASITE,26 March 2021,10/10,"With Parasite, Bong Joon Ho once again proves that he is a master of social commentary in cinema. Eventhough he has tackled several socially relevant themes in his previous movies, particularly in Snowpiercer, it hasn't been as immaculate as his work on Parasite. With a masterfully written screenplay and flawless direction, Bong has created a cleverly constructed critique on the class divisions of our society.The true genius of the film lies in its subtlety. Instead of presenting the themes in an on the nose manner, the film utilizes several symbols and metaphors using the characters, as well as the impeccable production design and blocking, both of which was aided by an exceptional screenplay and one of the best usages of storyboarding in cinema. The film conveys its themes entirely through these aspects with little to no reliance on exposition. The theme of wealth inequality is presented through the lives of two families who are at the two extreme ends of the financial spectrum and the parasitic relationship that occurs between them. One of the most notable achievements of the production design is the portrayal of the localities of the two families. The Kim family lives in a congested, cluttered, stink bug infested, frequently flooded semi-basement house in the lower regions of the city, relying on cheap food, surrounded by crammed up houses of similar conditions. On the other hand, the wealthy Park family lives in a modernistic, spacious, well-organized house with expensive possessions, in a beautiful neighborhood, in the upper regions of the city. The best visual representation of this can be seen in the sequence where Ki-woo walks up to the Park family house. A cleverly placed edit, suddenly transitions the gloomy, congested alleyway of the slum, to the sunlit, spacious driveway of the Park house. Another example of the brilliance of the production design is the subtle portrayal of the increasing wealth of the Kims. The cheap possessions seen in the house of the Kim family in the earlier scenes are gradually replaced by more expensive objects in the subsequent scenes.The movie showcases how the existing class divide in our society, forces a parasitic relationship between the upper and the lower class. This is best expressed through the infiltration of the Park house by the Kim family, followed by them existing almost as parasites on the Park family. This parasitic existence makes them temporarily rise above their hardships. This is evident from the sequence where they finally manage to chase away the drunkard who constantly urinates near their doorstep, symbolizing them standing up against the pathetic living conditions that have been plaguing them for years. However, the wealthy also live as parasites on the poor, as seen by how the Parks utilizes the Kims for their needs.Another aspect the movie addresses is the competition which occurs among the members of the lower class, which is a direct result of parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor. This is presented by the conflict that occurs between the Kims and the housekeeper and her husband. Both families who live as parasites on the Parks eventually discover each other, and engage in a bitter conflict with one another, to claim their place as the ""parasite"". This internal competition within the lower class, results in their own downfall, as the ensuing conflict results in them ending up in a much worse situation than before. An attempt to change this, will ultimately result in the downfall of the society as a whole, since the modern society is built on the existence of class divisions. This is symbolized by the climatic birthday party sequence where all the three focal families suffer fatal casualties. This results in the Kim family finding themselves in a much worse spot than they already were at the beginning of the film, which is the eventual outcome of the internal conflict for power which occurs among the lower class.The film also showcases how both the classes are affected differently by the same events. This is most evident by how differently both the families are affected by heavy rain. The Kims' lives are nearly destroyed by the flood, while the Parks view the rain as a mild inconvenience as their camping trip had to be canceled. While Ki-Tiek grieves the loss imposed on him by the rain, Mrs Park gleefully talks about how the rain had reduced the pollution and freshened the air.The film also deals with the destructive nature of false hope, symbolized by the Scholar's rock which Ki-woo receives from his friend. The rock, which promises wealth, instills a false hope in Ki-woo and his family. This prompts them to go on this risky affair which ultimately results in their own downfall. This leads to one of the most effective instances of symbolism in the film, as the rock is used as weapon against Ki-woo, symbolizing how his hope had betrayed him.By a blend of exceptional works done in the field of writing, directing, acting cinematography, editing and production design, Bong Joon Ho has constructed one of the best critiques of the modern day class divisions and wealth inequalities of the modern society. Despite detesting class divisions, Bong also acknowledges that such a division ultimately acts the backbone of the society. Once the distinction between these classes become inconspicuous, the foundation of the society will be disrupted, resulting in its destruction, a theme presented quite explicitly in his previous film, Snowpiercer.Through the eyes of the Kim family, Bong Joon Ho showcases one of the sad truths about our society. Due to the existing class divide, the poor in search of a better life, are forced to live as parasites on the rich, which in-turn causes an internal competitive conflict among the poor, resulting in their own doom, bringing them back to the same condition as before or to a much worse spot. These series of events are inevitable because our society is built on this nature and any attempt to change this nature will have catastrophic results. The film doesn't criticize the families for their actions. Instead, it criticizes the nature of the society which forced them to commit these actions."
PARASITE,10 November 2020,9/10,"This film is truly an accomplishment in filmmaking. Director Bong Joon Ho starts off with such a simple plot, and manages to turn the film into something really crazy, and quite suspenseful, which I was not expecting at all, especially after having seen the trailer. As for the cast, I don't really know anything about any of them, as I have not seen any of the other films that they have been in, but they all did a fantastic job in their roles. The main cast does a great job at portraying this manipulative family who will do just about anything in order to make a living, while the wealthy family's actors do a great job at portraying these gullible and complacent characters that have no idea about the intentions of the workers that they have just recently hired. One thing that I absolutely loved was the entire plot and how it was executed. I did not realize how crazy this movie would end up getting, I really thought that it was just just going to be drama between two families for much of the film, but it ended up being so much more than that, I loved it. No wonder it won all of the awards that it did, definitely one if the best movies I've seen in a long time."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,10/10,"I don't write long reviews, and I'm not going to here. All you need to know is that this film is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Acting was superb, directing was world-class, plot was near perfect. Seriously, go watch this movie right now."
PARASITE,3 June 2020,4/10,"In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating. One i like from this movie is description between rich and poor. I like this part a lot, that's why this movie got an oscar. But overall is not good as rating."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,8/10,"The first third of them are very good-looking. I thought they were comic comedies. After the men in the basement came out, I thought six people would live together. I didn't expect that the plot would suddenly change. The director had to lead a story without any sense of reality to the cruelty of realism. As a result, it became more and more painful. The last one was especially stiff. Selina said there was a smell of death in the poor. The film's depiction of the poor is not as accurate and powerful as this sentence."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,9/10,"""The person who takes half a second to see into the essence of things, and the person who takes a lifetime to see into the essence of things, are doomed to be completely different destinies."" This line is the best commentary on the fate of the two families in the film. Maybe, but more often to know, people for their own birth, the situation and so on have a lot of powerless and helpless, who do not want to live in the sun forever, let themselves let their families live a happy life, who want to live in the basement rent, but also be disgusted with the taste of poverty on the body?"
PARASITE,19 May 2020,8/10,"The rich man did nothing wrong, even to the servants, but he could not help hating them, hating them!"
PARASITE,31 May 2020,1/10,"To be honest, I am so disappointed! Some of the Korean movies I saw before were good, but the plot of the film was too stiff. The film is so full of class stereotypes that it appears that some plots and people are stupid."
PARASITE,3 June 2020,8/10,"A prophetic drama of the sublimation of class contradictions, the genre film's big frame, but showing all the artistic details, dislike the dramatic plot of this film, is not to see this film is absurd surrealism style.
What I like most is the pan lens of Three people walking in the rainstorm of Keizer family after the rain, which is extremely clever and USES a class metaphor from top to bottom. ""Stone"" in the film the role and meaning is self-evident, a symbol of the base jersey - parasitic class nature and destiny, after rain, floating on the surface of the water, battered, parasitic, hypocritical, greedy nature, and in the space of dreams, ""stone"" sink in the bottom, metaphor true, really, composed of vision, the goodness of the parasitic class of its own."
PARASITE,18 June 2020,9/10,"""Parasite"" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice."
PARASITE,14 September 2020,8/10,"Good acting, cinematography, twists and screenplay. The side I liked the most is the location chose, it seemed like every location was perfect for the screenplay and vice-versa.
Nothing revolutionary, but still a really good movie."
PARASITE,15 November 2021,2/10,So the super smart members of a poor family (why don't they get real jobs?) take advantage of the gullibility and kindness of a successful rich family to take jobs in the rich family's home (getting other people fired to do it) and then abuse that kindness...with a totally stupid ending...and this is supposed to be a statement against capitalism? How this trash won the Oscar when there were so many good nominations that year is a mystery.
PARASITE,19 July 2020,7/10,"Wow! Brilliant yet with some fragmented story lines. Very funny and then alarmingly dark. Found the violence and over the top change in storyline in the last 1/4 of the film difficult to watch and really disliked it. After, I wish I had not watched this film. Very difficult to rate. I guess I am tired of all the violence. So glad though to see a movie made in South Korea come to the mainstream theater here."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,3/10,"This movie was so boring. So overrated. I admit it - this is not my genre - but even so I do not see why this movie was almost universally critically acclaimed. One good thing about watching this movie - I fell asleep and apparently have sleep apnea so I'm gonna go get that checked and treated. So, there's that. If you like interminable movies with an absurd plot and no movement, then this movie is great. Me personally? I'd rather have a colonoscopy than sit through this movie again."
PARASITE,21 October 2019,10/10,"I just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful. It is a mix of moments that happen as fun, joy, tensions and sadness. The climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting, you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen, everything flowed very well. I'm amazed at the movie, a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday!NOTE: The counterpoint of the rain scene is ""because of the rain the rich can't get to camp"" and ""because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp (in the gym)"""
PARASITE,11 February 2020,4/10,"While I understand that I like movies that are prob not on the best picture stage, I give all movies a chance. I heard a lot about this and was curious so my husband and I rented. I was forever waiting for it to get interesting and the thriller to come out but it never did. I was surprisingly not distracted by the subtitles but although a fun interesting movie, I don't see where the best picture came in. If you're bored or call in sick one day I'd say give it a watch but I wouldn't rave about this."
PARASITE,15 December 2019,10/10,"Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"No plan is the (best) plan. No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,6/10,"This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness."
PARASITE,24 October 2020,2/10,"Every single minute of this movie I was wondering why, why, why, would anyone give any credit to such rubbish. How a terrible movie like this would get any praise at all! And I finally got the answer: Political Bleeping Correctness. ""Give an award to the different people even if the movie stinks""! A criminal con family. Are those the new ""heroes""? The Shawn of the dead is much better than this. Run fast!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent moviesIn my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottomThe movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.Sad open ended finale.Highly recommend
PARASITE,16 February 2020,6/10,"The whole point of this movie is that there is a crazy guy in the basement and he has to come out to kill everyone like some sort of reverse Frankenstein plot. Don't tell me about symbolism or the more deep-core messages in this movie when everyone in it is a damn CARICATURE, with each person filling the stereotypical roles like the dumb, rich housewife so that only one thing can develop: and that is the story. There is no part of the film where we see any real in-depth look at poverty coming from the mouths of the characters, only their superficial actions which lay against a strict blueprint to propel the story forward to the climax which is the crazy guy coming out and killing everybody, So let's talk about the story: it's literally an infiltration movie, similar to heist movies like Ocean's 11 with much better cinematography. And this is where I give the movie an okay rating, because of the cinematography and overall directing which was done pretty well. Otherwise I don't see how people are raving that this is such a good movie, have they been hoodwinked by the fact that we've seen this all before with less stereotypical ways of depicting class struggles and character?"
PARASITE,14 January 2020,10/10,"This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?)
Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)Parasite? 6. (all deserved).Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it."
PARASITE,11 July 2019,9/10,"Parasite is a film that is so well crafted, so well told and original that I was left thinking non stop about it for days. Parasite is a film that you should know as little as possible about before watching as it weaves such an interesting and compelling narrative that will have you hooked in minutes. It is occasionally funny, often tense, sometimes shocking and always interesting. Within ten minutes of watching the film I figured out that this would be a slow burning film where the tension rises until everything comes to ahead and it did not disappoint. The film isn't shot in a flashy stylish way but it is still beautiful to look at and is shot superbly and subtly. The acting is good across the board with all the main cast getting moments to shine. The characters are all well thought out and three dimensional all having their own desires and motives. Parasite also has a strong social commentary to make (that I wont discuss for spoilers sake) but is not heavy handed and is slightly present at the beginning before it hits you hard towards the end. This film is so close to perfect but is let down by its ending. If the film had left the ending more ambiguous and finished 5-10 minutes earlier I would have given Parasite a ten. After seeing the film there is no question on why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and is one of the best films of 2019 by far."
PARASITE,31 May 2020,9/10,This is not just an ordinary movie that you might seeHow there's a difference created by the society on the bases of class-high/low is clearly shown. It has a different story and a meaning to it!
PARASITE,1 November 2019,9/10,"Set against an urban background bathing in pollution, floods, and the North-South tension as an ever-present echo in people's psyches, Bong Joon-Ho achieves a revelation of pure innocence of simple humans that are puppets of their circumstances. The relentless positivity of each studied family, even the little basement couple's, their love and dedication to each other keeps the audience in all the way through. It's hard to point the finger at any of the characters as the victim or the perpetrator, except the outside forces or the cutouts posted in the hiding place of the Housekeeper's husband. A Korean tradition by now, masterfully applied in the Wailing and The Chaser, there is an effective tonal play coating the baseline with humor which intensifies the suspense."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,9/10,The review by FNG of Parasite is a rockin' piece of cinema appraisal that really precludes my struggle to offer a more useful review! God knows this piece will not be bested by other than professional reviewers like the best ( Pauline Kael ) it requires the intellect of an afficionado who has already left the mortal-coil stage bereft. Absorb that User Review and understand what it means to appreciate great film making!!
PARASITE,17 July 2020,5/10,"To begin with I'm not a fan of Bong Joon-ho. I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second.
I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory.So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to.A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence.
To quote Calvino:
""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars."""
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯"
PARASITE,3 December 2020,10/10,"One of the most horrendously hilarious portrait of any typical family ever committed in cinema in recent memory.It's narrative had a global relevance seldom seen in cinema these days. It's multi-layered social commentary that still managed to be very Korean all with its profusely embedded cultural and historical references scattered throughout the story which seemingly etched in stone that was gifted to one of the main characters. Metaphorical, literal, it's everything a brilliant story could ever be. Never had I laughed in a cineplex so loud it's almost scandalous, an orgasmic feeling even. But what stands out as phenomenal in this film is the richness of how the characters in the film were all fleshed out, result is very multi-dimensional.I've seen qute a few of Bong Joon-ho's film works, and I can already say this film is not his finest work but it's grasp over the numerous accolades it has received since its release is very much deserved, and I definitely still want to be surprised with the stories he has already told and are still gonna tell in the future, so I'm very much looking forward to exploring his other works as well, it's just like finding jewel in the rough as they say.
Definitely, an alpha."
PARASITE,13 January 2021,4/10,I had high hopes for this due to the Oscar awards but was left rather disappointed. It was an odd mix of comedy and serious drama with unconvincing characters and a bit of a stupid story at times. Very different but for me fell flat and very overhyped. I've watched much better thought provoking films with good social commentary.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards!
A MUST WATCH!"
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;Best picture:

South KoreaI believe that Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood had better sets, but in all honesty, what is it compared to Parasite ?I would not hesitate to put it in my top 10 best movies which I have ever seen. And, it is probably, the greatest movie of the 2010's. Read no further about it, just watch it. You will be delighted.10/10"
PARASITE,2 July 2020,9/10,"It is incredibly well-written, directed, and acted. Bong Joon Ho has crafted this movie masterfully. It is one of those movies that keeps you guessing what will happen next every scene and occasionally throws you a major curveball, but not one that is entirely unexpected. Each character is fleshed out really well and is interesting to watch. Amazing! What a rollercoaster! Definitely recommend."
PARASITE,12 August 2020,9/10,"It's really hilarious most of the time and with some sadness of reality on the class level in the society as well.I've seen a lot of twist-ending mystery movies/shows so the ending isn't that surprising, but it's still a fun movie to watch!Although it's shot nicely, personally I thought 1917 should've won the Oscar over this for best film though"
PARASITE,3 August 2020,9/10,"An impressively constructed South Korean film. The lives of the rich and poor become entangled leading to disaster outs consequences. Top marks for cinematography, as well as the underlying dark and relatable theme shown throughout the movie. Parasite definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,5/10,"I heard glowing reviews about this movie and decided to watch it. I was expecting to be wowed, but was left disappointed. There are way too many plot holes in the movie. The Kim family is a poor family living in a small basement apartment and yet Mr. Kim is able to drive a Mr. Park's Mercedes Benz with ease and grace without any proper driver training or prior experience in handling luxury vehicles. he had to visit a dealership to check out its controls before taking up the job. Mr's Kim who also has no prior experience as a house keeper, appears to be acing her job. The same goes for the Kids too, they simply ace at their fake jobs.Not to mention the thankless nature of Mr.Kim, who instead of being thankful to Mr. Park for having employed his entire family, ends up killing Mr.Park. This movie certainly did no deserve an Oscar for best picture."
PARASITE,23 January 2020,10/10,"Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,7/10,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."
PARASITE,7 August 2020,7/10,"PARASITE (2019)A tale of the uneasy relationship between the classes, a tale of identity and of desire.
This morality play explores that even with a plan man is destined to remain caged and immobile no matter the social and economic aspirations.
The story has been told before but Korean director Bong Joon Ho ratches things up a bit, especially in the film's climactic ending. The lower class Kims are masters at manipulation and lying to get ahead and benefit working for a naive wealthy family. Yet sadly the Kim's never advance. The class struggle moves into poor against poor before dissolving into all out chaos between the classes. The director keeps a good distance from the characters painting them in broad strokes. The story ends violently, yet tragically it appears that nothing has really changed. One man confined to hiding in the cellar is simply replaced by another and the futile dream of social and economic advancement continues.
I often wondered while watching this film if PARASITE was the correct translation of the title. For me, the class relationships in this film are more symbiotic, each class needing the other to survive. So who or what is the parasite? For the director it is hope: that longing that burrows under the skin that you can't get rid of.
This is a well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay that has a natural forward movement to it. There is an artistic, art-house metaphoric quality to it (such as a rock is both a totem and a weapon), but I don't think it is the masterpiece many claim it to be. The movie plays out very straightforward, more like a made for tv mini series. An excellent three-parter perhaps.
The production is great and the actors are terrific, parts of it quite funny. However, for me this is a good movie, not a masterpiece nor Oscar best picture worthy. I rate PARASITE 7/10."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,9/10,"Basking in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing the air in the dark room will only walk like a ghost. Poverty on the stone can not be removed for life, caught the smell of cheap can never be removed. The bedbug that curdles underground, with medicated open a window to sterilize oneself; The host at the top pays someone to sterilize himself. The rich suck the blood of the poor rise, the poor send in the house of the rich survive, people ghost with a room to share food, insect and beast parasitic body development enmity."
PARASITE,27 February 2021,1/10,"Sometimes you just defend a movie or an idea because everybody likes or some loud people will scream the idea. But this movie is not a masterpiece or sth.
The family gave them jobs,money and opportunity. They were not treating them bad. They were just rich and they needed people to work with them. Why would you hate, lie, betray a family who gave you job and family and kill the man in the end with no motivation?
The guy lives in the basement doesn't have motivation to attack people like that. (Ok let's say he got crazy because they killed his wife but the director doesn't show this! We don't see character getting crazy and losing his mind in one day)
The father doesn't have motivation to kill the boss he just helped you and your family and you are disturbed because he doesn't want you to cross the line ? What the hell is that ? You supposed to be friends with your boss or you kill him? He tells you to do your job. His son is having health problems and the father was too worried he lost his mind, he didn't care people bleeding, he was blind couldn't think properly so what ? Everybody has a moment that can't think properly, a shock.
The movie is too overrated. So we should kill the rich because they have money and they provide jobs ? Or this is a critic for those who is greedy. In both ways i dont like a character killing another one with no motivation or they couldn't explain well ."
PARASITE,8 June 2020,9/10,"Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!"
PARASITE,18 May 2020,9/10,"It reflects the differences and opposition of the rich and the poor, and exposes the despair and helplessness of the underlying society.I think it does a good job of deconstructing the metaphors and themes of the story with attractive visual and audio premises. The theme of the movie is very good, and the shooting is also very clever."
PARASITE,11 February 2021,5/10,"It's a good entertaining movie, but for me it was very predictable. For those who are not in touch with other cultures or poverty issue may find this movie very innovative, but it has long sequences that are very boring. But overall, if you are someone who watch movies regularly, you will find this very predictable.
I wouldn't call it a ""masterpiece""."
PARASITE,29 July 2020,8/10,"""Parasites"" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed it. Fun little movie. Not sure what all the Hype is about, though, not even close to movie of the year. Worth a watch for sure."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,10/10,"Having just rewatch the movie again last night, I'm again confirmed with why this title was my personal best movie of 2019. Even on second viewing, there isn't a single boring minute. The tale captures you from the very beginning and makes you feel heavily invested in the story right away.The first hour is gleefully entertaining, showing the poor family put on a scam scheme. When you see it unfolds, it just leaves you with a smile on your face and laughing along with their execution. And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie. Not getting into spoilers, but this build up is well worth it.Overall the movie is simply a viewing pleasure. Great acting, excellent story and cinematography filled with symbolism. An irreverent tale of class differences I would highly recommend anyone to give it a watch."
PARASITE,9 October 2021,7/10,"The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again."
PARASITE,17 December 2019,8/10,"It's a nice-to-watch movie and nice-to-think afterwards of what you've just saw.At first, it feels you are watching a single-sided comedy, in which a family of poor-devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people. But, 45 minutes later, you see something different.It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene, trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is ok.The ending is not the best I could think of, I guess, rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming.Very strong and meaningful pictures, painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world, showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere. The main characters is like they're living in North Korea if you think of it!Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil, nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that make us react the way we do. I am not even quite sure who's the parasite. Poor people who discover a window for (a better) living or rich people who take advantage of lower-class people in order to obtain their wealth, not knowing how it is, to be poor?"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,6/10,"I enjoyed this film but I don't think it's the masterpiece that critics have made it out to be. I didn't get the numerous multiple genres from this that others have claimed it has. It's effectively a crime flick with a poor family conning a rich family with some social commentary thrown in. I suppose the ending is a bit more thriller/horror.The story is entertaining enough, some of the imagery is lovely and it's well acted. See it but don't expect it to be the best film of the year."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Korean films are love. Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective.
Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure.
Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience.
No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.
It's rightfully the MOVIE OF THE YEAR OF 2019!"
PARASITE,18 March 2020,5/10,"From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,6/10,"First half of the movie was really boring. Second half was kinda interesting though. An the ending was really really bad for my opinion. The other thing that was annoying is that the actors over played at times and the worse of all was the actor who played the boss lady . She was over playing and it was really annoying. I don't know if those were the directions but I did not like it at all.
In conclusion not an Oscar worth movie, not a masterpiece..."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,10/10,"Honestly I was reluctant to watch this movie for a long time. Because I felt Joker should have cleaned up at the Oscars. But after seeing this I fully understand the academy's decision. What a masterpiece of storytelling. It simply has every ingredient a perfect movie needs. Excitement, laughter and crying it's all in there."
PARASITE,13 August 2019,8/10,"One of the best of the decade, Cinematography is priceless, screenplay is top-notch.
one of the best stories about poverty-wealth complex I've ever seen.
you're experiencing two stories and two completely different movies until half-way as you're watching the poor family planning their way through the other life and it connects together in the best way possible,
since the basement is found, you enter another world of twist and mystery which messes with your mind and gets you on another journey.all I can say is,
ABSOLUTE GOLD!"
PARASITE,9 July 2020,9/10,"This movie just had it all : comedy , drama , tense . All very well stuck together . Definitely worth the watch !"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"Maybe this film makes a statement about class, as some claim. It could just as well be a statement about films, or the film industry. Nicely produced and well-acted, the plot was almost entirely predictable but the climax seemed contrived--though the denouement was interesting. Somehow American Beauty came to mind. That's about all I've got, having just seen it."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,10/10,"So much to unpack. incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography. Well written script. Masterful suspense, so many metaphors! the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over. I was captivated through the whole movie.I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea/South Korea as well as social class, but I haven't seen anyone else point that out, so it could be me grasping at straws.For the main family, the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began, minus the father and daughter. Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook are presumably still struggling, at the bottom of the stairs again. Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away. Thus describes Bong Joon-Ho's ruthless realism; the poor get poorer, and life continues on with no plan to fix anything.Not that that matters, it wouldn't work anyway."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.Loved it."
PARASITE,25 May 2021,10/10,Good movie with show you how to take advantage from another family. And how easy can be to replace people with easy tricks. I really like the idea. Everyone shows different types of people and way how to show themselves.
PARASITE,15 September 2021,1/10,"This film made me feel so depressed I would actively discourage anyone from seeing it who feels down at times. I do always try to be as positive as I can when talking about anything but this film made me feel so hopeless that I don't have anything positive to say about it. It left me in a really dark place and I wish I had never seen it. No-one will like seeing this film, critics may have given good reviews, but none of them could say they enjoyed the film. It makes you feel so depressed that since this is something I do struggle with, it affected my mental health after watching this.The quality was really disappointing, I predicted everything that was going to happen at every point in the story and none of the main characters felt anything approaching realistic as they were extremely one-dimensional and horrible from the opening moments with a completely age-inappropriate relationship involving one of those characters throughout the film. But most of all this is a film which is completely rotten to its core. The worst film I have ever seen. Avoid it if you want to enjoy yourself."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,9/10,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end."
PARASITE,18 November 2019,10/10,"Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me."
PARASITE,5 May 2021,10/10,"There is no action in the first hour and a half, but still i loved to watch every single part, family problems combined whit some action on the last part. Just gold."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"I rated this a 7 yesterday but after a full day of thinking about it, I must say it's really good. Slow burn, it has everything in it. Unpredictable and makes you react outloud"
PARASITE,29 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a fantastic film made by the wonderful Bong Joon Ho. Every single frame is beautifully crafted and the story was investing throughout the entire two hour runtime. It is very darkly hilarious, smart, and overall excellent. It also has without a doubt one of the most realistic endings in film history. With a single flaw in sight, Parasite will be perfect for any movie-goer."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"The scene where the family was under the table was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever watched in a movie. 10/10 amazing movie, those reviewing it anything lower then a 7 don't know what a good movie is."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,2/10,"The film won the Oscar for the first time in the history of Korean films. I wondered where it was better than other Korean movies, so I went to see it. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The film is too stereotypical and many plots are stiff. There's a lot better than this movie, and I can' t understand it won the Oscar."
PARASITE,18 September 2020,10/10,"A seemingly perfect film, this film is so complex and beautiful, watch it."
PARASITE,15 November 2019,8/10,"Incredible screenplay, uncanny script with a completely unpredictable plot despite the anticipation of anomalous outcomes.. Clever comedic infusion with artistic representation of the consequence of deep social divide."
PARASITE,17 August 2019,9/10,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
PARASITE,9 February 2020,,"First half of the movie was okay, second half was much better. Overall it is very good movie. Great story not so great executed."
PARASITE,17 January 2021,5/10,"I don't have that much to say about this movie. It's too plain and mediocre. Nothing special about the story, nothing about the characters. The plot twist, if you may call it that, is weak at best. The decorations were built with great attention to detail, but they don't create any striking image. Except maybe the elevated toilet. But do you really think a toilet is enough to earn the praise that this movie gets? The parallel events that happen to the two families are very obviously parallel, you don't even have to watch the movie to see it. The title of the movie - yeah, we get that, who is actually the parasite, very subtle, haha. Ironically, this doesn't get more obvious after watching. The moral? Well, dubious at best. I hope they were not trying to justify the murder by the distaste to the smell of the people on the subway. But in this case, what is this movie about? It's kinda empty, has nothing to say. The actors play fine, nothing above or below average. Then, a few words about humor. This movie is listed as comedy. Yeah, it uses some typical comedic moves, like the impostor family hiding below the table. But none of those are funny. Most of these moments are just cringeworthy. I don't know if the director was going for this emotion, and even if he did it successfully, I'm not appreciating it. As a comedy, this film is far below mediocre. So what's the big deal about Parasite?"
PARASITE,9 March 2020,1/10,Stunned at how anyone would think highly of this film. It should have been a short. Every aspect of the story line was so predictable and poorly executed. Not even a single spin that could have made it interesting. Do not pay to see this movie. Stream for free or just don't even watch it.
PARASITE,2 January 2020,10/10,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews."
PARASITE,23 June 2020,1/10,"Couldn't even finish this. As I watched Parasite (Gisaengchung) amid all of the positive reviews and hype, I genuinely wondered if I was viewing the correct film!A codependent extended family of losers that scam and manipulate and profit by fraudulently insinuating themselves into the lives of a wealthier family. A metaphor maybe, for the seeming acceptance of unethical behavior now inherent in our present world?Would Parasite be considered hilarious if about a codependent extended family of African-American losers scamming and manipulating their way into the lives of another family? Would it be considered Oscar-worthy? Or would it be time to call the police?"
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"A beautiful journey of emotions.
Delivers a strong subject, so interestingly and with a bunch of great actors, incredibly directed by Mr.BongA very important film.
Kangsammidha"
PARASITE,23 December 2020,10/10,"The hype following this film was real and I saw it at the Scotiabank Theatre Toronto in Dec 2019. And I left that theatre stunned and in a trance of bad ass cinema.The peach montage scene alone... I think its somewhere between 5 to 8 minutes and there are 60 shots in that. That alone will make your jaw drop.The detail in this movie is masterful and this does what cinema or what a great movie should do: it should grip you, expand your mind, captivate you, and take you on a hell of a story that involves a fine balance of acting, sound, visuals, and believing in the story. This film did all that and RESPECT!!!!!!"
PARASITE,26 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a masterpiece, worthy of all the praise and awards it has received. The title alone has about 4 different meanings depending on your interpretation of the story. ""So metaphorical"" as a certain character says multiple times. Every single performance is brilliant, from Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and Hye-jin Jang as the Kims to Sun-kyun Lee and Yeo-jeung Jo as the parents of the Parks to everyone in between.In fact, there isn't a single area that the film falters in. Production design, editing, score, cinematography; they are all top class. The script by Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han is superb, covering a spectrum from dark comedy to social commentary. The direction by Bong is absolutely brilliant too.However, my absolute favourite thing about the film is the seamless tonal shifts. The film covers most genres that you could think of; from comedy and drama to thriller and even horror and it does all of this without feeling out of place for a second. Some of the tensest scenes I've seen in a film are contained here and they are utterly brilliant. No matter your interpretation, there's a clear message here, from an examination of money (or lack of) and beyond. The movie is spectacular and will undoubtedly go down as a classic."
PARASITE,28 December 2020,1/10,It's a good one time watch. Don't get the hype around it
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,6/10,"Nothing to see here. No idea how it won the best motion picture.I kept losing focus, it was just not that amazing. I've seen 100s of foreign films, this was far from the best."
PARASITE,21 June 2020,9/10,"Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho has become instantly ingrained into film culture already. It became the first foreign film to win best picture and for good reason. Parasite is one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time. From the jaw dropping suspense, to the social commentary, the one word I have for this movie is meticulous.
The film follows the poor Kim family as they hatch a scheme to infiltrate the very wealthy Park family. The concept is simple enough, but the story both subverts and exceeds your expectations as the plot snowballs out of control.
The movie is a showcase at building suspense. As the movie goes on the tension grows higher and higher until we get the payoff in the climax. The movie's script is just so great! The characters are written profoundly and every scene means something to all the characters, the themes and the story. The cinematography in this is also really great.
Another thing that really stands out is the messaging and how it is conveyed. The audience is treated with the upmost respect from director Bong Joon Ho as he never is heavy handed delivering this social theme. The theme is conveyed is symbolism and metaphors and it works amazingly.
I really loved Parasite and it is probably a close second for my favorite movie of the year after The Irishman. It is definitely somewhere in my top 15 favorite movies of the decade if not too 10. The movie is extremely creative, original, and meticulously created. I'm happy to say that Parasite stands amongst some of the greatest foreign films ever made.
9.5/10"
PARASITE,12 April 2020,5/10,Good for a single watch but doesn't deserve Oscar. Very very ordinary story but nicely executed. Worth watch one time
PARASITE,1 May 2021,9/10,Finally something good not like the usual American bsht. Attention to detail... colours ... senses...
PARASITE,15 February 2020,8/10,"This started off as a comedy but then turns into a borderline horror movie, the ending will definitely stick with you, but expect anything"
PARASITE,10 December 2019,9/10,Congrats To Director To Pick This Story For The Genre ! It Changes My Mind That Cheating Is Not Bad If The Purpose Is Survival ! This Movie Also Shows Slaverysm And Racism In Reality As No People Shows It Directly To Our Face ! Acting Is Excellent ! Cameraman Deserves An Award ! Ending Was The Best ! Plot Twist Also Attratcts The Audience ! This Story Is So Difficult To Be Done In A Fast Screenplay ! But They Convey The Feelings Successfully
PARASITE,5 April 2020,9/10,"Parasite is one of the few movies that live up to the hype around them. Getting all the praise in the world from audiences and critics alike, it's being called the movie of the decade. On top of this, it has won 4 Oscars including Best Picture. But I assume you already knew that, in which case I apologize for wasting your time. But if the hype and those Oscars aren't enough to convince you to watch this then maybe reading on further will.Parasite doesn't stick to a single genre but is a mix of drama, comedy, satire, mystery and suspense. All this fit into a 2 hour movie without causing a hitch in the seamless transitions between those genres. Fueled with incredible performances from each and every cast member, the movie ,despite being a thriller, involves a plot which is so believable, that it's frightening.Wildly unpredictable, the title of the movie will only make sense after the ending and till then, you'll only be left guessing. Not revealing the details, but the movie seems to be going in a certain direction at which point it takes a sharp turn into complete madness. Things pretty much escalate from there, revealing a clearer picture about the intention of the movie.The more praiseworthy thing apart from the flawless camera work and near perfect direction, is the display of the disparity between the rich and poor using symbolism and other It paints a picture about what it's like to be on both sides without the presence of any heroes or villains.I personally think that movies have become such an inherent part of our lives and their global presence has at least touched if not influenced a lot of people. And not using such a powerful, widespread medium to communicate about a social cause ( of which we have plenty) seems like a wasted opportunity. So kudos to director Bong Joon-ho for taking on this issue and yet finding a way to make it entertaining!"
PARASITE,27 June 2019,9/10,"This film was incredibly well shot and thought out! It had basically everything to have in a drama thriller film. Its my first Joon-ho Bong film and my god it was perfect! I love drama, I love thriller and crime. It hit the perfect spot for my liking and the story was perfect and emotional throughout! The awards given to this film were well deserved and after watching the film I can see why. I think I have became a fan of Mr. Bong's films and im off to watch his other hits!"
PARASITE,18 January 2020,8/10,End is dammmm horrible. There is nothing in the film to be afraid of but thinking about what happened in the movie scares you.it is great it may move youu a bit.
PARASITE,6 December 2019,10/10,"Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!"
PARASITE,26 July 2020,9/10,This was an excellent film. It keeps you intrigued throughout with many unusual occurrences and twists. Very clever film
PARASITE,4 December 2019,,"This movie was alright. The acting was good and story was fine, but the pacing and the overall tone of the movie was kinda dull, imo. I wasent that invested in the plot and characters.
There are better movies out there this year, like FordV Ferrari and The lighthouse."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,5/10,"It's completely unclear why you would kill two (even three) characters. By the end of the story, it becomes ""farfetched."""
PARASITE,14 May 2020,6/10,"I only watched this coz of the hype, but it was just an okay movie. I didn't find the story that interesting, especially how they got so greedy. ""Jessica"" quoted some big figures for her pay, I really thought that would have made a difference in their lives, but it seems all the money went to was food, coz thats all that changed in their lives. They started eating at a better place. And it really took a dark turn at the end."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"-Comedy
-Drama
-Thriller
-HorrorParasite is all that! an amazing movie about how you can work all your life and be miserable. Yeah, they are some mistakes, but it's a movie after all, so enjoy it!"
PARASITE,12 December 2019,10/10,"Parasite is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a while, it has a message that you have to look in another perspectives to look in a different ways from the poor families and the rich family, and that doesn't mean they are rich they don't look after for the poor families, but the greediness and the hatred between the two poor families, show us how is the innocent family is.""Spoiler ""
The greedy between two Poor families that caused climax of Antagonism. The poor families because of the greediness and hatred the ""rich family"" and Innocent family has suffered, and caused a death to the rich family."
PARASITE,6 November 2019,5/10,Parasite (2019)OUCH!Pls make this director stop.
PARASITE,10 January 2020,10/10,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,9/10,"I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know.
Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand."
PARASITE,10 June 2020,9/10,Parasite from director Bong Joon-ho is a very deep movie on a lot of different levels. There are many symbols and messages throughout Parasite that are harsh but true. The set design and acting work together to create masterful suspense that had me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I can understand why Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture. Don't let the subtitles discourage you from watching Parasite because you won't want to miss this masterpiece.
PARASITE,15 April 2020,8/10,"Fresh.The ending of the film is unexpected.If I have a chance,I will go to the cinema to see it."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,8/10,"The film depicts two opposite sides of the huge gap between the rich and the poor without any strong conflicts. As representatives of the two classes, there is no direct hatred between the individual and the individual. It can even be said that uncle Kim's family is very grateful to representative park and thinks that Mrs. Park is simple and kind. The rich couple, on the other hand, did not specifically target the other class of people with any deliberately difficult and contemptuous. But there was still bad blood between the two classes, or between the two families."
PARASITE,20 April 2021,1/10,"A great nightlight for your roach castle or cardboard home, will keep intruders away!"
PARASITE,18 August 2020,10/10,"I saw parasite just after it's Oscar sweep. But was still unsure, you see the thing is I was rooting for 1917 to sweep and was wondering what this parasite film actually was. I watched the trailer and didn't quiet get it. But I decided to give it a go anyway. After sitting through its 2h 8m runtime I couldn't disguise my satisfaction. The movie was one of the best I'd seen from recent years. I will say don't let the subtitles put you off experiencing this masterpiece.The twist came completely out of the blue but did not in any way feel cheap or unearned. In fact the felt extremely consistent with the story whilst still changing the plots destinationAs for the oscars do I feel that parasite should have seeped?
No.
Sure I think that best picture, best foreign language film and production design (parasite actually didn't win production design but I think it should have) However I think Sam mendes should have one Director, rian Johnson should have won original screenplay but I'm not so mad anymore.Overall watch parasite and prepare to be amazed"
PARASITE,9 September 2020,10/10,"Parasite has just earned the title of the first foreign film to win best picture and it Very much deserves it, as Parasite is one of the closest things to a flawless masterpiece I've ever seen. From the great cast, the beautiful cinematography, the genius script, every aspect of Parasite is good. This is undoubtably director Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece and some of the best work of any director. It's story will grip you with is realistic characters and masterful twists, and the intelligence with which it highlights issues of today's society will haunt your mind for weeks to come."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,6/10,"Crime doesn't pay. Just ask the sociopathic poor Kim family featured in the dark tale PARASITE, an overrated, B/B- slasher film dressed up as high art: the latest runway walk sporting the Emperor's new clothes.First the perps hoodwink a nice wealthy family, taking out the nice poor chauffeur and loyal kind poor housekeeper along the way, then make life a living hell for a third nice family. Ouch. Don't get in this ruthless mean family's way or you'll be sorry.I am.I liked the movie's opening shot. Painterly. Black writing appears on the right window pane of the Kim family's semi-basement hovel. For a while, everything was going OK. I liked the first act. Then WTF. Talk about bad choices. What an artistic, intellectual, sense-and-sensibility nose dive.Tough to give this harsh and disappointing mean-spirited flick higher than a 7. Because even if I give it a 7 for FORM (nice production values, acting, and visuals, but an achievement of FORM at best only slightly better than the architectural quality of the deluxe modernesque house that PARASITE features as the main stage set of its story), I can't give the movie's STORY more than a 6.Which averages a FORM & STORY score of 6.5.That's about where it left me when I left the theater: pleased on an emotional and artistic level about 6.5, a bad taste in my mouth, feeling played. But at least I know what all the hyperventilating groupthink hype's about.But then the filmmaker didn't give himself the awards. The overblown fanfare isn't his fault. He just wrote, directed, and made the best movie he could.And a 6.5 isn't a bad score or in any way derogatory in my book, especially for a story that feels like a stage play more than a motion picture. For me, any movie that gets a 7 is darn good.So. Enjoy. See PARASITE over and over if it's your cuppa tea and you find the movie relevant to your life, your vision of the world, your artistic aspirations and work. Different strokes for different folks.But here's the thing: Actually, all we know for sure is that PARASITE may not have been--and most likely wasn't--the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' first choice for Best Picture but somehow still managed to eke out a win for that misleading category. PARASITE may have merely been the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' second and third place choice for Best Picture, thanks to the complex ""preferential ballot system"" (Google it), pushing PARASITE over the top to KO works that may have gotten more first place votes.How else can we characterize this non-transparent balloting paradigm, based on non-disclosure of the balloting results, than Fakery Afoot?Or to steal a line from THE GENTLEMEN, ""F*%@ery Afoot.""The Academy won't tell us the truth. How many first place votes did PARASITE get? How many first place votes did the other 8 nominated movies get? Why won't the academy show us the math?We can handle the truth.Instead, the Academy treats us like sheep, preferring to keep us in the dark, misleading us, relying on our gullibility and the necessary illusion (as they see it, in their screwed up marketing way) that PARASITE was the top vote getter for #1 film.Maybe.But unlikely.I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.Truth be told, who knows (other than The Academy's Threshold Guardians) how many other so-called Best Picture award winners since 2009, when the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to as many as 10, won an award not for what we're led to believe, Best Picture, but for a category that would be more accurately named Top Consensus Picture.Or, oxymoronically (and moronically), Top Second and Third Place Picture.Or how about Most Preferred Picture.Academy Awards are a self-promotional corporate crap shoot, fueled by politics, social trends, self-interest, personal biases, PR, hidden agendas, mass mind meld, and money. PARASITE simply reflects the latest Academy enabled intellectually dishonest connection between the secret and screwy preferential balloting system results and the name of the award--the fake connection between what goes on behind the curtain and what goes on in front of the curtain in the merry land of Oz.In other words, to use an analogy: Like our federal elections for President, the Best Picture award doesn't go to the popular vote winner. The award goes to the Electoral College winner. But in our elections for President, though we might not like the set up and feel it's unfair, at least we know how the system works, it's fully disclosed, and the vote tallies do not remain behind closed doors.My hunch?PARASITE, true to the meaning of the word, ironically enough, benefited by deriving nutrients at the expense of other movies.I suspect that PARASITE landed the award for Top Consensus Picture/Most Preferred Picture not by leading in the number of first place votes but by siphoning off lots of second and third and maybe even fourth and fifth place votes, thereby outflanking films of more surpassing quality like LITTLE WOMEN (8.0) and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (8.75).Again, I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.I don't know which force-feeds us a bigger Monster In The House, PARASITE or The Academy of Motion Pictures.At least PARASITE's ugly monster roams the house out in the open.(Aside: For Best International Film, PARASITE oddly beat out the brilliantly written, shot, and acted, truly modern and original, artistically and socially astute no-false-note gritty LES MISERABLES (8.5). I haven't yet seen Almodovar's PAIN AND GLORY, also nominated for Best International Film, but I'm guessing I'll like that more than PARASITE too. And, by the way, how did the Academy manage to overlook the remarkable unnominated edge-of-your-seat film-wonder UNCUT GEMS (8.5)--too cutting edge? Not good enough to make the empty 10 slot? Really? And you got robbed Adam Sandler.)PARASITE not only trots its monster, the downtrodden Kim family, out in the open, painting the family with a thin brush, hiding nothing, and therefore leaving little if anything surprising to foreshadow, reveal, or shock us about their inner life, history, motivations and what makes them tick besides inept pizza box folding, manipulation, high jinks, and greed.PARASITE also does another thing really well, which goes hand-in-glove with the story's two-dimensional nefarious family. PARASITE reminds us that pressure reveals character--and the arc of the parasitic self-serving Kim family's character is simple.None.Nasty family starts out F'd and poor. Nasty family hits the jackpot through fakery and fraud but hits a snag. Nasty family turns violent then becomes poor again and more F'd than before.Unrepentant.Unchanged.And all an empty way for the filmmaker to set us up for some nasty, gratuitous horror and gore.I was almost ready to accept the poor family's mooching off the rich family as an inspired metaphor for capitalism mooching off society, doing whatever it takes, including lie, cheat, steal, smile, swindle, and kill, to parasitically feast off our commonwealth.But then capitalism wouldn't likely end up back in the basement............One final thought. PARASITE tells a story about rich and poor that goes beyond the obvious economic one.The story takes place mostly inside of a house. A house is a metaphor for human character: Character is a house. You have your interior and exterior. I speak as an architect when I say that in terms of the quality of architectural design, the house has a rich, developed interior but a poor, undeveloped exterior. And I speak as a screenwriter when I say it's the opposite for the quality of the character design: PARASITE's characters have a rich, developed exterior but a poor, undeveloped interior. They are little more than paper-thin characterizations.The movie's building architecture and character architecture are reciprocally related, creating a kind of symmetry, conflict, clash but not a pleasing kind--because in Story Architecture, what matters most isn't the quality of the stage set design but the quality of the character design. And that's where PARASITE fails most glaringly as a work of art.The filmmaker created a monster, patching together a subpar exterior building architecture and subpar interior character architecture to create a FORM & STORY 6.5 Frankenstein."
PARASITE,3 April 2021,10/10,"This film was nothing short of amazing. The writing, characterization, cinematography, acting, directing and more were all insane. I thought I wouldn't like this film because it's in Korean and I thought reading subtitles would be a drag but it was the exact opposite. Every moment you are on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next."
PARASITE,13 February 2021,8/10,Ok this cool but i think the end of the chapter 1 move is so boring
PARASITE,7 June 2020,10/10,"Are you a parasite? Who is the parasite?This movie is absurdly great, it gets you by the balls and makes you feel everything they planned you too feel. True poetry does this. It guides you to explain exactly what you need to understand, both logically and sentimentally. This was written by a true artist that not only understands the topic at hand but has a deep knowledge about the medium and visual language.Parasite takes you to another reality, it is raw and yet it hides its rawness through comedy, masticated just enough so you can feel comfortable at first. This is exactly how society is, you are in your home, sitting on a chair or lying in your bed, reading this comment on your thousand dollar computer of phone, full belly, warm, relaxed. The comedy gets you instantly. Light, easy to grasp, easy to follow along. And then, when it hits you, it hits hard, it hits where it matters. The movie prepares you, hints you where it is going to hit, but you are NOT READY. You receive these hints every day, every time. You walk on the streets, you see it, you ignore it. You ignore people, you ignore hunger, poverty, death. Yet, it is all there. Suffering never stops. Never. And yet, you try to be comfortable, you struggle to find behaviors in you that can clear your ego. You protect yourself and hide yourself from reality, consume large amounts of soft sweet warm media, consult with top-notch psychologists, have pets, great food, great internet, great movies, great distractions. This movie is about this, you, us, our distractions. It is a conversation that needs to happen and for this reason I recommend you stop everything now and watch this movie. Thanks."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,4/10,"Cultural story line was interesting, funny. bizarre. Not sure how to say much that has not already been said.I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not wasted over 2 hours that would have been better spent digging for worms to fish with or eating a bowl of frosted flakes with bananas and strawberries (which would have been more appetizing).90 minutes would have done it for me....make that 45 minutes. Way too much hype for a theatrical mess. Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year, ha.Just goes to show the Academy is screwed up. This film does not stand in the same arena with movies like 1917 or Harriet."
PARASITE,4 January 2020,1/10,"Ridiculous, implausible plot; heavy handed allegory at best. Overdrawn caricatures of rich and poor. I guess some viewers found this funny, but nobody laughed in the theater. The worst was the gratuitous violence near the end, shown with graphic detail."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,8/10,"What I love about this movie... it's a blast to watch, very original, and the directing is some of the best. The originality is a huge plus to me, because it feels like there's not much of it to go around right now.But as far as the negative (I'll spend a little longer on this because theirs so much praise already).. I feel like all the best drama in the movie feels manufactured. I felt like the director had the poor father stab the rich one for a dramatic conclusion, whether it was justified or not, a mechanism to show the movie had some dramatic point. Almost hamfisted in, but never organically produced.The rich family behaved like bosses in a typical work environment. Seemed dismissive at times, even gullible, but in many ways, incredibly generous and trusting, if not creating opportunity and doing more good than required. The director may say, there's no good guys and bad guys, but, shouldn't we at least feel like theirs a motive behind the final killing? I should have been thinking, I hope he doesn't kill him, I hope he doesn't kill him.. but instead I was just thinking, why is this disgruntled cab driver grabbing a knife to kill the rich father of all people? There's a murderer who just killed his son, who is being carried through the courtyard by the rich daughter of all people, trying to get him some help. The rich father commented that he liked the cheap panties, but that didn't relate to the message at all, he didn't even know they were the driver's daughter's. Seemed like a cheap inclusion to build motive for the dramatic killing. Did he look down on the family? Not really, he was a boss and was even caring, and didn't even know they were a family. The poor father stabbing him in front of everyone put his own family at risk and hurt their ability to function even further, and although you knew he was upset, it didn't feel like that level of aggression worked with his character at this point in the film.Overall, the message didn't come across succinctly. I think the director would probably say, the rich should be more aware of the pains in the community. So no-one can ever have something nice, ever again, until everyone is rich. The only way this rich family could have over come their flaws, is if they had ensured that everyone in the world had a good day the day before.If I want to get really critical, I would say that the director wanted to make a funny, political, and scary movie, and therefore threw in random scenes to sensationalize his script. Like when the old maid comes to the door... of course they wouldn't let her in if the movie was being honest. And that's what enabled all the incredible drama, was this poor decision made with unclear motivation. They're all hanging out inside, eating food, broken bottles on the floor, openly making a mess of the the house for the first time, this could blow their whole operation they meticulous planned, and were cunning and quick on their feet in every other scene, but they decide to let her inside always, oh well. Could have just told her to come back? So, then they find a poor family living downstairs, which is random and sort of unrelated to the story and the point of it... but they find a poor guy there and so the protagonist mother decides to turn them in. What needs to happen to create the next sensational moment? Well, if the family living downstairs were to just happen to discover the entire secret of the poor family before the mother calls the cops in 5 seconds, then we could have a fight to the death. What happens next? Well, the entire family comes tumbling down the stairs and the downstairs family gets video proof of them referring to each other by their family names, etc. If any of those random, highly unlikely, and unrelated elements don't happen in this short sequence, the entire movie ends with the family making a little money as an uber driver, a maid, and 2 tutors. But, the movie needed to go bigger. So, we have these unintuitive moments driven by unclear motives tacked on to ensure we get the killing and dark moments and dramatic political messages that can only be found in the second half. Now we've got the pieces, at the expense of depth. Almost seems like a fun, silly movie with random political narratives to increase the clout. Like it's a movie that's supposed to make you feel good, because you just got to watch a comedy, a thriller, and then became a better person because of the mechanically meaningful scenes. I mean, if this is how you make a great movie, you could literally use this as a template, because again, it could be a manufacturing process. But since the feeling of moral fulfillment comes by way of cheap design, and gives a bit of hollowness to the final experience.So, I rate this 8! 8 because of the direction and originality. 2 stars gone because of the artificial nature of the climax. I don't like crapping on a movie this good, but it's off my chest now and there's plenty of positive reviews, so I'll leave some of that to them. :)"
PARASITE,20 February 2020,5/10,"However, not in this case.
the cinematography is great and the actors are good. but what is so ""masterpiecey"" here?
nothing. its a ""nice"" movie, that's it.
is it possible that Hollywood is so obsessed with diversity that content is no longer an issue?"
PARASITE,24 December 2019,10/10,"A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,7/10,"This is a nice movie to watch.. All the twists and turns makes the movie really interesting. Actors were all very good.
It's just I felt the movie list it's pace now and then. It gets boring in the middle.
But then what an ending."
PARASITE,15 November 2019,8/10,"... what should I say about Parasite? This film is a real gem.The directing is just great, coupled with by an impeccable cinematography.
The writing is entertaining and give the characters personality and layer, as well as the story. The themes are justified: the difference between well rich and poor family is one of them. The characters personality are reinforced by the great acting performances of the ensemble cast.Everything in this movie is a gem. Evrything.Bong Joon-ho, you are maybe one of my best filmmaker.Parasite rating: 85/100"
PARASITE,18 May 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho has made incredible movies in his movie career, but this is without a doubt his best, as well as the best movie released in 2019, and also one of the best movies of the decade. Playing masterfully between different genres, Parasite is surprisingly one of the most universal movie of the century. I know that subtitles can be new to some, but the worth of this movie can´t be tamed by subtitles."
PARASITE,16 July 2020,10/10,One of the greatest screenplays I have ever seen wow just wow.
PARASITE,17 November 2019,10/10,"Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,4/10,"I'm unsure as to why the film has been overrated. The main theme of the film is status, class and betrayal. However, I think the film fails to make these themes compelling and thought-provoking enough to motivate the audience to care about the characters. The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family, despite their poor economic background.There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film's plot to be too chaotic and convoluted. compelling enough. As a result, there is something missing from the film. The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey. Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic, unrealistic way. This affects the believability in what you're seeing, thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters.Forgettable."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,3/10,"I'll keep this short and sweet. What an overhyped pile of garbage. It had its moments, but after it was all said and done it was just a long Three's Company episode with a twist ending that was uninspired."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,5/10,"Once again, I find myself questioning 3 things 1) the entertainment industry's media machine which seems to be growing further and further away from 'the people' 2) the willingness of an army of sheep to fall into line and 3) the veracity of many online reviews.The caustic social commentary is irksome and tired, i.e., hardscrabble, noble poor struggle to survive while self-indulgent rich people tread on them. This has been covered in literature and film countless times and often better than this. In this case the poor family are (with the exception of the daughter) listless and dim, not at all sympathetic. The fact they ruin the lives of two people who actually do their jobs is forgivable apparently. In contrast the unlikable rich are in fact a clever entrepreneur and his wife who, though not smart, dotes on her children and wants nothing but the best for them. Not sure why the somehow deserve to be exploited by a family of indolent grifters. And apparently the father's distaste for poor grooming is deserving of homicide. Great.In any case the movie is predictable except where it introduces 'deus ex machina' plot contrivances.The finale is idiotic. The father is desperate to drive his kid to hospital. The car keys are under a dead man's body. While attempting to move the body he notices that the man has body odor and pauses to, in a particularly demonstrative fashion, hold his nose and roll his eyes. Riiiight.Throw in a little bit of tastelessness (really, if you find a pair of panties do you immediately sniff them?) and you've got the makings of a rather tedious and somewhat offensive 2 hours of mediocre movie making."
PARASITE,17 May 2020,8/10,"My Lorsh i have been chewing on this film and the directions it could have taken and how different it would have been in American hands--a weak point was when they we're all caught in the house it would have made more sense for them to flee to the basement tunnels but in panic best decisions don't always prevail; moreover, an american writer would have gone all comedy with a happy ending and for me to sit through subtitles i think this film captured me in it's extreme uniqueness and sudden dark turn so after swallowing i think I'll settle on an 8"
PARASITE,7 January 2020,9/10,They way the story runs it catches your attention more and more.
PARASITE,30 August 2019,8/10,A great plot! Fascinating. Should've cut more unnecessary scenes though to get to the pace. I have to skip some prolonged story lines that doesn't add value to the story and characters.I love each character arc. I love the story. It was awesome.
PARASITE,22 May 2020,8/10,"The story is about a poor Korean Family, and it's 4 members,who live in an underground floor basement, which gets flooded with the slightest of showers. They do different sorts of part time jobs,for a living. Their fortune changes, when one of the friend's of a family member offers him to teach English to a rich house's girl, in his absence. Fortune of the poor family soon changes (and later they knew it changed for ever) , as they become fully dependant upon the rich family, for their living (just like a parasite and a host).
The real thrill starts, after they poor family discover a hidden truth about the rich house."
PARASITE,20 December 2019,10/10,That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.
PARASITE,14 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is fantastic!The name of the film pertains to our ""main characters"" in the film as well as two others we meet later on.There's a lot going on for this film in terms of the political and societal commentary it utilizes. We see with the opening the setup of this, as the main family is impoverished and is literally living at the lowest level without being underground. They struggle to retain what most would consider basic necessity nowadays like wifi, and do odd jobs to regain that and have a simple meal.Fortune strikes though as their son gets an in with a rich family to tutor their young daughter, eventually working their way deeper inside until all four are working different jobs for this family.All this is achieved because the mother is easily manipulated and prefers recommendations when bringing workers into their home, rather than documentation. This ties into the difference between classes.However, our main families newfound means of financial potential is put in jeopardy one night when the former house cleaner returns. She rings incessantly, needing to retrieve something in the basement. Which we find out is her husband, revealing the main family is not the first to get an in with the rich family. Her husband had actually been living there for years to escape loan sharks, and was receiving food and residency unbeknownst to the family above.The raised issue of these two different families leeching from the wealthier comes to a head when the rise is discovered by the former housekeeper. She and her husband are subdued and shortly after our family, save for the mother, is able to sneakily escape.This leads to a brilliant scene of our family descending back into poverty. Going lower, and lower, showing just how different these two worlds are. I loved this scene. It was so clearly thought out, and it brilliantly enacted.There's so much to love about this film and it deserves so much of the praise it's been getting. It's clear that Bong Joon-Ho is passionate about the work he does. Definitely give this a watch, its worth your time and money."
PARASITE,27 December 2020,10/10,I've never seen such a different movie in the genre before. I don't know what to feel. It was just so good. It was really good.
PARASITE,20 April 2020,7/10,"Being the first ever foreign film to win the best picture @ the Oscars, I had to give this a watch. Also this is a good choice for a lockdown time film, as nearly everything happens indoors!Was it oscar worthy? Well its shot beautifully, just like the director's earlier film - memories of murder. But coming to the movie, although its a fresh storyline about a wealthy family being conned by a poor family; I couldn't totally connect with the film. As I felt some portions were unrealistic or nonsensical I. E the parks never realised there was a guy living underground for years! or Kims hiding under the table for hours without getting caught or reason to kill Park in the end?!..But overall it is entertaining, dramatic & worth a one time watch, even just for a comic relief and good visuals to add."
PARASITE,10 March 2020,9/10,"In this dark comedy thriller, the Kims, a resourceful lower-class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family. Rich with style and social commentary 'Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft.The cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth.The production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity.But the movie is more complex than 'poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate. The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other, what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class.In 'Parasite' Bong Joon-ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society. The film Resonated with audiences all while being insanely entertaining leading to a much-deserved Best Picture win."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"I have never watched a Korean movie before, I really liked the movie and I recommend people to watch it. Great actors, great story & a masterpiece that you have to watch.
The end of the movie is ok for me but I could be better"
PARASITE,12 May 2020,4/10,"If you like to watch movies for escapism and finding entertainment and optimism then don't watch this. I can't say it's poorly made, acted, or written, but I couldn't relate or care about anyone in the movie or anything that was going on."
PARASITE,28 April 2020,10/10,"Execution ✅
Made me satisfied✅
Acting ✅
Should've been nominated for Cinematography✅(Altough the nominees were great)
Screenplay✅
Directing✅
To win best picture (f*$@ yes )✅"
PARASITE,26 July 2020,8/10,"This film finally has an action that has never existed before. And that's exactly the best thing about the film. A thriller story between rich and poor that is pretty well written.As such, I personally found the staging to be rather standard. But the end is worth it in my opinion. The film is rather calm, but the end is all the more shocking and blatant. The acting is solid. The poor family is easy to find, even though it embodies evil. The development of family behavior is scary.If you know the core of the story at the end, the film title makes a very good sense.
In my opinion, Parasite wasn't the best film of the year. But worth seeing. Mostly because of the story."
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is so great . In my opinion , parasite is one of top 10 movies of the last decade ."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,5/10,"Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics.Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact.The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible.He will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons.Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre.Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree. That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining.Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,9/10,"4d ago
Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating 9/10"
PARASITE,31 March 2020,9/10,The best movie i've watched recently. Congratulations
PARASITE,27 April 2020,9/10,"Movie is not what it seems, and it definitely takes you for a ride. At moments it's fun but then it becomes suspenseful and thrilling. Story by itself is really interesting and amazingly written. Director did a great job too. I loved the characters and how different from each other they are."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,8/10,"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed. It's a really clever, really good story, with all the twists and turns, and the actors are really good. But in the end, it fell into the usual pattern of Korean films. Now you can understand why the director said you couldn't tell the story, because if you did, it would be a lot less entertaining. Satire, dry humor, reflection on social problems, all of these are felt."
PARASITE,4 June 2020,9/10,"In the scene of heavy rain, the director used the method of comparing montage to express the group pictures of the rich and poor families in the heavy rain. Lay the groundwork for the outbreak of contradictions at the end of the following. Isn't it ironic that Mrs. Park stresses that imported toy tents for her son in the United States are more reliable and sturdy than Kim Kezer's home in the heavy rain?
Ji Yu family rushed home, found that all of them have been flooded, people in this time of crisis, rescue must be their most cherished things. Father saved his wife's medal in a hurry , and he knew that the honor was important to his wife.
Son Ji Yu hugs the stone that can be transferred by his friend, he hopes to be able to transfer; and what is Ji Ting doing? She was holding down the splash on the toilet seat, and she wanted the last little decency in the house"
PARASITE,22 March 2021,10/10,"Everything about this film has pretty much already been said. However since I've seen it, I've never been able enjoy sitting in my warm house during a rain storm since. And that's an example of how powerful cinema can show you something so blaringly obvious and change you. I also have a recurring nightmare about a man on the stairs but that's a different way this film affected me! Yikes!"
PARASITE,10 November 2019,2/10,"The plot is very good, with loads of twists and turns. However, I did not like this movie. It was an entirely unpleasant experience."
PARASITE,22 February 2021,5/10,"The hype is simply because it's foreign and people, as usual, are jumping on the bandwagon. There's nothing great about this film. Don't say I didn't warn you."
PARASITE,31 January 2021,10/10,Amazing. Though it's not a film you feel the need to see again as you probably would for other tens.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"In this movie Bong Joon-ho directs like Billy Wilder plus Alfred Hitchcock... the result is just unique. The plot is not only original but contemporary, funny, scary and poetic at the same time.
Remarkable."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,7/10,"Literally.First, I always give pause for Cannes films since it's generally over pretentious ""film-viewers"" who think way too deep. It's a freakin' movie.As a US viewer, the cultural differences, not the class differences, is what got lost in this movie. Some of the social aspect which seemed such taboo are just ""meh"" in the US.I think if there was an ""Americanized"" version of this, it might ring more true, but I have 0 faith in Hollywood ever making anything good again."
PARASITE,3 March 2021,5/10,"Inventive story, fair enough, great metaphors, obviously, but unfortunately, terrible acting. ""Mrs Park"" perhaps an exception, to the all round, wooden dourness of the performances. Was looking forward to seeing this, especially as it had been likened to ""Society"" the veritable 80's cult classic masterpiece, but I was left feeling well, pretty underwhelmed really, but hey, ho you can't have everything. However, maybe it'll grow on me over time!"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"Don't get me wrong. Parasite is a great movie. This being said, I believe that Hollywood is saying we'd rather vote for a subtitled foreign film than recognize Netflix as a major player.
The Irishman, The Two Popes and Marriage Story are also great films and deserves more recognition."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,7/10,The movie is not what I expected. And not as brilliant as it was being told. I chhod have easily skipped this without regret.
PARASITE,24 February 2020,6/10,"Pretty good film but not even close to living up to the hype of the praise it gets. My guess is that the Hollywood Elite have embraced this movie as a way to virtue signal that they get the suffering and unfairness of it all!Acting is good, movie is too long for sure, all unlikeable characters mostly"
PARASITE,13 August 2019,9/10,"Korean films are doing really well on International platform in this century, we saw how good films like BURNING and OLDBOY was and now it's PARASITE which has surpassed all of them in achieving the degree of how to grab the audience from the real world and put them in the virtual world which they ignore around them.
Parasite is a story of below average income Korean family who really love eachother which is a characteristic feature of poor families. The love to exploit freebies whenever they can...they always use others' WiFi.
The story takes a turn when one of their friends' visits their home and give them a kind of meteroid out of his grandfather's collection and tells that there is a need of english tuitor in a wealthy household. The family agrees to the contract even if they have make fake college degrees. The story will really make you engage once you will sit to watch this movie. There is no way you will be dissapointed by the story telling and characters.
No wonder this movie won Palme d'or since it has stood the test of every variables which are involved in a perfect thriller.
If you are movie fan...especially a foreign film lover then this movie is made for you...a must watch. Thanks."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,8/10,"Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!"
PARASITE,1 March 2020,6/10,"Well executed on many levels. But when a non english speaking film wins an Oscar for best picture, needles to say the expectations are really high, and for my money they did not reach all the way. Half way thru I felt it was promising, but the last half hour lowered the rating for me. Over all a good movie but no way nere fantastic."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,10/10,"This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,9/10,"For most of us this one is first ever experience of South Korean movie
And it is amazing experienceMovie introduces us to the culture of
S Korea. Which is similar to. many Asian countries and something are new to usAs the movie name is Parasite.
Movie depicts rawness. That every human being contains parasite deep downMovie is brilliant in every aspects.
Parasite has. Comedy ; fun ; sadness ; brutality ; depressing ; family bonding ; intimacy ; strictness ; thrilling ; darkness etc...Movie is good. You never loose the grip from the screen and story."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,"I haven't watched many international films, mostly because I haven't been met with the opportunity of the will to actually go through with the commitment with finding the perfect film and taking my time to sustain it enough. But after hearing all the great reception of this movie I couldn't help but be intrigued enough to search for this movie. I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it.
This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW""
I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work.
If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,5/10,"The storyline here is original and interesting but unfortunately as the movie develops, it gets a bit silly. I'm not sure what the underlying message is, if any. Just a light comedy really I suppose. I certainly can't understand why it would have won the best picture Oscar in 2020."
PARASITE,4 September 2019,9/10,"Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of this year. It's very well directed with a engaging background score, captivating screenplay and stunning cinematography.The film flows through multiple genres from comedy and drama in first half to horror and thriller in second.Story revolves around a impoverished household trying to procure jobs in a wealthy family using unscrupulous methods. Bong-joon-ho deals with more than one philosophical arguments throughout the movie but never loses his focus of the central plot.With masterful direction of Bong-joon-ho, film was able to smoothly transition from a tone of comedy to tragedy effortlessly. Parasite might be his best work to date."
PARASITE,28 January 2020,6/10,"I appreciate the effort of the Parasite team, the director Joon-Ho Bong in particular. He tried hard to get recognized from the international audience by creating a non-typical Korea film. Unfortunately, this is overdoing. The movie is too long and quite boring. Many scenes are unnecessary. Yes, there are times that the movie are fun and entertaining, but to say it is the best film of the year, I don't think it is the case at all. I will be shocked if this movie wins any Oscar award."
PARASITE,8 July 2020,1/10,"As someone who lived in Asia all their life, and ve seen lots and lots of asian cinematography, and korean as well, this right here is just plain and simple trash. My husband who is asian as well thinks that as well, a complete waste of time. It could only recieve such a high praise in the west. Overrated, pretensious, and ridicilous. How do you describe people's action with logic? You dont, cause there is none. If you think there is, think again. You must be thinking in steryotypes if you believe any people in asia would act anything like in the movie."
PARASITE,12 March 2020,10/10,It is so much better to dive into this knowing nothing. I only watched the trailer prior to the movie and it shocked me after. Everything is stitched to perfection. Great commentary on society.
PARASITE,5 November 2019,9/10,"This is one of those films that will throw you off if you watch the trailer, but that is a good thing. It keeps your attention from the first to the last shot. Very dark comedy extremely well executed."
PARASITE,27 January 2021,7/10,"Because they are totally a very deceptive and cunning persons.It's a very good movie, but too bad.... for me it seems the movie is telling that one can be as worst as possible yet still can escape from justice if he/she is clever enough.And on the other side, at the same time this movie is also telling to the rich people not to be so naive and kind to their staffs. Just be careful and don't put 100% trust to their staffs.I don't understand as some said that they are not villains because they are poor?Anyway, again... This movie is sooo good, worth to watch. Scene by scene are all interesting except the ending."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,10/10,The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.
PARASITE,8 May 2020,5/10,I don't understand how this movie won the academy award for best picture? Its okay at best..the whole we're trying to make a statement about the rich and poor needing each other to survive is nonsense..these were bad people it had nothing to do with them being poor. If this had been an English speaking film it barely would've gotten a second look...
PARASITE,13 April 2020,2/10,"I gave this film two stars because although the story is garbage, it's beautifully filmed and the set design is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to the cinematographer and the set design people. That being said, I found the story to be trite, boring, predicable and disappointing. Caution, spoilers follow.The plot is nonsensical, the characters are clichés, and I'm not sure I understand the message the filmmakers are trying to convey. Is the film trying to illustrate the shallow banality and institutionalized cruelty of the wealthy class and the devastating plight of the word's poorest folks? Those points are well-illustrated by the flood, the rich husband's treatment of his employees, etc... but beyond that, the plot settles into your standard, formulaic series of predictable events, portraying the poor family as stupid, rage-filled, murderous, half-wit psychopaths. Are the filmmakers trying to say that their murderous rage is justified or that poor people are just too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions? The poor family in the story are criminals, but they go about their criminal activity with all the calculation of an 8 year old. They are buffoons whose undoing follows a series of bad decisions, cons and assaults that are carried out with no forethought whatsoever.This idea, so popular among the entertainment elites, that the rich are horrible people (excluding themselves of course) and that the poor are noble savages, seems to inform an awful lot of character motivation and plot development. It's a common trope here in Hollywood and I guess their overseas counterparts have learned from the best. If Hollywood has taught us anything it's that stereotypes and recycled stories are what the public wants. After all, filmmakers usually don't portray life as it really is, rather, they portray life as imagined by a privileged elite who write and produce this nonsense. From their perspective inside the bubble, Hollywood has spent billions of dollars over the years to bring us clichéd tropes such as:
""The hooker with a heart of gold who, by the story's end will be rescued by a rich, handsome millionaire,"" and,""The wise, world-weary black sidekick, who guides the white protagonist and serves as his conscience, but who sadly must die near the end of the film,"" and,""The white-savior schoolteacher who is determined to 'make a difference' and ultimately is able to 'reach her students' through a combination of white-lady-tough-love, mime work, hip hop and interpretive dance, transforming a ragtag bunch of inner-city HOC (Hoodlums of Color) into Rhodes scholars.Maybe filmmakers outside the US have learned from the pros, and maybe they got it right, judging from the number of folks who rated this film highly and the fact that it won the Best Picture award.On some level, I find this film offensive and am disappointed that so many have jumped on the bandwagon and rated it highly. Having personally known many wealthy people and many poor people, I cannot reach the filmmaker's conclusion that the rich are cruel and indifferent and the poor are stupid and violent. I've also, unfortunately, personally known several murderers. They were cold, unfeeling sociopaths and when you looked into their eyes you saw an abyss. Nobody home. But they were not motivated by righteous outrage at an unjust system. None of them were poor. They weren't rich either. From a socioeconomic perspective, all the murderers I've known were people who had decent jobs, plenty to eat, new clothes, cell phones, access to credit, all of them were white, and people they murdered were from socioeconomic backgrounds almost exactly like their own. I watched this film to see if it lived up to its hype. Sadly, it turned out to be just one more piece of garbage, no better than most of the junk made in Hollywood. What a waste of time."
PARASITE,12 March 2020,6/10,"It's won best picture for 2020 along with other awards so seeing all the hype I am really looking forward to seeing this masterpiece.... WOW, was I disappointed. Yes, it's a good film, funny, silly, good acting (not all) etc but ""Best film "" er no ... there are loads of good films equally as good as this but not worthy of the awards it's been given. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but films like 1917 are head and shoulders above this in every way. I know you can't compare the two films in their content but to get best film in my opinion is to tick all the boxes in all categories above the rest, yes??? well Parasite just doesn't do it."
PARASITE,25 January 2020,7/10,"The aptly named Parasite is a movie with a message, one that permeates through every frame and colors the interactions between characters. The class struggle between the upper and lower echelons of society (in this case the rich and their servants), is a common concept in most Asian societies and placing this dilemma at the heart of the plot is, in my opinion, its undoing. Although the idea itself is worth exploring through a work of art, it lacks the striking, bizarre and mystifying elements that make other thriller flicks appealing.Perhaps my misgivings about the movie are mainly a consequence of my expectation that the plot would contain some major twist and supply a mind-blowing climax in the tradition of the classic thriller. Although the tale does end on a violent note, it is far from being unpredictable and even a fairly attentive viewer could foresee a similar denouement halfway through the film.More of a satirical drama than a wild ride, Parasite moves at a rather sedate pace, and the clever con tricks that prompt a chuckle in the first act turn predictable and even lose credibility, with most supporting details seeming artificial and contrived.The characters, though well portrayed by a talented cast, suffer the ubiquitous flaw of being agonizingly one dimensional, merely tools in the hands of the director, designed specifically to bring about certain sequences of events. Barring a single incident in the climax of the film, the characters seem to lack a will of their own, the overarching concept of class inequality embodied so perfectly in each person that they appear more like an ensemble of caricatures.Yet praise should be doled out where it is due, and no element of the film deserves more praise than its cinematography. Despite the shortcomings of the plot, the wonderfully filmed scenes make up for them to a certain extent, the symbolic staircases, architectural secrets (wink wink) , floods and lavish garden parties yielding a veritable visual extravaganza. The score ebbs and flows beautifully with the pace of the film and complements each scene powerfully.In summary, despite deserving some credit as a timely black satire, if a good old crime thriller is what you're looking for, Parasite is certainly not up your alley."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,1/10,"This movie starts out well, with a rather humorous idea for the storyline, a family of grfiters insinuates themselves into a well today household by lying and deception. Then the movie influence perhaps by Quentin Tarantino films, disintegrates into a grisly ending of murder at a child's birthday party. Some are trying to exalt, including the Academy of Arts, into something symbolic and important. Frankly, it comes across to me as sadistic violence as a form of enjoyment. Sorry I went. Maybe they should call it 'the Academy of Deviants' because they seem to like those kinds of films best!"
PARASITE,30 January 2021,3/10,"Overrated, don't see what people are seeing in this movie to rate it with a 10"
PARASITE,29 February 2020,9/10,Everything was going great until the ending came. Why did he kill his boss? And also the basement guy?! Well that was unexpected. Why was no one stopping him and why did he bring the rock to the guy? The ending could've gotten much better.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is phenomenal, it's epic, exciting, funny, has the awesome ultra-violent in the third act of the movie, it's so unique and powerful that it's so cool! This movie is just a masterpiece, and however hates it is just weird, because it's perfect in any way you look at!"
PARASITE,7 December 2019,9/10,"Funny, Sad, Dark comedy, Drama, Shocking twist, but definitely, masterpiece. I like that none of them is represented as the pure evil or the pure humanity, It's just about the levels that the society created. The smell of the poor family is the same (because of the house, as the girl said, because of the level they live in) and also the rich family. The end was so iconic.
Best actor was Kang-ho Song (the father of the poor family) he gave us A-Class acting. And also the others were so good but that man was something else.
The director and the writer Bong Joon Ho made history. They say films are the history of our age and that man created such a great history here.
On a mid day cinema with five other people in it, it was a great day when booked that ticket."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making."
PARASITE,2 March 2020,5/10,"One Sunday night I eagerly watched the oscars, hoping my favorite movie of the year once upon a time... in hollywood would win several awards. While it won a few I was shocked to see parasite win so many. A few weeks later I decided to rent the movie and watch. And after 2 hours I can say that I don't think it's all that great. Let's start with the positives. I enjoyed the comedy. There were several bits that had me laughing. They were probably not in the same spots others would usually laugh but nevertheless I thought the movie was decently funny. I thought the acting was pretty good too. Both sides of the family pulled off a pretty believable take on the rich and the poor. But that's all I can really say I liked about the movie. About halfway into the movie I turned to the person I was watching it with and told them that ""This movie must get pretty great within the next 45 minutes amiright"" I had heard so much about the many twists and turns of the movie and I can say that they're really wasn't ever a big twist for me. I mean there was one. That one lead to the entire 3rd act of the movie so I can't really say it was all too surprising. As a person who has loved
Movies since I was a mere lad I can say this wasn't anything too groundbreaking, and can definitely say if it was made the same exact way expect by an American, the movie would be perceived as sucky and unoriginal. I really tried to enjoy this movie but I just couldn't. Maybe someday I'll revisit it and see something in it."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,1/10,Maybe not so good as Human Centipede 1 and especialy Human Centipede 2 but on par masterpiece. Kudos to north korea.
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"When i went to see this film, i was expecting to see if all the reviews saying it being the year's best film were true. Well, i didn't hate this movie, but there was just something about it i didn't like. I don't know what it was, really. The plot was really interesting and well written, the characters were were good, but it was just something about the second act that threw me away. I'm pretty sure everyone else will love it, but i just think it's a bit overrated."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,8/10,"A well deserved best picture. A really unique storyline that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. I am not sure I've ever seen a movie that I'd classify as a comediac-horror-thriller but in a way Parasite was.I loved the setting, love how it was shot and the dialogue was incredibleThe only reason I'm not ranking this higher is because I didn't like the dad killing the boss. I don't think the storyline ever built that up properly and it bothers me."
PARASITE,7 July 2020,8/10,"It's a very well-made movie. The third act is tumultuous, trying to mimic a sort of Taratino-esque atmosphere that works partly. I really don't see how this movie won the Oscar when Jordan Peele's ""Us"", a movie with VERY similar themes, but much more well put together, wasn't even nominated. The ""message"" of the film is rather evil and misinterpretable; we're talking about a country that only has the money to make this sort of cinema because economic liberalism built it from the disgrace it was in the past century. The poor family's father's reaction to his boss disliking his smell, in the privacy of his home, is ridiculous."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,9/10,"With a great mundial attention, Parasite surprise evertyone win 4 orcars against favorites movies like 1917 (Sam Mendes) and The Irishman (Martin Scorcese), and all of this is not for nothing: Parasite is a refletion about politics scenario about misery, social inequality and other social problems that aren't be seen, mainly in a country like South Korea that is always showed like a technology and science power without any social problem (that is deny in Bong Joon-ho film).
Like as all movie that talk about humanities contrast and inequality, Parasite is a relation between Kim family and Park family: the fisrt lives in a house basement and the second family lives in a beautiful and big mansion in a elite neighbourhood. In addition focus in scenes that show the both ambients, the movie has another way to show the inequality between Kim and Park: Kim and Park are two of three of most popular and communs surnamens is South Korea, however, Kim is most commun (21% of koreans) than Park (9%).
The contrast in the reality not only in South Korea, but alround the world, is not realized by Kim family when they are work in many funtions in Park mansion, as like they are part of the Park family. The lack of class awareness in a group that feel privileged by an elite that always oppressed is showed when Choong-sook say ""she isn't poor"" to Moon-gwang, the last Park housekepper, when she founds Moon-gwang's husband in basement.
There'is a discussion about is the ""parasite"" in movie is about Kim family, that lives in Park home illegaly, or about Park family, that explore the work of Kim with the inequality. Actuallity, the parasite is about the actions of the both family and, in same time, is the envy, the greed and the preconception that kill Kim- jeong and Nathan Park. Therefore, Parasite has a many interpretations about an only mensage
All of the adventure vivenced by Kim started with a rock brought by Min, Ki-woo's friend, that is an amulet very commun in asian countries that bring lucky to families. This object is very important to undestand the movie because many events in movies is about it and it construct slowly the social context of movie: The first event is a Choong-sook commentary when Min brings the amulet, when she say: ""It would be better if is was food"", showing that the basic necessites is most importante than religion. The second event is when Ki-woo go down the basement to give the amulet to Moon-gwang and Geun-sae like a gift, but the man almost kill the boy blow to the head, and the third, and the last, event about this amulet is when the rock is returned to river, like Kim family is returned to misery after the happening in Dae-song party. In any moment in the movie, the amulet is showed like a religious object that can save somebody of poorness and misery, but is showed only like a material object, the same manner that capitalism sees the world and the same manner that inequality and poorness is in the world, a fisical and real problem. As Kim-Ki-taek said: ""That's the reason that people can't be have a plan. Without plan, nothing can't be wrong""."
PARASITE,9 March 2020,1/10,The ending was ridiculous as it was created for children below 5
PARASITE,18 March 2020,7/10,"It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film, but the palm did find it unworthy. I don't deny it at all, but I do n' t think it's necessary to retell it. I think there are great shortcomings in three aspects :1, the development of the plot is not logical. 2. expression means symbolic meaning is too straightforward, low-level. 3. theme is not deep.First look at the first, generally speaking a story is very strong film for the development of the plot in line with the basic logic is a minimum requirement. Of course, I fully agree that there is a de facto logical sacrifice required for thematic expression and dramatic effects. But the parasite's sacrifice did not achieve the same thematic expression, which is not ok. For example, the placement of four family members into wealthy families, which accounts for almost one-third of the films, was dramatic and smooth. When the first day of the male master's visit when suddenly the spirit of his sister when suddenly put forward, I feel wonderful, feel very clever, because after all received a salary more than the previous tutor, it is normal to double this salary. But then it was arranged a little bit, and it was so smooth. Second, if the smooth entry into the mansion is needed for the development of the plot, then these people can also be qualified for the mansion job seems even more fake. The rich's nannies and drivers are n' t so good, especially nannies, who have been working with former builders for years to get used to the job. And the whole conversation and manner, the slum environment living in the old couple can not be unmasked. Of course, the director did not fail to take this into account, adding Song Kanghao at home rehearsals and the male owner complained about Song Kanghao on the edge of the play. But it is still not enough, and the overall logical rationality is very fragile. Third, the night of the camping scene, drink all know four people in the living room drink wine and even broke over the wine cup can taste it, the hostess did not even notice, even on the sofa hit a shot, all over the glass residue was only a sweep of Kim Kiting a simple treatment, also unaware, this is basically intolerable illogical. There are a lot of such examples, I admit that some are necessary, but in the overall advance, the director did too much to advance. In particular, the final garden battle, frankly speaking, is it necessary, this ending does not feel a little abrupt, this is the director stall spread out there is no way to solve the outcome of the conflict created by the climax of the solution ah. And the end of the garden battle is the same, leaving the people in need, one to stay in the basement to write, the other to receive letters outside. And Song Kanghao also did not know when his son can come to see, so every day to knock on the Morse code, that lights flash all night our German residents do not find someone to repair. Forget it, you can't stop"
PARASITE,10 May 2020,9/10,"The concept was very interesting and I liked so much the way they managed to get into the house.Although,I put 9 because the daughter was killed."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,1/10,"Predictably stupid
Irritating characters
Unnecessarily hyped
Bad screenplay"
PARASITE,11 April 2021,5/10,"So I went in after seeing 10/10s, 5 stars and Oscars/ awards.You know how a celebrity starts a trend and ten years later no one can believe that was fashionable and it actually was horrendous.I get that vibe here, because the film is so unique and Let's the viewer decipher the plot, people are saying this is great because it's thought provoking, similar to a tate modern peice of art, red splash of paint worth 5 million because the artist is famous.Anyway, as you can tell I'm not that keen on the film but didn't hate it, just left confused to the over inflated ratings, reviews and awards. Go in sceptical and you may far better than me."
PARASITE,7 June 2020,8/10,"Such a resourceful family, stuck in the social ladder! This movie is very different from the usual movies you will watch. It's very troubling. But you've got to watch it."
PARASITE,25 June 2020,10/10,"As far as I can remember, the last time I watched a Korean film was in January last year and it was ""A Taxi Driver"". Most of the movies I watch, apart from those in the big screen, are mostly recommended or are heavily talked about. I heard about this movie, Parasite, a few months ago when it won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival in May, becoming the first Korean film to do so. My expectations were too high, but this film did not disappoint. It is obviously one of this year's best cinematic offerings.It was a good decision not to read anything about the plot of this movie. All I knew before watching was that it is a "" satirical black comedy thriller film"". I expected the ""satirical"" portion to be the reason why this film is universally acclaimed. But my mind couldn't do away with the word ""thriller"" (look at the movie poster, it's already creepy) since I don't normally watch thrillers alone.It was indeed a thriller!I was thrilled to the point that I was so stressed I had to pause the movie a few times to catch my breath. I was stressed but it was the kind of stress one discreetly craves in a movie since the stress gives satisfaction. There are no supernatural beings in this movie. No robots, no science fiction, no ghosts, no zombies. But as for the criterion of being a thriller, it satisfies with flying colors.The shifting of the mood in this film is shocking. It starts like a heist film - something that feels like the Ocean's movies. Then it transitions into something that feels like a documentary about poverty. The first half makes your heart skip a beat while the second half slows it down, without getting repetitive or monotonous. And then you reach the final scene where you begin to think a lot about everything that transpired.Parasite is a film with a beautiful narrative where metaphors, symbolisms and parallelisms all run up and down in a staircase. The social commentaries are evenly laid out from the first scene to the last one. This is a film about class struggle, about the gap between the rich and the poor, about mental illness, and about realities in the world that are difficult to acknowledge.This movie has so many layers it is probably best to watch it with a lot of friends because there are so many things needed to be discussed.What good is a movie when you don't want to talk about it afterwards?"
PARASITE,26 September 2020,10/10,"I am not in Korean movies or music, so I watched this movie only because it won the Oscar.I was wowed by the concept, gripping narrative, and character development. The way the director showcased the class difference was unique and unlike anything I have seen before (I have watched limited movies, so I could be ignorant).All in all, I am gonna watch it again someday."
PARASITE,22 January 2021,10/10,"'The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.'Parasite is not a simple movie, it has multiple layers and an assortment of emotional complexities. And to integrate everything and present as a tragicomedy is arduous.But, a job very well done by director, Bong Joon-ho."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,2/10,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. ""Shattered glass"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""Bling ring"". Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,7/10,"This was a clever and amusing dark comedy until it went way too dark and kooky about two thirds of the way into the film. The first two thirds of the movie very enjoyable if somewhat of a cliché view of the social classes in South Korea. It was much more disparaging of a low class family though. It portrayed them lazy, slovenly, dishonest amateur con artists waiting for their next victim. It was funny if you don't take it seriously. I wonder if the director actually wanted you to believe he is saying that this is a depiction of a typical lower class family in South Korea. His portrayal of the upper class family was also cliché if a bit more muted and of course overly simplistic.The horror slasher ending segment seemed like a completely separate movie. I think it was totally unnecessary and thrown in for shock value only. I understand that the characters and the plot around the dungeon husband and his enabling wife was also added on to the story s a weird twist. The twist of their predicament was amusing if not pretty far over the top. I suppose was a hint of the really crazy stuff yet to come. It really went downhill for me when they tied up the couple, throwing the former housekeeper down the stairs. It looked like she was dead. And then it really started to go off the rails when the Parasite son went into the dungeon with the rock to do what? Kill the couple in the dungeon??? Come on! From there on it was bloody ridiculous.It just seems to me that the director was just not satisfied with making a fun dark comedy and had to add a silly teen slasher segment for shock value. Best picture??? It certainly was not a great year for quality movies but there were other films that were overall better than this."
PARASITE,8 March 2021,,"Parasite received all sorts of rave reviews and the movie is really interesting until the part when they find out the housekeeper's husband is living under the house. Then it gets all whacked. And the son should have been killed by the force of trauma from the scholar stone that was supposed to be for good luck. Too many plot holes, like how could the family move back into that crappy apartment? Wasn't it condemned after all that flooding? Acting was superb but the violence at the boy's picnic was gratuitious and unnecessary. I'm sure some love this movie and want to see it again and again but it was rather dark and depressing. If you have a sick macabre sense of humor this film is for you!"
PARASITE,9 March 2020,10/10,"Got hooked up on the movie since the first minute, the injustice, struggle and social inequality on its best. Great work"
PARASITE,7 July 2020,6/10,"This movie is... memorable. I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,7/10,"I didn't think this movie was an amazing masterpiece but I didn't detest it either. it was simply a bit more than okay for me. The story fell a bit flat when I watched it. I enjoyed the tangled web the Kim family wove around the Park family. I almost felt like you were supposed to feel more sadness and empathy for the Kim family. I can't say that I did feel that emotion but I felt I understood why they did the things they did. I enjoyed the story line within quite a bit more than the main. Overall I wasn't blown away but I think it was written, acted and directed extremely well. I'd like to see more from this director. His shots were impressive."
PARASITE,21 December 2019,10/10,Movies are about people. And this movie described struggle of lower class. A beatiful piece.
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"A Korean film that seemingly sweeping up at the awards seasons? It can't be that good, can it!? Did the judges not see 1917! Is what I hear you cry as you even read the title of this review. From the mind of Bong Joon-ho comes a drama about class and home invasion, but truly can it be THAT good? Lest we forget this is the mind behind the uncompromising vision of Snowpericer and the unsettling onslaught that was Okaj... but even still, it can't be better than Joker? Right?There is a surreal kind of desperation that follows you while watching Parasite, you want to see the ultimate fate of our protagonist sooner than is given. The real tilting point of the movie comes around the halfway mark when a troubling discovery is made, this propels the film from contemporary melodrama into an all-out descent into madness, this is where Bong Joon-ho thrives. In the chaos, in the distress, this is where Bong Joon-ho forces us as an audience to be.Parasite has a rare kind of delicacy to it as if Bong Joon-ho doesn't want to upset us too much, but what's to keep us unsettled. He wants to make us dread for the next turn of events, and as the final curtain falls, you know you have just seen a masterpiece. However, I am unsure if this would not be better suited to a stage production rather than the grandiose of a film.The movie has nothing in it which makes me feel like it must be seen at a cinema, but perhaps that is to its ultimate asset. A film that transcends how you view it and is outstanding on its own merits.The most adequate comparison I can make for Parasite is a Shakespearean play. The film has moments of levity and comedy, blended in with horrible and tragic scenes, and is divided into acts. It has deep pathos and there is something overall cathartic about the whole experience.This is the first film of Bong Joon-ho's that is set in a reality which is current and we (as the viewer) inhabit, despite this, there is still a surreal and other world quality to the proceedings, not unlike Alice In Wonderland. Bong Joon-Ho beckons us through the looking glass.Perhaps Parasite's strongest suit is its characters who are exceptionally well balanced, there is nothing as obvious as a villain or hero in Parasite. No, the film leaves this up to us, as the viewer to pick out who we feel was correct in their actions most. Make no mistake Parasite's is a world filled with fallen humans. To make such deep characters takes a lot of talent and each of the actors give performances that could have easily lead to their own awards nominations.Parasite is a true master class in film making, while totally different from everything else on the market, genre and even world it might just deserve all of the awards it's getting. Yes, even THAT one.10 peaches out of 10"
PARASITE,4 April 2020,9/10,"Its hilarious , realistic , thriller , comedy , all in one"
PARASITE,11 September 2020,7/10,One of the most over rated movie of all time. It was good and one time watch movie but not worth all the hype it good because of being a foreign movie and people want to appreciate it but the appreciation went too far. And it got the awards like oscars because of less competition.
PARASITE,29 June 2021,8/10,"2 years after its debut in 2019 and I'm just now getting around to watching Parasite. Where to start... when people talk about creating art that drags you in and doesn't let go, this is what they're speaking of. The level of suspense throughout the whole film while showing hints of genre after genre after genre really makes this a class act. With numerous twists and turns, this movie is a professional jaw dropper. To you who is about to take part in this experience, congratulations!"
PARASITE,25 December 2019,9/10,"Directed by Bong Joon Ho, i had high hopes for this movie (As i loved memories of murder and okja). It was a perfect blend of comedy, dark humour, class difference. I don't want to spoil the movie but the plot is good too. I didn't like the first few minutes of the movie because of some cringeworthy acting but as the movie progresses they all reedeem themselves. Some scenes were forced into the movie which didn't contribute in any way to the plot of the movie. The cinematography was flawless. And the ending was bittersweet which according to me is perfect. Overall, it is a must watch movie."
PARASITE,26 August 2020,8/10,"Ngl this do be kinda lit. I really like the dynamic the family has with each other, and I love the contrast between the poor family with the misery they live through and the rich family with their perfect and happy lives."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,8/10,"Good movie and really entertaining. Wouldn't say worth all the oscars, but it was very funny."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,8/10,"From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10."
PARASITE,8 March 2020,7/10,Done very well even the topic is not new. The casting fits like a glove and their acting is great. However the ending is disappointing and rushed - they could have done much better than that!
PARASITE,2 October 2019,9/10,"Technically the movie sector is a way of entertainment, and Parasite is a really good example for it.
The film has everything! Thrilling adventure, a family drama, dark humor and twisting scenes. In the middle of the movie everything twists and chains you in your chair. Joon-ho Bong put up a really good job. Directed really good. The casting was really good, with the well-played actings and good directing the characters reflected their emotional conditions very good.
The one con i can point out about the film is the slightly weak ending. It could've been more emotional, tragedian and exiting.
Over all its a really fun movie to watch, infect the best one recently. These kind of movies don't come often."
PARASITE,22 January 2021,3/10,"Bad plot.
Bad accting.
Shallow.
Overrated.
Amazed by the stupidity.
Score is paid or here is some brainwashed people who give it more than 3 stars for this mediocre movie!
Genre, what genre?!
Overall not worth it!!!"
PARASITE,25 April 2020,6/10,"Somehow never understood what does the panel find while they give there judgment. This movie was ok but seriously why an oscar, did not get that part. I read people giving reviews about the genre this film has, there are lots of movies which has many genres and much better than this movie."
PARASITE,7 September 2019,10/10,"Excellent writing, acting, direction, drama, suspense and action. A must see this year."
PARASITE,11 November 2019,10/10,"The suspense, drama, accuracy with the real life, visually amazing. It's just beautiful."
PARASITE,17 December 2019,10/10,Definitely the best movie of 2019. Everybody who loves cinema must see this film.
PARASITE,21 October 2019,8/10,"The Movie have a few very interessting situations, in which the audience don't know if it should laugh or be serious. It's a Arthouse Movie and not a Blockbuster with very much action in it. The camera, the location and the story of the movie a very good. The house of the rich family reminds me a little bit at the house in the movie ""Ex Machina"". The style of the movie is similiar to other korean movies like ""Burning"" or ""Oldboy""."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,10/10,"This one has the lot
Great movie
Great cinematography
Great script
Great acting
See it"
PARASITE,29 February 2020,10/10,"It's a true masterpiece. Outstanding! May be the best movie of the decade. Amazing story, amazing screenplay,outstanding cinematography, beautiful music or sound, super acting. Overall it is one of best in history. And Bong Joon-ho is a legend."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,4/10,"Im still figuring out why the viewers are making a big deal of this movie? Just to be fair the oscars award granted for the movie are deserved and all credits goes to directing and screen play otherwise everything was pretty much expectable and crystal clear , plot twists are meh and the whole movie was a slow burn, really it's not that much well scripted."
PARASITE,26 August 2021,10/10,"There are times where we really deserve a good thrill from a good movie. If you're looking for one, then ""Parasite"" is one hell of a cinematic ride to take.Bong Joon-ho's direction calls back to the brilliant direction a master like Hitchcock would provide, which would be full of unique visuals and stellar composition. And, since I'm on the topic of masters, I am convinced that Director Bong Joon-ho will go down as not just a master of the directing craft, but also of the screenwriting craft. The screenplay, which he co-wrote with Han Jin-won, is full of not just so many twists and turns, but filled with so much genre-bending twists that there's never a moment where you feel the trope is overused. Both Bong and Han clearly know how to write a screenplay that is just as effective as say a screenplay like the one for ""Chinatown.""Then comes the performances of the cast. This film is a prime example of casting done right. Song Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, the father of the poor Kim family desperate to break the boundaries set by classism and infiltrate the luxurious home of the Park family, with Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong playing the father and mother, respectfully. Every single actor in this films shines like cinematic gold in their respectful roles.So, if you like films that are original, imaginative, thrilling, and oh-so brilliant acted, written, and directed, then please. Give Parasite a go. I promise, you will be in for a surprised. A really big one."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,10/10,"With many other films out there pointing out of the problem of wealth gap and the struggle to survive in cities, Parasite stands out being different because of its comedic effects and the sudden twists.
There are so many moments in the first half you can laugh with ease when the family use their wits to resolve problems. But under that surface, there is pressure building up, and the dark finally emerges from the most grand-looking house. I was awed by the sudden twist.
The cinematic effect is great. I was surprised to know that the mansion was purposely 'built' for this film. There are so many details that portrays the 'bitter-sweet' life of the struggling family."
PARASITE,30 March 2020,1/10,This Movie Is a copy of a Tamil Movie. And Now Parasite's Director is sued. Don't Watch This movie instead of it Watch The real One. Parasite DO NOT DESERVE OSCAR.
PARASITE,22 April 2020,10/10,"Solely based on social inequality and the consequences of capitalism, 'Parasite' is a film that demonstrates indirect friction between opposite social classes. Bong Joon Ho was writing in an attempt to reveal that Korea isn't as glamorous as one would think this is shown from the massive social gap between the Parks and Kims (from one of his press interviews 'but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair'). I think this is quite ironic as we saw the younger individuals were more likely to proceed into becoming slightly successful as they were the ones that secured the jobs for their whole family, also going back to the statement about the poor widening, but what stood in the way was another poor family who had the same idea but in the end both had different morals which ultimately lead to the demise of both poor families. This is just one of the reasons why this film was so incredible because even just talking about it sounds poetic and satisfying."
PARASITE,17 May 2020,10/10,"Everything here is perfect. From the characters, plot, theme, music, jokes, cinematography and all."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,9/10,"Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.
Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece."
PARASITE,7 January 2021,10/10,This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in recent years. The acting and story are phenomenal. I was also shocked to see this got best picture things are changing for the better in the Academy. This is an amazing film anyone should see.
PARASITE,8 February 2020,8/10,"The film starts off as a Lucille Ball/Vivian Vance escapade and ends as Quentin Tarantino drama. I guess that's what we call fluidity.
Parasite is terrific. The cast is embraceable. The actors were recognized by the Screen Actor's Guild for the ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture."" Hurray for Parasite."
PARASITE,5 June 2020,7/10,Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
PARASITE,16 July 2021,6/10,"Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars."
PARASITE,9 December 2020,9/10,"I thought snow piercer was a pretty good film when it came out and indeed I still think the same about it. But parasite was outstandingly good.
Never too predictable and never too far fetched. Took me a wee while to get used to subtitles as I haven't seen a foreign film for a few years.
If only all films were as great as this."
PARASITE,2 June 2021,10/10,"The ending left me truly staggered. Bong joon-ho's originality was mind blowing, and easily recognizable as inspired by Psycho. A very subtle Hitchcockian touch to the flick.Truly great film."
PARASITE,28 December 2020,10/10,Feeling sad because i can't rate it 20...! Just awesome... !
PARASITE,2 November 2019,10/10,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture."
PARASITE,12 December 2020,10/10,"The first half of this film sets up the mind blowing second half perfectly. I usually can predict what type of twist or at least have a couple different general directions of where a plot twist might be headed; trust me on this, you'll never see it coming. My favorite films of all time include No Country for Old Men and The Departed; this is right up there with them and in some ways eclipses the rest. A must see."
PARASITE,12 August 2021,10/10,"Enjoyed it. Very unique narrative of the story and contrary to what others say, I enjoyed the 2nd half. It had great twists and unexpected turns."
PARASITE,26 March 2021,8/10,"The film demonstrates poverty, desperation and inequality. It dramatizes the extreme differences in the world between wealthy and poor family."
PARASITE,9 April 2021,9/10,"Wowowowow, this is one of the best films I watched in a while. It was well crafted and the acting was great.It made a really good showcase of social divides across different classes and the extremes that one will go to in desperation. It also showed how the rich think of the poorer proletariat as less than, shown through the odour comments throughout the film, it is this lack of respect that lead to the patriarch's murderous actions.I feel like the house also represented the aforementioned divides in society, the basement representing the lower class and the place of desperation, originally used to hide from loan sharks and after used to hide from the police. Above the basement, the rich family lives, literally above, which could be seen as a metaphor for the place they hold in society, towering above those who are less fortunate. This is a theme, repeated again when the protagonist's house being so low down, is flooded by the torrential rain, whereas the Park's house isn't affectedThe shifting of the film's tone from an upbeat, fun atmosphere (reminiscent of a bank heist film, e.g. Ocean's 11), to a dark sombre tone was powerful. It also presented the unforeseen consequences that can occur when these people are pushed to the extremes. You could also argue that it was the greed of Ki-Taek's family that dealt them this fate, their lack of empathy and consideration when causing the other people to lose their jobs is what started this, however I'm of the opinion that this whole situation was the symptom of a greater issue, wealth inequality. If the state pension system was better perhaps the Geun-Sae wouldn't have had to stay in that basement for so long. If the Park family weren't in a bubble, perhaps Ki-Taek's father wouldn't have snapped. If there was another way to get employment, Ki-Taek's wouldn't have had to resort to greed and forgery to get money. All these things could have been prevented through a better social support structure, perhaps this is the message of the movie.This film was quite poignant and I believe it really achieved its goal of showing how the less fortunate, people on the fringes of society have to live, what lengths they are driven to, perhaps some people will never understand but this film certainly made a great effort.I'm not surprised at all that this film won best picture, it's a unique film and the soundtrack is powerful too, might I add."
PARASITE,9 April 2021,10/10,"The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. And Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. And Mrs. Park ..."
PARASITE,8 June 2021,8/10,"I always told to myself that, don't judge a movie before you have seen it, even better don't expect anything about it. But this time, at this movie, I can't stop myself from expecting this 2019 Oscar best movie, at least, I hope a wonderful experience just like Memories of Murder.As a result, this is actually a good movie, but didn't good enough for an Oscar, at least didn't good enough for me. The social problem in Korea, the poor and the rich, and 3 families in one house, every design and detail is really amazing. But I think the point wasn't hit enough, seems like just give a try and then run away."
PARASITE,15 July 2021,10/10,"A true masterpiece from Director Bong Joon Ho.I've watched this movie more than 10 times now and still amazed every time I see it, The attention to every single detail is unbelievable.Director Bong really stick to the Chekov's Gun rule. Every element from the start until to end connects with each other. Every scene is necessary.The cinematography and production design really helped the contrast of the Kim's and Park's family.Recommend to watch both color and black and white version. The black and white gives it more contrast and texture, but some scenes doesn't really work because yet this movie wasn't intended to be a black and white film."
PARASITE,23 September 2021,10/10,This movie is both hilarious and thought-provoking. The premise gives the movie a lot of opportunity for humor as well as a tool to talk about class warfare.
PARASITE,9 April 2020,7/10,"I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle. While I was entertained, I was shocked that this movie won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Picture over the far superior 1917."
PARASITE,5 January 2020,9/10,"A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" at any given point during the movie.This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,2/10,"Since many critics and the Academy are swooning over this Korean film, I was compelled to go to the theater, pay my admission and be ready to read English titles for over two hours. I kept an open mind and found the first third of the two plus hours to be interesting. Mind you, none of the characters were especially likeable--the lower class basement dwellers or the upper class snowflakes living in the architectural digest modern mansion.The lower class family were the true parasites, smelly low class leeches looking for and finding every possible way to become what they weren't--classy.After the son, the daughter, the father and then the mother managed to become tutor, analyst, driver and cook, the plot thickened and to me went off the rails. A hidden bomb shelter, a husband living in that tomb for four years, a biblical rain storm miraculously not causing anyone of the submerged characters (with hundreds of electrical wires floating overhead) to be instantly electrocuted, cell phones to continue to work after being equally submerged. Not at all believable. And then........The skies cleared and a gala lawn party was planned at the modern mansion. Here's where I could see Jordon Peele becoming royally pissed. Wasn't all the crazy knife wielding and weird stuff done in Get Out? Yes, it was! So the Academy voters had to make amends for not giving Peele the Best Picture Oscar. Instead they gave it to this two plus hour Korean gab fest.I left the theater feeling absolutely empty. Not moved, not caring, but wondering just why did the performers all have three names?Avoid if you haven't already given your valuable time."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"First of all, all this opinions are personal and can only be applicable to this especific movie. From now on, I will open my mind how I perceived the movie and how it touched me, not necessarily being a= universal truth. So, read it with open heart.Photography of the movie is brilliant, as well as the story line unfolding.Before jumping into what I think is crucial, I just want to remark some romanticized/false assumptions employed in this movie. Life it is just not like that:
1. rich people is happier than the least well-off
2. richness comes out of nowhere, so those people can party all the time
3. every mechanism is valid to get poorness behind, such as scams or tricksIn the other hand, I wanted to remark some authentic premises:
1. Yes, Richness is loneliness
2. Yes, too much money destroy relationship between people. Capital is a relationship solvent
3. Yes, scarcity does not allow people to reach their potentials
4. No, not all poor man is willing to dedicate himself to honest work, and therefore, avoids the burden it brings as challenges
5. Yes, people established in life do rely on strange arguments, as long as they converge to the ""goumetization"" of life style
6. Yes, all people want to feel special somehow special
7. Yes, simplicity is key for happinessSome thoughts on the characters:
1. One family represents scarcity, first two levels of Maslow's pyramid: what caught my attention was that despite of being poor, they were not dumb. The boy could have being a genius of design, the girl a successful artist. Instead they deliberately opted for schemes and dishonesty. They laugh virtually all the time, validating each other's mish-mashes. They struggle together and they are happy to share meals together. Poorness in the movies is always romanticized, put in a box where everything is excusable. To me, what defines poorness is not the lack of resources or money, it is thinking the whole life by half. This means, understanding how the world works, what are the underlying rules and how to fit on the scene.2. The other family represents richness, the top layer of Maslow's pyramid. They went beyond the average. Abundance, excess, distance amidst family members, the need to seek everything specially tailor-mad for them (what I call GoT ""gourmetization-of-things"", consumerism. Have you notice how few lines between these characters are there? Compare the number of lines among poor family members vs rich family members. Maybe God lives in what is common, collective. Sometimes I there is a natural, intrinsic trend to attribute to richness what is often there. Let us see why. To provide to the family, the father is almost always away. It is not shown on the movie, although I assure you he has many, many, problems to tackle on a daily basis. Being rich does not happen by accident, it is more like being placed on the top of a pyramid of marbles. As the time goes by, if one is not careful, the marbles start to spread all over the place. It takes a lot of effort to put them organized again. The mother is trying to protect the kids with the weapon she has. Daughter and son seldom touched their parents. There is a hidden cost on the mentioned topics. The cost of absence, which is never depicted in movies.3. The housekeeper it is a symbol of order. She manages to close some family gaps. Always attentive she keep the ball rolling with excellence. Of course, later on the movie, we realize she is also interested on serving because of a personal condition.4. The man on the basement, could be seen as ghost and glory. Ghost because of subconscious issues we might carry in life. Glory because he live with little and even though is respectful to those who brings him subsistence.5. The children, might be seen as the ones suffering the consequences of social contrast. On one side, the overwatch and undercaress. Remember the boy receiving the walkie-talkie? Might be the concrete symbol of father-son distance; on the other side, the being close to their parents, whoa re incapable of showing a constructive trail.Some other core elements on the story line:
1. The smell: it is a way to show arrogant and pedant rich might be. One of the reasons why the driver stabs the father of a family2. The special club for VIPs: demonstrates how fragile are the rich family, taking decision on shallow perceptions. Being subject to any kind of narrative3. The houses represent contrast4. The stone: symbolizes superstition, something that will not make dreams come true. Also, when analyzed the scene on which the boy is stoned, it denotes the tragedy of poor, how it can come back to those who bet chips at it. The wrong way5. The booze: a psychological help to make rich life bearable6. The party: more than being the stage of gore violence, it is a stage where one rich family demonstrates its power (id est status, ego, vanity) to other ones7. The knives: the killings with knives give a more personal and physical aspect to the attacks, something the guns cannot emphasize. It was necessary to the characters to drown their own hands on the victims and provoke the blood shedIn conclusion, at a first level of reflection, the parasite is the poor family, ""invading"" the house by applying weapons are sensible to.
On a more deep analysis, and I do not even know if the director intended to do so - that is the beauty of any kind of art -, I think the parasite is the alienation, the way people stop seeing other as human beings. This the major common fact orbiting each and every character. It allows the social shock to occur, it allows the contrast to become laughable, it allows greed to flourish, it allows precocious endings and loss of opportunities."
PARASITE,27 April 2020,5/10,"I tend to like western fantasy more, because it's about fictional places and abilities, not behaviors."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,Simply amazing! One of the best movies I watched in 2019. Keeps you on the edge all the way. Great flow. The end was something.
PARASITE,16 October 2019,10/10,"This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.Go see this movie."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,10/10,"Wow! Parasite is a great ride!!Although there was some grimness, it's not a horror flick, but a psychological thriller. The film paints with grandiose broad strokes using extravagance to tell a bigger story...a story about social inequality and the gullibility of people, particularly entitled acting rich foks. The story crawls into your mind and leaves you pondering.PS. Can I just say that I'm sickened by the fact that the rich husband & wife have matching pajamas 🙄*Disclaimer: if anyone has matching pajamas with their significant other, my apologies 😆"
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,Believe the hype. This is one of the best if not the best film in years. Watch it and you'll see why
PARASITE,16 January 2020,7/10,"So PARASITE...this film makes you think and laugh and gasp all in one scene. Part of me felt like a voyeur watching a film about the political and socio-economic problems in the Koreas. There was so much symbolism. The class struggles, the haves and have nots, the disparities, and ""blindness"" of the rich toward the underprivileged and disenchanted, forced to live underground. The""peeing man"" for me, represented the Elvis loving crazy dictator, 45's favorite, potential button pushing maniac, he scares me. Kim Jong-un, who is reckless and careless and pees all over everyone anytime he pleases, yet no one can stop him...sound familiar? This film took satirical chances that we do not always take in American filmmaking. And with an unstable, murderer at the helm of a shaky ship in N. Korea that was bold, very bold. It went everywhere and took us on quite a journey. IMHO, I felt it went to crazy town once the Con Artist family made the underground discovery and then it just crashed through the ceiling at the party. BUT, it made me think and I was compelled to talk about it and wrestle with what I just watched after it was over. Isn't that what film is for?"
PARASITE,29 October 2019,9/10,"Parasite doesn't give a s... about following rules, sticking to the plan or pleasing the viewer
The storyline is thoroughly thought, the characters deeply developed and the element of surprise is constantly around the corner during the second half of the movie. One of the best movies i ve ever seen"
PARASITE,22 June 2021,9/10,"The transition in the story chapters in a dramatic ascending manner, with the appearance of shocking surprises in the last quarter, led to the wonderful feeling at the end of the film."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,5/10,"Based on some of the reviews I've read on IMDB, I'm not the only one who thought this film was definitely not worth the hype. Some parts were interesting but overall, I found it was just ... meh."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,9/10,Bong joon ho is clearly a talented director from everything i have seen from him he has a key eye for slowly drawing you into the plot and keeping you at the edge of your seat i also loved how the story played with your expectations for characters in the film this film was the first in a long while that made me legitimately feel nervouse for the characters being discovered i won't spoil it but you will know what i mean when u see the film for yourself the only complants i had would be a few scenes went on a bit too long and i kept misleading myself into thinking it was going to end sooner then it did but i imagine on my second watch these issues won't be a big deal to me i mean this film has already been creeping into my thoughts since seeing it hours earlier i'm not sure if this film is a 8 or 9 or how the film holds up to the directors previous works but this film is worth your attention please if your sick of the hollywood garbage that is turned out in your local cinema please look for a cinema that's playing parasite it's worth your time and i feel it might be my favourite movie that's come out this year so get hyped and check it out and if your new to the director check out his previous movies the host and especially mother are some of his best but parasite is up there with them check it out
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,10/10,"I've never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well. It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal.After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"Good movie, nothing more nothing less..8 is a fair rating... 9-10 gets perfect movies for me..."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,5/10,"First, the movie is simply too long. Second, so many unbelievable scenes, such as:When the rich family goes camping (completely unbelievable) the poor family parties in the rich family's living room spilling food and grain alcohol everywhere. When the rich family comes home unexpectedly, they hurriedly sweep the food and spilled alcohol under the coffee table. How can the rich parents sleep on the couch two feet away from this mess but don't see or smell any of this - especially the husband with the fabulous sense of smell? Or at the very least smell the stinky family who are also hiding under the coffee table?Poor family's home is flooded by sewage and rain water due to a deluge. The family goes home to try to rescue what they can, wading thru chest high sewage water in their house, but nothing is salvageable except the rock. That night they sleep in a shelter but wake up the next day dry with not a trace of filth on any of them. Oh, and their phones are still charged and work. I guess they were on their heads. And then they go directly to work at the rich guys house for the son's birthday party. The daughter in a lovely dress. The son in nice clothes. The dad in his chauffeur uniform. Huh?Scenes like that make me crazy...But I did like the fact that the first housekeeper was as corrupt as the poor family. That I didn't see coming. Or the Quentin Tarantino ending."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,8/10,"Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity."
PARASITE,12 November 2019,3/10,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Reading the synopsis itty sound good.I had to stop watching with 35 minutes left in the movie.I was incredibly bored. I enjoy slow movies but this was.... I felt my life being wasted.Go watch Annihilation. I saw that recently, that is a good movie."
PARASITE,9 July 2020,6/10,"The film was going pretty well and I was enjoying it, but thenSpoiler alert!Why on earth would they allow the previous housekeeper in at that time of night. Surely the sensible thing to do would have been to tell her to come back in the daytime. But no, in order to further the story they had to crowbar this scenario in.From that point on the film was ruined for me."
PARASITE,17 February 2021,1/10,"I can not believe that this movie won any awards at all. Horrible. It started off ok and transitioned into something where it seemed that the writer ran out of creative juice, then in a desperate attempt to write a movie script, just wrote a bunch of pointless drivel that had no real substance or connection to the story line. This was really 2 movies butted up against each other.I think that the awards given to Parasite should be given to the next in line that did not win, because they were robbed. C'mon Hollywood. This is no way to show how 'woke' you are. I want my money back."
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core.
Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre
Was I the parasite?
If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.👏👏👏"
PARASITE,1 January 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a great movie. It's very well paced and structured, and has an interesting and constantly evolving narrative. From a filmmaking standpoint, it's on a very high level.In the end though, I still felt it left something to be desired. I felt that the movie didn't have as much of an impact on me as I had hoped. The ending wasn't as cathartic to me as to others and I quickly forgot about the movie shortly after I watched it, even though I usually think about movies like this for days after I watched them.Maybe this can be attributed to the fact that I found it genuinely hard to really sympathise with the characters for different reasons and I didn't form a strong emotional bond with them - and without it, how am I supposed to care about their fate?It's sad what has happened to the hiding guy and his wife, but they were introduced so late in the movie and their characters didn't really get fleshed out.The big family (who the title probably refers to) got fleshed out quite well, but the more I learned about them, the more distant and unlikeable they became.As for the rich family, they are somewhere between the previous two. They had some character development, but not much, and they were neither liekable or unlikeable - so basically, I didn't care about them at all.Overall, I would still say that it's a pretty strong movie, but it lacks some kind of soul that would elevate it to a much higher level and make it truly stand out.Therefore I also think that the 96/100 Metacritic and 8.6/100 IMDB scores are undeservedly high. This movie is an 8.0-8,5/10 for me, which means that it should be somewhere around 80 on Metacritic and somewhere between 7-8 on IMDB."
PARASITE,15 November 2020,8/10,"Can't say I've ever watched a movie similar to this one. Because of the reviews I gave it two attempts to draw my attention and I'm glad I did.
I found it thought provoking with a lingering sadness afterwards, the disparity across humanity.
It's a well crafted film with a beating heart and a poignant premise."
PARASITE,24 December 2019,9/10,"It did start off a little slow (or maybe it was me getting used to watching a movie with subtitles for once) and I had no idea what to expect from this movie. But man I did not expect the direction this movie takes at many moments. I found myself jaw dropping, laughing and over all just adoring the choises that were made during the production of this masterpiece."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁"
PARASITE,23 February 2020,1/10,After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.
PARASITE,8 May 2020,9/10,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while. As soon as I learned it was from the same director Snowpiercer, I knew I had to watch it. Plot twists, great story telling, and stunning visuals are just a few reasons I enjoyed this film so much."
PARASITE,2 April 2020,8/10,"This movie plot shows us about the interaction between two families in which one poor family acts as parasite to the one rich family.
The plot of this story is appreciating with a new concept."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,4/10,"You have seen the ludicrous reviews claiming that this is the best film of the year and that it will be remembered for years. It won't. It's a nonsensical movie about a bunch of weirdos. It's well shot, but if you expect a movie to give you some positive feelings, some lesson, or an inspiration, well prepare to leave the movie theater empty-handed."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"Fantastic movie, I really liked it. History, script, actors, it was really a very good work."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,9/10,"With the likable struggling family trying to make a living in a rough world and then keeps you attached with it's unconventional twists while using subtle symbolism to get its anti-capitalism message across.As an American who believes in the free market, and the ""American Dream"" of working hard, saving your money (the step people struggle the most with), then investing your money, and shooting for your goals with everything that you have, I appreciate it when movies that are critical of the economic system of capitalism which allows for their to be a larger wage disparity between the rich and the poor then other economic systems, doesn't feel the need preach its beliefs to you with elaborate speeches, but instead opts to let the story do the talking. However, the one exception in Parasite to this was the conversation in the gym that Ki-taek had with his son about plans. And it's this quote that really sticks out to me:""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. No plan. You know why? If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""This is an absolutely heartbreaking outlook to have on life and it can only truly be believed by a man who has let his circumstances defeat him. But at the same time, some people are just given the short end of the stick in life. They grow up in a bad situation and often times lack the education, the capability, the direction, drive, or the opportunity to pull themselves out of it. In the case of Ki-woo and his sister Ki-jeong, they clearly weren't lacking in capability or drive, but the lack of opportunity was implied which was why Ki-woo's friend Min-hyulk was a godsend to the family when he presented Ki-woo with the idea of him taking a tutoring position.What I find funny is that the father ends up acting on impulse when he hides in the basement and the situation of the film with a poor person living in the shadow of a rich person remains the same. On the flip side, the son says he has a ""fundamental plan"" in which he will go to a university, and make enough money to buy the house so he could free his father. At first, the movie tries to trick you into believing that he was able to do so and he is able to see his father again, but then it is revealed to be a more realistic and melancholic ending with Ki-woo hoping that he will be able to actually set out and do it, but never actually being able to do so. This is suggesting that in a capitalistic society, those on the bottom have a hard time of rising to the top even when they have the drive and capability to do so.But me being the optimist that I am, I cannot accept such an ending. The reason that Ki-woo fails isn't because his dream isn't attainable, it's because he doesn't actually have a plan. Saying that you are going to go to a university and make lots of money is not a plan. That's a dream. Plans need to be thought out with smaller attainable goals set as stepping stones to reach that dream. And judging by the way Ki-woo was raised, he probably never had anyone show him how to break things down to properly execute a plan. That pains me because once Ki-woo gets some direction, he'd be able to find an opportunity to help get his family out of the rut they're in. Of course, in some cases, it's better for you to worry about #1 and to not let your family drag you down with you which is something that I've had to learn the hard way in my life...Overall, I am happy that this film won best picture, It was an original film with a brilliant script, great acting, and likable protagonists despite all of the horrific stuff that they do. But what I think is even more noteworthy is that Parasite is an anti-capitalist film which portrays rich people as people. And I respect Bong Joon-ho for pulling that off especially when I felt that the biggest flaw in his previous film Okja was that he was anything but subtle with how he portrayed his antagonists. Parasite doesn't have antagonists. It has a working class of characters that are struggling to make a living and a higher working class of characters that is oblivious of the struggles of those that are beneath them."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,7/10,"Although I enjoyed watching the movie, I don't understand why people say this is one of the best movies of the decade. The ending is kinda weird and the middle of the movie is also boring"
PARASITE,11 July 2020,5/10,"Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie."
PARASITE,26 June 2021,5/10,I liked the house and the cinematography. Struggled to watch it. Didn't really warm to any of the characters. Laughed twice. Plot was predictable but not a crime in itself. Wouldn't recommend.
PARASITE,19 October 2019,7/10,"I rate the film for its intention, for its rawness, and for the impression it leaves after I walk out of the cinema.
Nevertheless, I don't feel convinced by the acting, nor the somewhat implausible story line.
I can watch this film as a well-packaged piece of entertainment. But I don't think I'd be missing much, if I hadn't watched it."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,10/10,"Wow! This one really blew me away! The writing is just too good for words to describe. Each and every aspect of film making whether direction , acting , editing , production design, sound design etc. is just best it can get . When you see this movie you will go "" oh this deserves an Oscar"". And you got it right , it actually won the Oscar's. Too many reasons for it to win the Oscar's.
The writer and director Bong Joon Ho simply deserves a standing ovation and then in true Korean style, a big bow down with folded hands!"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,5/10,I found this film to be an okay film but I don't think it's as good as it's high rating suggests but each to their own and obviously a lot of watchers wouldn't agree with me.
PARASITE,18 February 2020,9/10,The storyline is really different. People don't get to see this type of movie often. The movie is really a lot to take in the storyline is based completely on the name of the movie.
PARASITE,18 December 2019,9/10,"Many dialogues are impressive, like a spear stabbing my heart."
PARASITE,26 July 2020,10/10,This movie is fantastic. It has the perfect mix of comedy and drama. It has realistic and fun characters and has a fantastic twist. You won't expect it and it is a really fun movie. There is a lot of symbolism and I promise that you will love it.
PARASITE,4 June 2020,,"I'm afraid to say this movie is evidence to the press, PR and political agenda driven bile we are subjected to daily. Basically, it's 100% over hyped.
The emperors new clothes is an hour too long. It's a terribly crass, dull story that's simply well shot.
The movie and it's PR machine and subsequent Oscars are an insult to the peoples intelligence.
If constipation is your favoured hobby, dive in. If not... avoid."
PARASITE,5 February 2021,10/10,"Who are the parasites? This is the question going through your mind throughout the film. That's why this film is so good. The rich family living their lives without a care in the world. The poor family desperate to survive. Are the rich family kind, selfish or both? What about the poor family? Who are the parasites? Both families? When the rain comes and floods the ""poor people"", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain. But is it because they are selfish or are they blissfully unaware? This is story of how people view the world after experiencing two different lives. It's brilliant, full of questions and thoughts."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,4/10,"I am really confused by people who call this film ""groundbreaking or a ""masterpiece"". It's a watchable film that takes a while to gain momentum but manages to keep your attention. Nothing earth- shattering or innovative about it. A good experience but I would not pay $14.99 again. I fell victim to the hype."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite combines multiple genres through a captivating story and interesting characters. The contrast in lifestyles between the Kims and the Parks is portrayed through the amazing camera work and the incredible set design.
The acting is simply jaw-dropping. I'm glad that these insanely talented korean actors are getting exposure through this film and I hope to see them on the big screen more often.
This movie is simply amazing. It's psychological, comedic, frighteningly real. I would highly recommend you watch it, but avoid spoilers, as they will ruin the surprises."
PARASITE,12 June 2020,10/10,"This is by far the best movie that I've seen in a while! That doesn't necessarily mean a lot, but this movie is all you want: Beautiful cinematography, great cast, good writing! I will keep it short as one can easily say something that gives a hint to the story. Don't read any other reviews... You need to see this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible."
PARASITE,24 April 2020,9/10,"When I saw ""parasite"" it had already hit hard in cannes, and now it sweeps the Oscars. The premise is about a very low-income family that is getting involved with another family but of high class bringing unpredictable events. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the metaphor in the title goes a long way and makes us think of ourselves as a society and who the ""parasite"" really is in this film. There are no good or bad for both the poor and the rich family. As for the performances, they are excellent taking the rhythm of the film and going from humor (often black humor) to very dramatic and intense situations, especially reaching the third act. The direction, the staging, the lighting and the staging are outstanding, as is the music, making a great choreography. This type of film was needed, making an x-ray of the most complex beings in this world and how we handle ourselves ... Humans."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,6/10,"While Parasite had great cinematography and was gripping from start to finish, the movie lacked proper closure and wasn't executed greatly. The conclusion lacked any relation and was uneventful. This movie which so ""profoundly"" tries to highlight social class differences, failed in creating a movie with a logical ending and turned into a sappy melodrama almost painful to watch."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,8/10,This is the perfect film. Subjectively speaking I may have enjoyed Joker equally however from an objective standpoint it is extremely plain to see it was the rightful winner of its Oscar for best picture and WITHOUT A DOUBT the most original. Awesome Movie. Clearly describe the reality of our current world.
PARASITE,19 April 2020,9/10,"This movie is amazing and deserves the Oscar for best foreign language film.The director is great,looking forward to seeing more Asian movies."
PARASITE,1 May 2020,10/10,This story is incredible- beautiful cinematography and excellent directing. The characters and relationships are dynamic and you can't look away. Not surprised that this won the Oscar for Best Film
PARASITE,22 May 2020,9/10,This movie didn't disappoint! Everything felt original and it took a disturbing twist towards the end. The theme of the movie was clear from the get go! Overall great movie and I would watch again!
PARASITE,23 August 2020,9/10,I have never seen such a movie where every little detail such as dialogue or an object foreshadows other things that come. Absolutely fabulous the way they made this film. It was entertaining and had lots of suspense at the end.
PARASITE,11 November 2020,10/10,"Not only is this my favourite movie of the century, it's one of my favourite movies of all time. What's so great about it? This movie has the best example of an amazing midpoint and conveys a theme and deeper meaning better than any other movie I've seen. The first half of the film was captivating enough, but once it reaches it's midpoint I was glued to my seat and my eyes were glued to the screen; this movie is close to perfect; I'm sure it might have some flaws, however, I can't see them since the are so easy to overlook because of the qualities that it would take me hours to list. Just to name a few; the pacing is fantastic, the characters are interesting, the conflict is original, and it has one of the best montages of recent years. This movie will go down in history and be remembered for years to come as an achievement of cinema, and this is why I strongly suggest you watch it."
PARASITE,16 February 2021,,"I've never been much of a person for movies, but I didn't really have a choice but to start watching some of the more popular ones as I became friends with people into cinema.I cannot express my love for this movie enough - I've seen it four times now (showing it to anyone who will watch it with me, and once in theaters) and it is just as good every time. Creative camerawork, greedy yet redeemable characters who talk like real people, and the craziest plot twists that nobody could see coming.The ending reminds me of Midsommar in a way that it uses bright, lush greenery and beautiful people standing against scenes of brutal murder. The stark contrast makes these types of scenes so surreal and almost romantic, in a way. Bright green on bright red, with copious amounts of sunshine spilling in. It slices right through the serene atmosphere. Loss in Parasite is permanent - it is not resolved by a cut to ""ten years later"" where all of the protagonists have recovered and are back to normal. There is no mercy in this film and I love it."
PARASITE,16 July 2021,10/10,"The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult children, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family who live in a squalid, cramped apartment in the middle of a basement in a commercial busy working class. Seoul district. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. And Mrs. Kim, literally reek of poverty. Often, as a collective, they commit small tricks to survive and, even when they have jobs, they do the minimum amount of work necessary. Ki-woo is the one who dreams of breaking out of poverty by going to university one day. Despite not having a college education, Ki-woo is chosen by his college student friend Min, who is leaving for school, to take up his tutoring job for Park Da-hye, whom Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is at university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years lived in their modernist designed house and former residence of the famous architect Namgoong. While Mr. And Mrs. Park are about status, Mrs. Park has a shifty, simple-minded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable lying to her about her education to get the job. Upon getting the job, Ki-woo further discovers that Ms. Park is looking for an art therapist for Parks' teenage son Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending her professional art therapist friend ""Jessica"", actually Ki -jung that he knows he can be the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling in love with Da-hye, he starts imagining himself in that house and so the Kims as a collective initiate a plan for all Kims, like Ki-jung using false names, to replace the existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for being fired. The hardest one to get rid of might be Moon-gwang, the Parks housekeeper who literally came with the house - she was Namgoong's housekeeper when he used to live there - and therefore knows her every nook and cranny better than he does. Parks. The question then is how far the Kims can take this blow in their quest to become their version of the Parks."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,I saw Korean movie for the first time and it was awesome. Everything in the movie was great from story to direction. If you are a movie lover you should not miss this one.
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,"Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,10/10,"I will keep it short go see this film everyone. Totally deserves all its awards a masterpiece in film making by the director who gave us memories of murder. If you are a fan of Korean movies you will clearly love it and if you arent this may change your perception. It has it all comedy, drama, thriller you name it all merge beautifully.ENOUGH SAID GO SEE IT NOW."
PARASITE,26 December 2019,7/10,"Not sure about it being the masterpiece that a lot of views claimed it to be, but it was nonetheless captivating to watch. Outrageous plot set in an everyday neighborhood made it seem not so ridiculous but rather interesting to watch. Great cinematography. Always Loved the director's style. And like many other good Asian films, this one definitely stands out from a crowd of CGI packed action Hollywood movies."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,7/10,"I watched this movie after reading a lot of rave reviews about it, so that may have played into my impression about the movie. I think it's definitely a good movie in fact one of the memorable ones of 2019, but i still feel the praise this is garnering is slightly overrated for what it offers. The concept is nice. I don't know how the dialogues are in Korean but the English subtitle translation was average and didn't have the comic nature many times. The build up was slow but the movie picks up pace pretty quickly after that. After some shenanigans by the family, the real chaos which is at the heart of the story starts. The frantic events at the end didn't make a lot of sense. I think the end kind of soured overall impression of movie for me, for the sake of keeping review spoiler free I would not say which event exactly but you'd know when you watch it.Another problem I found was that movie tried to be a lot than what story could have allowed it to be. Comedy thriller would be perfect description but then there are attempts at being a drama movie too and they feel less coherent to the movie... The acting was good by almost every character for the most part. Overall I would say it was a good watch and it is memorable for the uniqueness of the story."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,1/10,"I don't understand the high praise and award at all. Even if you are poor, you shouldn't throw away your morality! Didn't the son score a job at pizza place at the very beginning of the movie? Isn't her sister good at photoshop and computer? Can't their chubby mom work as dishwasher or clothes washer? A lot of low income family in Indonesia do that. Instead of working hard, they conned their way into an innocent family!Sure, a movie protagonist shouldn't a good person all the time. But they should get retribution when they choose to be bad. In this movie, the father was never arrested for killing Mr. Park. The protagonist lost his sister, but they got what they deserve. They made the previous house maid lost her job. They killed her and almost kill her husband too.Mr. Park and his family is totally innocent. But they didn't get the justice in the end. What kind of movie is this? Rich people deserve to die from not treating the poor as equal human being? Nah. Mr. Park is normal. I have seen much much worse.Some people also mention how about protagonist father deserve to be mad during the final conflict. Hello, guys? What kind of father wouldn't prioritize his son who's having seizure? What kind of father would put a stranger's life before his son's life?Bad, bad movie, where moderately decent guy didn't get justice, and the murderous evil guy lives."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,10/10,"My favorite movie of 2019..
Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture"
PARASITE,13 September 2019,9/10,"I really appreciated the film. The director was subtle but his end result was strong and intense. It made me very uncomfortable. I probably would not watch it again, but it is worth watching. Acting was without a doubt great."
PARASITE,2 February 2021,6/10,The wokeness I am referring to is Hollywood. Best picture? Because it's a foreign film written by non white males and no white males are in the movie. This is a nice way to cap off the decade of insane wokeness. That is the only conclusion I can come to as to why this won so many Oscars (which have been a joke ever since Shakespeare in Love beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture).
PARASITE,24 March 2020,8/10,"The film was being a masterpiece, to some extent .... the ending was disappointing. But I really liked it!"
PARASITE,13 May 2020,7/10,"Parasite is a highly polished and pretty-looking movie but it falls short in a few ways. My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of ""tonal whiplash"", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home? I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,Will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Worthy of ever award and accolade that comes its way.
PARASITE,8 January 2021,5/10,"I see people really raving over the film and the awards it won, so I was keen to see it, sounded great. And it was great until about two thirds through when the ending kicks in.The ending was just so-so, seemed to build up to a crescendo and then the plot let the actors down."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,1/10,"I'm a fan of a lot of international movies which break out of the Hollywood mold, but not this one. Could barely sit through it, and should have walked out early. It never got better. Some people seem to like it, but there are a lot of overly inflated reviews here. Maybe I'm rating too low, but I could not think of anything about it to rave about. OK...maybe the acting wasn't too bad, but the plot and script overall are a 1."
PARASITE,7 March 2020,4/10,"It surprises me how critics have a taste for movies that may be artistic but are just awful or average experiences at best to watch. If you're a film critic you might like this movie for the reasons that all the other film critics do.If you're an average moviegoer who wants a movie with characters to relate to and a story to inspire and remember you would be disappointed.The first half of the movie is way too long in setting up the premise, you don't realize what the movie turns out to be until the second half making me feel like the first half consisted of too many irrelevant details and was way too long. By the time the movie picks up pace you're already tired. I found myself skipping every thirty seconds towards the end.Secondly, a great movie should leave you with a positive feeling, either a feeling of hope or inspiration or if neither of those are possible atleast the satisfaction of having had a good laugh. This movie does none of that, it leaves you with a feeling of despair and hopelessness. Sadly that is what passes for art these days.There were some good parts about the movie, such as the acting was top-notch especially from the sister. Cinematography was good too but the movie was just not deserving enough to be the best picture of the year.If it wasn't so highly rated I would've given it a 6/10 but giving it a 4 to bring the rating down to what it should get."
PARASITE,19 September 2019,9/10,"Just as a flatworm or a tapeworm enters the human body unnoticed, stay in the stomach and starts multiplying to damage the human internal system, a poor family becomes a parasite to a rich peaceful family.The concept of humans being parasites is superbly told through incredible cinematography, editing and background score."
PARASITE,25 May 2020,9/10,Parasite is the best film I have seen in a while. I am so glad that It has won numerous awards. No many films expose the inequality among social classes and climate change.
PARASITE,22 September 2020,1/10,"The most grotesque movie of the Oscar awarded movies I've ever seen...Don't fall into that ""I'm sophisticated because I watch Korean movies"" trap"
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"I just this for the second time in cinemas and I loved it just as much as the first time. I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films.The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet.
Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that.The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing.I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching.
This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,5/10,"Korean satire about class differences turns into working class slapstick and pointless violence, that is, pointless relative to the point of the satire. The underlying dynamic is contemptuous of the poor and working class, and ends with a phony working class dream, under the guise of family. The last half or so of the film drags."
PARASITE,9 August 2019,7/10,"I gave 7 for this movie. I dont like the ending they killed each others. Really bad for reflection, why not they helping each others by buying 1 apartment and live ever after.. But its like a normal live we lived today..
Poor and rich
Good and bad
Loved and hated"
PARASITE,13 March 2020,8/10,"I liked the film, to see a Korean film gain recognition is a breath of fresh air, South Korea is mainly known for its K-dramas not for niche films like this. The films mix of comedy and horror keeps you glued, and there's no clear protagonist and antagonist. Had a great time"
PARASITE,19 September 2021,7/10,Ok I get it. It was original. Foreign films often get more attention from film critics just because they're foreign. There were some truly original thoughts in the plot. Some parts were comical. Some were more graphic than a real horror movie.Most importantly what the hell happened to the love affair between the tutor & student?? That was never addressed.There were several parts that had no relevance even later in the film.
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,This movie is everything....i wish i could give more than 10
PARASITE,15 November 2020,9/10,"I get it. The film's good. Very good. Best picture amongst english speaking films???? Why??????? Fine. Let it win the best film in the foreign film category. Some weird political shenanigans going on there. ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"". The film, even with subtitles, keeps you immersed and forgetting that ""time has flown by"" which you want from a cleverly crafted movie. The film gently builds to an almighty OMG. What else could you want??. Well done to everyone involved in the movie."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"You have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,5/10,"There was no need for the bloodbath ending. All of the film's points could have been made without it. A 10 review until then,"
PARASITE,16 August 2020,7/10,"A poor family cons a rich family into having them in their home.Let me start of that is an OK film for reasons mentioned in other reviews.
However I just don't grasp why people find it a masterpiece. Also I don't like slapstick and 'pretending comedy' (comedy where the character is someone they're not and constantly worried being found out)It does not really highlight the self-destructive nature of the poor parasites:
Bad habits, lazyness, naivety, drinking, smoking.Instead we just see some stupid decisions and it tries to make you feel 'sorry for them'?
If they kept the jobs they got - with hard work - surely they wouldn't been living in that basement no more.The poor would be better suited with some hard talk rather than your fake pity. Work hard, don't smoke & drink and remove your bad habits.It ain't got integrity and it's virtue signaling for 10/10 reviewers, right?"
PARASITE,9 November 2019,10/10,"PARASITE
Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner.
Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo.
The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller.
Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,4/10,"This movie has one excellent idea and one clever twist. Cinematography was great and the overall setting ambitious. Yet, it seems quite overrated. Attempted allegory about capitalism is rather obvious. The movie lacks true emotions and feels forced. There is no character development or subtle interactions between characters. I felt disconnected with the main characters which made the movie boring despite the plot-driven concept."
PARASITE,30 January 2021,5/10,"Here is why I think this movie is overrated:
The characters are unconvincing. Given that they all have an eye for exploiting other people for money, how did they become so poor in the first place, unless there was some kind of sudden divine inspiration? And is uncouth behavior all the working class would like to achieve once given the opportunity to become rich?Although the movie seems to be compassionate with the poor as a first impression, it does the au contraire from a class perspective. The naive and gullible rich are defrauded by the covetous poor! Shouldn't be like, the rich are covetous so they have become rich?The acting is mediocre if not bad compared to other Korean movies such as Handmaiden or 3-iron.All in all, it is a so-so movie which nobody will lose anything if not watches."
PARASITE,4 June 2020,10/10,"Rarely this kind of movies are made.. From the moment it starts to the finish, you won't move an inch... Direction, storyline, acting everything is mind blowing"
PARASITE,29 September 2019,9/10,"Wow... This movie was a masterpiece. Acts, scenes, music, shocking accidents and specially difference between poor people and rich... I always remember this movie. It made me to think about Shop Lifters movie. Thank u all agents. Remarkable movie 👌"
PARASITE,2 January 2020,5/10,"I watched the film without any knowledge of anyone's critic or rating. I got into the interesting plot of the beginning with much more curiosity for the direction it could drive me to. However, I was disapointed when blood began to flow everywhere unnecessarily, without serving any purpose. I am not a Tarantino's fan, that's for sure. In the end I could not realize if class struggle or social inequality aspects of our society should be told on screen in such a confusing way. Or was it simply a flat thriller? I did not quite get it. Surely overrated though."
PARASITE,1 May 2020,1/10,This movie was predictable and boring... I don't get all of the fuss at all
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"The first half hour is promising. Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult."
PARASITE,17 October 2019,6/10,"Cinematographically really an awesome film, great actors, storytelling, gripping. But maybe it´s only me, I can´t make out a plot that ties all together, unfortunately. So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,7/10,"As far as I know people in South Korea do not have that kind of openspoken relationship, using swearwords and sexual language.
All in all it's an ok movie but as said not very realistic even for being a filmed drama/comedy/thriller.Do NOT understand the hype."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,9/10,"After watching Parasite, it's hard to describe what I felt when ""Kevin"" finished writing the letter for his father. The film itself is entertaining to watch, it keeps you thinking and when you look for the deeper meaning within, you find a hard theme to display on a screen yet done brilliantly in Parasite.
In my opinion the movie is a direct metaphor for dreams, and even for the concept of the ""American Dream"". In the film, the ""Kim"" family is struggling from the beginning, they have dreams, especially Ki-Woo (Kevin) and his sister (Ki-Jeong) to go to college. When Kevin heads out to his job interview with the Parks, he tells his family that he doesn't think of the forgery of the documents as a crime. He is just getting these documents before time, because he will go to college. His sister also seems like she wanted to go to college and seems frustrated that she couldn't because of their situation. At the end of the film, Kevin imagines himself overcoming and finally having money after he went to college. He then would be able to buy the house where his dad would still be trapped in the basement room. The sad part about this is that Kevin really thinks he will be able to save his father, but because of what has happened, he won't be able to.
An interesting metaphor used inside the film is how the levels in the different houses represent the social classes. For example, to get to the Park's house the Kims had to walk up a hill, and to get back to their house they had to walk back down a long way. Even inside the Park's house this can be seen with the hidden basement room, in which one of the ""parasites"" lives.
The film for me started out almost as a comedy, all of the sequence in which the family works together to fire the Park's workers in order for them to be hired is great and I really had fun watching it. Where it all changes is when the two ""parasites"" face off against each other to stay on the surface (literally and figuratively), while the losers are thrown back inside the basement. From this point the whole movie changes dramatically and it all goes downhill, as represented by the flooding of their apartment. What really seems interesting to me is how when the Parks were at their highest point; dining and drinking acting like they own the place is when their downfall begins. This probably represents how in many cases the social class lines are set and those below don't belong above.
Mr. Parker is the one who is above all the others, he is the man of the house. In two occasions Mr. Kim tells Parker that he loves his wife, to which the first time Mr. Parker responds, ""we'll call it love"". This probably shows that in truth he doesn't love her and the only thing that he really loves is well, money and power. In an intimate scene between the two, at a point Mr. Parker looks even uncomfortable adding more to why I believe he doesn't love her at all.
When the Kims first meet the Parks they think between themselves that they are nice people and look at them as their equals. This all changes in the scene where they become trapped underneath the table and overhear Mr. Park telling his wife how Mr. Kim smells like radishes with great disgust, as if he weren't even human at all. This greatly upsets Mr. Kim, as if this smell makes him less than them. Later, this explains the reason for him killing Mr. Park in the final act of the film.
Overall, the film is complete and a realistic portrait of a struggle between classes and a commentary on how not everyone can accomplish their dreams because of how our society is built. It has various moods that I honestly really liked, from the comedic, to the dark and psycho parts of the film. The thing that this film has made me think the most about though, is the dreams part, because that can come like a brick to the face, to know that what you want the most in the world might not come to you."
PARASITE,9 October 2019,9/10,"This is one of my favorite movies of the year. The wonderful director is back at ít again with another Korean film. And this film is certainly up to his standards.First, I'm gonna go mention everything good about this movie.The cinematography is beautiful. The colors look mesmerizing throughout the whole runtime. They manage to make even simple dialogue scenes interesting with complex camera movements and angles. The color palette perfectly matches the moods of the scenes.The acting is mostly pretty good from all actors involved. The dialogue and characters are well-written, memorable and compelling. It's extremely well-directed. The locations feel realistic and like their a character.The suspenseful scenes are well-made and executed. They're suspenseful and you sit on the edge of your seat. The montages where multiple are happening are well-edited. You know what's going on since it's been recently established. The editing is fun and fresh.It manages to both thrilling, scary and funny without any of them ruining the others. The suspenseful parts are suspenseful, and the comedy is placed at inappropriate parts. The music choices and score match the scenes they're in perfectly and they never feel out of place.The scary parts are well-executed and photographed and they're genuinely suspenseful. It never felt forced or misplaced. There is, of course, no comedy randomly placed in the middle of a tense scene like there is in most modern-day movies.I don't think there is a single thing about this movie I dislike. It is by far my favorite movie of the year. This is a movie everyone would enjoy. I don't think there's a single person I wouldn't recommend this to."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,This isn't a feel-good movie. It is is the cold harsh reality of whatever the movie's message was. I was too grasped on the story itself to see the bigger picture. That could be the message itself. It really took my perspective of life and twisted it.
PARASITE,29 July 2021,10/10,"I can't get over how it ended, everything comes at a cost every decision has its consequence. It's dark realistic thrilling and sometimes funny. This fits to many different genres."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,7/10,"The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,8/10,"This is one of the best films of 2019. It's intense, satirical and emotional without ever feeling disjointed. The film can literally turn on a dime from being hilarious to being suspenseful and it feels seamless. The acting is incredible and the films direction is excellent. The conclusion is very emotional."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,6/10,"This movie is not as it got of credit. It doesn't deserve an Oscar. It's a very simple movie with a simple story and no extra efforts, effects or performance were there. 6 is its max"
PARASITE,18 January 2020,10/10,For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.
PARASITE,22 January 2020,9/10,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,7/10,"Parasite movie has its elements of comedy , drama and thrilling but not satisfying at the end because
It takes a dark turn at the end which was still nice if the production was going to end that way ...
But No
It takes another dark turn which was in my opinion bad and I disliked it because you can messed up a great movie by ruining its ending
Many people liked it and also decided to give this movie an academy award for best picture
But nah.. I didn't get it..
So good movie to watch but at the end it gets too depressing to watch the ending
No justice done there."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,9/10,"Wow this is a masterpiece. One of the best films of 2019. Boon crafted such a beautiful world, with writing that seamlessly blends together with every scene."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a monumental picture that changed the perception of foreign films forever. It was less of a film, and more of an experience. Bong Joon-ho has created yet another masterpiece that will never leave your mind. Everyday you learn new things and immaculate details about the film that you never noticed, such as his use of lines throughout the film to represent the split in class and ""crossing the line"". His attention to detail is a huge factor in why this movie is so beautiful, but his knowledge of Korean culture and social class is what really makes this film outstanding. Knowing that the film is an accurate representation of the class structure in Korea is a huge eye-opener to those from other countries.The greatest part about this film though, is that it speaks to everyone in some way. To Koreans and even other parts of Asia, it's great Asian representation in the media and especially the film industry, considering how well it did. To film lovers, it's a combination of immaculate details and concepts put together in beautiful shots and scripts. To other viewers, it's a great tragic/comedy/thriller full of many twists and turns, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Parasite connects many different people and cultures through marvellous story telling. Their strive for what could possibly be seen as the ""American Dream"" certainly connects to a younger audience who have the same goals; Go to a great school, get a well-paying job, get rich and start a family. Teens who have been raised to strive for those same goals in life (including myself) can relate to their struggles to reach that goal, which is almost impossible. The acting in this film is impeccable. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik are such a powerful duo and bring light to their characters. Yet again, the performance by Kang-Ho Song is outstanding. His exemplary portrayal of a Korean father trying to take care of a struggling family while saving face is accurate and beautifully done.Parasite is exactly like it's name. It catches you off guard, infects your brain and never leaves it. This film is something that's never been done before. Breaking records, shaking up the film community and making a huge name for itself. Parasite has completely changed the game and set a huge bar not only for future korean films, but for future films in general. Bong Joon-ho is a master of his craft and I cannot wait for his next film."
PARASITE,9 November 2020,9/10,"Parasite is one of the few films that managed to breakout into mainstream US, managing to score itself a well deserved Best Picture at the Oscar's, being the first film entirely in Korean (the first movie to not be English), to do so.Parasite revolves around one single theme: Classism. Not only is the film a stunning visuals masterpiece, but with each minute the movie sets itself up for the incoming climax, one you won't be prepared for, nearly a twist ending that we all had an inkling was coming.Parasite's clear depiction of classism between the working class and the rich is well portrayed and serves as a stellar must-watch. It's metaphors and foreshadowing will leave you questioning everything you already knew about the wealthy."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,9/10,"Without spoiling anything, I'll say that this movie cannot just be watched. It has to be felt. The characters are all relatable in a very discomforting way, which is what makes this movie so intensely sad and beautiful. A great peek into an economic struggles that is often left unseen but might now be more relevant than ever."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,9/10,"I admit I wouldn't have gone to see a subtitled movie if it hadn't won Best Picture. Don't normally enjoy reading movies. This movie was worth it! Got drawn in immediately with the characters and stayed enrapt as the plot developed. No dull moments for sure. Did make me think about class and how the haves and the have nots lead parallel lives, with the haves not really ""getting"" the have nots. Loved this movie!"
PARASITE,26 March 2020,6/10,"The movie is mainly about upper class & working class people & a clash between them...So,we can say that the movie is good but not so good to get 10 out of 10..The story is pretty simple...But the movie can't be movie of the decade or can't get 10 out of 10 because there are also many movie about the same fact...So good but overrated..."
PARASITE,19 March 2020,8/10,This is not a professional review. I just have a question. Why are rich people in movies so easy to cheat? For irony?
PARASITE,6 June 2020,9/10,"Never before have I seen a film that's funny, intelligent, nerve-wracking and thought-provoking at the same time. I wondered into the cinema not knowing what to expect; I left with an urgent desire to learn *everything* about Korean cinema. ""Parasite"" is a must-see."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,9/10,"One side is a flooded room, and the other is a birthday party.
On one side is a cold and hard gymnasium, on the other is a luxurious and soft back garden.
Money is an iron, ironing everything.
They rubbed their nets, lived in the basement, and used any means to get a job.
When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst yet, there are even more miserable.
If you are rich, you must be richer than you; if you are poor, you must be poorer than you.
The gap between rich and poor is like countless walls, dividing people into three, six, and nine.
This wall stands upright despite the wind, the sun and the rain.
The Park couple looked silly, but they are still getting richer;
Jin Jize's family is brilliant, but still can't turn over.
You think you have gotten a good job and got a good salary, and you got rid of the status of poverty. In fact, it is still a thousand miles away.
You can wash off the sweaty smell of clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has been integrated into the blood.
You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone's basement.
They are bugs, so they have a hard life;
They are bugs, so they ca n't kill them"
PARASITE,6 April 2020,10/10,"I went to see Parasite in the cinemas... TWICE. This film is brilliant. It's funny in the most witty yet realistic way possible. It's deeply tragic. It's terrifying when you least expect it. Parasite leads you to believe that it's one thing, and suddenly transforms into another. It's a complete masterpiece. The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious. A repeat viewing is perhaps even more satisfying than the first, knowing what's THERE before it is revealed is just... a feeling I can't explain. It's a must watch. Not to be missed."
PARASITE,30 April 2020,9/10,"A movie worth watching... comedy, drama and thriller combination with a twist ending."
PARASITE,11 May 2020,10/10,A combination of intense drama and dark comedy. Will definitely keep you entertained trough out the movie.
PARASITE,4 June 2020,8/10,"I believe the director should have kept this movie light hearted and funny despite the serious topic at hand, notably that of inequalities in South Korea. The final 50 min were not all that good in my opinion, and the (violent) behavior of some of the main protagonists defies logic. It's probably deserving of all the accolades because no better movie was released in 2019. I think Shoplifters (2018 palmes d'or) is as deserving if not a better picture than Parasite."
PARASITE,5 August 2020,10/10,"As the title suggests, Parasite is my all time favorite film. Bong's original screenplay is one of the freshest and most original ideas I've ever seen/heard of. The idea of a poor family leeching off of a rich family by pretending to be qualified is brilliant. There truly has not been any other film like parasite and I think it should be appreciated as such. The characters and dialogue throughout the film strike as very realistic which is why everything that happens during the flick strikes the viewers very hard. The ending left me in a very depressed state and changed my view of the world a bit. It helped me realize of privilege and how the world just isn't that great. Upon thinking about the film later, I also wondered what the movie would've been like in the Kims' perspective. I believe this movie is one of the greatest ever made, and is an instant classic"
PARASITE,25 June 2020,10/10,"One of those movies you can't look away from. I have watched it three times and it was equally enjoyable each time. Absolutely beautiful shot and edited, the writing and acting is excellent. The movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat every second of it and take turns that you never saw coming. One of the best of the decade."
PARASITE,29 July 2020,3/10,"I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper/more groundbreaking than it actually is. It has the plot of a rom-com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary. Wow! Class differences exist! Thanks Bong Joon-ho for enlightening me.Just because you've successfully deciphered what the director/writer sought to convey doesn't mean he's necessarily saying anything profound. People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that, despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film, its significance remains painfully surface-level.I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves--and it's fitting. During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events, I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture (alongside the universal acclaim).Well, after the former housekeeper's return, the stupidity that ensues (yes--that moment and the very end inclusive) signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise. However, it's here where the film starts to break down for me.We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening. That's ok for some time, for some genres, but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy. The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to. And on top of it, I genuinely don't care what happens to any of these people (save a tinge of regret for Mr. Park's taking a knife to the chest), I find it impossible that the tutor-son could survive two (2) skull-crushing throws of a rock to the head, and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr. Kim committing the murder in the first place, even given the heat of the moment and his motivations.I was almost peer-pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I've seen none so low as mine, but 3 just feels right. Something unconnected that I need to insert; the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn't even there for me either. It's smirk-with-one-corner-of-the-mouth funny throughout, but never really hilarious. It's prettiness is its strongest feature and to say otherwise is contrived."
PARASITE,28 August 2021,8/10,Bomb Movie! Should watch at least once. Very metaphorical and tragic. Solid 8 in my opinion.
PARASITE,2 April 2021,10/10,"I'd read the great reviews but didn't know what to expect going into this and it just completely blew me away, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Highly recommend!!"
PARASITE,30 June 2021,6/10,"Very well made film. It was very thrilling and each scene had you wondering what was coming next. The ending with the violence was disproportionate to the very well crafted first 3/4s off the film. After it has you feeling a bit disturbed, well made but the ending was too violent for good taste."
PARASITE,1 November 2021,10/10,"Awesome! First I was skeptical cause it wasnt an english movie. Then I thought! Why not watch it, it has high ratings. And I have been watching some real bad hollywood /American movies lately.Watch it indeed! You will be entertained, its a good movie and with good gore material! A mix of emotions will linger on with you long after the movie ends."
PARASITE,28 September 2021,1/10,"So much overrated
This movie doesn't worth more than 5 stars
I don't understand people who liked it , it has nothing to do with dark comedy , its all boring."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,7/10,"My impressions are following:
It is quite dragged. (Despite being curious about how everything is gonna end we had to stop and watch the last 30ish minutes of the movie the next day. I was not sleepy, just fed up with watching it.)The major flaw in the plot, as I see it, is that 4 extremely capable and adaptable people are living in an basement, starving and struggling to survive. Another thing is that the husband of the first housekeeper would have died starving in the bunker, without even attempting to go out and get himself some food, despite the fact he was not locked in, if his wife had not showed up after many days to check up on him, finding him all weak and hungry. And how did Chung-sook manage to clear all the mess so that the Parks did not notice anything if not when they arrived then when they woke up in the morning?The movie has quite a suspenseful plot, nicely done, but asides from that it is just not entertaining enough. And here I found myself divided, on one side really wanting to see what is going to happen, and on the other side just dying from boredom because despite of all of the happenings it is simply just not entertaining.As for the cinematography, I liked the movie. It is nicely filmed, nothing spectacular, but fitting and suitable to the plot. I especially liked the flood scene when Ki-jeong is sitting on the toilet, that was hyper-realistic and remarkable.Altogether, okayish, I would give it a 7-star rating."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"Think of all movie genres you can think of and you will find a piece of everything in this movie.
This is unpredictable... this will intense. This will make you keep guessing and then you will be like wtf cuz none of your guesses would be right. This is everything."
PARASITE,2 April 2020,1/10,"One of the great time waster of all times , this movie never fulfilled the expectations , the reason why I wasted my time on this movie coz of Oscars but I never find anything special in this movie , many hundred movies must be rated much higher than this movie."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,9/10,Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie
PARASITE,2 January 2020,,"Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period."
PARASITE,11 March 2021,9/10,"A magnificent black comedy by Bong Joon. Parasite is about class difference, greed and a lot of other things all wrapped into one. A highly engaging film, perfectly written and masterfully directed. It deserves all the awards it has received. 9/10"
PARASITE,18 June 2021,1/10,I started watching this but I couldn't finish it. This says something because I am retired and I don't have much to do. Totally appalling characters. Even if there is a story I don't care because I couldn't care less about the characters. I wonder why it got distinctions. Every other Korean film I watched is better than this. In fact some of them were great.
PARASITE,8 January 2020,6/10,"There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"If Parasite would have come 5-6 years ago, it would have walked out of the Dolby Theater with just a single win in the foreign category and it would have burned my heart. I mean if you can't go beyond that cliched appreciation (of the best foreign-language film), despite touching such high artistic note of story-telling. And that too, just because of a mild language barrier and the politically driven format of Academy and other award shows, as a matter of fact."
PARASITE,22 November 2021,9/10,"Each time I watched Parasite I picked up something new
Movie will grip you and keep hold of you until the end. Very deep, meaningful story of 2 Korean families at near opposite ends of sociology-economic spectrum. Amazing how much they have in common, however their differences are brought to life by the director in painful scenes, imagery, and tons of symbolism.A must watch."
PARASITE,28 March 2020,5/10,"Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies."
PARASITE,13 December 2019,9/10,"The hype around Parasite has been huge, and the more i read about it, the more i wanted to see it. A couple of my friends had seen it and knowing they know what i like, urged me not to wait until Feb for its UK Release, but to try and see a preview. Luckily enough, there was a preview at Curzon Mayfair in London this week with director and lead actor introducing it and i managed get a ticket. I
can safely say its the best money i have ever invested in watching a film.The best way to see this is not to know anything about it and try to avoid the spoilers which i managed to do. The Tag line on the poster ""act like you own the place"" had me intrigued, but having seen the film, it makes perfect sense.Its basically a home invasion movie that has a lot of laughs at the start but then turns very dark. The story is very cleverly told and all the cast act their socks off. There are some real surprises/shocks along the way, but all make the film more entertaining.Can clearly see why it won the Palme D'or at Cannes, ive seen nothing like it, its in my top 3 of the year and i cannot wait to see it again. Have to say its best to see with a big crowd, as the laughs and gasps that come along the way make it even more enjoyable."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,6/10,"I sat down with great expectations. I ended up disappointed. The first hour is absolutely cracking and whilst the plot is very predictable it plays out beautifully with some good comedic lines.The movie then dries up a little and it feels like it's lost its mojo before it then goes BANG!Bang good or bang bad will be up to the individual as to how much escapism you can tolerate and how many holes you are willing to gloss over.For me it was bang bad however I have also watched the Irishman recently so compared to that crock this is like a masterpiece!Was it worth a watch? Yes. Would I pay at the cinema again? Definitely not!
The moral of the story is that in Hollywood we cannot trust!"
PARASITE,20 January 2020,10/10,This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars
PARASITE,10 February 2020,,"I was basically rooting for no characters in this film; why would anyone?! There were moments when the family was almost exposed which I guess added some tension but if they got caught, oh well.... Best Picture?, wow."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,6/10,"What a weird movie! Parasite has some interesting things going on, it's a psychological thriller with elements of Stephen King's Misery, but then it also has self reflecting internal monologues that remind me of Trainspotting."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,"Finishing this movie left me in AWE. Everything from the transition from a lighthearted introduction to a thriller drama, the directing, the intricate storyline (notice how connected everything is - really shows great scriptwriting), the reversal of roles and even the lumming existence of reality...I could go on for HOURS. To keep a long story short, this movie was SPECTACULAR. Do not shy away from this movie. The Academy has done something right."
PARASITE,15 May 2021,10/10,"One of the best movies ever made. Period.Everything is just a masterpiece here: plot, directing, camera work, character development.A must watch DEEP movie."
PARASITE,3 May 2021,7/10,Its a little overrated. 7.5/10. Not bad not so good.
PARASITE,22 March 2020,1/10,"We people watch movies to entertain ourselves. But this movie, 'Parasite' is very depressing. It has exploited the topic of poverty. The end makes us feel sad.Give it a pass if you don't want to get depressed."
PARASITE,4 August 2019,10/10,"I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and I have to say, the film is still in my head. The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!).This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film).""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists.The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist.On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation.The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before.Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences. It is a film that focuses on poverty, despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours. The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Therefore, Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed.""Parasite"" is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other. This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end, it's completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him. This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema, and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general. If not, then Hollywood is completely out of control."
PARASITE,17 December 2019,10/10,"Damn you south Korea. You're going through one movie after another. Korean movies are a class movie. After watching this movie, I was in the house for about 3 weeks. They can make such a movie. How natural is the act of one man. After the end of the movie many questions were coming to the head. Who is the parasite ???"
PARASITE,29 March 2020,10/10,"The movie was excellent. It covered all the genres that you can think about, starting from comedy, ending with horror and if that's not all, add a naughty scene in there as well.While watching, my emotions changed along with the movie, at first I showed a lot of sympathy for the family, then I started to hate them a little bit because of their ""parasite"" mentality, then again I wasn't happy with the Parks since they were looking down on the poor.Another thing I really enjoyed about the end is that it was shown from two sides - from the rich and poor perspective. For the poor the big rain was devastating, however the rich enjoyed it since they can have have such a nice weather for the birthday party.Brilliant movie!"
PARASITE,31 January 2020,9/10,You will experience twist after twist while watching this movie. It contains very mild but catchy dark humour. Some scenes will create cold waves inside your lumbar spine. You will be thinking the ways to get rid of the troubles along with the characters of the movie.
PARASITE,6 June 2020,7/10,"7.5 = very good movie (for me 8+ is excellent)+ Well shot movie
+ Good cast
+ good dialogue
+ 'Memorable epilogue'
+ Some good Tarantino like momentsCliched horror/thriller 'slasher' finale with the typical horror movie music. Not original but suprising nonetheless.Could have developed characters slightly better."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,1/10,"It is unclear what the main message of the film is and who should be called ""Parasite."" As the film constantly makes us feel sorry for the poor family, let us first suppose that the rich family members are considered as parasites, and we should seriously consider the problem of inequality in our society. But no, the dad was hard-working, creating jobs, spending all his available time and money with his family. The man did not abuse his employees, he did not use cheap labor, did not force anybody to work in unhealthy conditions getting huge profit in his pocket. Similarly, the mom was trying to find the best teachers available to get their kids educated, and she treated everybody well. If they had not had servants, probably the dad would have not been able to dedicate as much time to his job and not to forget about his family.On the other hand, the poor family got their positions by cheating. Should they be viewed as parasites then? I don't also think so. They continued to work hard despite all the difficulties they met. They get their job done: the car was clean and driven smoothly, the favorite dishes were cooked, so what's the problem? Who are we supposed to like or dislike, what is the question the filmmakers arise?Also, the movie has some problems with the plot and redundant scenes. It is unclear how a family who lived in a filthy apartment, was not able even to fold boxes became a group of good servants for an upper-class family by doing so naive and straightforward tricks. Why did the director even decide to introduce the scene when they were getting less money because they were not able to fold boxes? What does it add to the film except for the plot holes? He could have just portrayed them as diligent but poor people so that they could have perceived as more positive characters."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,,"Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"
PARASITE,5 January 2020,9/10,"I felt the same way as when watcjing Knives Out. Wondering the whole time what's gonna happen next? Never a dull moment. And the story unfolds at a good pace. I felt slightly uncomfortable the whole time. But not too much that I didn't want to finish watching it.
I like movies that allow me to watch and allow it to tell me the story as it unfolds. This did that. Great movie."
PARASITE,29 October 2019,9/10,"I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation.
Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, ""Parasite"" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,10/10,"I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!"
PARASITE,16 August 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho strikes again with this modern art masterpiece, this movie literally blew my mind with its great combination of comedy and tragedy.
One of the finest, perfect, enjoyable movies of this decade, Thanks to Bong Joon-ho and thanks to the seventh art who allows us to witness such beauty like this."
PARASITE,21 November 2020,10/10,Even reading captions did not take anything away from me enjoying this movie thoroughly! The twist and turns and bitter ironies! The one moment in the timeline that flipped everything. One minute conning your way into good fortune to doing something completely stupid and turning good fortune to an absolute nightmare.
PARASITE,26 November 2020,2/10,"There are some movies that move slowly and this is necessary for the subject, the tone of the film, the development of the characters and the story. This is not one of them. The biggest problem ist the first part, when the destitute family, person per person, starts to work for the rich family and as in most social dramas, the differences of living and working are shown. This takes one long hour. I guess the intention was to film it in a comedic way and it is clear from the beginning that there will be changes. Unfortunately this hour is just very boring and not at all funny. I had to stop watching and resume on another day. If this part would have been condensed to 20 minutes - fine. After the first hour things change in tone and the expectation that the already established critique of social differences in the country (and the one solution of maybe marrying up, which stays a dream) will be dealt with more openly are confirmed. The only surprising element is the how - the very fast developing escalation of violence. At the end we again see the dream of the boy to make money, climb the social ladder and rescue his father - which of course will stay a dream. So the three parts of the movie are very conventional, but they don't work together very well."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,10/10,Loved the story n all casting. Beautiful pictures. Well descrption of social classes and change on human mind
PARASITE,12 January 2021,10/10,"Watch it...its a classic and brilliantly done, I watched it 8 times after the first..."
PARASITE,10 September 2019,2/10,This is not a good film at all..every thing on this file is wrong..at least people do bad things do win..what the point writer want to prove. so poor movie. i rate this as 2/10
PARASITE,10 August 2019,9/10,"This is the best film of 2019 so far for Korean cinema. Casting was superb with good story.
I gave it 8 because poor family didn't look poor and also for the last part where his son become successful in a minute.
Overall its a good film to watch.
Enjoy Watching...."
PARASITE,24 July 2020,3/10,This movie is good but it's a bit overrated. There are more better movies than this to watch
PARASITE,22 January 2020,9/10,"Hilarious at times, weird, with some unexpected plot twists. Shows that whether you are rich or poor, the life you lead is really is just as futile........update: Yessss I am so happy that it has now won an oscar for best movie ! Well deserved!"
PARASITE,9 August 2020,9/10,"If you want a thought-provoking movie that will stick with you for hours (or days), then Parasite is the movie for you. Most movies have a clear division between the protagonist and antagonist. You root for one and despise the other, because that's what we've been groomed to do for our entire lives - but what if the divide weren't so clear? Classism is an age-old separation that has been symbolized in literature and television for years and years. The ""good guy"" is wealthy, and the ""bad guy"" is poor, or vice versa. That isn't always how it works in real life, and Parasite strives to exemplify that.I would be gravely mistaken if I didn't mention the phenomenal acting and breathtaking cinematography that takes place in Parasite. The tension that begins to build about halfway through the movie is palatable, and will make your stomach knot. I recommend going into this movie with no spoilers and very little prior knowledge of the film, as it'll make the experience that much better.I've seen a lot of 3-7 star reviews claiming that they don't ""get the film"", and that it is over-hyped. You need to be able to look past the superficial to understand this film. Good and bad are obsolete, and classist stereotypes are shattered into pieces. Go into this film with an open mind and an agreement to think past what you see on the screen. There is a lot of symbolism and reading between the lines in this film, and to fully understand it, you'll need a good hour to think after the film. As you're laying in bed, wondering what the hell you just saw on screen, it'll all start piecing together in your brain. That's what makes a good film, and Parasite is one of the best I've seen this year."
PARASITE,9 November 2019,9/10,"Where must I start .. is it a drama ? Horror ? Thriller ? Well let's say it's everything and it is true . The director Mr Bong join-ho has given is everything his direction with spectacular visuals makes it looks artistic, the lightings for each shot and frame is phenomenal also the pace of the movie and how the movie gets into next gear and the twist it's all brilliantly done .. This movie is a satire and the line that society has drawn between rich and poor is well narrated through eyes of both the group .. movie is very metaphorical in different acts and it also adds humor excellently .."
PARASITE,10 October 2019,10/10,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."
PARASITE,2 November 2019,10/10,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."
PARASITE,2 September 2020,10/10,"Portrait of a society. Of a World with a lot of humans that can be capable of doing whatever they can tu only SURVIVE. The analysis of a parasite in relation with the human is impecable. Details of the director carefully taken, like the Morse code, the kid being a Indian, the terror scenes strongly built up to make you scream from inside converge great in this movie. Comparison of a simple insect that that moves with his tiny arms and legs eating, evolving, wasting resources till it can't no more. Humans are a weir race and with this movie we can FULLY Understand a reality that lives."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,8/10,Unique movie for me. It's a bunch of genres in one sorta. I like how a lot of things in the beginning came back around later in the film.
PARASITE,27 April 2020,9/10,"I used to think this movie is a tragedy but on a second watch I realised it's a  comedy. Clearly one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best thrillers of all time. The movie is very intelligent and very captivating. The pacing is very dynamic and the script is brilliant. The movie look beautifull, from production design to directing and cinematography everything was stunning. The set design express the social commentary about the difference between classes in very subtle and intelligent way. The ending was surprising in a good way."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,1/10,"I don't have time to write about this sham of a movie. I've already wasted enough time watching it. the movie had no message, no lesson..just bunch of liars and criminals. If the Korean culture is like that then I am definitely steering clear.
I have no idea why everyone around me seems to love this movie. What happened to the world?"
PARASITE,10 September 2020,10/10,"First I rated this movie 8. Then I changed it to a 9 after reading an informative review for those of us who did not quite understand the second half of the movie. After a while it sunk in: This movie is a freaking piece of art. The way it changes half way from an entertaining and comfortable adventure-like plot to a shocking crime scene that enlightens issues related to social layers and class differences, had me consufed at first. But it was deffinately a necessity not to become «just another movie», but one of its kind. This production is unique."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,This movie show's that you don't need a lot of money to create a good movie just talent needed the best movie of the 2019 absolutely just watch it if my review doesn't convince you mabye 4 oscars awards can
PARASITE,22 February 2020,7/10,"When I watched this film I was impressed and I really liked it, but I wasn't blown away. I left after seeing it thinking ""yeah, I get it,"" but after sleeping on it I really found myself understanding the film properly. The way it's written is exceptional, and I'd never seen anything quite like it; the seamless jumps between genre really caught me off guard. I never knew what to expect, and going into the film without knowing a thing about it, I was pretty shocked. From comedy to thriller, I was on the edge of my seat.
The thing that really sold me on it being a good film, however, was the ending. Sad, hopeful, but ultimately a fantasy. A bitter, bitter fantasy. I mean, what a way to end! I will say, though, that there were about ten times while watching that I was expecting the credits to roll...Ultimately, this probably wouldn't be my first choice when sitting down to watch a movie, nor would I normally choose to go see a film like this is theatres, but boy did I enjoy it! I think everyone should, at some point in their life, see this film, but I don't think everyone will enjoy it."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"This was an amazing film, from the metaphor of the American dream to the tiny details in lighting and cinematography it was wonderful. every scene looked amazing, everything was where it needed to be and the framing was wonderful. i don't believe the son ever managed to buy the Park's house, the distance between the two classes was just too big."
PARASITE,3 March 2021,9/10,"I noticed from the first minute of Bong Joon Ho's Parasite that there was more too it than meets the eye.Every beat of the story is a huge plot turn that you never see coming. There's so much depth to each character that each one feels like an individual puzzle box.Some might be turned off by the Korean dialect, but you're literally going to miss it if you turn away (unless you speak Korean, of course).When you're not looking at the subtitles, your eyes are locked on the amazing visuals and beautiful set design.Trust me, following the subtitles will be the least of your worries.Slightly long-winded, but brilliantly crafted."
PARASITE,30 January 2020,8/10,"'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body
What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances.Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them.kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members.the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making.One evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo. Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -wooMrs. Park's son da - song
He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing
Ki-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she's not one of these and she also enters the house.Kim ki - taek tells his family ""rich people are realy gullible""
The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper. Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to work
It is here that the name of the film becomes a make senseKim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthday
Kim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to Park
Suddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives.
If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film.Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone.Kang ho song's performance as ki - taek is subtle.The acting of kang's physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable.
The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause.
(example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB.
the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)"
PARASITE,3 January 2020,9/10,"A movie with stakes, set ups and payoffs and an engaging plot."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is also a person who uses others to obtain advantage without doing anything in exchange . parasite is about poor family who are trying to get job in rich families home ,the son (kim ki woo ) is english tutor and his sister (ki jung ) art therapist and their parents mother (chung sook ) housekeeper and father (ki-taek) is driver . they are poor family but want to get rich so they fool park family to get this job. parasite is a success story and also winning everyone's heart ,it is also a top prize cannes film festival and best foreign film in golden globes. director bong joon ho is his seventh film and its too good . this movie told us about the ugly , brutal modern life . when someone lives out in the open and others are forced to live in shadow but everyone sucking one another's blood. this movie of director boong joon ho called it ""satirical black comedy thriller movie""so parasite is stunning movie and all characters are wonderful actors."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,7/10,"The acting was great on the part of the con artist family. Mrs Park was just pathetic. Her character was played like she had an IQ of 50. I thought the story line as a whole was clever, but the very end was predictable. I knew exactly where the father Mr Kim went. I didn't like that he stabbed Mr Park. I didn't think that was in character, and it wasn't deserved. The poverty of the other family was not the Parks' fault. Their wealth inequality was just circumstance, and they were at the worst just ignorant. I couldn't root for the poor family because I didn't feel sorry for them. They could have used their wits to make better more honest choices to try and get ahead. Instead they chose to dupe people and take advantage of them. I liked that they showed the son at the end sitting in the apartment saying ""someday"" he will have enough money. A happy ending like the one they teased wouldn't have been fitting."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,8/10,"Story was very unpredictable and giving good messages.
That line impressed me: ""she is kind because she is rich"""
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,"This is essentially the perfect film as it does everything - storytelling, visuals, sound, editing, acting etc. - to perfection.""Parasite"" belongs in the discussion of the greatest films of all-time in my opinion and everyone who appreciates a good film should certainly watch this one.10/10"
PARASITE,19 March 2020,8/10,"To be honest, the family 's three views and one word are difficult to solve. It 's really a problem. Like a parasite, the family sucks in others. Don't say it 's disgusting, even if it 's low. If something goes wrong, you still want to solve the problem by killing people. In the end, your father killed the little girl 's dad. At the end, he was still completely regretful. He did n't lose the little girl. Then this layer of class gaps and gaps that are determined by social status and money need not be portrayed. Such an explicit irony is only ironic. Such a direct description not only does not perfectly show the poverty at the bottom of this society. The destiny of the gap between cheap and social class seems to add to the picture, but it is indeed a masterpiece of the feature film."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,9/10,"Filled with amazing characters, beautiful cinematography, frightening moments, dark humor, and a timeless social message, Parasite succeeds on all counts."
PARASITE,21 May 2020,9/10,"Parasite is a phenomenal film with top notch acting and fantastic direction from Bong Joon-ho, known for the films Snowpiercer and The Host, this movie may be his masterpiece. It contains eccentric and interesting characters, as well as a bizzare plot line that should keep any audience thouroghly entertained throughout. I went in knowing nothing, and this is the best way to watch this movie. The less you know about the plot, the better. It won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and rightfully so, I'd say. The direction is flawless, many characters and subplots weave together to create a beautiful mess of a movie. I love this film, and anyone who loves movies will love it as well. The reason it doesn't recieve a 10 is due to its disjointedness, which seems intentional, though I would have preferred it to be more focused and feel less rushed. This film may have worked better if it was about 30 minutes longer. Anyway, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you haven't already, its sitting on Hulu right now."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,9/10,"This movie is amazing, I love it, the best movie I have watched this year!"
PARASITE,24 June 2020,10/10,"Smart, inciteful, and entertaining...subtly inspirational WOW."
PARASITE,15 May 2020,9/10,"A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying ""wow""."
PARASITE,20 October 2019,10/10,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.It's such a fantastic social commentary."
PARASITE,16 March 2021,10/10,"Joon-Ho Bong has created the best film of 2 centuries, i don't even care about the ratings or anything, this is the best. The suspense of every part after about an hour and 15 in, is so good. The last scene had me crying. This is a must watch, and it's on hulu. Go watch it right now."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,8/10,"No doubt that this is a great film. Great storytelling, wonderful characters and scenes. The build up is slow, but very effective. A lot has been written about this film in all the other reviews so I won't repeat, but one thing that was sticking out for me was the ending. Do we really believe that the father went back into the cellar? Taking the risk he would't be able to get food at all and die? And then, when they moved house, no one lived there, the cupboards and fridge empty for months... How did he survive? And do we believe that he used morse code to contact his son? How does he know that his son would watch? Wouldn't he search a different way to contact him? Call him at night?? And how can the son ever contact his father in the end, saying he should come out and they will meet again? The morse code works one way... So this ending is the only real flaw to this film. It feels constructed and overly romantic. It even spoiled the emotion, whereas I'm pretty certain they thought it was tragical and moving. So, only 8 out of 10 because of the ending. The rest of the film is pretty flawless..."
PARASITE,1 March 2021,10/10,"Wow! Wow! I mean... wow! First time watching it you think it's a black comedy that is a masterpiece! The second time you see the layers beneath, it's structured in a way that makes it soooooooo amazing. Third time, well third time it's just a masterpiece again!"
PARASITE,11 August 2021,1/10,"Trash comedy, trash story, and people are saying that understand the message of different of poor and rich people. I am not here for philosophy class and some leace making guru stuff. I am here for entertainment and goosebumps and this is just overrated trash."
PARASITE,30 March 2021,5/10,"Actually this movie is not that brilliant! It has a good start, but then the plot is just disappointing. The end ruins the whole movie. The occuring violence is a very simple move to finish the messed up plot.And do not expect good acting or realistic characters. It is just overacting."
PARASITE,11 November 2021,10/10,"This movie knocked me the heck out , I watched half the movie with my hand on my mouth , couldn't handle the tension in every scene , the cinematography genius or this crazy plot."
PARASITE,24 September 2021,10/10,"Ok, let's start with why I liked this movie.To be honest, I'm more of a horror, thriller person. I'm a fan of hereditary and Midsommar. But this might be one the movies that changed my cinematic experience forever.Firstly, the plot and story is genius. This movie expands into a realistic yet terrifyingly accurate world. The movie of course is carried on the idea of the treatment of class in our modern day society. The 1st half and 2nd half and two sides on this complex story of a symbiotic relationship. Amazing movie!Highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be surprised at a movie!!"
PARASITE,5 March 2021,7/10,"Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,8/10,"... last year ""they"" came up with ROME : A year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City in the early 1970s. ... now arrives this soap-box genre project .... is the world of cinema and snob film festivals becoming so much inclined towards kitsch box-soaped melo dramas ?"
PARASITE,4 September 2019,10/10,Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..
PARASITE,21 February 2020,4/10,Absolutely nothing special about this movie! But go ahead and have a look!
PARASITE,5 March 2020,4/10,I definitely don't know what all the fuss is all about?! This film does not deserve an Oscar! Just another senseless hype!
PARASITE,21 February 2020,3/10,"I watched this movie during the 3 days, with pauses. It exhausted me really. Such a pain in the ***. It is nothing more than a pale copy of Tarantino's movies, with a plot so unrealistic and boring. The acting was awful too. The only decent things about this movie was a solid camera and photography, as well as the scenography. I really cannot understand all the fuss, the hype and Oscars won."
PARASITE,3 August 2021,10/10,"But its a must watch movie , amazing. In the middle it gets predictable and then get better and more suspense u stay at the edge of ur seat."
PARASITE,7 January 2020,5/10,"Is the fact that people who voted for it to win the Cannes film festival award and those who gave it anything higher than a 7/10 on this platform, actually exist.A family living below the poverty line in a 1st world nation whose kids couldn't pass the national exams or fold a pizza box would suddenly become world class con artistes overnight infiltrating a wealthy family? And when things took a dark turn, we the audience are supposed to feel sorry for them, just because they are poor, nevermind their greed, pride and total lack of character?Please don't insult our intelligence, at least 1 out of 3 accounts here are real and still give honest review."
PARASITE,9 March 2020,7/10,"I had high expectations given the raving reviews here. But I have to say, I was disappointed. Fair enough, it is a decent movie with an original plot, but certainly not one of the best films of all time. Not by a long shot."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,I had no expectations for this film nor did I know anything about it besides that it won the Oscar for best film. I was BLOWN AWAY! Such a cool looking film and very suspenseful/interesting story. Not something I usually gravitate towards watching but I'm glad I did!
PARASITE,2 March 2021,1/10,"TLDR : Worst movie I have ever seen,without a dobut.Plot:There is a poor and a rich family.The poor family lives in a small apratment somewhere outside of the city,while the rich family lives in a big mansion.The son in the poor family somehow becomes a teacher of the daughter of the rich family,although he is uneducated and not qualified for that job.That simply makes no sense to me.Then he gets the job for his sister,who becomes a psychologist for the rich's family young son,while also not being qualified for the job,and he presents her as Jessica who used to study in America,and not as his sister.The movie becomes pretty predicatble and naive at this point,everybody can realise that they will eventualy get jobs for both their parents and that their goal is to kick the rich family from the house,which is really shallow plot if you ask me.
Then the daughter of the poor family leaves her underwear in the car,what makes the father of the rich family fire the driver,and you guessed it-he hires the father of the poor family as a new driver,although he doesnt have any recommentadions(i don't count fake recommendations here)
And then the poor family founds out that the maid is alergic to peaches,and they get her sick.As a big surprise,the mother of the poor family becomes a new maid.
What a deep movie so far !
As very smart criminals they let the old maid get into the house,and she visits her housban in the basement where he has been living for four years,Yes you have read it correctly,he has been living in the rich's family basement for four years without anybody noticing it.Then the poor family and old maid & her housband get into a fight,instead of cooperating thogether,in order to steal as much money as they can.
At this point I asked myself,can it get more shallow than this ?
Then there is 50-ish minutes of them fighting and hiding in the house without rich family noiticing that they are there.And finally the husband of the old maid(who is btw. insane,what is disgusting) comes out of the basement and tries to kill people,what is very badly acted.REWIEV:The plot is so shallow,predictable and stupid.Rich family is fireing their employers without any real evidence of them doing something wrong,but just because poor's family members told them so.And then they are employing the rest of the poor family memebrs(mom and dad) without them having any job experience nor recommendations.
I understand that the poor family members are suposed to be the villains here,but they r not ""interesting vallians"" like president Snow in The Hunger Games,or Darth Vader in Star Wars or Joker. in Batman seriesThey are not vallians,they are just parasites.They are not even ""smart criminals"" but rather stupid ones like burglars in Home Alone.
First 30 minutes of the movie were OK-ish and i would rate them 6/10 ,but after that it gets super predictable and shallow.There is also a guy in the basement who is pressing the switch with his head which is really,really disgusting.
I wish there is option to rate this movie 0/10 and turn back time so i can not watch this movie and live my life for extra 2 hours in total.
This is one of those movies that makes me want to live the Earth and find a new planet to live.In my opinion,how this movie has 8.6 rating and has won Oscar is bigger mysteria than how the univers was created.
I am so disgusted by this movie that even though I made my imdb account back in 2013,I decided to write my first rewiev."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.A masterpiece."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,9/10,"Starting 2004, I watched hundreds of K-movies, literally. Closer to 1,000 than 500, actually. Halfway into ""Parasite"", I was certainly entertained, but still wondering why this particular movie won this year's Oscar for best motion picture. Then I stopped wondering. Well deserved win!
A few others would have been worthy contenders (""Oldboy"", "" Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"", ""Bad guy"", ""A bittersweet life"" or ""3-Iron"" come to my mind and I forgot many others), but I guess Korean movies weren't on the radar until the mid-2010's. Better late than never..."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,The Korean drama and thriller written & directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art
PARASITE,17 February 2020,5/10,"It appears this years theme is social injustice between lower and higher classes (Joker, this crap) . I was okay with this movie up until 3/4 . Now i have regret that I've wasted 2 hours of my life 13 dollars . And to think it won over Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I knew Oscars suck but this really is a final nail in the coffin."
PARASITE,25 July 2020,1/10,I enjoyed the first part of the movie but didn't feel anything. The ending was so so stupid and made me feel like Im watching cartoons.
PARASITE,26 February 2020,7/10,"There are 100s of movies worth better, never reached the oscars. You can watch it maybe once or twice but definitely won't keep it in your collections. Well executed and it is been overrated for it
."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,4/10,"This movie is full of plot holes, especially on the second half. The supposed twist is full of stupidity and the ending can not be worst than that. Really dont understand how can this win the Oscar."
PARASITE,24 September 2019,9/10,I must say this movie is so good. It make you laugh and then cry. Being an indian i watched this movie with the english subtitle. I love it !!!!!!
PARASITE,12 March 2020,10/10,"Amazing film, completely worthy of the Oscars it won. It did not follow the typical three act story, instead, it is like watching two movies in one: the first part, a comedy or satire, the second part was more like a thriller. However, the screenplay and the photography made both parts feel as a whole. During the 132-minute movie, it put the audience through many different emotional states. It is a movie that develops many topics resulting from the capitalist world and the increasing difference of the wealth of the rich people and the misery of the poor. It explains the differences between the social classes, emphasizing not only how the opportunities are different for both, but also how climate change affect them differently. However, is not the typical movie that romanticizes the working class, but rather show them with disunity among them and as people who live from the wealth of their masters and do not hesitate to smash others for a little bit of wealth. Moreover, both classes do not seem to understand nor show some care among them. The wealthy people live from the work of the poor, while the poor live from the wealth of the rich...then, who is the parasite, are there more than one? Another thing the director shows in this movie is the social death resulting from poverty. All this is shown in screen through a complex yet understandable symbolism and the mood is perfectly settled with the music. The photography and editing is also really good, my favorite part was a montage with combined more than 20 scenes. A piece of art to enjoy!"
PARASITE,4 December 2019,9/10,"What a masterpiece that was. Being familiar with the korean cinema and the overload of fantasy it carries every time, I wasn't really prepared for this rare gem. It's mix of pretty much every movie genre and a hell of an emotion ride.
It all starts very smooth and simple, kinda funny too as we've been introduced the family. You can easily assume It's a family
comedy drama. So far so good.. From the moment that the boy gets into this rich House and then, mess an chaos surrounded the place. It all turns into a crime, soft thriller mood and It's getting darker and darker until it explodes. I don't wanna say much because it will destroy all the fun. In my opinion you should not read or hear anything about the plot, before seeing this movie. The only useful tip, is good to know is that after the first 15-20 mins, starts a wonderful ride and you will definitely love every single minute of it.
Spoiler ALERT
Here in Greece we say ""The one who always searching for the Big fish, turns out losing and the small one (he already got)"". So never be greedy guys. Be thankful with what you have and always work harder if you wanna do better.
Enjoy the movie guys. Every one has to watch this.
P.L"
PARASITE,25 January 2020,7/10,"Wonderful movie and immaculately written. Shows satire perfectly and both the acting and storytelling is exquisite. But ain't no Moreno than this, shows the satire, the world we living in."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"Surprisingly easy to watch. It's a film on many levels starting as a gentle comedy, morphing into something a lot more macabre. Seeks to provide commentary on social class in Korea as well as a nod to the political environment of having a non friendly neighbour in the North. The title is brilliant"
PARASITE,21 April 2020,3/10,The only good thing about this movie is...Nothing.
PARASITE,18 August 2019,10/10,Extreme! Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a good criticism about the rich and poor in the world.. the movie is really interesting and pretty sad... worth it. Please watch it. You will not regret it.
PARASITE,5 April 2020,7/10,"I found this movie very good and definitely deserving all awards it got.
The story is brilliant and the characters are interesting.
It's just that ending kinda ruined it for me, I feel it was just pointless violence that didn't contribute to the rest of the movie."
PARASITE,27 October 2020,10/10,"Best Film I have seen this year by a country mile and I have seen a lotA well deserved Best Film, Best Director, Original Screenplay ( Academy Award ) and Palme d'Or etc etc etcTurn off your phone and other distractionsEnjoy!"
PARASITE,21 January 2020,10/10,"I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it."
PARASITE,30 December 2019,9/10,"Funny, scarcastic, touching, emotional... the movie builds up as a comedy but then shows the family drama and depicts a modern south korean society where the rich live in another galaxy, so far yet so close from a family of ""untouchables"". Inequalties of ou times are so well shown, in this comedy drama. best movie in 2019"
PARASITE,14 January 2020,7/10,"I am gonna be fast about this.
The movie is boring in the first hour. I was constantly giving a look in the bar to see how mush is left!
Let's talk about the second part where all the action took place. So, I understand why everything happened, about killing the rich guy etc. What I don't get is the scrip that wasn't something that blowed my mind. I was pretty sure when I saw the storm and the flooding house that someone would die in the end. In other words, I wasn't surprised at all with the killing scene. The interesting part was that the son somehow survived and was free and the part that father found to hide... But i am trying to be honest here, I don't give this movie 10 stars for making me focused on the action for 20 minutes.... That's why this movie is overrated!"
PARASITE,18 November 2019,9/10,"Perfect script , Ph of the gods , and the direction is is a work of art that combines with the palate of colors that create a great atmosphere.
The soundtrack is normal and the characters are great."
PARASITE,10 January 2020,10/10,"Wow! I can't understand how or why this excellent film can be compared to ROMA. This is pure gold. Roma was bad in a lot of aspects, bad acting, bad rythm, history/screenplay, etc. Even using a great camera such as Alexa 65 was a great disappointment. Now, this film Parasite is in every area a superb film. We need more movies like this!!!"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"Theme of the movie is unmatched. An experience of division between classes.
Bringing reality so subtly onto the screen."
PARASITE,26 May 2020,10/10,One of his best works. Builds unlike many movies and comes to an end in fantastic fashion. A must watch and hooks you to the point that you don't even realize you are reading subtitles.
PARASITE,22 November 2019,7/10,"The movie was really good! It's worth watching! The struggle of classes and the gap between them is visible in this movie, but all is is dressed with a lot of humor, unexpected events and a storyline and plot that won't let you down or make you feel bored at any moment!"
PARASITE,31 May 2020,5/10,Do understand the message and all but definitely not worth winning the oscars. The mindset depicted is something which some people have and not all. For me this was one of the most overrated Oscar winner ever.
PARASITE,27 March 2020,2/10,"This movie is only good for old & mature people .it not for young generation 😜😂
Waste of night for me"
PARASITE,26 March 2020,9/10,I love how everything changes in this film. I won't spoil anything from parasites because everyone has to see it. The way the poor family infiltrates the big but still vulnerable family is fantastic. The spectacle is great and the plot twist in the middle and at the end is just one word to describe WOW
PARASITE,16 August 2019,8/10,"Objectively speaking, this film is not as good as ""Memories of Murder""and ""Mother"". It is a good movie. But I have to say that if ""Burning"" is in Cannes this year, ""Parasite"" may not win the prize. This is the kind of movie that you think is good after watching it, but you are not interested in watching it again. Bong Joon-ho is a master of genre, but this movie obviously cannot be his best."
PARASITE,7 July 2020,9/10,"Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one! Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively."
PARASITE,30 October 2019,5/10,"I'm An Indian.I Watched It After A Lot Of Recommendation,But It Never Fullfilled My Expectations.The Movie Shows The Division In Between Peoples Such As High Class And Low Class,It Presents In The Way Of A Comedy Drama.I'm Not Satisfied On The Movie Maybe Because Of I'd Watch Lot Of Indian Movies Which Has These Kind Of Story."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,9/10,"The movie starts slowly and shows us who the family lives. Despite the unmoral functioning of the family, that pretend to be someone their not to their benefict, after the major plot twist in the midle of film, the tension dont stop rising and the ansiety keeps increasing until a crazy final conflict. The resolution of the final dont explain to much but have satisfied me."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,9/10,"My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!"
PARASITE,27 April 2020,7/10,"I managed to not know much about this before watching. Was genuinely surprised by a few plot twists, and was at the edge of my seat or holding my breath for many moments, with many laughs at the believable absurdity in between. In the end, I felt this was a thought-provoking commentary on the desperation and feelings of being trapped experienced by many in poverty."
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,"I can say that i did not expect that how one movie could affected me like that.
All i can this movie is speechless.
This is so original & real.
This is real life, i am so sad to see that how can poor people and capitalism world can do this to any human being... and also the ''smell''... the best version to explain that how people can feel low, terrible. and how rich people can consider any human being like their slave in modern world. only the system can do this. this film is real because its showing the real world, capitalism and how the poor people can fearless about any other human being in order to get money from them. its scary but its real. this movie shows that you cant trust anyone."
PARASITE,21 June 2020,9/10,This is an outstanding film with lots of fascinating subtlety. The cinematography is not only gorgeous but also conveys more about the characters. It has a great musical score that emphasizes the underlying themes and deftly ramps up a creeping sense of dread. The film seems less interested in making a socio-economic statement than it is with crafting a tight thriller that captures audience attention from start to finish.
PARASITE,11 November 2020,9/10,Just one thing to say amazing. Story is so normal but you dont understand this movie when you see it cuz its a one kind of metaphor movie.
PARASITE,11 September 2021,10/10,"A truly remarkable film with as many layers as there is great characters. The climax is shocking, especially when Kim Ki-Jung is dying but Mr. Park is yelling at her father to get the car and take his son (who seems to be having a panic attack... likely because what has happened is shocking and he actually cares about the lives of others) to the hospital. His continued screaming made his killing inevitable.I wish the film ended with Kim Ki-Woo purchasing the home and sharing a moment with his father."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,6/10,"I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,9/10,"This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,2/10,"Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,9/10,I will say this again and again. Trailers ruin movies. I watched this film after staying away from trailers. I have done so since. Suicide squad. Where I realized trailers ruin movies. Do yourself a favor and if any movie you hear about that you wanna see. Just go see it. Don't watch the trailer. This was the actual opposite of what I thought the film was going to be. And it was incredible. Thanks.
PARASITE,9 January 2020,1/10,"The west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment. This film is the example. A commercial, illogical potboiler with not one original character. This film can be compared to a number of Hollywood, European cinema. Everything is stupid and illogical. An entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity. Top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors?! And the owners of the house, a family of 4, has no clue about any of it, despite all these happening right under their noses for years? Sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical. Sounds like a Hollywood B comedy movie starring Queen Latheefa, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel and other SNL cast members."
PARASITE,6 April 2020,9/10,I loved this movie. The director has a really beautiful touch and the dialogue and plot twists had me constantly intrigued and surprised.I absolutely loved the character of KiJung - the sister. I would like to watch a whole movie about her character - it is so uniquely nonchalant and self-serving that it is a delight to watch - you simply don't see or hear of people like this.I felt the ending was beautiful and just ever so slightly rushed. Still the best movie of the year for me and a worthy oscar winner.Rent it/ buy it and enjoy.
PARASITE,11 April 2020,10/10,"Seen the Movie two times one in January and other recently in April. It really is a great movie although my mother hated it and was asking why it won the Oscar. I think this movie is a masterpiece as it all drama,comedy,terror,mistery it makes you go on an emotion rollercoaster , it makes you think about your life about desperation when you have nothing etc.. . Such a great movie that will perdure a long time."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,9/10,For some reason the UK only got Parasite in cinemas in February so I've only just got the chance to see it. It's a great piece of filmmaking all around with great performances and a fantastic script.
PARASITE,17 February 2020,9/10,A fantastic film that holds your attention from the first frame to the last. I was totally captivated by the story and the cast did an amazing jobs of creating memorable characters. Loved the twists in the plot and the feeling that the photography gave. An excellent piece of work! Bravo!
PARASITE,19 April 2020,5/10,"Uhmmmmm... Not expecting the events turn into such madness. Sad, but it will teach you a lot of lesson."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,9/10,"This is one of those movies that after watching you have to step back for a second and breathe. Amazing. Great acting, directing, and genius writing. Beautiful set design and a perfect score. And that peach montage I mean, just watch this movie. If I have one complaint the ending could've been a little tighter, but it's a minor issue. Incredible, deserved every award."
PARASITE,30 March 2020,10/10,The beginning of the movie is so fictional and if you keep watching you don't regret.
PARASITE,30 March 2020,9/10,"The movie had a constant sense of elevation. Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, they did. Somehow though, it all feels super realistic. That's the power of pacing. Recommended."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,8/10,"It exposes the reality of Korean society
Surprise me!"
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,Paracite is a suitable title fir this movie. Watch this movie. It has everything.
PARASITE,24 April 2020,10/10,"This is a film for film fans, who wants to see something interesting, new, brilleant, with oh my god feeling
This is bloddy brilleant film
Super direction, acting, and the production design"
PARASITE,15 May 2020,9/10,"On one side is the flooded hut, on the other is the birthday party. One side is the cold and hard gymnasium, the other is the luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron. It irons everything out. They rub against the net, live in the basement, and do whatever it takes to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, and worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into 369 grades. This wall, regardless of the wind, the sun and the rain, stands still. Mr. and Mrs. park look silly, but they are still getting richer and richer. The Kim family is very clever, but they can't turn over. You think that if you find a good job and get a good salary, you will get rid of the poverty status. In fact, you are still 18000 miles away. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has melted into your blood. You've climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may have just reached someone else's basement. They are worms, so they have a hard life; they are worms, so they can't kill anything."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,7/10,"While some people would say that this is boring, I find this movie quite relevant. It features how people live in the different spectra of society. The Rich. The Poor. Metaphorically, the movie was able to portray how most people live in a third world country."
PARASITE,11 June 2020,9/10,"Basking in the sunlight of a courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing in the air of a dark room will only walk flesh like a ghost. Hold the poor stone can not get rid of for life, catch the cheap smell can not be eliminated forever. Bedbugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening Windows with potions; The host at the top pays people to disinfect it. Rich people suck the blood of poor people to rise, poor people sent to live in the rich people's houses, the ghost in the same room to share food, parasitic worm and beast development enmity."
PARASITE,1 May 2021,9/10,"I had no prior knowledge about this movie going into it, but afterwards I knew I got done seeing one of the most well-crafted films I've ever watched."
PARASITE,22 July 2020,9/10,"I watched Parasite and liked it very much, first of all, the soundtrack of the movie was great, its script and subject were gripping, it definitely deserves the Oscar. The last 20 minutes of the movie are excited and tense before it is excited but the last 20 minutes are raising the bar to the top."
PARASITE,31 August 2021,8/10,"Get your senses heightened. Parasite is one hell of a movie. It's so hauntingly simple and elegant, I couldn't believe what happened in the end. I just sat where I was, spellbound. With awesome story, acting, direction, music, exquisite art direction (the interiors of the Park residence took my breath away) and cinematography (even the slum area looks awesome), Parasite totally deserves all of the awards."
PARASITE,22 November 2020,10/10,"Everything is pure imposture
Movie of the year: a wonderful cinematographic surprise, wellplayed, well done!
Everything is pure imposture that seems to be the only way for the protagonist family, father, mother, son and daughter, to get a job at all and to reach the state of happiness. At one point, the disillusioning sentence is heard from the father: ""500 university graduates apply for a position as a night watchman.""
Everything could be so beautiful if the poor family's greed wasn't so great and their recklessness. They soon discover that the old housekeeper whom they had pushed out of their position has a dangerous secret that could endanger their new positions. This triggers a chain of surreal, mad and wonderful situations that lead to the poor family losing everything and more.
But against the background of the madness of the rich family and their airs, all the sins of the poor family were finally excusable. It fills me with sadness that the poor, without rights always remain the poor and without rights, and with every attempt to change their fate they just slide deeper into their Schlamassel."
PARASITE,19 December 2020,10/10,"I was lucky enough to stumble upon this film in a small theater while traveling abroad. It is the best film surprise I have seen made in my lifetime. This is a modern day Citizen Kane full of brilliance behind every scene and the small details are beautiful to watch. This film is an essence of humanity and must see for cinema lovers. Absolutely well deserved for its best picture Oscar.
I would give this 11 stars if I could since this is the first movie I have ever seen where I couldn't predict the twists or ending."
PARASITE,19 July 2021,3/10,"...seems to be surrounding many things South-Korean and Japanese, at least that is my feeling. The culture and art of these and other Asian countries get hyped ferociously in the west. I am not saying that I mind, people can like whatever they want and there is so much intriguing and nice to like but it does have this unpleasant side effect that films like this are treated like pure gold. This film is not, for me.I heard much about this film, read many great reviews it being incredibly funny, frightening, disturbing, dramatic and and and. A Film that should have won all prices as best competitor in all genres(a part from adult and children's movies). So I watched it expecting it to be dark, smart and deep and at the same time entertain me and make me laugh, and cry at best. But it did not. I yawned quite a few times though. It is really long and it would probably be so much more entertaining if it was just 90 minutes but as it is several scenes just drag along not giving the viewer anything no content, no grand acting, no new and brutal visuals(yes, the scenery IS VERY WELL DONE! But it is not so beautiful that I want to stare at it while nothing is happening and also after a while we have seen all the shots so thank you, next.)
And about all the genres...it really is not that funny, not that dark, not frightening and not horrific, some drama in it but not done better then in many TV shows in all fairness. I might be unable to understand some of the humour as I do not speak Korean and also I could only find a synchronised version so there could have been some puns that just flew over my head but I doubt that that would have made a change.The acting is not great, the characters are not really likeable and sometimes feel unfinished the story does really not make much sense and the twists and turns are not something incredibly smart or unexpected. I must really say I went in hoping for great entertainment and did not finish it in one sitting but stopped half way in and finished it the next day because I was disappointed and bored and felt like using my time differently.It is simply a film, the message is very simple and while it has some nice shots it is really not a film I would recommend....to anyone really. I even now knowing the film, rereading the reviews do not see what those people saw in it. Which is grand! People have different tastes! As a review in simple terms: A mediocre film, with nothing outstanding about it and ruined by a too long running time which results in the film being boring."
PARASITE,5 February 2021,10/10,"I really really enjoyed this movie! There is a good plot, the ending is very good!"
PARASITE,3 April 2021,1/10,"Still unsure why this won so many awards, I recently watched again and still did not get it.I can not really review without adding storyline hence (spoiler alert)
a family of con- artist and thieves infiltrate a house and hide in the basement the end, that's it, I really do not the understand why so many awards for a film that has no purpose or meaning, I must be confused some how but this film for me just did not make any Impression, I watch alot of 'foreign' films this does not compare to 'Along with the gods1 or 2, old boy, I saw the devil, even norwigen films,
I do not know.As a film for me, I would not waste your time."
PARASITE,22 May 2021,10/10,Movie is just awesome. It reveals dark secrets of the life. Must watch movie.
PARASITE,28 May 2021,10/10,To say the least this movie is brilliant. The class differences you can see with both sides of the family is really telling of the modern wealth inequality around the world. The rich family with a complete lack of perspective and respect for the other/main side of the family is very compelling and makes for this amazing story. One of the best movies ever made and it's ridiculously enjoyable start to finish. 10/10.
PARASITE,2 August 2021,10/10,"While Parasite spends a good amount of time on comedy, it nonetheless presents an extremely nuanced take on the struggle of Rich Vs. Poor, with neither side painted as entirely good or entirely bad."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda; specifically, the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world. The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,8/10,"The hype behind this film is unbelievable. I've been avidly watching Korean movies for years and had to see this one of course.It's very good, but if you've watched a good amount of Korean thrillers before it won't exactly blow you away. It has the slow burn that leads to a violent climax, dark humor... even the class warfare themes that are common in Korean movies.If you like Bong Joon-Ho movies you'll probably love it."
PARASITE,22 August 2020,7/10,"Enjoyed this move, smart and with heaps of character. but for me it went downhill in the second half as it went from plausable humour to silly and violent slapstick."
PARASITE,29 August 2019,8/10,All of the watchers can get the idea of the contrast between the families that's for sure. Interesting -not the most interesting- plot works just fine but movie couldn't give me the feeling of emphaty which it tries to give. Rich family was wierd but it doesn't make them the villians. You don't kill people because they don't like your smell and crying in front of the picture of the man you murdered won't be a redemption. Writer tried us to grow sympaty for him but it didn't work for me.This kind of unjustified things pushed me a bit and ending wasn't satisfying that much. Acting and cinematography took credit of my rating. Thanks for reading.
PARASITE,2 April 2020,,"Amazing !! Mind blowing!!! If you haven't watched it yet, watch it right now"
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,"Very much enjoyable, loveable and heart warming piece of art. But the end didn't match with the flavour of the movie and came to me as if a beautiful road trip has ended with a crash but still its a must watch."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,2/10,"By it, i mean Oscar worthy.Like some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place.The movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does.My humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't."
PARASITE,30 June 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a moving essay on the class divide.A beautiful shot movie that takes you through the struggles of a downtrodden Kim family trying to meet ends. For them, everyday is a battle for survival.During these struggles, they come across the Park Family.. Initially you meet the naive wife, who can't pick on any lies. She gives access to one of the Kim. And one after another the Kim's systematically encroach all household activities of Park household.. Ofcourse Lies, forgery and greed are the themes running in the background...but mostly this movie is a sharp satire on Class divide..There are a lot of surprise elements in this movie and it does catch you off-guard.
Especially, when the old caretaker (who btw has been removed by the Kim's through careful planning) , requests to enter the house for a very hideous purpose.The architecture of the house itself is beautiful. The stairs are used to good effects. Director conveys a lot through the different stairs and windows in this little tale.. also no tiny detail in this movie is there by chance, it is there for a purpose.. which is what makes this movie even more interesting... It is like an artwork, which on surface might just be telling one story but inside... It holds a lot... So it is basically, on the viewer, what he/she makes of it.Wonderful watch.P.S - As an indian watching a Korean movie, the language is tad distracting but still with subtitles, it is a comfortable watch."
PARASITE,2 March 2020,1/10,"Like many of the Users reviewing this film, I had high hopes when I rented it.I thought it started out well. Unlike some of the reviewers, I kind of liked the family of grifters (especially the daughter). In fact, my initial rating was 10 stars; however, as the movie continued, the stars began to fall by the wayside.If the movie would have been about a family of grifters, who use imaginative ways to imbed themselves into the lives of a rich family, and then develop a storyline from there, this would have been a likeable, if less imaginative, movie. Unfortunately the plot veers significantly away from this by first introducing a weird, and unbelievable character living in a basement fallout shelter, and then, turning violent and bloody for no apparent reason.It's too bad as the movie started out with so much potential and some truly comic scenes (i.e. leaving the windows open for ""free fumigation"" and the little boy's ""surrealistic"" paintings which are nothing more than scribblings).And no, don't tell me that I need to have a better understanding of the socio-economic conditions within modern day Korea to truly appreciate this movie. It's not my job to educate myself in order to appreciate a movie. It's the movie's job to allow me to appreciate it. If it doesn't do that, it's a waste of time."
PARASITE,17 August 2019,8/10,"Great movie , you'll find a lot of emotional moment and highly intensity."
PARASITE,25 October 2019,9/10,"Dark, spot-on culturally aware satire, so funny; SO funny!"
PARASITE,23 April 2020,9/10,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon Ho has served up over two hours of fascinating story played out by interesting characters on beautifully crafted sets. At no point during those two hours did my attention wander, but at several junctures I realized that my pulse was racing (in a very good way).As with any film - ""your mileage may vary"" - but I cannot imagine that many folks would not enjoy Parasite. It's fantastic."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,9/10,Loved it. Everyone should watch this movie. Had our attention the entire movie. Bit strange and unexpected. So good. Just so good
PARASITE,29 February 2020,9/10,Best storyline I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Would definitely recommend seeing.
PARASITE,28 March 2020,10/10,"This movie shows all the aspects of life.
Truth
Lie
Honesty
Karma
And destiny
Its a crux of life.
What a master piece"
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"Original, creative, involving story.Great acting with a crisp production.One of the best in 2019"
PARASITE,24 April 2020,10/10,A roller coaster of a movie with great characters and plot twists. A narrative that draws you in from start to end. A movie to add to all time favorites.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"If you want to see why this move took the Oscars, you should check it and give it a try. Maybe you would like or not. Just watch it!Yes, the metacritic score it's really high for this movie. But yeah, it's a ""must see"" movie. The soundtrack used in this movie is fantastic!The acting was great, from my point of view.If want to see a drama movie with a little few scenes of comedy, a ""dark comedy"" you should try it. Trust me, you won't lose anything."
PARASITE,16 April 2021,6/10,"While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached. It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed...? Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family. Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people, getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction. When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in...? She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases. The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion. All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment. I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it.The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion (that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless). The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don't remember any of it.The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie. While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea, metaphors do not make a movie magically better. While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment, the movie cannot stand on it alone. I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its ""gimmick"" of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer. The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew. I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite, especially from the actors. If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you, but it is highly subjective and does not make the film ""the masterpiece of a century"". A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top. A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg.I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section. With a more likable poor family, lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story, this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been, but it would have been far more enjoyable for me. But thats okay, movies are not just made for me, a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie, so its current form definitely has a right to exist."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,2/10,Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.
PARASITE,10 September 2019,8/10,"When you set out to watch a foreign film you never know what to expect. And you can only hope that the film will keep you off phone so you don't miss any important subtitles...
Parasite takes you on an emotionally gripping storyline, where you will find yourself fixed to your screen for the entirety. The superb directing, and In particular writing style of this screenplay complement to each other and will not disappoint. I was so pleased that the ending of the film ties the rest of the storyline together and really does justice for the rest of the film, cause who likes a bad ending? This film did get a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and it was defiantly deserved."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,6/10,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately."
PARASITE,12 December 2019,9/10,"I was bombarded by ppl recommending this movie to me so when I finally saw it, I was a bit underwhelmed - or you can say I was overhyped before. The main complaint - I was not ""blown away"" by any element of the movie. I know that's a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects. Instead, this movie did just ""pretty good"" in all of them.Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is - I don't want to say cliched - a pretty common theme in East Asia. Juxtaposing two closely-related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device.Execution of the movie is professional and top-notch. Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups (some of them a bit in the face), which, on the bright side, shows the movie was extremely well-thought out and executed. Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise - a bit over-crafted, I'd say, which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me.Character arcs are well-justified but predictable; was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non-visual medium - smell. The juxtapositions of the underground v. above ground, the pre- and post- discovered housekeeper, and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose.Last, the cinematography was beautiful, the tone was unique and well-balanced, and the performance was amazing. Overall, a highly polished and accomplished movie. Yet I failed to see much ingenuity. It felt like the director hides behind his craftsmanship to avoid showing the audience his true self."
PARASITE,29 March 2021,10/10,"I've been a fan of Bong Joon-ho movies for a bit now. This is by far the best one I've seen. I'm not going to go into detail about anything. Just try to avoid spoilers before watching the movie. Trust me. If you've seen a Bing Joon-ho movie and like his style of directing, you'll like this. If you are just a fan of movies in general, you'll like this. As far as I know, there is not a dubbed version of this movie. If you're okay with subtitles, this wont be a problem. I understand that subtitles can be distracting, but I urge you to watch this movie anyway."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,This one made a stunning impact for sure! It is not overrated. Highly recommended. 😊
PARASITE,6 March 2020,9/10,This film is actually 3 films in a suit pretending to be one big film and it does all those little films extremely well.
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"I can sit here and talk about how the acting was, and what the parasite represents, how this movie can change the industry, and how the lightning and music was.. all the typical reviewer bull****
But I actually just wanna give this 10 stars and urge YOU to go watch it. Please do yourself the favor.. It's fantastic!"
PARASITE,2 January 2020,9/10,"Great sample of 9 stars movie: plot, acting, score, direction and deeply topic (Inequality). A little bit of more cinematography to be Masterpiece."
PARASITE,16 June 2020,1/10,"First I must admit Bong Joon Ho is a good director and writer. And Parasite is technically not bad at all.However when watching a movie, it is quite rewarding to find some constructive citicism and good morals and principles. Well, in Parasite all you see is a man criticize at the way society works, with its undeniable flaws but, in the most destructive way I have ever seen. As he purposely doesn't leave room for good as he does for evil.As Frank Capra said 90 years ago: ""all cried: Emancipate our films from morality... Kill for thrill-shock! Shock! To hell with the good in man""That is why to me ""It´s a wonderful life"", ""Up"", ""Lord of the rings"", ""Jojo rabbit"", ""Lemans 66"", ""Ordinary people""... while thay may be technically worse movies than parasite, are a whole universe better than what Bong Joon Ho could ever dream."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,2/10,"TERRIBLE ! VERY VITIMIZATION! Poor poor people. No living conditions? You will go after studying, working, creating your own living conditions to get out of the hole. They used cheats to fool the rich family. Typical leftist movie that incites violence between poor and rich.
Why not incite the union of classes? Why not help yourself by being honest with each other? Showing your strengths and weaknesses? The world is going from bad to worse because of this FAILED ideology."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,"It's a good movie, but surely not better than Joker!!
Hollywood BS will always be Hollywood BS. The Oscars are not what they used to be; just a night to make political statements. Ricky Gervais said it best!"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,1/10,"Well, that was a thing. It reminded me a little of the humor of ""Being John Malkovich"", but without the wit, or wits. And with big doses of ""Eeew!"" But hey,on the bright side it makes me want to see ""Being John Malkovich"" again.I should have been forewarned because the writer/director Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed the execrable ""Snowpiercer""."
PARASITE,4 September 2019,10/10,"This movie lives in this time
An amazing sweet thriller movie.
Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood"
PARASITE,4 November 2019,7/10,"Ok ok, I've got to give it to the filmmakers that this unusual film is beautiful shot & acted. But for me, it was also a disheartening mess, taking dreadful closterphobic turns as it descended into the depths."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,9/10,"I stumbled upon this on IMDB and just had to watch it and I'm glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Everything about it was great, I was blown away! I am like many Americans that tend to avoid movies that are not in English. I feel like I'm missing visual aspects of the performance, and miss out on relevant inflections and nuances in speech patterns because I can't connect the words being spoken with the meaning of the words.With such good reviews I said screw it! No more will I limit myself to just American cinema and it paid off. Now I have a bunch of foreign films lined up to watch. I highly recommend seeing this, and if your like me with the subtitles just give it chance you wont regret this one."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,10/10,"Definitely lives up to the hype, so much better than I was expecting"
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,"A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!"
PARASITE,7 December 2019,10/10,"This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,10/10,Watch this movie. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was happily suprised that I was watching a masterpiece.
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"This was a good movie. However, there are plenty of GREAT movies this year. It's ludicrous to put this movie above all other movies. Joker is my favorite movie of the year, but I didn't expect it to win best picture. 1917 deserves it."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,4/10,"The only good thing I noticed about this movie is how the 180 rule was decently violated when the rich mother was talking to the poor daughter/ art teacher. The use of slow shutter speeds during the pee/ water battle was completely unnecessary. Bloodbath, boom. Nihilist muttering. How did the kid survive being hit twice with that rock? I hated this movie. Didn't get it."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,"I just watched ""Parasite"" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.
This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you.
The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is.
I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY."
PARASITE,18 June 2020,8/10,"I love the whole movie, including the cinematography as well. It depicts what the director and writers wants to convey. In all aspects, all I can say is I'm very impressed. The beautiful architecture of the house plays a big part in telling the story of the movie too.This movie also talks about the rich and the poor in Korea. It tells you how different their life could be, and how it affects one's personality. The characters are interesting too. It brings out the mysterious side of the movie. When I finished watching, I can't just say it's a movie of one genre.You should watch this to understand what I meant. Go go!"
PARASITE,18 February 2020,7/10,"If this deserves Oscar,"" get out"" deserves it too. It's a good movie, but lack of logic"
PARASITE,27 January 2020,1/10,"Horrible movie. There's no script at all. All the humble people - ALL - are portrayed like animals, with no principles. The director way of filming is disrespectful to the actors, which is not common in Korea. Korean movies are more elaborated, respectfull, and deep. This movie is empty."
PARASITE,8 July 2020,10/10,In 3 alphabets...wow... this movie transforms from dark comedy to family drama to a thriller to family drama with spellbinding sequences and perfect choreography. Keep entertaining us with such awesome cinema.
PARASITE,3 March 2020,10/10,"I saw Joker, The Irishman, Ford V Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit and Once upon a time in Hollywood but i 100% agree with this movie winning the Oscar.
Well done !"
PARASITE,8 May 2020,9/10,This movie is excellent and unique. The entirety of the film is like a puzzle that fits perfectly. This movie is intense and exciting. A perfectly crafted lie that is created too hastily and greedily and ruined just as quickly. The bigger they are the harder they fall and the path to success has no shortcuts.
PARASITE,19 April 2020,4/10,Over hyped nonsense. Too long and I didn't care what happened to characters. Needed to be a short film and im being generous. Although i thought the 3 dogs were better actors.
PARASITE,16 January 2021,6/10,"I liked Bong Joon-ho's The Host, didn't care for Snowpiercer, and while I thought Parasite was decent, I definitely don't consider it the best movie of 2019, nor did it live up to the hype I heard beforehand. I however don't think there's some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of ""social justice"", and I'm perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year. There's been a few years in my time where I thought a non-American movie was better than the American-made ones that year.I was initially excited to see the movie, especially after hearing some hints of what it was about, and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes. I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country, so it felt very relevant. I also love dark psychological movies, but unfortunately after seeing this, I realized it wasn't that dark and wasn't that psychological. While it explores class disparity, neglect, and cruelty, there's so many problems with both the protagonists (if you can call them that) and antagonists (if that's really what they were).The movie's biggest flaws are mostly in presentation, but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived. It's a riveting watch, is fairly well acted and directed, memorable, and has interesting situations, but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree. The movie does have dark humor, which I appreciated, but I think some of it is unintended. This reminded me of Snowpiercer, as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn't help but laugh. I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon-ho, which worked well in The Host, but not so much in these other two movies. I haven't seen Mother, so I'm not sure if it's truly a common or intentional thread in his movies. I've enjoyed a lot of Korean movies, but I think Joon-ho may be overrated at this point.I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value, and gets a bit overly-explicit, and some character's reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived. It seems in these more odd situations, Joon-ho is trying to make some sort of statement or point, which OK I think I understood, but I also don't like things like that being forced because they don't flow naturally with the storytelling and feel more wedged in. I don't know how political the movie is intended to be, but whether I agree with the points or not, I'd at least like a movie to have these ideas flow well and not be ratcheted in.I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy Korean cinema, topics about class disparity, terror/horror drama, and maybe even just something different to the typical American movie norm. It is well-produced and generally well-directed, the characters and situations are memorable, you'll be shocked, but ultimately if you're anything like me, you'll be disappointed but glad you saw it too."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,10/10,"Cinematic Masterpiece with a mixed genre. A film that will hold you up and never bore you not even for a second. Its storyline, drastic drama which leaps up the story. Its an tecnical masterpiece cause Boon jong ho knows what he is doing and he crafted it well.
If you asked is it the movie of the decade?
Well, i can't tell it but it will be in the list.
Haooy watch."
PARASITE,14 June 2020,10/10,"Truly, something to remember. Thank god we have good film makers left. Everything in place. I Only hated that I could not undertand language, liked to think that I picked something on the way."
PARASITE,21 December 2020,9/10,"This film explores the relationships between the haves and the have-nots. The tension that builds towards the end of the film kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting and direction is superb. And the story will have you thinking about the film for days. I highly recommend this as I feel it is one of the best films, not only of the year, but of the decade. I can see why it was nominated and won several awards, including Oscars for best picture and directing."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"I was really sceptical about ""Parasite"" in a way because of the hype, but I also had fate in the movie being good because
Bong Joon-ho have delivered knock out after knockout. (Okja, Snowpiercer)
Also I really like Song Kang Ho previous works.
Most notably ""The Taxi Driver"", which left me crying my eyes out on a 8h flight.
Do not recommend.Anyways, Parasite is a masterpiece.
Every time I thought I'd figured the plot out there was a twist. Everyone also kept going on about the ending and I was like, meh.
Well, they were right about the ending.Can't describe this movie. The plot is as indescribable as Fight Club, Get Out or Us.Go watch it."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,"I felt a roller coaster of emotions watching this movie; everything about it so perfectly executed. What makes this movie insanely good is the actors, story, plot and narrative.Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???"
PARASITE,2 July 2019,10/10,"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).(Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"
PARASITE,12 June 2020,9/10,"Everyone will like some part of this movie . The story is great with a lot of plot twists but because of that being a very important part of the movie, it doesn't work for a second watch. Still amazing movie."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,10/10,A great movie! With great plot! Great acting from not so popular actors (for us) and everything was entertaining. Unexpected plot twists & great idea! I can recommend this to everyone!
PARASITE,27 March 2020,1/10,"How did this win best picture????? The ending was nothing special and the storyline didn't make sense. Not a good film in general and to think that this won best picture, TRAVESTY!!! I saw this and Cats(2019) in the same day... and cats was WAY better. At least in cats it was visually entertaining, this doesn't have anything to show for. Would not recommend and still don't know what the hype is about. Save yourself time and money and skip this film!!!!!"
PARASITE,10 March 2020,7/10,I'm still trying to wrap my head around this film. this film was really good from what I saw and it seems that Korea makes a lot of amazing films. the ending is what I remember the most like really what was that all about. this movie ws all over the place
PARASITE,14 February 2020,9/10,"I have never seen a movie with such balance of genres, it went from a drama to romance to horror and almost a bit of every genre! i absolutely love how they slowly incorporated every family member into the rich family and just the whole storyline is pleasing and connects amazingly well. the instrumental played a huge role in its suspense and i loved it! i was constantly on the edge of my seat as the suspense was so perfect. The fact that Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park really explains the type of people Mr. Parks family were. In a dire situation, Mr. Park shut his nose because of the smell of Mr. Kim, this truly made a realization to Mr. Kim of the type of people they are. The clash of rich and poor, this clearly set Mr. Kim off, to kill him. I like the message at the end, it's very realistic. The son dreamt of buying the house to save his father, and it all would have been a happily ever after. But no, it is sadly a realistic and actual outcome of what the movie should've been. I respect it! Overall i am proud of this movies success and would watch it all over again and would still be surprised and struck by it."
PARASITE,9 October 2020,10/10,Definitely Oscar-worthy. An experience. the director has done a fab role. Loved the female lead actress.
PARASITE,2 April 2020,9/10,"To think of such story is intelligent! This is a masterpiece, totally Oscar worthy! It has a strong message, that greed lands you nowhere. Also, everything and everyone is running after worldly pleasure, and no matter how much petty a rich man can feel for the poor, they always look upon them like som down trodden untouchable stinky filth. The highlight of the movie is its uncanny realistic background! This is every other south asian country, where class parity is so much!"
PARASITE,11 April 2020,10/10,"When I look at a movie as a whole I'm more focused on story then execution first, and am always pleased when the films execution is excellent too, like this film. I went into this movie with very low expectations because it seemed confused and I wasn't convinced the thriller part of the film would work because I set a pretty high bar there. I also never give out 10's because a project can always be improved. In this case, it reached at something instinctual that has only happened a few times, where at the end of a film or book, I immediately, almost impulsively want to experience it again.Parasite succeeds in a big way for a couple of really important reasons. The intelligent wit and comedy of the film draws out great empathy from the viewer without them even realizing it, and brings you along just enough to be fully invested in the characters. The family is relatable, poor, and have their sense of humor and love for each other that has great reach for those watching. As things take a dark turn into its thriller act, the transition is natural and a part of you wants that playful interaction to come back, but as things unfold you know there isn't a turning point and that it's about to get worse before it gets better. At this point in the film, the meaningful narrative on wealth inequality and its impacts quickly take a full cast you enjoy together and almost seems to divide them against each other. By the end of the film, you've been fully primed for the message and will probably feel a bit torn towards the protagonists and plot as a whole. That feeling is coming from the reality so many have experienced, and for it's masterful strokes I found myself completely hooked.There isn't a single negative I can think of with this film. From direction to acting, costuming and screenwriting, this film was highly intelligent and used genre as a way to paint new aspects of the story rather than relying on tropes or frameworks within a single genre. The changes from comedy to tragedy itself compels the narrative and that achievement alone makes this an excellent film!"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,5/10,First half of movie is good but other half is down hill just ok and Oscar wasted on such medicore movie
PARASITE,7 March 2020,8/10,"The cinematography, the story gets you, you can stop watching it, the suspense, the performance and acting is very very good but... is this an Oscar winner?? I don't think so... definitely a must watch and for sure you might enjoy it... just open your mind and be ready for something bizarre but watchable!!"
PARASITE,26 September 2020,9/10,"I watched this the day of the Oscars to see if it was better than 1917. Not only was it great, but it was an all time film. One of the greatest surprises for me in cinema history! Excelsior!"
PARASITE,15 March 2020,9/10,"While lamenting that the film reflects the cruel social situation we are in, let's also think about how to solve the social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor. Perhaps when the production of this exploitative capitalist system changes and disappears, it will usher in a fairer society!"
PARASITE,10 April 2020,10/10,"I watched this film couple of months ago, so I'm not writing this review with a completely clear memory of everything that I loved about this movie. All I can say is that at least a week after watching it, I was still googling aaaaall the hidden meanings in certain scenes, all the interviews with the director, why they did some scenes in certain ways etc. This is how starstruck I was. Once I learned about all the layers, I could only conclude that this movie is a masterpiece! I had a class called ""Visual culture"" at my University and this movie would be perfect for the analysis of its visual language. And they show all the different relationships between rich and poor, happy and sad, right and wrong, in suuuuch a subtle way!! I really feel like people should write essays about this film."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,9/10,Just an amazing film on every level. I've seen it multiple times and discover something new on every viewing. Great to see Hollywood acknowledge world cinema with it's highest honour. Wow.
PARASITE,3 November 2020,5/10,"Now this isn't a bad movie, not at all. Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film."
PARASITE,14 April 2020,10/10,"No words.... wow, what a movie. Loved it. This is my kind of film. I even clapped at the credits. Nothing else to say except its a magnificent watch and a great critique on capitalism and why we need to end it. Loved this so much... *top 10 favorite"
PARASITE,15 April 2020,8/10,"It is an awesome film that gives the spectator a sneak peek of how the complex Korean society works. The actors are greatly chosen as each one represents perfectly a kind of person (especial recognition to the rich mother, that acts really good). The only thing that I didn't like was the end, it was kinda unexpected and showed that the director wanted to end the movie ""somehow"". I would watch it again."
PARASITE,12 December 2019,6/10,"10/10 for acting, cinematography, and plot development1/10 for the second halfThis had the potential to resolve itself epically but instead quickly descended into a messy free fall of nonsense.There are so many intensely gripping Korean films I was sure this would be one of them. And for the first half I was engrossed. But the second half was a huge let down.The acting and production quality are fantastic but the resolution sucks. No spoilers.Watch the original Old Boy again, or The Chaser instead. This film has nothing but disappointment at the end.Boring."
PARASITE,23 April 2020,3/10,"The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,6/10,"I don't know, I wasn't very impressed. The beginning was rather a drag, I did like the plot in the middle, but it fell apart quickly for me and it crashed at the birthday party. Watchable, because it's unpredictable, but too hyped I guess or maybe it's just not my style."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,6/10,"All the actors were fantastic. Ending was beyong immagination. Very dark thriller story. Well u need to watch to know the real parasite.
Movie won the oscar, still I would vote Tumbbad compare to Parasite.
10 stars for the acting. First 1hrs felt little slow, overall 6 points."
PARASITE,6 May 2020,7/10,"Good film but way too many plot holes or grandiose surreal situations. The social theme was great to show the difference between lower and upper class, while maintain equal footing and save face when they met. When the driver got fired for adult act presumed , why wasn't she dismissed ? - this fell flat to be satisfactory answered. The rich family even thought possibility of drugs ..but kept her on? The movie should of ended for her there. Why was the ex-house maid husband stuck down there without any knowledge of rich family. Seemed far fetch and same when main actor father went down there. Flicking light would of been fixed or traced to underground passage. Numerous other questions but too long to write. The praise it got is overblown as far from sustained perfection through, albeit entertaining moments ."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,5/10,"This movie started out wonderfully and had the potential to rival films such as ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".The first part of the movie was set up to deliver more satisfying plot twists. Unfortunately after developing the characters and plot it fell all over itself trying to make a statement on the rich and poor. my message to the writers and director, tell a story, make a point , and please entertain and enlighten us. Don't get weird."
PARASITE,15 May 2020,3/10,"Parasite was an ok movie, it didn´t deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, a soap opera or a k-drama is better than this movie, what a disappointing."
PARASITE,29 May 2020,4/10,"Interesting movie and perhaps better if you are Korean speaking. However, can't believe this movie was an Academy award winner?! I can think of at least ten other 2019 movies that were way way better. You may want to suffer your way through this movie just to see how irrelevant and misleading an Academy award winning movie has become to the general movie goer."
PARASITE,26 June 2020,10/10,"Its plot gradually enveloped me, it shows a very harsh reality, it is totally unpredictable. Well earned that Oscar"
PARASITE,29 June 2020,10/10,"A+ 10/10 97%
What an awesome film. Bong Joon Ho never failes to impressed. Script is great with a lot of themes and metaphors that integrate story. Message about social issues are very well done. Tonal shift in the middle when they find out house keeper's secret is very subtle. Script has a lot of subtleties. Film benefits of multiple viewings. Bong or as academy calls him Pong directs this film really great. Acting is wonderful. Soundtrack is awesome. Editing is well done with fun montages and great pacing. First half is very funny while second is very thrilling and intense. Cinematography is beautiful and green screen is good and production design is slick. Characters are well written. Families are likeable while doing not good things. Contrast is interesting. Ending is shocking and plays a theme of planning and failing. My problems are veeery minor. I didn't like resolution to Parks and didn't like how Ki Jung died and some jokes aren't that funny, but still who cares.
Overall:Great film which will be in film schools. Well done, Pong."

PARASITE,16 July 2020,10/10,"I was pleasantly impressed by this movie, I recommend watching it in cinema if you have the chance"
PARASITE,16 December 2019,5/10,"Movie was ok. Mostly about people who are maintenance seekers in the life and how they con a simple and vulnerable family, who paid the price for being straight.
Anyway suspence was good but it left a lot to be desired. If there was some hidden message other than what I said then we'll I missed something."
PARASITE,25 August 2020,9/10,"Saw it in cinema twice. Have nothing bad to say about it. I knew Bong-Joon Ho from Okja, which was a decent movie but not very special. So when it came out at a film festival I decided to go see it and I wasn't disappointed."
PARASITE,15 April 2021,10/10,"Lets get straight into the point. From 1h02m to 1h42m is pure perfection of cinema. This 40min was so masterfully crafted that i dont think anyone else in movie history could have done it like Bong. Lets be honest some people just cant take in the metaphorical features of parasite and thats fine. It's actually okay if people feel it as overanalyzed. But you just can't deny the fact that 15 minutes of the ex-housemaid just tense the hell out of everybody. With that sneaky snitch part of Kiwoo family sneaking out of Parks house. Even if some do not see a meaning to this they were still got thrilled by. About the meaning, personally, i guest it's gonna be about the interpretation of one's self. For me, a Koreab masterpiece."
PARASITE,30 June 2021,8/10,"The beauty of this movie is that nothing special about it yet everything is special.the treatment given to story is very fresh and it surprises you when least expected. To get the real feel you have to watch it that how a simple story can be done in intresting way .just one word ""Bravo""."
PARASITE,20 September 2020,9/10,"Superb plot. Rich and poor divide was and has always been there, but the way this film has exploited the theme to bring out how humans at various levels play out their part is undoubtedly praiseworthy. A must watch."
PARASITE,20 September 2020,9/10,"I was like ..wait what kinda movie is this.
Then I realized...its a really really good one. Thats what kind it is.Super cool.
Refreshing.
Haunting."
PARASITE,8 February 2021,9/10,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic."
PARASITE,28 February 2021,10/10,Greatest film I've seen to date. Nothing more to be said.
PARASITE,21 November 2021,8/10,"This was my first Korean movie I´ve watched. And definitely won´t be my last. I have wanted to watch this movie since it got its rewards but never quite had a calling to actually watch it.It was a very good movie that showed me a lot of things that I guess I needed to see.The family was really clever and sneaky and I really enjoyed how they managed to do all of it and get away with it for that little while.The movie had 2 hours but it felt like 45 minutes to me because I just merged into the movie as if I was in it.It was very interesting and I have never seen such a movie.I usually prefer fantasy, romance or sci:fi. But this has opened a lot of movie opportunities for me and I am grateful for that.Some of the moments that got stuck in my head was when the father was telling his son about making plans. And that his plan is to make no plan because in the end you are less dissapointed because nothing goes precisesly according to the plan."
PARASITE,31 May 2021,1/10,"This is my personal opinion.This movie won OSCAR, so it must have been good movie for others. For me, it was totally disaster. I wouldn't have given one star but I have to give to publish this review. Blind Korean movie lover fans can watch it.Nothing more to say,"
PARASITE,4 July 2021,9/10,"One person's opinion can differ from that of another's, and therefore the word ''I'' can become redundant when writing reviews.However, I'm going to make an exception to the rule here, because it's important for those who are concerned about watching a movie with subtitles to know that I'm not a fan of subtitles in movies. I struggle to focus on text for 2 hours, and I also find that I miss the detail of the movie. Yet I have still given this movie a 9/10.Why? Well, because you will soon forget that you are watching a movie with subtitles.It is a true masterpiece. A dark thriller comedy, so different to anything else that is out there. A real step forward for cinema. Superb acting, phenomenal cinematography, and a magnificent plot, so beautifully built. It's fun, emotional, and dark all rolled into one of the true greats.Don't be put off by the subtitles if that is your concern. And absolutely do not miss the chance to get lost in this strange and eerie plot."
PARASITE,27 June 2021,10/10,I wont review this film. Just will say that this film is captivating & powerful. Brutal portrayal of class struggle left me depressed for long time & influenced one my own life decision.Movie should be like this. I will give it 10/10.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"This movie crowns all the relevant topics. Such a powerful combination of hatrid, detachment, irony. I dont see any eye opener, but an image from afar. Maybe an eye of the storm opener.
Every reply is well studied and crafted, but the play is powerful and natural due to the high performance - play and sets.
I ve found a very articulate speech, addressing topics like: global warming, Korean Reunification, the ... global enclavisation, the mistification of science, the blindness of the media (Park seemns to be involved with media or visual arts), the running from myths and fears (the ghost from the basement is a very complexe symbol), the dephts of the social construction - with it s double perspective (the rain as a disaster or entertainment).
I ll watch this movie several times, because the building is equally robust and opened to zooming and nuances.
The most, i admired the way it surpassed the cheap propaganda and obvious paths. No, this movie is for me a very complex essay on guilt and limits. Also, the tragedy dissolves in the web / the wave of infinite information."
PARASITE,10 August 2021,4/10,"I really unable to understand what make people think that this movie is a masterpiece , for me it's par average movie nothing new or not much emotional , I think people who says masterpiece must be watching an ultra level violence movies throughout there life so a small touch made them feel great or they just appreciating as it won academy awards .Any how this is just a normal movie filled with nominal emotional in itThis movie definetly doesn't deserve academy award."
PARASITE,14 August 2021,9/10,"Parasite is a film of two halves, both equally interesting and captivating, but both powerful in their own regard. The first part of the film provides a slightly unsettling crescendo for the second half, the tension built by Bong Joon-Ho in every seen only compliments the beautiful cinematography of the film.Parasite is intensely ""... metaphorical"" and everybody will likely watch this film with a slightly different perspective of the meaning behind such scenes. The film has intrigue, drama, exciting narrative, a unique story, powerful physical violence, and expressive themes of classism. Parasite is essentially a tale of two families (or is it?), one poor and the other rich, the films shows the vices and vulnerabilities of each family and the good and bad they do in life.A 15 page essay could be written on this film, explaining the many profound details, images, narrative and outright dynamic filmmaking throughout, however, plain and simple if you want a shocking, socially relevant, frightening and bamboozling display of film that will excite and entice from start to finish, Parasite will provide this.Parasite is the first foreign-language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture... there's a reason for that."
PARASITE,19 October 2021,10/10,"Parasite (2019) is a masterpiece at it´s finest. There is clearly no surprise that it won 4 Academy Awards.My favorite part of the film was 100% the cinemaphotography, this movie is art, and that's thanks to the cinemaphotography. Every angle isn´t lazy. It´s well made and the director Bong Joon Ho took every chance possible to put his vision on the big screen.Another amazing thing is the acting. The actors put the best performance possible. From dramatic scenes, to intense scenes and to horror scenes.Now some people might not like the ending, but it had me amazed. It shows also how unpredictable this film is.It also shows how everyone isn´t who they say they are. Even if its just small things.This film is amazing and if you haven´t seen it, then I highly recommend it. (unless you cant handle violence) if not, then watch it."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,7/10,"This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated."
PARASITE,7 March 2021,8/10,"It has everything. It's funny, it's sad and it will make you fuming. You will feel with all the characters. The ending had me for a while; at the end it gives you another type of twitst. A very good movie. 8/10"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"A good movie with an appealing enough plot that has some interesting twists. However, nothing justifies a Best Picture award: No outstanding performances, no memorable soundtrack, not even the sets/photography are good enough to leave a lasting impression.
Plain and simple its a solid script that entertains for its duration, with a somewhat critical view of society which people who think of themselves as movie critics will cling on to justify that this movie can win Best Picture award, especially being paired up against Joker and 1917, both of which are vastly superior in every aspect."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,6/10,"I'll try and keep this shortish. For reference I think there are at least 3 films of 2019 that were better than parasite including 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', 'The Irishman', and 'The Joker'.If you're not the kind to often seek out great original content than I can imagine why you might think this movie is really some kind of unique, fresh gem. But there are too many plot conveniences and unrealistic character behaviors to really class this as ""The greatest film of the decade"". Not by a mile.Having said that I found the movie had several interesting threads and themes going on, some of which resolved, and some which were probably the most interesting went nowhere. ie the young 'rich' kids role, among other things. That was slightly disappointing.I think the so called 'class divide' commentary was there, but not to the extent that everyone raves. It showed more that there is not such a simple black and white difference between the two, which I appreciate. But I think the 'class divide' actually provided more a part of the organic scenery than a driving force of the film.Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but I would have rather just watched it at home, than paid to see it in gold class. Does that make me a bad person!?"
PARASITE,2 May 2020,5/10,It was an OK movie. I don't understand how you can give an Oscar to a movie that's just kind of meh. I was hoping that the ending would be something super interesting or exciting but instead it was just kind of sad. I feel like to call this a masterpiece is an insult. It was a movie it happened and it was two hours long.
PARASITE,28 September 2019,,"'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,3/10,"A veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved ""Snowpiercer"" but this is total crap."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,,Yeah. Wait for it. Tent. How to eat a banana. Hmmm. American Made.
PARASITE,19 March 2020,4/10,"To all of you with the high rating - You liked the house didn't you!? be honest - it was the architecture, wasn't it?Can't be the amateurish overacting..."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"'Parasite - an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.'When working-class Woo-sik Choi gets a job tutoring Sao-dam, the daughter of the rich Park family, so begins the slow, progressive attachment of the parasite to its host. This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches."
PARASITE,16 November 2020,9/10,"The truth is that the movie is about not 2 but 3 different class of society.
The Parks: the true upper class..Represented by wealth....huge house.... Abundance of sunlight... concerned with only First world problems...The Kims: the lower middle class... represented by unemployment.... Half basement house....lack of sunlight... Concerned only with their struggle for better lifestyle...The Ohs: the true lower class... Represented by hunger.... Deep basement..... Absolutely no sunlight... Concerned only with their survival....For the first half of the movie, we see only two classes, Parks and Kims and it shows how Kims are leaching on to Parks for their well being like a Parasite...But later when the third class is introduced as Ohs, audience begin to believe that actually Ohs are true Parasite as they offer nothing in return to Parks for what they steal..As we approach the final quarter, when the **** hits the fan....the perspective is switched again to show that Parks, the luxury class, are the true Parasite, they depend on the society for their lifestyle and pleasures but don't even give respect to the once they depend on. This is the true revelation.The movie brilliantly shows how cruel is each class towards other. Pay attention to how the Kims react when they find out their is another class below them. They also show no sympathy to Ohs and they hurt them and leave them to die of hunger. (As depicted in No plan is the plan scene).Another thing to pay attention is the scholar's rock, it is truly metaphorical as it is a symbol of hope, as shown in the scene it was introduced. Ki-Woo shown to be always hopeful as he is shown clinging on to the rock even when their whole house is flooded and they are turned homeless overnight and in the end it this rock (hope) that hurts him the most and yet he is hopeful that one day he will buy the house to free up his dad.This capitalistic world is at balance when each class is happy with where they are but it starts trembling down when the lower classes try to move up the social ladder.
The scene where the Kims get taste of upper class luxury is where it starts to get ugly and when the true lower class try to rise the whole society shambles. Ultimately everyone loses something. Lowest classes losing everything (the couple dies), Middle loses half of what they have ( the daughter dies and father is imprisoned) and the upper class only loses a quarter of their family.This movie has so many layers and so much depth, it is best understood if you watch it three times from three different perspective of each class."
PARASITE,12 March 2021,9/10,"In all honesty I'd been putting this off for quite a while. After watching it I can see exactly why it won so many awards. The entire film is a fantastic view of the class divide. The symbolism used throughout is amazing. The comedy is perfectly timed and the tension that is built in certain scenes (spoiler free) is some of the best I've seen.This film has made me visit the back catalogue of Bong Joon-Ho and with the exception of Snowpiecer (2013) I have not been disappointed.Overall, if you are a film fan then you NEED to watch this... and the rest of his films"
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"I was not expecting that much of this movie. Normally the films nominated for the Oscars are not my favorites, but I saw something different in PARASITE that take me out of the typical Hollywood movie, the script is very original, and the Oscar is well deserved: you don't expect what is next.This movie can be labeled as black comedy, thriller, and drama. Is also an ""out of the box"" movie, not for all tastes, I recommend to the audience to expect little and then you´ll be surprised by the script. Finally, I have to say that I am glad that the quality of movies outside the US has been improving so other countries can enrich the 7th Art."
PARASITE,28 November 2019,10/10,"First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this."
PARASITE,14 July 2019,9/10,"I watched this film not expecting much but the way it developed a sense of dread and anxiety crept in.
The film masterfully builds up and quietly holds the underlying tension and by the end it explodes in everyone's face leaving you gasping for air having held it for a longest time wondering what will happen next.
I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged.
And my mind was blown when the third act went bongkers haha.
I watched this film 3 weeks ago. And still trying to figure out what it all meant.
Don't miss it."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,7/10,"For shure it's a good movie.
The production is great ( visual, audio, cut).
But the story started great and end up a little flat.
Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper."
PARASITE,19 April 2020,9/10,This movie has all the emotions. A must watch! The story is so simple yet so twisted. One of the best foreign movies I've watched.
PARASITE,30 October 2019,3/10,"I must have seen a totally different movie, because I almost fell asleep in the theatre. And I really wanted to see this movie. It's just a prefect example of how social media and a decently filled marketing purse make you go watch movies you'd otherwise ignore. I really like Korean flicks, but this was whether fish nor flesh."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"I can understand there are a lot of people who really enjoyed the movie. It has good pace, there's a lot of tension and some unexpected twists. But honestly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece, despite it flaws. And it has many flaws, unfortunetly most of them are in the story itself. For me they spoiled the movie. I was asking myself questions almost from the beginning of the story:
Why a smart, young, good looking, english speaking guy cannot find at least decent job?
How his sister, without experience or art/psychological education manages to conduct tutoring to the boy, with whom - as his mother said, couldn't stand any art teacher? First lesson we can see even the boy bowing to ""Jessica"" - did she hipnotize him or smth?
How she knew about trauma the boy had?
The fathee could drive modern, expensive car without proper experience or training. They were poor, so he does not drive at all, and as he said his only experience with merces cars were during short work as a parking worker. How he could play experienced driver?
How it is possible a woman without proper experience knows how to run modern house and how to behave as a housekeeper for a rich family? And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes, while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation?
There is a scene with the Da-Song sitting in a tipi, writing the message of ""HELP"" that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp. The movie never addresses that later. Why the boy did not inform parents about that. And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp, and strange patterns of the flashing light?
How it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years????
There are just some of the questions I had. Main two ones are: why a family of so resourceful, inteligent and determined people live in a basement in a poorest of districts? With their talents they should be or on the top or in prison. Second - ending suggests we should sympatize with a father and his son. I have no idea how we can do that - they cheated, murdered and caused some innecent people to lose their jobs and reputation - honestly, there were no people in the movie I would like or had any sympathy for."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,10/10,"This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane. There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. This--THIS is a TRUE thriller. Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on the condition of humanity."
PARASITE,8 November 2020,9/10,"I watched this movie as I had heard great reviews about it. I don't normally go for movies with subtitles as I find them difficult to watch and read at the same time, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I wasn't sure of the plot and had made a point of not reading up on it before I watched it. I was not disappointed!
I do enjoy something a bit different, and this delivered.
A bit of suspense, horror and a touch of humour, highly recommended."
PARASITE,8 September 2019,3/10,"I have to admit that the main idea of this Korean film is very good. It is different from the majority of the films I have seen, but for me it was inadequate.
The first 40-45 minutes are the main part of the movie. You understand what is going on. The rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first 40 minutes. It becomes boring.
The acting is just good.
Nice effort."
PARASITE,2 November 2019,10/10,"I reserve 10 stars for only the cream of the crop, and I can safely say after one viewing that this was just that.Masterfully done in every aspect. All of the acting, camerawork, and design was fitting and never over the top.The plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective. Furthermore, this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself.I don't want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie; as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so. All I would advise is that you do see it, and for those of you averse to foreign films, don't let it impede you. It truly is the finest movie I've seen in recent memory. You'll forget it was in Korean."
PARASITE,2 December 2019,10/10,"Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,9/10,The movie was great and I would love to watch it again but what bothered me later is how the dogs in the house never noticed the presence of another human being like in the case of the boy when he hides under the bed.
PARASITE,28 March 2021,7/10,"'Parasite' [Dir. Bong Joon Ho, 2019, South Korea].I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie-watchers not being book-readers, or, the novelty of reading whilst 'watching' (glancing up between dialogue) is probably where people are deriving pleasure.You're barely able to watch the film while you're reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you're unable to judge the acting and cinematography. They're speaking in a foreign language too, so it's impossible to rate the delivery of lines. I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans.Parasite is good, quite original, but certainly overrated. The story is reasonably straight forward, and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be.The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life, whilst the drama isn't believable or impactful.Who is the titular 'parasite'? Well, we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites. It's a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family's lavish home through skilled deception, skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes.Of course, their new source of income goes off-rails as quickly as it had begun, but certainly not in a deep, 'Hitchcockian', or clever way.Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends: The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen; What was the relevance of the ornamental rock?; Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend?; Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn't love his wife?; What were the drugs he mentioned he'd buy her?; What became of the boy's deciphered Morse code?; How did the young man send a letter to his father?; Was the end a dream?So, Parasite is not a funny film, and not particularly thrilling, dramatic, clever, or suspenseful. The (music) score is ok, but it's hard to comment on the acting as it's a foreign language movie, and the photography is hard to judge when you're reading the almost non-stop text at the bottom of the screen. There's no particular moral to the story to learn, other than, maybe, not pushing your luck, and tolerating an unpleasant smell.However, from the originality, and what you can discern from the plot, it's still an engaging film - even if that's largely from the novelty of reading subtitles.7/10 - Not as good as Cinema Paradiso [1988, Director's Cut, 173 min]."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,9/10,"I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"Less subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,6/10,"The story is about the interaction of two Korean families, poor and rich - Park.In both families, fathers are the lazy guys. Classical now.
The kids are mostly autonomous and self-made due to the laziness of their parents. Classical as well.The interaction starts with a lucky meeting of an old friend by the young man from the poor family which allowed him to start his work for a rich family. This is normal and gives him big money and now he can help his family.But he lied to the Mother of the Park family to create a position for his sister. The sister has strong greed and asks a high price for her work from Park's family. And then created a plan for how to put all her family into a rich house by kicking out all old stuff. Greed can kill you, remember it until the end episode.
Also, there is a question, why Mother from Park family is simple? It's unsafe. And why Father from Park family didn't join the family decisions? Probably he has problematic pride. And they are both lazy and it's also can kill you, remind it as well.
In conclusion:
Don't be lazy and control your greed. As well as part attention for your partners or other people whom you délicate something or who affections on your life.If someone is dominated and another is submission in will kill one in them. Beca careful and pay attention."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family.
I'm also gonna build myself a bunker."
PARASITE,29 September 2019,9/10,Parasite deliveries a flaky experience of black comedy suspense bound on the perspective between upper and low-class families.Characteristic direction of the story flow is enough to generate a cult following. Cinematographed well of Kim Ki Taek and his family's situation in details.The unusual blockbuster film that rarely see in the commercial theatre.
PARASITE,23 April 2020,5/10,Talk about SLOW! This movie dragged for me and failed to keep me interested. I ended up turning it off after 20 minutes (surprised I made it that far). I read the synopsis off Wikipedia instead to see what the hype was about. I suggest y'all do the same. Not worth the 2 hours when you can read the synopsis in less than 5 minutes.
PARASITE,17 February 2020,5/10,"After watching the similarly overrated ""Host"" a couple years ago, I wasn't keen to jump on the bandwagon for this one. But so many people told me how ""amazing"" and different it was and kept recommending that I see it. So after it won all these awards and they put it back in my local theater I broke down and saw it. Well, that was a waste of $13.50 and two hours. It's billed as a genre bending comedy/drama, but in my opinion it misses on both fronts. There's nothing especially humorous in the dialogue or even the situations. Poor family scams rich family for jobs and money. Ooh, that's so original, except that it's not. The fact that the poor family is so unsympathetic makes it just unbearable. They're vile and annoying. Is it a clever commentary on class structure in Korea? Not really. Just hamfisted platitudes. The rich couple come off as far more likeable in fact. As for drama, there really isn't much. Yeah, they try to take a dark turn towards the end and there is a feeble attempt to make things dramatic, but I just kept looking at my watch wondering when this bore-fest would end. Then it just kept dragging on.And for the record, I spend lots of time in Asia, including Korea. I've seen lots of Asian films. I have Asian relatives and an Asian spouse. It's not cultural misunderstanding here. I just think, like that similarly shallow representation of mental illness in the even more boring ""Joker"" film, people want to praise something that they think brings attention to some uncomfortable issue. Guess what? Variations of this class structure have existed in Korea for hundreds of years. Things are better now than they were. There are plenty of options that don't involve scamming and murder. But if you can feel better about yourself by claiming to empathize with the lower economic stratum by suffering through this film, more power to you."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,7/10,"I felt there was a lot of unused themes, like the Chekhov's gun principle and the family was fairly smart but jobless, it doesn't fit. More goofy than a masterpiece.
All in all it was a decent movie and worth my time, I think its rating though is inflated by the social class messages throughout the movie."
PARASITE,15 April 2020,10/10,"This movie left me with a very sad feeling :( Ut was heartbreaking to watch the poverty these people are exposed to. Weird, but amazing and sad movie. I cant give much more details then this. Just see the movie for yourselves."
PARASITE,7 June 2021,2/10,"Too long, too silly, too boring. I don't understand how this move got awards and high ratings."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,10/10,"Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.The last movie that evoked so many strong emotions was Precious, in 2009."
PARASITE,25 March 2020,5/10,"I ki d of liked the movie at that point when I saw the Swiss magnets on the fridge and he started talking about German people living there... I watched the movie with English subs, so I hope in the original language they weren't making this huge fail."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,4/10,"It is amazing to me how often you see folks review films and they get caught up in the hype that some people say how great a movie is and then they feel they have to say the same thing. Not me. The movie was aesthetically beautiful and shot in a way that I have not seen before. However, the premise is preposterous. The rich family were very rich and somewhat naive, but on the whole they were nice people. The mom doted on her kids and wanted the very best for them even if she did not always understand them. The father worked long and hard hours but appeared to always come home. They treated all four of the folks they hired to help as almost family. And the movie made a point about identifying the supposed insults that the rich family made about the poor family but the ""insults"" were not particularly harsh. But I guess we were supposed to hate the ""evil rich family"". Meanwhile the poor family got an innocent driver fired. Caused the existing housekeeper to suffer a severe allergy attack several times and invaded and jacked up the rich family's house when the family was away.It wasn't a movie depicting the differences between the ultra rich and the ultra poor. It was a movie identifying the differences between an idiot family and a successful family who got rich."
PARASITE,9 April 2021,1/10,"If you never knew that rich people are somewhat uptight and poor people somewhat desperate, this movie is for sheltered daisies like you I guess."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"Finally got a chance to watch the best picture, director, screenplay winner: PARASITE and it's brilliant. Simple in it's beginning for a family wanting to find a living then a brilliant comedic lie to earn it and the complex aftermath it creates only to end in a mirage. South Korea nailed the want of every person that does not have and the blind ignorance of some who do...Highly recommended even with subtitles."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,5/10,"Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution.
What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending.
This is
It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it.
Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie."
PARASITE,4 November 2019,10/10,"A MUST SEE for every cinephile. I finally understood why critics and audiences had been raving about this film. Bong Joon Ho's direction, storyline, cinematography, performances, and use of symbolism utterly blew my mind. My eyes were fixated on the screen and I was sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense for more than half the movie; the suspense was really engaging and enthralling. The touching and melancholy ending, the jaw-dropping scenes that startled, shocked, and surprised me and the effective use of symbolism (such as the scholar's rock and the peach) are some of the attributes that classify Parasite as a truly essential movie. I definitely want to rewatch this. If you don't give this film a positive review, then you don't know true cinema."
PARASITE,7 September 2019,10/10,"Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie.
Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!"
PARASITE,18 February 2020,10/10,Very suspense and dark humour are glamorously seen. Acting are superb. What a masterpiece. Well deserved Oscar 👍
PARASITE,12 April 2020,8/10,"I am really impressed with the way Mr.Bong has portrayed the characters' characteristics. He showed how much time and effort he had put into the process of making this film.
However, there is one thing that I cannot stand to not wonder. How come a notable family like that cannot afford a single decent camera inside the house? Is it that easy to break into that such private and top-notch accommodation?
Besides that I have no comments on either the storyline, the BGM (which are flawless), the light, the settings, the acting. Everything is great."
PARASITE,30 January 2020,7/10,"Movie isn't necessary a masterpiece if it is foreign movie! and certainly isn't a comedy genre. Movie is aesthetically attractive but it is mostly filmed indoors on two locations.Soundtrack is unnoticeable. I expected much of this movie but than reality kicked soon. After almost 90 minutes of pure boredom, movie suddenly transforms into typical Korean horror movie, which might be appealing to some teenagers but not to me.
Weakest part of movie is unconvincing story.For example: parents are poor,badly educated and unemployed but suddenly,overnight, father becomes perfect personal driver of luxury Mercedes limousine and mother ideal housekeeper.Daughter on other hand has vast knowledge about art history. Nobody knows about house basement/panic room and perfect luxury villa doesn't have a single camera or video surveillance...yeah,right... That's how you make scenarios for typical B-grade horror movie,not for serious melodrama."
PARASITE,31 January 2021,1/10,...is that this fiasco rates above so many amazing movies on the IMBD top 100. This rates better than Casablanca?!? Inglorious Bast*rds?!?! Have our standards really sunk this low?
PARASITE,28 June 2019,10/10,"Social satire movies usually are serious, but Bong made this movie so thrilling & fun to watch. It will both make & ruin your day."
PARASITE,7 November 2019,8/10,"It's a harmonious asian mixture made of black comedy, thriller and psychological movie. It seems that Korean society offers an appropriate frame for this good movie. Young actors are really beautiful."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,9/10,A fantastic story and casting. Movie is all about getting job to a family who are in need for their bread and butter . But some circumstances changes and they lost their family members. It will be great to see this movie on big screen.
PARASITE,27 March 2020,3/10,"A low-class, jobless, loser family unexpectedly turns out to be a bunch of devilishly refined intriguers who invade (like parasites) an innocent high-class family. Many irrealistic turns. The end is both pathetic and ridiculous. The script is both psychologically and socially inane.
What a shame that Kim Ki-Duk the great Korean director has never won an Oscar, and this patchwork has.
All the high-class characters are just humane, and all the low-class ones are corrupt. I'm very surprised reading in reviews and criticisms that this film was leftist or critical about capitalism and inequality in any way. It wasn't. The message is the old high-class commonplace that wealth makes you noble, and poverty ignoble. No question about whether creating such inequalities, wealth, and poverty systematically was noble or ignoble. It's just natural condition, y'know, that's life, a great struggle with winners and losers. The happy end of the film is that one of the parasites finally decides to make money, so everything will be solved.
I'm afraid that this message was the reason why the brave new winner people loved this movie so much, and also why they have all misunderstand it."
PARASITE,21 November 2019,10/10,I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!
PARASITE,18 April 2020,10/10,"It starts off interesting, but you have no idea where it's going. You end up having moments that make you smile from ear to ear, to moments of pure anxiety and borderline horror. The way it carries from scene to scene is seamless. My girlfriend described it as ""a wild ride"", which sums it up very well. Fully deserved all of its awards and acclaim. Highly recommend"
PARASITE,15 March 2020,10/10,"The scenery, the performance, the achitecture, the cast, everything knits tightly together to form a bittersweet -masterpiece if I dare say- film. It's been a while since I saw it, but it stays with you; a must see for sure."
PARASITE,17 March 2021,3/10,"If the guys sense of smell is so fine tuned ( panties in the car), why can't he smell the food and drink stuffed under his couch 1 foot away from him?"
PARASITE,25 July 2020,10/10,"This type of movie is rare to rarest,words are not enough to beautify it"
PARASITE,11 November 2019,9/10,"Parasite is everything you didn't expected it to be. Any advice? Don't take any spoilers and allow yourself to be surprised, and you will be every minute. Bong Jun Ho's film is humoured, ironic, fun, scary and effortlessly touching.
The social side of the movie might seem very subtle, but it's everywhere. There aren't many metaphors to make it seem bigger, everything is neat and effective. This is the kind of movie you didn't expect to come from South Korea, but maybe it's this great because it is from South Korea."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,6/10,"Good? Yup. Best picture? There wasnt even a parasite. I thought I had a tape worn once. That was scary. This movie wasnt scary. I thought it would be so, not what I had in mind."
PARASITE,9 August 2021,10/10,"I have nothing much to write as this film speaks for itself, but I have only ever given 3 films a perfect 10.1. The Shawshank Redemption
2. The Godfather I
3. 12 Angry Men.Guess they are four now!4. Parasite (2019)"
PARASITE,14 October 2019,3/10,"Parasite was just bad movie which got trophy.
if it been spilt up to two section the first was cool but the second one was disappointing and annoying
the main problem is basically on scenario . one of bad characters was the father because he was not a father in the beginnig of movie he was a little idiot but not a father and at the end of it he was a selfish man killing the rich guy just because of bad smell and not for his girl .
overall I can say parasite is a disappointing movie"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"It works on so many levels it means so many things to different people you can see it in the reviews that are across youtube, rottentomatoes, etc.. Everyone has something different that sticks out for them and yet this film blends it so well.I know for a fact that this movie will be considered up there with The Godfather and Pulp Fiction in due time. It only just won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Foreign Film Oscars and people will slowly start studying it more and more. When you see the best analysis channels like Nerdwriter write glowing essays on Parasite you know its hit its mark very deeply.Outward differences aside, this movie IMO is very similar to the ""What Could Go Wrong?"" Genre like in No Country for Old Men, A Simple Plan, but its also such a study and understanding in different socio-economic class, poor vs rich, and its fourth act is very Hitchcock.. This movie will stick with you and I am just glad that I was alive to see this movie. That's how good it is."
PARASITE,7 June 2020,10/10,"I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Unpredictable and very emotional. The bad reviews are from simple minded self made ""movie critics"" unable to comprehend anything deeper. The movie is not bad just because you were bored and didn't understand it."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,10/10,I just finished this movie. This whole movie give an amazing experience. The story is beyond our imagination. The performance of the all cast is just outstanding. It's a must watch for all movie lovers.
PARASITE,6 May 2020,8/10,This has to be the best movie I have ever seen. The performances of every actor and actress is absolutely amazing. The plot of the this film is amazing and the ending leaves it open to what could happen in the future. It is a great mixture of comedy and thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I found myself being sad that it was over when it was done. This will definitely not be a waste of your time and if you do not watch it you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides."
PARASITE,20 November 2019,10/10,"This is true masterpiece
It's unpredictable i love this movie"
PARASITE,5 November 2019,9/10,"Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical.
It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it.
10/10 + Oscar"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,"My God, what an disaster. To much overacting. This movie is such a flop, just like the Oscars nowadays."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,2/10,"Firstly, two warnings:
1. No real spoilers below.
2. My wife and I did not like this film at all (but note we also hated Pulp Fiction and Little Miss Sunshine which were also very popular with many people).The cinematography was excellent. Beautifully filmed and showing bits of Sth Korean life that I had never seen. Of course, some aspects, the unemployed family and the wealthy family themselves were probably atypical.We both thought the story and most scenes were quite ""old style"": trite, contrived and quite trivial. The film didn't venture into slapstick thank goodness but the lines and jokes were simple old ones transposed into a modern setting. I chuckled slightly ONCE during the film. Just not my sort of humour (give me ""Kives Out""). In terms of drama it was a bit like watching grass grow, OK interesting grass but that was all.The ending had a strong message but was executed in a completely over the top and ridiculous manner, and out of all context (style-wise) with what preceded.I can understand why a lot of people loved this film, and laughed a lot (although noone else was laughing in the cinema when we viewed the film). It has some strong elements in it but just dragged out too thinly for me.Worth seeing this film just in case it is your thing."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,7/10,"This is a very good movie, but not a masterpiece. I really like the story and the actors were pretty good. I would never expect this film to win an Oscar. I guess the politics has entered the Oscars for good.
I understand that many will not agree with me, but this is my personal opinion."
PARASITE,20 March 2020,6/10,Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz.
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,"Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,6/10,"It was mildly enjoyable for 3/4 of the film, but the ending felt like another movie was spliced in. Very disappointing ""best picture""....I can't explain why without spoilers, so I won't try."
PARASITE,20 June 2019,10/10,"What a movie ! What a story ! Beautiful , inventive, original, at the end you are on heaven..."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"A movie with much gravitas and profound social issues.We can expect much more from this prodigious director and the stars of this phenomenal movie. Kudos to AMPAS!Hopefully, the Oscar for this film will open the flood gates to more foreign films that have been historically relegated to the ""Foreign Film"" sub-category at the Academy Awards."
PARASITE,12 July 2020,9/10,Very good movie with a simple message. Eat the rich!
PARASITE,19 August 2019,9/10,"First time I watched Bong Joon Ho movie was The Host, a Korean sci fi about the rise of the monster of Han river. The star, a stupid, low class but determine man played by Song Kang-ho. I fell in love with this movie, and then I look for another movies starred by Song Kang Ho, I get Memories of Murder, Taxi Driver and another movie about world war 2 between Korea and Japan.The I realized, most of Song Kang Ho's best movies are directed by Bong Joon-ho, which are not much. This guy is about quality, he doesn't make movie every year. It took 3 years hiatus from The Host to direct the next one, Mother, and it took another 4 years before Bong Joon-ho directed Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton.But Parasite is another masterpiece. It's easily considered as the best movie of 2019. Forget the noisy blockbuster Hollywood action flick. Parasite is a gem, a real gem that only movie lover can appreciate. Carefully directed, smooth dialog, the theme about the class struggle, the acting, the plot, the craziness, the comedic situation, all you could not easily forget.I fall in love with Korean movies because of Bong Joon-ho and Song Kang-ho."
PARASITE,10 August 2020,2/10,"If you watch this movie you will probably like it or love it. Why? Because you are supposed to love it.It's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie.It is completely implausible, slow moving and has very little story.But you will like it. Everyone already told you to like it."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,6/10,"Parasite 6/10... very well made movie but is it the first Korean movie the academy have seen??!
The oscars throwing best international movie, best director, best screenplay and best motion picture at this movie just goes to prove my theory that the Academy are so out of touch and so desperately want to appear ""woke"" and this action by them is just an insult to all the great Korean movies that have come before this and all the other great movies released in the last year.
For me this was an above average South Korean movie but everyone latched onto it as some kind of miracle of modern cinema... Meh academy, meh!"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,This movie rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture. Some think it was entirely political as this is the first ever foreign language film to win this award. I advise them to watch it because you cannot say it didn't deserve an Oscar if you didn't. It's just wonderful and shows how heavily underrated and overlooked Non-English films are.
PARASITE,6 April 2020,10/10,"Could have given 100 on 10
This is one of the greatest movie of this decade"
PARASITE,28 February 2020,10/10,"I was lost in words after watching this movie. You really can't describe this movie except for the word ""perfect"". Just go watch it and you'll understand."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,"*Spoilers alert: Don't watch this review if you haven't seen the movie yet, and give recommendation of this film to all your friends in order to give more visibility about Korean cinema.
This film tell us the story of Kevin, a young adult that lives in poverty with his family and is trying to improve his own life, as well as the ones of his family, by faking his own documents and getting a job into a rich family house as an english teacher.The really positive thing about this film is that It works perfectly as movie and film, due to the combination of black comedy, thriller, and even terror on the second and final act.
This combination of different genres across the film with really good measure makes the film to be really entertaining, and at the same time artistically profound due to the cinematography and use of minimalistic environments and shots that creates a good atmosphere really quicklyI think this movie shows perfectly how we shouldn't believe in the american dream, because the higher amounts of drawbacks that we have against us, it is very likely that we aren't going to reach the ""dream"", and this is really obvious at the end of the movie.
Whatever we think the americano dream is, we have to always remember to ourselves that is just a lie that leads to dissapointment and frustration rather happiness and prosperity.
In resume, if you want to watch an independent film from last year that has a really good story, cinematography and acting, check this one out"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity"
PARASITE,14 April 2020,8/10,A fabulous film but has some defects detracting the film from perfection...
PARASITE,16 November 2020,9/10,"This movie has it all. From a fascinating and creative storyline to intriguing characterisation, Bong Joon Ho captures the prevalent topics of greed and class based discrimination. Although many were not a fan of the films later half, personally I enjoyed the exciting, new developed dynamic that Ho presents. He entertains the viewer through immensely tense scenes that keep one on their toes - wondering where the plot is travelling. One can truly marvel at this accomplishment, and the vast majority of people will, I think, be perfectly content with the way that it finishes."
PARASITE,20 March 2020,10/10,"This movie is the best movie of the year, all scenes are amazing, and it has a very good message"
PARASITE,29 May 2021,10/10,"It's unsettling, it's funny, it's tragic, it's exciting, it's horrifying. This is a movie that will definitely grow on you the more you think about it. I like movies that are both entertaining and meaningful and this was definitely one of them. There are no ""villains"" or ""heroes"" in this story, just three different classes, (upper, lower, and lowest) striving to live while feeding on each other."
PARASITE,2 April 2020,4/10,I am still trying to figure out why would such meaningless movie get such a high ratings. There are thousands of films better than this but end up getting petty reviews.
PARASITE,12 January 2020,1/10,"I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,9/10,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite, a film that truly defines how well a international film can be outside of hollywood"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,8/10,"Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,8/10,"With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already an extremely tense moment rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.With a finely crafted script, true emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,"I couldn't help but be drawn to this movie, after the opening scenes depicting the never ending struggle to find a good wifi signal.
The film shone it's true colors though and expressed what to expect, when a man nonchalantly sprayed the streets with disinfectant, as the family watched on. Followed closely by the family sitting around enjoying a beer. I think someone has caught the Corona virius. The family although quite quirky manage to surgically insert themselves into the lives of another. But they're not the only ones. This dark comedy left little to be desired with a well rounded cast. The ending was straight out nightmare. With a touch of the comidic and a flourish of hope.
Favorite scene: cigarette on the toilet while the house goes under.
Ps. Just be sure to skip the naughty bit at 1hr 28 for the kids."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I was echanted with every twist and turn this movie presented. The pacing and shifts in the storyline melded together beautifully to create a captivating film. This movie is an instant classic that I could watch again and again. Wonderful and fun movie!"
PARASITE,28 April 2020,8/10,"This movie grabs your attention and never lets go. It thrilling to see the characters and learn about society from the interactions between the characters. Talk about endings too, a truly satisfying and unexpected wrap up."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,9/10,"Definitely a movie you cannot judge by just watching it once. During my first watch, I went ""this is an enjoyable movie"" but then--once I got to watch it the next time, I came to see all the metaphorical/visual symbols that Bong Joon Ho ever so masterfully put in the production of the movie. As a Korean speaker, I did not need the subtitles but if you do need them, watching the movie twice (or thrice lol) will help you understand the movie better, because during your first watch, you can focus on the subtitles and during your second, you can pay more attention to all the visual details of the movie. Superb movie"
PARASITE,29 March 2020,10/10,Best movie i like how the plot changes true masterpeice
PARASITE,15 April 2020,10/10,"This movie deserves every bit of attention it has got. Parasite is a surreal experience of luxury, scheming, and deception. I can not wait to see what Bong Joon-Ho has for us next."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,10/10,The movie story was excellent and could be better and I am very sad for ki young death
PARASITE,13 April 2020,8/10,"Intellectually elite people look down on the kind of movies other people watch, the non funny jokes and the try too hard acting but it's not fair to except people to put in their brains in everything they do.
Parasite meets the margins of great acting, direction, cinematography but what is the best thing is that it is not intellectually elite it serves a plain story like a flowing river and everyone can enjoy it. You can be far far away from this river and like it or choose to go into subtleties and like it.
I also am glad that this Oscar winning movie is not just a heap of ache and pain as they usually are."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,9/10,Great piece of cinema but needed less Korean. Was happy with that end scene where everyone got slaughtered because it meant they stopped speaking Korean.
PARASITE,18 April 2020,10/10,Are u kidding me. im speechless. idk have anything left to say. pls imbd let me post this.
PARASITE,19 May 2020,9/10,A remarkable piece of work by Mr. Bong Joon Ho. The narration is so well paced that one is hooked up till the end. The dark humor on class division and how lack money and status can effect a family is very well shown in the film specially in the heavy rain scene. Loved the movies and the performance of every cast is outstanding. It a worth watching movie.
PARASITE,4 May 2020,7/10,"This was may first time to watch Korean movie.
I think this is a modern and national unique movie.
Many scene reflect Korean social problem, for example disparity, diplomaism and so on . Because of these, this movie could be a unique, not following American ones.So i can assent on that this was awarded Oscar, one of the most authoriative movie award.This is not related to evaluation, i noticed that Korean people use english in their daily conversation more frequently than Japanese.
I heard that the importance of English is acknowledged in Korea recently, so many parents make their child to learn English in his childhood.
I guess that these condition appeared in this movie."
PARASITE,7 May 2020,9/10,"The crossroads the characters find themselves at are just crazy! Half-way through, you suddenly feel like you're watching a different movie. And it draws you in completely no matter how badly you sometimes just want to look away. Parasite absolutely deserved all the awards it won. Great filmmaking."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,8/10,"(The article involves spoilers)""Parasites"" released last year is a seemingly ordinary and profoundly won the Palme d'Or masterpiece.There are some intriguing scenes in the movie, which is the episode where father Kize stabs President Park when his daughter loses too much blood. Indeed, a person who seems to be easy-going, why did he start killing at this juncture? Moreover, there is no sign of anger before the murder, let us analyze the large amount of information contained in it from this point.Everyone also saw that part of the reason was the previous action-when President Park picked up the car key under the body of another bottom man, he pinched his nose. This is to avoid smelling the damp odor that he had been staying in the ground for a long time; and this behavior aroused the resentment of his father Keizer. Other than that, I want to say that this is not the only reason. Let us analyze one by one.First of all, President Park 's aversion to the behavior that is temporarily called ""moisture"" seems a bit abnormal at this time: the tutor who was asked by his wife has been stabbed in the heart, and his life is punished. He is saving lives, but at this juncture he still has to avoid the ""bad smell"" of the people at the bottom. This seems a bit abnormal, and some people will think that this is a ""play"". I think this illustrates a point: he is more than unaccustomed, he strongly hates this taste.This action caused Kizawa, who was originally in the camp of President Park, to fall to the camp on the side of the deceased holding the key. Yes, they tried every means to get themselves a job, become a ""parasite"", and gain wealth. They are all private animals, but their encounters are the same. Compared with President Park, he has a class gap.After all, why did President Park strongly hate this damp smell? There is a reason for everything. One of my personal speculations is that President Park was born into an ordinary family, rushed into the upper class by his hard work, and married Mrs. Du who appreciated her talents. This requires a process, and after this process is finally carried out and succeeded, the person who has risen in status will feel aversion to the people in the relatively lower class before him. This aversion is often stronger than the people who are already in the upper class; not to mention him At the time, we were dealing with people from the bottom who were ""lower"" than the civilian class. This layer of disgust is in the bones, so it is so disgusting to smell that smell, which explains the ""abnormal phenomenon"" above. Similarly, the Kize family also experienced a change in status caused by a change in status. Before ""Parasitic"" came to President Park's house, when both parents were in the state of unemployed nomads, they saw that the drunkard outside the window did not dare to provoke peeing at home, or his son's friend, the drunkard roared away. But when they saw the drunkard again after they had a job, they fought hard, feeling that they had a bottom, and felt that their status exceeded that of the drunkard. This also proved that after the promotion of status, they would hate people who stayed in the previous class. Similar stories like Fan Jinzhong received preferential treatment after lifting, too much.Let me say one last thing here. Why do you think President Park is ordinary? The above is just one reason, and many other small details can also prove this point, like being unfamiliar with aristocratic education, and finding tutors for the children are all controlled by Mrs. Du; like when the children are camping on the grass, they are willing to He slept casually on the sofa. Or if you find a foreign object in the car, you can carefully and rationally analyze its origin. This detail is a relatively important quality from the civilian to the upper class. Of course, these are speculations, and there may be other reasons behind these actions. If the personal assumptions are really set by the writers, it can be said that this movie is very intentional and has a lot of details.Returning to the above, in addition to the strong aversion of Kizawa, which led to the scourge of murder, President Park 's behavior also has another layer of relatively comprehension, that is, the whereabouts of the Kizawa family will be exposed. The corpse in front of him was a low-level person before his death, and he could see it on the outside. The smell on his body was similar to the driver, nanny, and two teachers in his home-they could be elegant in appearance, but their heart and some behaviors could not hide their truth Appearance. In addition, Kize was very excited when introducing the babysitter, combined with his own meticulous analysis above, so that he could infer the secret of this ""parasitic family"". Keizer took this into account, so he could only destroy evidence that would prove that they were a family. Similarly, this reasoning also has a small problem. Because her daughter is almost dead, and the hostess sees her husband 's driver suffering from the serious injury of the tutor to this point, it also feels a bit strange. This matter will be exposed sooner or later, so kill Park The president has no way to hide the truth. Killing and not killing, neither of them can stay here for a long time. The grief of losing their daughters can't be restrained. It can only be said that under the circumstances, a blank brain did not allow him to consider so much. The pain and helplessness of Keizer on this frame of the play can be said to be shocking.As mentioned above, there is a gap between strata. This is to say another point. Class differences are insurmountable. Before the homicide, Keizer asked President Park again if he loved his wife deeply, and then President Park took it seriously, shifting the topic and saying, ""Please treat today as an extension of your work."" There are subtexts. The president is unable to stay with his wife every day due to other reasons for his busy work, so he said how much he loved her, and he felt ashamed when answering this question. Being stabbed by someone lower than himself, he felt humiliated, so he said this. This sentence is actually meant to say: you are not suitable to evaluate me, you are not qualified, and it is your job to do your job. Keizer naturally sensed this meaning, he was angry, he was dissatisfied. He was dissatisfied that he had to be treated as a servant. He was dissatisfied with why he was not equal in life. The dissatisfaction with society eventually vented to the dissatisfaction with people, and this anger burned when President Park pinched his nose. Perhaps, at the end of the film, Kize didn't understand why he had to become a ""parasite"" in order to live a good life, and children like Duosong received a good education from an early age. He lacked effort or luck. Of course, he didn't realize that when President Park ""despised"" him, he also ""despised"" the drunkard.I'm afraid this is the weakness of human nature.Therefore, this whole tragedy is accidental and inevitable. Too many reasons, too many fetters, led him to the extreme. The main theme of ""Parasites"" is much higher than it seemed at first glance. Although the whole story is about the dialogue and style of partial comedy, there are some heavy pictures and deep themes behind which are worth thinking about. It is just three simple families, but it contains so many intrigues, which is really surprising and regrettable. Some of these details may never be discovered by us."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,5/10,"I liked only the first 30 minutes or so - the rest is just too... I don't know how to put it, well it's kind of boring most of the time. It's too hyped up. I don't agree with the portrayal of the classes - the rich guys are idiots (how did they become rich), the poor guys are smart and cunning (why are they poor then?) and then we get the ""big reveal moment"" in the movie and from then on it just dies out.There's something not right with the film, I just can't put my finger on in. Intelectually speaking, the film discusses the classic societal and class problems. It's like the ""Malevich Square"", there will be a million different interpretations to it's meaning. I don't know if the director intended for it to be anything deep and to have many different layers - but anyone is free to make his own judgement.I didn't like the ending, it's got the classical blood thirsty ending that so many asian movies have that it's almost cliche.In the end I think it's overrated, this is a solid 5, it's watchable but that's it for me."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,7/10,"This movie feels so-so, far from boasting so good, or I give too great expectations, the result is too big, the plot is too ordinary, and many people hold this film to the altar"
PARASITE,13 June 2020,9/10,Its a good movie with every twist and turns. Scriptwriter has given its best shot with this movie.
PARASITE,2 July 2020,7/10,Parasite is not for everyone.A section of audience will relate to it.It covers almost all genres.
PARASITE,17 July 2020,9/10,"This movie leads us to review the real life between High class and the worst-est level. It is sad to feel actual feeling, but it is real! please spend a little time to watch. It is so worthy!"
PARASITE,10 July 2020,10/10,Bong Joon Ho is a great guy. Really good directing i cant forget this great movie
PARASITE,13 July 2020,8/10,Excellent movie. Very nice plot. Everyone acted well.
PARASITE,7 November 2020,10/10,"Very good story
Excellent actors
Fantastic direction
A complete movie from all points of view
Although I'm not a fan of South Korean films, this film is different from the rest"
PARASITE,17 May 2021,10/10,"This movie is perfect. I have never encountered another film just so flawlessly structured, designed, acted, scripted and just so much more. I never actually new how much a film could cling to me as this one has. There is just so much I love about this film that I can't really put it down in this review, so, if you appreciate the art of film and want to see how beautiful a movie can be, watch this film. Now please."
PARASITE,22 January 2021,9/10,"First off, what an achievement, the Academy don't like to budge easily in their traditional ways so being the first non-English speaking best picture winner is extremely impressive. Very well deserved too.
The film itself is fascinating. I've never watched something that dips into so many genres, it manages them all brilliantly in its own chaotic way. I especially enjoyed the thrilling/dramatic moments and the humour. The family had both my sympathy and my frustration, they were dreadful throughout most of the film but you could argue only as a product of the world they find themselves living in. The film dives deep into the extreme ends of society and it is fascinating viewing how they collide. Highlights include when Mr Park complains of the smell, showing his true colours despite him being nice enough externally. Special mention to Mrs Park who's naivety and obliviousness was very believable.
The ending was excellent and I somehow found myself rooting for the family once again.
Overall, a true masterpiece.
Don't be put off by the subtitles!!"
PARASITE,24 February 2021,9/10,"We have been always fascinated with the Korean movies . But this one is different , it's deep and entertaining full of thrills and surprises. Recommend watching for a night"
PARASITE,26 February 2021,8/10,"This movie is being raved about everywhere and has won numerous awards and I'm still pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. At first I wasn't sure what to make of it but I soon realized an hour after watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Everything is really solid and I can't think of much that I can point out and say that is wrong with the movie, it's the culmination of a bunch of really great individual pieces coming together to create something bigger - the whole is greater then the sum of its parts. I went in basically blind and I hope any future fans do too but if you're not convinced, tight and unique story, very suspenseful, and charming characters. If any of what I just said sounds interesting, you should go watch this movie. I'm only giving it 8 stars because while I think the movie is great, it doesn't show itself noticeably excel at anything that other movies don't, still very solid and I would highly recommend."
PARASITE,4 April 2021,9/10,"This film is great. It is good at what it tried to be. The performances are good but a bit overreacted in my opinion, that's the only drawback this film has. The shots/ camera work is phenomenal. The directing is great and the storyline is perfect. This is a film where the second time you watch it the better it gets. There are so many themes in this film and objects that are placed on purpose to convey a message. This film is manly about crossing boundaries and the status difference from these two families. Smell also plays a big role in this film. Smell is a way that the rich family differs from the poor family. The rich family see them as parasites.Great film not overhyped and a entertaining watch."
PARASITE,10 March 2021,10/10,The way this movie quickly escalated made it a must watch totally worth it.
PARASITE,28 June 2021,9/10,"I have very low experience with films that have subtitles or are dubbed. This one is my first and will definitely not be my last.I watched this with subtitles and never lost track of anything and enjoyed this quite a lot. The acting was great, the suspense is constant and you never know what is going to happen next.Great film and highly recommend."
PARASITE,4 October 2021,10/10,I seen this movie about a year ago now & i still think about it almost daily.
PARASITE,23 September 2021,9/10,"This movie did not dissapoint. A lot of people think the movie drops the comedy and starts going full thriller at the second half, but this movie still doesn't ditch the comedic tone of the film. I honestly think it does a great job at displsying both genres, both being exciting and funny at the same time. 2nd favourite movie of the year."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a good, dark, comedy.But it's not worthy of Oscar Best Picture."
PARASITE,31 December 2019,8/10,"Make no mistake, this movie is hugely entertaining. Until it turns macabre without a warning. Minutes to the end, things took a sudden twist for the worst, leaving me to wonder ""what in the world just happened?""I naturally rooted for the ""parasite"" family. They're shameless and wicked to the bone, and some of their tricks were so hilarious I nearly choked laughing.In this kind of movies, it is expected that the fall is never too far from the rise. I sort of knew that our heroes would run out of luck sooner or later and things would turn sour. Alas throughout the late turmoil, I anticipated some sort of silver lining which, sadly, never came to pass.Call me naive but how, why should a movie this good leave such a bitter taste in your mouth?"
PARASITE,12 October 2019,10/10,"In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,10/10,"I spent some time with the movie ""Parasite"" tonight. It captured me in it's symbiotic web. I'm sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequately...so I won't attempt that magficent accomplishment. Parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy, literature and Korean (yes...I do have a very tiny bit of that :) ) The set design was amazing...and it may give 1917 a run for it's money.The stairs...oh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of ""metaphors"" (yeah, I made myself giggle on that one.) I was instantly reminiscent of my Philosophy 101 ""Allegory of the Cave""....""I went down."" Thank you Herr Hanak.Okay, I've lost all of you, I loved this movie for the Best Foreign Film...mostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possible...I will have nightmares about the gnawing, they chatted and checked their phones throughout...then they pottied and were able to read the screen....and then they seemed confused. Wonder why.My feeling about awards..knowing the methodolgy of the voting....this film will not be best picture on Oscar night."
PARASITE,2 May 2020,9/10,"I just watched ""Parasite"" last night on a Netflix DVD, and I can now see why it won so many film industry awards! Wow -- it was wickedly funny and darkly disturbing at the same time. A unique plot with top-notch acting & directing. I highly recommend it!!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,7/10,"I don't know what the fuss is all about this movie. After I watched the Oscars and to my surprise an Asian film lifting the top prize left me puzzled and at the same time very much excited. I immediately downloaded it and saw it in the middle of the night, the very same day. I won't say it's no good. It is brilliant but Oscar brilliant!!!! That's doubtful.Our society is not equal and it can never be. That's the fact and we have to live with it. Just imagine a predator and a prey playing equal in mother nature. Chaotic, right?Very well cinematographed, written, directed and acted but it was just unbelievable to always see rich guys play dumb and easily gullible. They are not like that. And poor and hungry always menacing, opportunistic type which is also stereotypical. Oscars is all about breaking the stereotype but the train has derailed I guess. So disappointed. There were a lot of films better then this one."
PARASITE,6 April 2020,5/10,"The poor is ""clever"". The rich is dumb. There's no depth in almost any of the characters. Every one in this movie has a paper thin character that only serves a very superficial role. Not to mention all the plot holes that can't last 3 seconds of thinking.Setup is nice, but the poor mooched half way through but the progression stopped by the intrusion of the 2nd parasite. Right after the serious of incident all the tention they built up got washed away, instead of let it escolate to a meaningful conflict it resolved in a chaotic farce.It's a nice topic and the setup has it's pretentials. But they end up with shooting the pellet with less than half berral of powder.It's a ok movie, but way far off from winning an award."
PARASITE,2 May 2020,10/10,Its nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting and writing is just excellent. There is never a dull moment in the movie. It is one of those movies where you never have to look at the watch to see how much time has passed by. The class struggle is brought out in a humorous way that is dark and disturbing at the same time. The characters seem very real and remain fresh in memory long after the movie is over. A must watch Korean film.
PARASITE,18 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft."
PARASITE,26 September 2019,10/10,"This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!"
PARASITE,12 February 2021,10/10,"What an incredible film. I'm not even going to talk much about it in detail because I just want to encourage others to watch it. It shouldn't be detailed, just watched. It was perfect from top to bottom. It gets everything it wants to accomplish right, and does it in such an in your face yet subtle way. The class struggle, the strong bond of family, happiness, love, teenage angst, motherhood, pain, loss, just all of it. One of the best films of this generation, and I don't think I give away that kind of praise easily."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,8/10,"This movie paints a picture of necessity. One family needs to survive, another to to thrive, and when the tempo clash, there will be casualties on both sides. Life goes on for both families, but it shows that the less fortunate are more prone to violence."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,5/10,"I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10.
I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
PARASITE,17 January 2020,9/10,"Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay.
The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers."
PARASITE,18 May 2020,10/10,"What can I say, I'll keep it quick.1. I knew within a few minutes this film was going to be excellent, we all have that feeling when we know if something is going to be exceptional.2. Some of the dialogue was so hilarious I was literally crying with laughter, bordering on the genius some of the interactions were incredible, and that was just the subtitled version, in Korean I am sure it would have been mind-blowing.3. It's the kind of film you will never forget, it is so truly unique I am fearing a Hollywood remake.4. Cinematography was often breathtaking.5. Acting was so good I'd call it perfect."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,9/10,"If you liked Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, then you'll definitely enjoy this South Korean masterpiece. (Note Mr Trump: in Korean with subtitles, but easy to follow subtitles!)
I don't want to add any spoilers, so I'm restricting my comments.
This is a story of a poor, struggling clever family that manage to inveigle their way into a wealthy family's life. The plot goes well until..."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,10/10,I don't know how to start this I'm speechless!!I don't want to spoil anything but WATCH IT!!
PARASITE,22 February 2020,6/10,"I'm sure I'll get hated to the hill for this, but this wasn't a masterpiece. It was well acted, from what I could tell. Without knowing Korean, it's certainly possible I'm missing nuances of language that I correct in my own mind through the subtitles. I've seen others defending the second half of the movie, but that really is where it goes off the rails. We were enjoying it up until the party started. Then nothing makes much sense. It completely separates the plot into 2 distinct movies, the 2nd of which isn't that good. The movie explains most of its ""nuance"" and ""message"" with plot devices that work out ""just right"" to explain themselves. But they're just plot devices. And the end plays out as if we're supposed to be happy at the reunion? He killed someone that did nothing to him, except tell his own wife ""he smells.""Snowpiercer and Train to Busan were better movies, tho they suffered from the same ""poor ending"" problem. But those endings were 5-10 minutes long, not 30. All in all, I really wanted to love this like everyone else does, but neither myself nor my wife did, come the end. I understand subtlety, but it really seems like people are digging so deep for it, that they're applying things that even the director never intended. Maybe that's the ""abstract"" nature of it, I'm not Roger Ebert."
PARASITE,27 June 2019,10/10,"Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,6/10,"This movie got the stellar reviews just because the PC crowd got pi**ed off that Joker took all the limelight. There had to be a ""counter-balace"" and this movie got hyped.
The first half is overly melodramatic and ""funny"" as in American Pie type funny, and the latter half at the very best portrays some of the struggles of Korean society-presented in a weird and almost Twilight Zone-ish way. But that's litetally it! Besides the sudden plot/atmospheric twist there is little else. Imagine if K-pop was a movie, and the last part of the tune turns to a Metallica song. That's this movie in a nutshell. It was not bad, but all the stellar reviews are give it way too much credit. Joker won, the rest is just attempts to br de jour."
PARASITE,6 June 2020,6/10,"The acting is great, humour is funny and the first half of the movie is so enjoyable, it has everything you want and is one of those that has you asking questions as to how the family can keep this going. Sadly ending of the movie just takes this film downhill way too fast and the final 20 minutes or so is just odd and disjointed. What happens to the wife, daughter and son who lived in the house? what about Min? Surely he returned from his travels? It's like the writer had the perfect idea all the way up to the killing off of characters and then didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. They instead just play on the political message about the gaps in wealth and class which is why I think this film appealed to the Oscar's."
PARASITE,22 May 2020,4/10,"I'm torn on how to rate this. The acting was good, the cinematography was pretty amazing, and I was captivated by the plot, but I just really didn't like the story.Most of the characters seem like terrible people. At first they were fine, dude was taking a job. All good, he helped his sister get a job by lying. Eh, fine whatever. Then getting other people fired to take their jobs... and then it all ends in murder? I'm not confused by the plot, but rather confused about why people love this so much. Granted, it's probably just not my thing. I tend to not like movies where most of the characters are terrible people and there's basically no redeeming qualities. Classics that people love, ""Gone with The Wind"" and ""Grease"", are two movies I hate.
This movie did nothing for me, other than leaving me confused on it's point. If you loved it, that's fine. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, or people who like it, I just don't get the hype.After watching a video explaining the themes a bit more, I decided to add two more stars to my rating. I understand the themes and why they are important, but this movie isn't for me."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,,"I fail to see the greatness of this movie. Yes, it's a good one, no doubt about that, and I've certainly enjoyed watching it. However, I feel it's quite overrated and often predictable."
PARASITE,4 April 2020,7/10,"Well watched it on Amazon Prime. It's clearly a story on Survival, Greed and Realisation. It's a one time watch not worth Oscar , sometimes its too funny to understand on what basis do the Oscars decided on Best Movie"
PARASITE,1 August 2019,10/10,"PARASITE: The new Bong Joon-ho film that may be the best he's made and a hopeful contender for the best of the year.First of, the dialogue is brilliant. With it constantly working on multiple levels, first making you understand and care about these characters, then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale. This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human, there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen. Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves, lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they're pretending to be and because of their fantastic set-up, you're able to immediately tell when they're being themselves or not on the turn of a dime.It manages to always perfectly balance it's comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones, always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven't experience all year.The political satire and themes on class struggle are too, fascinating, they're intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think, so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone, you're free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want.Joon-Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013). Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product, but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters, rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about.By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story, when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they're affecting character's you understand and like, and secondly they're then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too.Even if you were to purely watch this without wanting to think about social satire, it's still an unbelievable film. It takes you on a mysterious thrill ride with some of the most interesting and unique characters put to screen this decade, the story goes to places you would never dream it would, and the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it. It's a mile a minute masterpiece from one of the most exceptional auteur directors working today and was more than worthy of taking the Palme d'Or - 10/10"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,5/10,"I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste too much time on this one. It's okay. No more no less. Okay to watch on a rainy Sunday, as I did, but at no point did it impress. It was quite boring at times although I did finish it with some effort. It's not a bad film but one thing is absolutely clear: it's unworthy of it's Best Movie Oscar! Don't know what the academy was thinking, but this is clueless.."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,5/10,"This is just an average movie with a sadistic story and with a sadistic message and no morale. The director here has made the villains into heroes . He is trying to show the world the good , decent and innocent people are the real paracite of the world just becuase they are rich. The director feels that being rich and having maids, cooks, teachers, drivers is being a paracite !!!!
The villain family who is poor and cheap , they do not have any morals. They are souless beings. They just kill and lie to make themselves enter into a good man's home and his life.So here the bad people are shown as winners and good people are really nice but they are brutally killed and cheated.What is the motive or such filthy storyline. ???There is nothing special about the movie.I feel that those who give 10/10 are the people who feel that everything is fair in this world to rise at top .Do you want to set such example for your kids and future ???
Put yourself as the rich guy shown in the movie, who dies brutal death without any reason . Do you feel the good vibes after seeing the movie??"
PARASITE,19 March 2020,6/10,"I do not think this is a grate movie. The owner of the house totally believes the driver, and others too. at the final stage why the driver is stabling the owner? because he doesn't t like the smell of the t- shirt of the driver?
stupid story. but end looks realistic."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"I actually fast forwarded the movie after climax. Still can't fathom how ki-woo's father didn't notice his son laying down blooded while entering the basement after commiting atrocity in the backyard? How ki-woo figured out that his father ""might"" be hiding in the basement all along."
PARASITE,15 May 2020,7/10,"Parasite tells a quite surreal story which could absolutely happen. The characters are realistic, I liked how nobody is a clear good guy or bad guy. On the other side maybe you need to be the part of Korean culture to fully appreciate it, but for me it didn't hold that emotional drama that many other viewers liked. It wasn't that funny in the comedic scenes, and other than the social cass divide which is seen in many other movies it wasnt really deep either. Overall a good movie, but did not deserve the oscars it got, especially considering Jojo Rabbit was another contender for best picture, and in my opinion blew out Parasite from the water in every regards"
PARASITE,8 April 2020,2/10,This is a real bad movie. Nothing makes sense. There is no strong story or something to focus on. Its a waste of time !
PARASITE,26 July 2020,9/10,"The movie parasite has many aspects to look for. It shows a new way to perceive you everytime you see it. But maybe the most relavant aspects is of it's political perspective. The movie throwout its storyline shows a series of scenes and act that portrays modern day society. In present times it's noteworthy that the differences of classes is real, and with time the difference of class is growing more and more. Capitalism has rooted it's way into almost everything and anything.The whole movie meaningfully describes two properties of capitalism, rather specifically neoliberal capitalism, these are ""Cool Capitalism"" and ""Cultural Hegemony"".The former is stated by Jim Mcguigan in his ""The coolness of capitalism today"". It describes the way the rich are unaware or rather ignorant about the actual condition of the society and that about the condition of the not so privileged.
In the movie, there's a scene where Mr. Kim is driving, and in the backseat there's Mrs Park, who says yesterday's night was a pleasant one, in a parallel scene one can see the devastation on the poor. Another example is in the same scene where Mrs Park says there's a bad smell, and this increaes as the movie goes on. Mary Douglass states ""There's no things as absolute dirt, it exists in the eyes of the beholder"", i.e its a social sature that is used to prove someone lesser than someone else. This part shows how the rich are unaware of the cost or labour given for their privileges by people who are below them in this capitalist society. This sums up as a fact that the people benifited by this capitalist system often distance themselves from the have nots both metaphorically and physically. They don't want to smell anything that will remind them of poverty or maybe on which they are feeding.The effects of late capitalism is the ever growing distance between the rich and the poor even in aspect of culture and lifestyle. Antonio Gramsci calls this as the Cultural Hegemony.
Throwout the movie Mr. Park describes about a line that he always keeps and loves to kept by any of his employees between him and them. He describes this as ""professionalism"" but what this actually means is that he cuts out a division to maintain his status of supiority. Cultural hegemony which favours the rulling class, always teaches to aspire the supirior. This can be seen in present day advertisement, and how everyone wants to acquire the dominant status. The same is portrayed in the movie by the scene where the poor family gets a chance to live in the Park house and enjoys themselves as the rich.The very end of the movie shows us a scene where Ki-woo has earned enough money to buy the rich house and afterall free his father, however this momentary happiness is dissolved as its reveiled that it was just as aspiration made by boy in a letter to his father. Furthermore in an interview Bong Joon-ho says keeping in mind the family's economic condition, it would take 564 year to buy that house. This is contrary to the idea of capitalism in America that ""A little hardwork can get you anything you want to achieve"", although the reality is that the rich gets richer in an illusion of social mobility. In the end part of the movie, after all the horor is gone, it is seen that the rich gets off from all the trouble, but the poor is trapped and diseased. In this society the poor are often faced with competition and struggle and are forced to fight between themselves for their living but theirs no attempt or ability to overthrow the prevailing system of domination.This is also portrayed beautifully by the scene where the two poor families fight to get a hold of the phone and thus make their stay in the house.Thus to sum everything up, its to be said that if one looks at the movie in a normal way it is shown how the poor is feeding up on the rich, i.e the poor are the parasites to rich.
But if one is intelligent enough, it can be pointed out that the rich are comparebly more parasitic to the poor. The poor are often poor because the capitalist system (companies) is unwilling to compensate fair wages for them in order to maximize their own profits.""Capitalism has neither the capacity, nor the morality, nor the ethics to solve the problems of poverty.""

PARASITE,12 July 2020,1/10,Don't believe the hype. This is a crass pretentious movie pretending to be a serious story about class struggle. It's obviously made by luvvies in the Korean film industry clique. The ending proves this theory.
PARASITE,9 June 2020,9/10,"This is a movie that is hard to categorize. It is a category of its own in my opinion. I thought the movie was great, different and unexpected. I don't have the cultural context but still was able to enjoy it. It wasn't the best movie I watched but I am glad I watched it. Dare I say the movie is a masterpiece."
PARASITE,7 January 2020,4/10,"This is not about social inequality. This is about a bunch of con artists who take advantage of a naive wealthy family. Its story is convoluted, far too long, and people are grasping to find depth. I've already wasted too much time on this so I'm not writing anything further."
PARASITE,6 July 2019,1/10,"A very boring movie, waited for so long for the movie to end quickly. I was expecting something more at the start of the movie, but it ends up getting more and more unwanted to watch."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,3/10,"A true master piece is in which one cannot pin point the the mistake of the situation.
Here they get into the family by lie so thats it. The bubble already busted as if anything goes South it's Thier fault. U can't expect someone to be good even when u are wrong.
The story is ok little twist n bla bla but killin the rich is not justify in any case..."
PARASITE,21 March 2020,9/10,"The story looks very simple but it takes you from top level to bottom level in just a minute,so you can have very different feelings at the same time like a real life. WATCH AND SEE !!!"
PARASITE,15 January 2020,10/10,"With a masterful script and Bong Joon-Ho's (usual) brilliant direction, this film is easily one of the best of the year. The entire cast give amazing performances which keep you gripped and thats the main difference between this and Roma. I myself am not usually one for foreign films so if your first attempt at a foreign film was Roma and you found that a chore to sit through as I did, I urge you to watch Parasite. You won't be disappointed and the trailers do it absolutely no justice. Definitely a best director and best picture contender at the Oscars this year."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,"I had no expectations before watching Parasite, it's truly one of the best films of 2019. My love and affection for this film is just like every other great movies I've watched.
The film also takes a dig at meritocracy, the humor in the film is quite outstanding. Kang-Ho Song has played his played his character with near perfection and the narration is just as good. All in all this is just a masterpiece!"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"Not just a movie it's beautiful like a painting every scene, every shot, every moment is breathtaking and background score is apt and haunting....Bong Joon ho is the man"
PARASITE,25 January 2020,9/10,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar.
The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo.
Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film.
Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."
PARASITE,5 January 2021,10/10,The aptly named film Parasite is a tour de force. The aptly named title shows the ways that class struggle and poverty feeds on every frame of the film and colors the interactions between each and every one of the characters.
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"Your intrest, your excitement builds in every scene. One of the best screenplay. This was my first Korean movie to watch and it stole me."
PARASITE,4 May 2020,9/10,"Clever, darkly funny, original & thoughtful movie about a destitute family who see an opportunity to exploit a rich one. Thoroughly recommend it. Little chance of Hollywood producing anything of this quality any more."
PARASITE,20 August 2019,10/10,"The Parasite is nothing short of masterpiece, proof that asian directors are one of best in the world. It is also well acted. All actors did amazing job. The main theme is social classes. Some scenes, especially the evening when it rained, were devastating. But beside that I found family relationships to be very good represented."
PARASITE,15 October 2021,7/10,"Lots of reviews complain of a lack of realism and plenty of comments cover the 'intellegent' and 'clever' social aspect of the movie.I think people lost something in translation somehow. This is a black comedy and it's a pretty funny one at that. Think Severance with slighly less gore and a sprinkling of Faulty Towers. The only peice that felt out of place for me was the ending which was much too sentimental to fit the movie (I think black comedies are notoriously hard to end fittingly anyway).The 'class' thing plays a role in the movie simply to support it's outrageous plot. True, it surfaces in the end between Mr Park and Kim but it's never explored intellectually enough to hang your hat on.An intriguing plot, plenty of good acting (Song Kang-Ho the pick), some good scripted banter that translated well and some very good cinematography. (I do have to say the one sex scene is actually quite graphic and ,although there is no nudity, is more akin to a Korean soft porn movie!)Go into this film willing to take it at face value and you'll probably enjoy it. 7.6."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,10/10,This was a weird movie but intriguing. It kept my interest and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
PARASITE,28 April 2020,7/10,"In my view it is neither too good nor too bad
But somwhere in middle"
PARASITE,6 May 2020,10/10,Definitely one of the best movies you can watch from 2019
PARASITE,23 February 2020,10/10,One of the best films I've ever seen.Technically perfect with a great story which moves effortlessly from humour to social commentary to tragedy.The best film of the year.
PARASITE,9 February 2021,9/10,"I can't believe some people were complaining about having to watch with subtitles, they're missing out. We first get to know the two families at the start of film and as time passes, we wonder how long this relationship is going to last. This movie portrays the struggles the poor face and the obliviousness of the wealthy. At the same time, it manages to make us feel sorry for both of these families despite their class differences. Overall, great film to watch with the many perspectives and symbolism."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,9/10,"I had all the feels while watching this movie. It expresses the brutal reality in the most surreal yet real form. One of the best movies of the decade and the acting was superb. Personally I would prefer more storyline explained for ex; how did the family become so rich, where did the poor family come from, what kind of a childhood they had etc in order to understand the psychology behind the actions of the characters. Maybe if it was a mini-series it would have been a better idea!? But as I said it's my personal opinion. Overall my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the movie. 8.5"
PARASITE,18 February 2020,3/10,"Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,After seeing this I am not liking any other movie
PARASITE,26 January 2020,10/10,"Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie"
PARASITE,13 December 2019,1/10,"Good, interesting movie, however a little bit overhyped. Awful acting. Good story, bad ending."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,"But all i could think throughout was, ""you mean to tell me they dont have any security cameras in that house?""
A wealthy protective family just lets strangers tutor their kids behind closed doors in bedrooms? Security camera outside and a secure front door camera but nowhere else.
Otherwise a fun, intense ride"
PARASITE,7 May 2020,3/10,"If this film has won 4 Oscar awards then it means that the world of the big screen is changing, because it is a nice film but it is not a masterpiece that everyone is showing, films like scarface, last tango in paris, once upon a time the west did not win an oscar and this film won four gentlemen i am shocked"
PARASITE,10 August 2019,9/10,"The film is perfect especially I checked twice the sence which the rain destroy the Home of Poor family and they did not have any place to go but in the Other hand for rich people the rain just make the weather better and the day after rain when Rich mother go to the city with poor driver she said : it is just blue Sky after rain night . the camera show a shot in Poor driver eyes who lost all his house because of the rain.
all people who involve making this movie ... thank you
we are waiting for another movie from you"
PARASITE,13 August 2020,,"Parasite was a great movie...one of those movies that you still think about days after you've finished watching it. I loved how it was in Korean - it felt like a glimpse into a different culture. The story especially was chock full of literary devices. The symbolism of the water, starting with the money rock being given to the family as a gift for good fortune, was prevalent throughout the movie. Beginning with a small stream (from a drunkard peeing outside their home) and culminating in the night that changed the Kim family forever (torrential storm that ended up flooding their house).The circular nature of the narrative was also satisfying but haunting. The irony was not lost on me that they discovered the man living in the basement of the Park family, only to have Ki Taek ended up living there himself after he killed Dong Ik. The parallels between the Park and Kim families were only enhanced by how different each family was. Two parents, a boy, and a girl - but from completely different walks of life.I wasn't expecting the story to go where it went...I wouldn't have imagined the slaughter at the end of the movie watching the first 1:30, which made it all the more surprising and meaningful. Parasite was certainly worth of winning best picture, and is a movie you'll think about long after you've watched it."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,1/10,It's terribly terrible i really hate it I don't understand the high ratings
PARASITE,19 February 2020,2/10,"Parasite is a rare movie -
the kind of movie that compels one to sit and admire.........the hype around it.
the film maker had faith in the audience's stupidity levels to appreciate whatever garbage he felt like throwing in the movie.
I saw this movie back in October 2019, much before its hype and while the first half of the movie is intriguing, it takes a downward spiral after that with its foolish plot.
*Spoilers*
mix of cliche / indigestible scenarios e.g. infiltrator family becomes uncannily cunning and smart as they take up one job after the other.
a man staying in the basement, for years, unnoticed.
infiltrator family's overboard feast while the owners are away, and guess what? home owners return right at the moment (who could have predicted that!).
the people living in the basement using morse codes via a light bulb for looong messages, but the owners never bothering to fix the light bulb.
and then there is the climax scene with killings... purely weird, unbelievable and nonsensical.While overall the movie is ok, esp in the first half, but it definitely doesn't deserve the attention that its getting. This is explained in director's interview where he says he spent 2-3 years on writing the first half..... and the second half and especially the climax, he wrote in 2-3 months as if he was possessed (high IMO).
Such an attention is a disgrace to the other good movies out there over all these years that never got nominated/won an oscar. Its a dark joke on other movies."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,1/10,Calling this movie dreck does a disservice to dreck. Message is simple: Wealthy people crazy and evil. Poor people understandably crazy and evil. Only redeeming quality is dramatic twist at halfway point but even this soon resolves into poor people crazy and understandably evil. Watched this because I had heard it had comedic elements and it had one if you think a pratfall is funny. Hopefully the only reason this got Oscar talk is to prove non-xenophobic cred of the Academy. Please stay away from this grossly overrated dose of depression.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,An unexpected journey through an ironic a tragic account.
PARASITE,14 April 2020,10/10,What an awesome movie plot! Really enjoyed this movie
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is one of the best movies I have seen. This is not an arguable fact at this point, it is so well made and the story line is brilliant. The attention to detail in this movie astounds me. Every single thing has meaning, from the levels of the house to even the portrait that Da Song paints when he is younger, which looks more like Geun-sae than a self portrait. I really appreciate the commentary on the different classes, and how their perspectives are changed through dialogue, through clothing and even through lighting. The whole idea of how the upper class will only take action when something affects them is so prominent, with the Parks not even aware of the troubles of their workers until it affects them. And, even when they do find out, they only do what will help them and their kind, picking up Da Song and even stepping over a girl who has just been stabbed. It's such a stunning movie and I give it the utmost praise.
Another thing this film comments on is the idea of the American Dream. At the end of the film, Ki-woo has an idea of working hard and buying the house that his father is trapped in. That is what the American Dream is, the idea that if you work hard and get an education, you can achieve everything. However, this will probably never happen for Ki-woo. It's mentioned at the beginning that he has been denied from schools in the past, but he thinks this time will be different. But it's the tragic truth that it probably won't be different. If it were, the film wouldn't end with that being a dream. It would cut off one shot earlier, with the father hugging his son, and then it ends. But there is that final shot, establishing that it's just goal that he won't be able to achieve. And so he starts off how he did at the beginning of the movie, socks hanging above his head and him sitting at his kitchen table in a basement."
PARASITE,30 January 2020,9/10,I'll keep this brief. This film is best enjoyed sans spoilers. Stellar cast-not one weak performance in this film. Superbly done.
PARASITE,13 May 2020,9/10,Story is good nd it tells you that if u lie to anyone and take advantage of anyone u will face it one day thats the truth
PARASITE,3 November 2019,10/10,"This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,"Just seen the film. Yes, it is good piece of cinematography. Telling story of different worlds people live in. Separate social bubbles. But what afterthoughts do we have while leaving the cinema?""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer""? Obvious truths. Nothing new we didn't knew about. Sterile environment of upper class, cockroach life of underprivileged. Dullness of these which have and hopelessness of these which don't. Characters without depth put into roles they were born into.Some symbolism justifying incostinant and improbable plot, but is there enough reason for its application? I see very little."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,,"Parasite on a building-site... I think this is one of the greatest films of all-time, when viewed in a mirror. Then you can see how honest the director has been. The actors with their performances their product-placement. Top-notch all round. Five stars!!!!!"
PARASITE,26 March 2020,9/10,"Expertly crafted, brilliantly acted, and inspiringly original, Parasite brings Bong joon-ho, Korean class disparity(which can be a little heavy handed sometimes), and international film to the main stage. Every setup, every edit, is perfectly edited to establish a whirlwind of internal emotion.A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 9/10"
PARASITE,2 March 2020,1/10,This movie is crap. Sorry guess I'm not woke enough to understand how this is the Best Picture. What a crock.
PARASITE,29 April 2021,6/10,"Has nothing special going for it. Sure, it's good at times but there's a lot of thrillers out there that are good at times and most of them don't get a tenth of the praise this movie got.Slow, mildly interesting first act. Thrilling second act. And the third act feels a bit try-hard with and an almost ON YOUR FACE piece of social commentary, and a 25th Hour rip-off of an ending.All in all, it's not a bad film by any account, but it's certainly not as good as everyone's making it to be."
PARASITE,21 May 2020,9/10,"Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!"
PARASITE,14 July 2020,10/10,"Even if subtitles aren't your thing, you can enjoy this. Great story, so unique and well thought out. Honestly, it's creative storytelling at its best. From the opening scene to the outstanding ending, it's just a great ride."
PARASITE,18 December 2019,9/10,Amazing movie with a great story. Actors do the good work. Screenplay and Direction got highest marks. Music is cool and thrilling. Atleast one time watch.
PARASITE,31 May 2020,8/10,"I watched the movie knowing how much praised it was, so the expectations were pretty high. I really liked the 1st half of the movie, the one establishing the whole ""deception"" situation . It was very smart and had 100% of my attention drawn to it. I consider the moment when the family sits at the living room and the doorbell rings a chasing point for both the plot and my overall view of the movie. It turned really weird really fast, with some small plot-holes (as of my own perception).
I'd give a 9,5 to the 1st half of the movie, to the other half probably a 7. Still, decent movie overall, good acting, interesting idea, nice music and picture...it deserved the oscars it received, no doubt about that.
And cinema is indeed a nice way to learn the culture of each country through the stories that are being told every time. I mostly watch European and American movies, so it was very interesting watching a Korean movie, and i did pick up some traces of their culture. Stonks!!!"
PARASITE,5 October 2019,10/10,"I thought that it is kind of black joke things. Satirizing the polarization, poverty or bad condition of society is the things that i had imagined befrore i saw the movie. Did you also expect that? My answer is it'll never happen.After the movie i feel like someone punch my head, and then i feel so bad at something that ican't explain what exactly it is.Highly recommeded to see it."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,1/10,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one."
PARASITE,29 December 2019,10/10,This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,2/10,"I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers came from but this is definitely not a fantastic movie. The characters seem stereotyped and lacking depth. I tried, I often go to see movies that don't fit the box office genre but in my opinion, this year's award was looking for one of this genre, rather than it being a top movie deserving an award."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite was one of the best films of 2019. It engaged the audience by building tension slowly throughout the first half, then having everything come crashing down throughout the second half, as if in slow-motion. One of my favourite aspects of this was that, as Mr. Kim says in the latter half of the film, there was no plan to their actions. This way, the audience doesn't know what's happening until it's over, and that might suggest that the Kims don't either. Still, the rush that I felt when I figured out pieces of their plan is difficult to find in most films. Two examples of this are when Mr. Kim poured the hot sauce onto the tissue, to trick Mrs. Park into firing her housekeeper under suspicion of tuberculosis, or later in the film when they hide under the table from the Park family. I'm pretty sure I audibly gasped when Mr. Kim lifted up the tissue with 'blood' on it.
An important thing to note is that the film, though made in Korea, represents the futility of the American Dream in a way that I've never seen before. When I say 'American Dream', I mean the ideal that if you work hard enough, you can become rich and successful. Both the Kims and the Parks, I would say, are living in fantasy worlds of this ideal. The Parks believe that they've worked hard to get where they are, and therefore deserve household employees who don't smell like a basement. The Kims, on the other hand, hold the belief that working hard will someday get them where the Parks are, figuratively and literally. No one believes this more strongly than Ki-woo, the son of the Kim family. This is shown throughout the film, from even before he first gets the job as an English tutor, when he's trying to get a job with the pizza delivery driver. Once he gets the job, he believes it's his way out and he can save enough money for college. The worst part about this is that he still holds this belief at the very end of the movie, when he writes a letter (that he has absolutely no way to send) to his dad. The letter describes this exact ideal; if Ki-woo works hard and goes to university and makes money, he can buy the house his father is hiding in, and literally be where the Parks were at the start. Since he's already been rejected from college multiple times, and South Korean real estate is crazy expensive, it would be impossible for him to achieve this goal, but he still believes he can. This is, in my opinion, the saddest part of the movie. Since this is how it ends, it leaves the viewer contemplating whether he could actually achieve his dream of saving his father, which makes the film much more powerful."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,8/10,"Its many wins and Oscar nominations should be enough to summarize the film Parasite as it was put on a pedestal at this year's academy awards due to its incredible cinematography and well written script. Going into watching the film, I had many high expectations, as I was aware of its at that time many nominations and high praise by those who had seen the film. I was quickly let down to realise that although these many things were true about the film, I found it to be a very long two hours to sit down and watch the film. Perhaps this was because of its slow establishment at the start, or maybe the film was just not something that I would normally be interested in, but I didn't enjoy it. I was really disappointed by this, because it was clear that the incredible production that went in to the film was truly something to set it apart. As far as the movie goes, I thought that it was very strong, the script seemed to be very developed for its nature, and the camera work was beautiful. For me, the plot just didn't grab my attention, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys films of a similar genera. Above the high praise that critics seemed to pick out about the film, its main theme seemed to center around the American Dream. In my opinion I believe that the film did in fact summarize the American Dream. Not only did the characters acquire wealthy jobs, but they managed to stick together as a family. Although their financial situation could have been handled in much better ways, I believe that the bond that they created as a family is definitely the epitome of a dream, as money can't always buy you happiness."
PARASITE,19 April 2020,9/10,"An unexpected storyline which tells a lot about society in South Korea or capitalism at all? Definitely different from Hollywood movies as we know todays, very artistic with well designed environment. Made me feel tensed like movies 20 years ago, , made me feel bad for the main protagonists. Apart from great storyline, very esthetic movie."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"For someone like me who barely knows anything about movies and films, this was spectacular to me. In the beginning of the movie, at first I thought it was a little slow-paced because I was under the impression that something big would happen after a couple minutes in as most or some movies usually go. However, it was an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding on who the characters are and their lifestyle, which is something I don't usually pay attention too. The way the movie was created is clever, it builds up the tension throughout it and gives foreshadowing before the climax happens and everything starts going wrong for the family. Meaning that the small conversations they make can have a meaning in what they say or do in future events. And when the climax happened, I was on the edge of my seat and whispering words on what they should or should not have done, showing how invested I was in the movie. At the same time I loved it how smoothly the transition was, as if everything clicked all together. Even though I was frustrated with the characters actions, they were portrayed really well on what's going on in the world and in society. How unfair it could be and how hypocritical we are once all that ""good luck"" begins to get to our heads. One that's well off would say how blessed we all are, while those that are struggling to get by would call it hell and how their lives are simply unmanageable without financial or other kinds of aid. I like how they portray that in the movie, the portrayal of human nature.Not to mention the amount of comedy in this film. I was just laughing at certain parts that I struggled to keep quiet.I would give it a 10/10 but me being stubborn I'm still frustrated about the characters actions despite it being well done 100%All in all, it's a great movie and I'm glad it got the attention it deserves. Props to you all!"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,5/10,"Highly overrated.
I was really excited about that film. Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it. Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon, but not more at all. I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two-class-society (that i as a middle class western can not really understand) but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted. Maybe again, its the korean style, but nonetheless it wasnt convincing.
Actually i waited for it to end."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,9/10,"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. I went into it not expecting to like it or even watch the whole thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, writing, and directing were all perfect, but the end scene kind of overstayed its welcome."
PARASITE,2 December 2019,10/10,"I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.
I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.
Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."
PARASITE,5 December 2019,9/10,"What a creative film!
I find Parasite as a wonderfully written story with amazing sequences of suspense mixed with a very well added comedy.
What an overwhelmingly finale!, this may be one of the best movies of the year that i've seen by far."
PARASITE,22 May 2020,4/10,"I'm sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this."
PARASITE,29 June 2020,5/10,"I might be the only one who didn't really like this movie. I went to the cinema to watch it with high expactations, and went out with disappointment. The movie is not bad, but also not good. I think it's overrated. Some things are not connected well and what in the high point of the movie happens doesn't satisfy me. In the cinema, I was literally like: ohh when will everything explose, the action should start soon. At the end of the movie, everything blows up, but it's not how you expected it. I cannot explain why I don't like it but something was not so right in the movie (not about the topic, about the course of events)"
PARASITE,22 December 2019,8/10,"I'll keep it short.This is one of the two best movies I've seen this year, along with Uncut Gems.
A biting comedy, that bites a little too much towards the end. I am not a big fan of that shock conclusion. This great film didn't need shock to make it come alive.The movie reminded me of satirical comedies such as Tootsie and Down and Out in Beverly Hills. Movies that take these interesting characters and puts them in environments that forces them to come to terms with life itself. It also reminded me of Billy Wilder. This is an old-fashioned fairly tale comedy, slapstick and all. Mr. Song is a a terrific actor and I hope that he and Adam Sandler are nominated for an Academy Award."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,This movie holds the pure depth of cinematic drama in 02 hours
PARASITE,13 January 2020,9/10,"This film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece."
PARASITE,11 March 2021,10/10,"Trust me this movie will gonna surprise you! I watched it with my mother at home.
We both surprised a lot. The story is taking shape very well. 2nd oscar coming from me and my mother. Thanks for great work everyone."
PARASITE,30 June 2020,6/10,Did i just watched a different movie ? I don't Know after reading all reviews i was quite excited and had hopes on this film. The overall concept of this film is good but definitely overrated i watched many films better than this which the critics and audience failed to appreciate. But this one is not up to the hype that the critics .
PARASITE,1 March 2020,10/10,One of the best film I ever seen in my whole life. Masterpiece.
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,"The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen."
PARASITE,2 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite is an amazing watch! I didn't really know what to expect going watching this and the end product most certainly didn't disappoint.The cinematography and the soundtrack is magnificent and the acting is insane. I really liked how much effort they took to make the scenes beautiful. The starting scene looked beautiful and the intense scenes actually felt intense.The Parasite's storyline was just so bizarre and fun. I was thrilled the whole time to see where the movie was going. Especially the ending felt really well-executed.Overall, I think this movie was phenomenal! If, this review sparked interest in you id definitely recommend giving this movie a shot."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,Well written and performed. Technically shines through and through. Probably the best experience in recent memory. Its pure art resembles and the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss this film. Definitely tops the list of best movies this past year too.
PARASITE,2 March 2020,4/10,"I wouldn't recommend the movie to literally noone.It was simply a 4 in my books, a 5 at most, but definitely not 7 or 8 IMDB points type of movie."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,8/10,"I have serious issues with this movie.Not because it isn't incredibly well-made, acted etc. I've seen some bad reviews of it which I don't agree with, but I understand where they are coming from. Because at no point is the audience given even the slightest hint about why any of this is happening. Why are this rich family hiring an art tutor for their eight year old? They must have more money sense. Rich people are stupid. Look at this smart but poor family taking advantage, it's all good. Well no it isn't actually. Scamming is a massive issue in Korea. Voice-phishing, molka cams, car insurance scams are an absolute plague and they are, in many ways, uniquely korean issues.But that isn't why this movie leaves a bad taste. At no point is it addressed why this family would need to be hiring tutors for their kids. This is a very Korean issue, and it isn't something that is exclusive to rich people. It is in fact the norm. It's just much easier when you're rich because no personal sacrifices need to be made. Maths tutors for 4 year olds. Piano teachers. Ballet lessons. Learning 3 or 4 languages. This actually happens. Yes at 4 years old. So an art tutor for an 8 year old really isn't anything to bat an eyelid about if you live in Korea. Which is why most young Koreans would do anything to live in Europe or the US, it's just a constant grind every single day.This isn't a film about inequality. In fact, Korea is well down the list of most unequal societies. Elderly poverty is a big problem in Korea. Inequality is not. Seoul is just a city, like London or New York or San Francisco that has very expensive districts and houses/apartments. But unlike those other cities, schooling is a large part of the reason for that. Everything comes back to education yet here we are blaming it on 'inequality'. It's fashionable of course. There's always something with the best picture oscar these past few years.Anyway, it's good to see a Korean movie doing so well. I would rather it have been Old Boy winning the big awards but I have no issue with this kind of entertaining fluff winning awards. Korea deserves recognition as they are producing some fantastic TV and films."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,9/10,"Been some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"A true masterpiece. I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho is a genius, and this movie is a masterpiece. That's it!"
PARASITE,7 June 2020,6/10,"I found this film to be trying to cover too much time in one film. You cannot convey depth and soul in such a rush. It was a check list of trying to be quirky, deep, etc. It did not work. I previously saw 3iron and that blew me away. This film has a very high score and I do not understand why. It is overtly formulaic. No character is given enough time to become anything you can relate to really. It is a hurry and that does not work for something like this. It is like Indie film for mainstream mind. I was not moved by it."
PARASITE,5 March 2020,8/10,"I finally went along with OSCAR hype and watched the 'Parasite' (just kidding, I was going to see it anyways, I just never managed to get into the theater in the summer when it was in the cinemas. I'm not quite sure did seeing the movie after all the award shower enhanced the viewing experience, or left me with shoulder shudder. I will not say that 'Parasite' is not worthy of all these awards, but considering all the hype - I expected something, I don't know, more. Do I think that the film is overrated, or underrated doesn't matter? What matters, is that 'Parasite' is a wonderful movie. I must give the highest praise to the actors. The story was intriguing with several layers, and it contained some unpredictable twists and turns along the way. I have a hard time to find perfect words to praise the cinematography - the camera (literally) danced with the actors and with the story. Yet, it was all so subtle that if you just didn't turn your attention to awe at the cinematography, you almost didn't notice it. Same thing with editing. The magnificent aspect was also the way the story was told - it started like absurdist comedy, then turned to quite spicy satire, then all of the sudden gory thriller and then ending this all with a nice touch of morale, but without preaching. The change in the atmosphere didn't ruin the pace or make the film lose its focus. The characters were clear, each one of them perfectly fleshed out. At least, the best original screenplay award is well earned.Besides being visually poetical and masterfully acted, the movie raises some poignant questions. People praise how good of overview 'Parasite' gives on South-Korean society, but to be honest - all the 'First World' countries are dealing with the same problems. No matter which economical class we are, people ale too self-absorbed, that they don't see the faults in themselves - everything is someone else's fault. While different people struggling for the same goal, rather than becoming allies and work together, they start to compete, and that usually means, that both sides will lose (that is just philosophizing, it is not a spoiler).Was it the most important film in 2019? Well, I don't know, because I haven't seen most of them, but 'Parasite' is most definitely a rare masterpiece that can be entertaining and what most important, thought-provoking at the same time."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,1/10,"This was one of the worst movies that I've honestly ever seen. I don't understand all the hype. The storyline was so bland and with many loop holes . The characters were not impressive, bunch of predictable trash. Save your time and money, this left a really bad taste in my mouth."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,10/10,"Parasite is such a brilliant movie I have ever seen! I am in complete awe after watching this movie, definitely an Oscar winning movie. The story-line and acting both were good, director maintained a prefect control to the story throughout. It has comedy, drama and thriller as well."
PARASITE,8 March 2020,10/10,"In an age of extreme CGI and remakes, Parasite was a treat to watch. The storyline is one of the best I have seen so far. The movie starts of with the viewer thinking it would go one way and then it takes an abrupt turn in the best way possible. I was blown away by the subtle meanings of some of the scenes and dialogues and did not even realize their importance until after a day of finishing the movie. The more time you spend thinking about the screenwriting and direction, the more you start to understand what a masterpiece this is. one hundred percent must watch."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,9/10,"The director's control over the story and emotional rendering is as good as ever, the story is multi-nested, the ""underground world""'s desire for the sun in the courtyard, the discussion of the relationship between money and kindness, and the conversation between the father and son across the letter. Ji Yu planned his future life in the basement of despair and hope."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,8/10,"It is complex and full of deep meaning, it tells a story of helplessness and despair, it is not a simple right and wrong, black and white. It made me think. I like it."
PARASITE,19 May 2020,9/10,This movie is excellent and unique. The entirety of the film is like a puzzle that fits perfectly. This movie is intense and exciting. A perfectly crafted lie that is created too hastily and greedily and ruined just as quickly. The bigger they are the harder they fall and the path to success has no shortcuts.
PARASITE,21 March 2020,1/10,"I can't believe I watched this film till the end. I kind of understand the metaphorical view of the director. There's no connection between scenes. In the first 20 minutes I tried really hard not to feel bored but I didn't make it. Frankly, I don't understand why this film was nominated not for an Oscar, but even for the last of the awards. Total waste of time."
PARASITE,1 September 2021,10/10,What a masterpiece. Easily the best film to come out in years and well deserving of an Oscar!
PARASITE,3 April 2020,7/10,"Give. 6 stars for the story and acting, but whats there in this movie that it gets an oskar and 8+ imdb. Some hot scenes , which are not even required. There are other movies which are for oscar and they gave it to this. This is really not acceptable.
Not even able to digest, how they can get the jobs so easily."
PARASITE,6 April 2020,8/10,"The movie proves to us that the plot plays are great in expressing the social sufferings, and they are told in the form of banter. In the movie, the problem of Korean social class (the same theme as burning, which shows the serious problem of Korean social class) is designed as an ingenious story with strong dramatic tension and full of suspense. The title parasite is a metaphor, and the stone is also a metaphor. A lot of political background corners are used as embellishments, and a lot of lines can be highlighted as golden sentences."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,7/10,"This story contrasts the living status of two Korean families due to differences in their earnings. The movie is set in metropolitan, therefore does not show distinct Korean culture. The drama is comedic, but not much of a thriller. The film is a good-watch but overrated."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,9/10,"Far from perfect and most certainly flawed in certain aspects of itself, Parasite still never seems to be held back. It's funny, emotional, and suspenseful, all while remaining swift with delightful characters, good storytelling, and good acting."
PARASITE,6 May 2021,8/10,"Original storyline, absolutely! Very interesting idea and well acted, but I did not understand the violent ending. All right, Mr. Park was mocking at Kim senior ""smelling"", but he gave him a job, so why kill his benefactor? Otherwise, great movie!"
PARASITE,20 April 2020,9/10,"The Oscars made me wonder - as all of the wealthiest people I can picture sat in a room and clapped for it - did we all watch the same movie?
Did every rich person who saw this movie come out of it feeling okay?
Please let me know. Because for me, the visceral point, the sweat you could smell on your born-poor self afterwards was gut wrenching.The advertising for this movie was misleading, it looked like it would be scary somehow, or a very serious drama, and I was delighted to see that it wasn't, that it was clever and beautiful and funny and not too self serious.Bong Joon-Ho is obviously a very clever writer and director, these performances were natural with just a small wink at the camera, and the set design was beyond beautiful. 150% worth watching again."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,9/10,I thought this kind of poverty existed only in India. But the way the movie depicts the needs of the common man in Korea and to the extent they go to secure a job is fantastic. The screenplay is very tight and the movie gives ample space to all actors to perform their role well. There is no unnecessary scenes or actors involved. The end is very tragic and touches your heart. How a small thing like securing a job could lead to so much bloodshed.
PARASITE,5 May 2020,9/10,This has to be the best movie I have ever seen. The performances of every actor and actress is absolutely amazing. The plot of the this film is amazing and the ending leaves it open to what could happen in the future. It is a great mixture of comedy and thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I found myself being sad that it was over when it was done. This will definitely not be a waste of your time and if you do not watch it you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.
PARASITE,6 May 2020,9/10,"Parasite is hands down a must see movie. I did not expect to be blown away, but once the movie ended, I sat there in silence and had to take a moment to process everything. The concept is amazing and it's hard to even imagine that someone actually thought of it. Parasite 100% deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars. I laughed, I cried, and overall, I just enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The creators, directors, cast, and crew are so talented and I truly think that everyone should watch it at least once."
PARASITE,28 June 2020,10/10,"Parasite is special in that it is able to achieve what other movies about metaphors can't, it's entertaining and highly enthralling. The movie doesn't have a dull moment. If you struggle to buy into the metaphor about meritocracy, you will still be highly entertained by a dark and very often sinister movie."
PARASITE,9 July 2020,4/10,"This movie isnt bad, far from it. But, also it really isnt that good as reviews and awards suggest, at least for me. Maybe i expected too much but nothing really revolutionary happens here. It has few funny scenes and a plot- twist like any other thriller/comedy approach. Social topics covered here didnt really touch me at all. I didnt feel bad for the poor nor for Parks family. Didnt even think about the movie after it was done, whilst i thought about every other oscar rewarded movie for a long time after watching.
Anyways, its probably me, who enjoys development of characters and atmospfere in the movie and none of that can be found in Parasite."
PARASITE,1 July 2020,9/10,The best movie and a different and original concept
PARASITE,12 July 2020,5/10,"Don't get all the fuss about this film, it is very average in every possible way. Started interesting but mid-way through it became boring and not compelling."
PARASITE,9 August 2020,7/10,"This film is an amazing work of dramatic art. The acting is first rate. The cinematography is state of the art. Beautifully filmed!The ending is very challenging because the viewer likely finds the Kim family very charming. As the charming underdogs, they are easy to like. As they suffer from terrible poverty and misfortune, they are easy to gain sympathy. The viewer will make excuses for their many lapses of character. But here is the point: they are evil people. Do not look at their intentions, but look at their actions. Look at the choices that they make. They are foul-mouthed criminals. They are consumed by envy. They have no moral restraints.The many victims of the evil Kim family are not portrayed as especially admirable people, so it can be easy to overlook the morality play that is being portrayed. It's okay for them to suffer because the audience is sympathizing with the Kims. Besides, the crimes against them are portrayed comedically. The audience laughs with the Kims as they commit their crimes. Until the full measure of the tragedy unfolds. What appeared to be a comedy, is revealed to be an awful tragedy. The trap has been sprung and the viewer has been judged with the guilty.It's a great work of art. Unpleasant, but thought-provoking."
PARASITE,18 October 2019,3/10,"I have watched some Korean movies, part of which I genuinely liked, but this one...how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me. I have to admit, that those have been some of the longest two hours, that I have spent in a movie Theater. The movie is neither funny (it might be the dubbing, but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie), nor shocking (unless You haven't seen movies before), it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters, it was absolutely predictive, drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom. Yes, it covered different genres, but other movies did the same, just much better."
PARASITE,9 September 2020,9/10,"Parasite follows the story of the impecunious Kim family, and how the prejudice of greed and class threatens their newly formed relationship with the Park family. In many ways, Parasite starts more like a comedy-a rather typical film that some may even describe as normal but: it is in the second quarter when after the Kim family and Park family have become acquainted, that the movie begins to live up to its title: ""Parasite."" The film was developed in such a beautiful manner that throughout the entire film; I found myself constantly guessing what will happen next but; I was always happy to be wrong. When I think of Parasite, I think of the sheer variety within its themes and how calling it a: ""Thriller/Comedy"" does not do it justice.Whether it was the unsettling tune that played at the weirdest of times or the thought behind every shot, the entire movie had me convinced that it was going to be like nothing else. Parasite leaves us with a rather uneasy feeling, not because the film was not enjoyable, but because of the way it makes us question everything. I believe there is a message that comes out of Parasite and my take on it is that: ""The act of falling is a lot worse when we fail to enjoy the summit."" So If you're looking for a film that does many things wonderfully different and will leave you with a constant thought in your mind, then maybe Parasite is what you should watch next."
PARASITE,13 September 2020,7/10,"This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it. I have watched much better movies both Western and Indian which portrays raw class, caste, religious and gender divide."
PARASITE,15 February 2021,9/10,"Strong Acting. Great Message. Gripping Drama. The film portrays two a whole different families in the context of class. One immensely rich and the other profoundly poor. The main storyline is based on the parasitic methods which the other family uses to make its daily livings. As my headline suggests, Bong Joon-ho has not missed the point on to which extent people can go to make their livelihood when they are poor. He has recklessly showed the gap between the rich and the poor. Poverty is an undoubtedly established and entrenched problem of the society but over the time people have gained modern tactics to deal with it, as shown in the film. Whether it is the Kim family or the Park family, acting is done significantly by both. Kims flawlessly played the role of a poor family who are smart enough and ready to fool anyone to make their sustenance. Parks perfectly played the role of a rich family who are decent and ignorant enough to be fooled. Every scene in the movie has shown the gap which has widened enough. The gripping drama is the main masterpiece covered by Bong Joon-ho. Lastly, this film will leave you thinking about its acting, plot and social message"
PARASITE,23 January 2021,8/10,The movie parasite shocked the american movie industry with it's simple idea which is the rich and the poor and trying to put them together in unusual picture and that happend really well.if you want to watch the movie i recommend you to watch and good luck.

PARASITE,8 March 2021,8/10,I would have given the movie 10 stars but they ending of the movie is not completed properly they left it in the middle
PARASITE,6 July 2021,3/10,It's way too overrated and weird. Nothing really happens.
PARASITE,21 November 2019,2/10,"The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves."
PARASITE,31 August 2021,8/10,"Amazing idea. Love the way it's filmed. Would definitely recommend watching, was not expecting it to go the way it went at all!"
PARASITE,1 November 2021,9/10,"At first it was a bit boring, but it got better after the first half. The ending was a bit messed up and the whole movie took a huge turn so sudden.Something that bothers me is how did Ki-woo survived. He was hit in the head with a huge stone multiple times and as we can see in the movie scene, he lost a lot of blood. He wasn't treated as soon as he got hit, because we can see Da-hye caring him on her back and his head wasn't bandaged at all, meaning that he lost even more blood while Da-hye was caring him around. By loosing so much blood and his head was obviously cracked, there is no way he could've survived.But Ki-jung, who was stabbed and still concious through the entire time, died.This doesn t really make sense to me, but besides that, the movie was good. I totally recommend it!*excuse my bad english please*"
PARASITE,3 October 2021,9/10,Craziest movie I've ever seen! There were so many plot twists. The script must have taken a century to write.
PARASITE,25 October 2019,9/10,Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. I dont consider myself worthy of reviewing a great master like him. Please watch if you can. One word. Wow!
PARASITE,6 February 2020,9/10,"I just finished the movie and it's truly a masterpiece, from the combination of drama/comedy/horror to the detailed portrayal of social inequality...If I could point out just ONE thing I didn't like, is how they toss the writing right at the end. So the kid says he's going to get rich, and so he does? After the movie was making a clear statement of how difficult it is for the poor to level up? I just found that particular part to be ""too easy""... But other than that, it is a superb film."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,9/10,"Bong Joon Ho (writer/director} is usually known for bashing the rich and powerful.. In this film he takes aim also at the poor who are depicted as conniving, immoral grifters. The Parks, the rich family who are the prey of the poor Kim family are shown as mostly naïve rather than cruel, The film is comedic for the first half and then takes a violent and serious turn. Riveting and thought provoke, highly recommended."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,6/10,"There are countless reviews posted here that delve into this movie's themes. I've read at least 20 of them, and many are engaging and brilliant. But I'm going to do something different. I'll speak to the Tarantinoesque nature of this film.There's a program on AXS-TV called ""The Big Interview."" Dan Rather spends an hour talking with noted personalities across all genres of pop culture. Several years ago he sat down with Quentin Tarantino (QT) and conducted a wonderful interview. I don't want to include spoilers here so I think that if you're a QT fan you will understand what Dan is referencing, below.Late into the interview, without accusing him of being exploitive, Dan asks QT to discuss this: How does he have the audience laugh and cry all in the same film? How does he get an audience to view scenes of a horrific nature yet laugh during the movie or come out of the theater smiling?QT's response: ""when a movie really, really does it to me, it's because it's made me feel very different emotions...I'm the kind of director that I want to play you, as an audience. I want to be the conductor and you're my orchestra. And (I conduct) the sounds that I make you to make, and the feelings that I get you to feel... And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings, and I give you something ELSE to feel. And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and make you feel something ELSE yet again. Well, if a director can do that, if a director can pull that off...then you're a lucky audience member because you really had an experience that night. You went to the MOVIES; that was worth leaving the house.I can't help but make my stuff funny because I think of things in a humorous way...but it's not all a big joke. I do like the idea that I can do this to the audience: Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. (snaps fingers) Laugh. And maybe that stop laughing is something horrific...(maybe it's) hard to watch."" He then cites specific examples from one of his movies where he said he needed to traumatize the audience.I love a lot of what QT has done, but not all of it. This movie seems to follow the QT blueprint but then it veers off in one direction and stays there. I did not leave the theater smiling. Thus, my rating."
PARASITE,28 January 2020,6/10,"Highly overrated film. Though performances are pretty good, the whole plot and most of the main scenes are so crazy that they take away credibility. Sometimes less is more."
PARASITE,17 November 2019,8/10,"I very much enjoyed this film. It wasn't particularly different than a lot of other dark comedies I have seen, but it was very well made and entertaining. I was hooked from the very beginning, when during the fumigation scene our anti-hero protagonists are likened to stink bugs.The first part of the film is a very clever dark comedy, planted with seeds of the trouble to come.Then we hit a point in the film when Bong Joon-ho steers the film from comedy towards a more tragic end. My only criticism is the film does not fully commit to this darker direction.The garden party scene was the perfect opportunity for Bong Joon-ho to go for a Tarantino-style bloody onslaught that would have had the crowd cheering in their seats. Or Miike-style shock-fest that would have had us covering our eyes while gleefully reveling in the gruesomeness. The film could have ended right there, on a high note, without losing momentum to a gratuitous denouement. Instead, I would have loved to have seen end credits rolling over stills of ""artwork"" by the sole garden party massacre survivor, the doubly-traumatized Park Da-song.I would have liked that.But the ending didn't reach for any extremes. It was good, but just a bit too safe for my personal taste. I hope Bong Joon-ho pushes the boundaries a bit more in his next film!"
PARASITE,7 March 2020,6/10,I don't want to be a troll but this movie is a bit overrated i think. We have much better dramas in Turkish cinema.
PARASITE,4 December 2019,2/10,"It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit"
PARASITE,10 July 2021,7/10,"Doesn't take much to please people nowadays! I don't buy the deep, multi-layered metaphorical masterpiece others talk about. It was a fairly simplistic commentary (given the runtime) on social class tensions.That's it. Interesting plot but I feel it could have been delivered in a much more captivating way. I found the pace excruciating after a while once I understood the general message. Wasted opportunity.Those giving it a 10 are not on this planet."
PARASITE,7 February 2020,10/10,The movie is truly a masterpiece...! I don't understand how this movie with such local sentiments can deliver something that is so universal...!The best cinematic experience I had this year. Everything is perfect.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,"It's not a bad movie. It's slow, predictable and has more plot holes than a swiss cheese. Sometimes you really have to force yourself to believe how naive some of the characters in this movie are. There's just no way that this movie is the best of the decade, year or whatever the media is portraying it to be. It's 8,6 imdb score is up to par with all time classics like Godfather I, II and Once Upon a time in America. No way, josé."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,1/10,"Nice, but i will not put it on a list with movies MUST TO SEE.
Definitely not for top 250!"
PARASITE,19 October 2019,9/10,"""Parasite"" Directed by Bong Joon Ho, maker of critically acclaimed movies ""Memories of Murder"", ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"", is a superbly crafted and a masters work who is in full command of his craft and so confident in his filmmaking that it doesnot hold anything back. It is
socially relevant and totally unique and original blend of horror, comedy and thriller."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,1/10,"I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good. I don't think it was a masterpiece, at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point.
The story was not good either.
I have to disagree with the rest of the world."
PARASITE,5 March 2021,2/10,"People kept recommending it so finally I pushed through to the end and what a drag it was.
It seriously too about 11 tries to finish it.
Slow, boring, unlikeable characters, disqusting.
It had good photo so 2 stars.Train to Busan is a different genre (or rather it has a genre) and is a much better Korean movie. This was just boring."
PARASITE,6 June 2020,8/10,"It's was such a thought provoking art piece such great social commentary. I loved how the writer essentially made us feel sorry for the perpetrators ""the bad guys"" instead of the victims. It was just fantastic. It turned everything on it's head and the ending was incredible."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,1/10,"How this won best picture is beyond me, not entertaining on any level"
PARASITE,3 March 2020,2/10,"Saw this movie today. While well acted and photographed, the story was nothing exceptional. Interesting for a while, yet waiting for something better to happen which never occurred. The last third of the movie turned dark and disturbing not only for the violence but the silly way it ended leaving me shocked at how it won the best picture Oscar. The first thought I had as the final shot ended the movie was:
""Are you kidding me?"" The all time worst choice for best picture ever!!!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"This is a good movie and well worth the watch, but it is not a 10/10, so lower your expectations as the hype is definitely not warranted."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,1/10,"I am content with myself that I find I am literally the only person on the planet who hated this movie. I found the acting amateurish at best and the script was so wooden it's amazing they didn't carve the read sheets onto tree trunks.
Not gory, not suspenseful, not entertaining, boringly predictable. 2 hours of my life I won't be getting back."
PARASITE,19 January 2020,6/10,"I watched this movie based on it's IMDb rating. After all, it scored only 1/10th of a point lower than ""Lord of the Rings"" (first one) so it must be a pretty damn AWESOME movie, right? Well....NO! It wasnt a BAD movie, it just wasnt....magical.Now, I do love my Sci Fi and Fantasy movies, however movies based on real life can be magical as well. Think ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Se7en"". This movie has a decent concept based on the interactions of 2 classes of people. I would go so far as to say there is no clear ""good guy"" and no clear ""bad guy."" In life, there seldom is. That said, it was interesting and entertaining but no way it ranks a 8.6. I think results are being skewed by a foreign market that has (understandable) pride in making a film with international appeal."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"I think the only reason I was mildly disappointed with this film was all the hype, including of course the Oscar win.
If I'd stumbled upon this foreign-language (to me) film, I would have been, I'm sure, thoroughly delighted and surprised.
But given that it's supposedly THE BEST FILM of all those released in the last 12 months, well, I find myself in unexpected agreement with Joan Collins, an Academy member, who on Britain's morning GMB show said she thought it was a good film; just not The Best Film (although she also admitted to not having watched the last 20 mins, as it got a bit 'dark' - I assume she meant emotionally, not visually - and she was having trouble with the subtitles on her apparently tiny TV screen. Get a 60-inch, Joan, if you're being asked to vote!)
It surely does twist and turn, and goes from a light-hearted, almost Ealing comedy vibe, into a slasher in the woods horror flick. The acting is great. The characters, on the whole, believable, but as the closing credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.
Why?
Well, I'm probably in a minority with Joan here, but I guess it was the whole story arc that left me unsatisfied. I would have been more satiated with an ending that allowed the nice, though slightly moralistically-challenged poor 'parasites' to get their rewards, while at the same time allowing the rich, privileged class to see the error of their ways. The rich folk here were, as far as I could see, perfectly nice people, apart from objecting politely to the smell of their poorer employees. Did they deserve all they got? I don't think so.
That's perhaps just a reflection of different story-telling techniques around the world. Maybe here in the UK/US we expect Disneyfied Hollywood endings, and this was not one of those. I still can't see quite why the dad/chauffeur decided to stab his employer to death. I can't see how the son of the poorer family survived two enormous blows to his scalp with a sizeable rock, with nothing to show for it than a temporary frontal lobe syndrome that made him laugh and smile uncontrollably, until, for no explained reason, that symptom disappeared when he was looking at news footage of the 'crime scene'.
Those details left me feeling uncomfortable, and less than satisfied.
Was it just the Hollywood zeitgeist that got this film the Oscar? Let's give it to a foreign language film for the first time, they said. That'll - if not silence our critics, then at least give them something to chew on. That's probably unfair, but, for instance, Rocketman sent me on a far more roller-coaster emotional ride than Parasite did. For me, it was easily a better film."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,3/10,Not worth the oscar material. Not a must watch. A normal film. Highly overrated.
PARASITE,2 December 2019,9/10,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I saw in 2019. The story is so original, it's funny, it's strange, but it could really happen."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,10/10,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, wonderfully written screenplay, artist style and cinematography. Too much to talk about, just WATCH this movie."
PARASITE,6 December 2019,6/10,"Actually until I watched the movie, I heard lots of good critics. It's wonderful, very impressive etc. But I don't agree, the first half of movie was good and also funny, but I can't say the same thing to other half, it wasnt realistic. And I reckon not as good as people standarts"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,7/10,No need for a long review. This movie was just OK. I'm not impressed.
PARASITE,10 January 2020,10/10,I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!
PARASITE,9 February 2020,1/10,"Seriously a recycle piece of dreck that piggy backed off the writing off of others. I just feel it was the abcs of death g is for grampa, or amazing world of gumballs ""whose in the house"" it just got a dragnet treatment to avoid claims of plagerism.My main complaint is that their is never a suspension of disbelief. I cannot understand how a person can have another person living in one room and never know this. How these uber scary loan sharks never investigated the womans place of work for method of contacts. How a man could have a house in a flood zone and not have it checked for annually checked issues like bugs, vermin and other parasites along with potential waterdamage or radium cracks. Also since a ghost was spotted down there and they believe in it you think they would have had a monk/priest or hoodoo practitioner to kick its butt out. Sorry while the plot is interesting it only works if everyone involved has diminished capacity just like the people under the stairs by wes cravenBut hey if you like the movie enjoy it. Everybody has there own opinion this is just mine"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"Love to see movies that are different than what comes out of USA studios, and this one was unique and fresh. After seeing it I have added Seoul as my next destination, it just will not happenduring rainy season. 🤣This film showed that life is not so different around the world. For example the way the rich folk in this film looked on the downtrodden folk; it reminded me of life in 1970s when I grew up in South America.Yes it merits the awards it received at the Oscars."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,8/10,"Yep it's paranormal, Ordinary family and upper-class family how they approach the most of their points in life. Superb acting deserve a best foreign language award in Oscars 2020."
PARASITE,2 June 2019,9/10,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,10/10,Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"This is a brilliant movie, just watch it without reading too many reviews, you won't regret it."
PARASITE,23 October 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !
Avoid spoilers"
PARASITE,29 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite is perfect reflection of the era that we live in. I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie.
Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them.
Things I like:
#Park family's wannabe, American and the Indian references
#Elevation allegory between houses of the families and the social classes
#Rainfall sequence (Masterpiece directing !!)
#Wrestle of cockroaches to keep the house and the owners of the house does not aware of what is happenning.
#Below the coffe table scene
#Production of sets
#Rising of tension until the birth day party
#Smell of poornessI did Not like:
#Last 5 minutes ( I thing it was not necessery to show us what happened after the birthday party)"
PARASITE,7 June 2020,6/10,"This movie just shows how pretentious and shallow people are. Unless, that's the directors objective showing the people who call this movie a masterpiece as shallow people. If that's his intention, it's a great movie.I bet you most people can't objectively agree on why they like this movie. Perhaps, it is truly a masterpiece for the sophisticated movie goers and other people who understand the themes of the movie well but these are like 20% of those calling it a masterpiece..For the ordinary person, it is just very average movie that if you saw without knowing it was PARASITE *cue the applause the trails*.
I did not feel anything for the poor people. Blame capitalism all you want but, they didn't have to go that far. You argue it's greed but they are supposedly smart or street smart but through out the movie. They make very foolish decisions which ultimately ends in this end which is a tragedy for the rich. I mean, if it's a poor people vs rich, then obviously their family would have the other poor family. You add greed?
All in all. I'm tired now. Enjoy being pretentious"
PARASITE,17 April 2020,9/10,"Great movie.......
Perfection at its best....
Great direction....."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,7/10,The narration in first half is slightly misleading by being racy while the actual film is meant to be about class divide and how the rich and poor see each other. The film would be more classy if the narration style was consistent. Still a good watch
PARASITE,31 May 2020,10/10,The movie would keep you on your toes. A must watch if you want a movie from which you can extract knowledge. Use of symbols elevates this movie (get it. Elevates? You will get it after you see it)
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"One of best crime/thriller i've watched. I can't guess where the plot will bring me, every minute in the movie i tried to guess but mostly i wrong, and got the unexpected, even the ending. Every character really has strong impact in the movie, and you must pay attention about every little detail they do, because that builds up the story, and has really deep meaning for the story. The movie itself is masterpiece, really worth watching."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"This film is very nicely shot and had some entertaining moments in it. The cast are great and the story has some unexpected twists.Overall I would definitely recommend watching it, however I really can't understand how it won best picture and best director at the academy awards. In that sense the film is quite mediocre as it doesn't leave a lasting impression as most Oscar winning films do.My guess is the Academy lording diversity at the risk of social criticism."
PARASITE,30 October 2019,5/10,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."
PARASITE,19 March 2020,9/10,"The movie seems an ordinary story but tells economic and social differences with a fascinating and stunning narrative. Ending is unforgettable while the whole of the movie keeps the audience in a curiosity. Definitely, everyone must watch this movie at least once and think about it."
PARASITE,13 July 2020,9/10,A New kind of story with an amazing take on the economic instability in the Korean societyA nice way to depict the ecnomic imbalance in the society with a beautiful and unthinkable scriptA must watch story and too many hidden messages or meaning in the script
PARASITE,6 January 2020,8/10,"English is my first language and I'm always hesitant to watch foreign films because of the subtitles. It's challenging and sometimes an effort when I want to relax and watch a movie. I'm so glad I made this choice to watch the Parasite. The film is original and very well shot. I loved the actors and by the midway point I forgot I was reading subtitles, the film pulls you in to its world. Fantastic film and I will check out more of the directors work."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better."
PARASITE,4 December 2019,9/10,"I have never seen a movie which shows so skillfully how the poor (literally) tear each other apart in capitalism. But it goes much further than this, is much more creative, and imagines a story way bigger than just a critique of our society.
Starts as satire, turns into a thriller, and ends as splatter / drama / comedy. Brilliant all the way through.
Only the dialogues might take some getting used to for Western audiences at first."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,9/10,It's an awesome movie which shows the standing and needs of a family in society which they might do anything to obtain
PARASITE,21 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite came along just when I thought I'd seen the best 2019 had to offer. The movie progressed elegantly like an amazing musical piece.The depth of the characters and the story kept me glued to my seat hoping the credits wouldn't roll. And when the credits did roll, I stared at the black screen in a moment of contemplation, thinking, this is what cinema should be. Absolutely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. 10/10"
PARASITE,6 February 2021,4/10,"Incredible that this movie can get such high ratings.
Will not recommend watching it. Completely unlikely plot and quite bad acting."
PARASITE,28 November 2021,2/10,I really don't get why everybody thinks it is so good.It is way too long and boring as hell.The text messages in between aren't translated so you dont really know what it is about.
PARASITE,14 July 2020,10/10,"Here is an interesting fact which I recently realized about this movie; in his work ""The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon"", Karl Marx refers to bourgeoisie and bourgeois controlled state as ""the parasitic body"" which must be removed in order to end the opression on the working class. However, at the same time one can think of the working class family who insinuates into the life of this bourgeois family as parasites. So who is the actual parasite? This is the question I think the director wants us to consider and ultimately it depends on your approach. Director's view on this issue is clear and it is so brilliantly elaborated in the film that I am in awe of his talent. It made me question my own behaviour as an individual within the system. It shook me and I think that is what all great forms of art does."
PARASITE,15 October 2019,6/10,I think this film is overrated. Not sure about all the coincidences happened to the family members are making sense.
PARASITE,2 June 2020,10/10,"Loved this movie, refreshing to watch something different from the usual mumbo jumbo.
Plenty of symbolic moments and a lot of unexpected twists to the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat practically yelling at the TV 'what is happening!?' whilst holding my head in my upturned hands. Parasite is basically a masterpiece. I was gripped instantly by the trailer and knew I had to watch it. I noticed a few goofs which incidentally others have too as they're written on here, luckily it doesn't detract from the storyline as there's no plot holes.
I rarely enjoy a movie 100% but this one is definitely up there as a new favourite. Evoking a lot of different emotions throughout, well worth a watch."
PARASITE,7 November 2021,1/10,"This puzzles me to no end. My honest feeling is that the claim to offer some kind of social commentary is a layer of ""respectability varnish"" that serves as an excuse for filmmaker and viewer to indulge in the heavy-handed violence that tickles their fancy, and nobody wants to admit that because, well, their peers (and colleague critics) like it, so it must be good.But then again, this seems so blindingly obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people fall for it. I'm honestly struggling with this: I think being critical and voicing social commentary is good and necessary, but movies like this feel rather as if it's part of the problem. They're ice-cold, de-humanising, disengaging. They make me care less.But then again, maybe I'm just stupid and blind."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,10/10,"I was so excited to see this movie after all the awards it got and my expectations were high, but it somehow managed to exceed all those expectations. it's simply brilliant and honestly one of the best movies i've ever seen!"
PARASITE,20 February 2020,4/10,"So to me, the movie was really average. It failed to really grab my attention and keep me on the edge of my seat. The story was also really predictable. I'm not saying it was bad, but it just didn't appeal to me as other movies of this genre.
In my country we come across these types of scenarios all the time about the less fortunate families and what they have to do to survive etc so maybe to me the story wasn't so out of the ordinary and I've seen worse on the news.
I understand it was really deep and metaphorical, but it just failed to resonate."
PARASITE,11 May 2020,9/10,"It's a simple yet effective story to portray the economical and societal level differences between the rich and poor. The movie is too perfect to point out any mistakes, nothing is too stretched and nowhere is left short."
PARASITE,10 July 2021,6/10,"I was disappointed with the movie after the reviews. Seemed unrealistic and I didn't find the morale of the story. I read how you can see Mr. Park's view of the ""help"" can be perceived as seeing the ""help"" as lesser human beings, but with the absurd ness of the story it questions Mr. Parks integrity as a character. It was a silly heist with a silly ending, none of it being likely and I didn't learn anything. The poor family stepped on other poor people to get ahead and even murdered a women, then the husband of that women comes after them. People kill people and it all seems ridiculous."
PARASITE,10 November 2020,2/10,I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.
PARASITE,3 March 2020,10/10,"When this movie got the Oscar, I was surprised to see that Oscars panel has finally accepted other language films. Most of the old Oscar winners were nothing more than boring, documentary-like movies which I hated. This time, I thought of checking out the movie and I was taken aback by the masterful direction and screenplay of a very simple story line. The script is the key and the way the visuals are shown is mind-blowing. The inequality among people, rich and poor, is shown so subtly which is the strong point of the film. At first, you want the bad family to go down but when you look at the way they live, the way the head of the park family treat the head of the poor family, somewhere you feel what they are doing is justified. And the final scene when park cares only about his fainted son instead of the stabbed victims shows the selfishness he has and it doesn't seem so wrong after all. Brilliant narration and absolutely must watch for people who like good movies!"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,7/10,"This is my first experience of Korean cinema (although I have watched many foreign language films). The subtitles may put off some but I care more about the story.This is a really good film which is equally funny as it engrossing and then nearer the end quite moving.The tone is a tad all over the place, which I'm sure is likely the aim but for me it makes it harder to land that emotional pull to make you really emphasise with the characters.I would argue the film translates to me that family and belonging are the themes to take away.So overall I would say I enjoyed the film and would say go see it for the experience, but if I'm honest I wouldn't choose to add it to my collection."
PARASITE,27 November 2019,10/10,"Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.Don't miss it"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,8/10,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was good but the the way other reviews are saying like ""most thought provoking films"" is just wrong."
PARASITE,7 November 2020,2/10,I so wanted to love this given the reviews I have heard but I was left wondering what film other people had seen. Idea was good but it was a nothing story in the end. So disappointed. Found the subtitles too small. Just could not have cared less. Why all the hype?
PARASITE,20 June 2020,6/10,But I really don't love it as much as all the fuss. It did not deserve to sweep the Oscars. Didn't love it
PARASITE,9 February 2020,3/10,"Well made movie but i suspect there are a lot of phony reviews posted here to gain an Oscar win. I liked the acting and story line.
However there needs to be some redemption (despite the political statement of classism).
Cruelty can be a means to develop a plot into something more transcendent. I didn't grasp any of that, just a descent into hell.
Too much over the top sensationalism."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,2/10,"Decent acting, not great.
Not suspenseful.
Not thrilling.
Not scary, not even a bit.
Decent overall message.
Parts seemed overly forced.
Too predictable.
Only finished watching hoping it would improve, but it did not.
Would have enjoyed it more had it been 35 minutes long.
2 stars for effort and production.
The high ratings are suspicious and puzzling."
PARASITE,27 April 2020,10/10,"I cant even understand how good this movie is, my mind is too small to truly acknowledge the very masterpiece i have just saw 10 minutes ago."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,8/10,"I came to know about this movie after it has won Oscars and immediately decided to watch it. Let's just appreciate the entire cast and the director of course. I didn't read any reviews before watching this movie because i didn't wanted to be spoiled and biased. So i straightaway watched the entire movie today and i can say that now why it is called PARASITE. The title is metaphorically used in this film, just like parasite first acquires the host body and divides into multiple cells and eats the host cells for existence but sometimes immune system of body fights back eventually killing some parasites cell that's what depicted in the movie but in the end it is parasite cell that won. The oral sex was also perfectly setup to show us the uncomfortable and uneasy position Kim was stuck in. The scout reference from starting was also to carry out the ending scene.
BTW i am from India so if any of you can suggest me 5 near to best Korean movies compare to this one then reply me."
PARASITE,9 December 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10"
PARASITE,4 March 2020,10/10,"Worth multiple rewatchesLove the multiple reviews on the beatiful cinematography, directing and editting.Should have won more categories at the Oscars"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,1/10,"I am not sure about the Korean values, but this movie is a silly adaptation of rags to riches where stereotypes are very strong and the plot is very flimsy. A lot of disgusting scenes including violence, gross and unnecessary. A dark comedy but the darkness outweighs the entertainment. I have seen much better foreign movies but at the least it was interesting to see some Korea other than Samsung, LG, Kia or Hyundai."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,10/10,"Family of cons get in deeper than they intended while trying to live a life they don't deserve. Unexpected twists and startling action, which does not deviate too far from possible reality."
PARASITE,28 November 2019,4/10,Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.
PARASITE,20 August 2019,8/10,Personally prefer 'Burning' but this one offers more dramatic scenes
PARASITE,6 December 2019,10/10,"This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade."
PARASITE,18 December 2019,10/10,"Its really difficult for a new film to come out & satisfy me & outperform well known masterpiece thrillers from the sixth sense to modern mystery inception
But this movie did exactly that i loved this movie more than fight club, inception, se7en,gonegirl,shutter island
Give it try for first 5 min, then. U will witness the greatest achievement in filmmaking of this decade
This movie has set new standard which i think difficult to crack for normal director"
PARASITE,13 February 2021,10/10,"The story Rolls a long as you'd expect but then gets out of control quickly.
You could see it happening in real life and being one of those weird stories you read in the paper and think ""how does that happen today"". Stays with you. Understand the rave reviews. Not fir everyone."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,"What we can?
Why we can?
When we can?
There are questions in film,the black comedy is a great genre to present a real life in a political empoilment country.
All of characters are very powerfull psychology and moral to complete a they psychology.
Powerfull and colorfull story on the screen!Great job,guys!"
PARASITE,12 August 2019,10/10,"This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.
Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."
PARASITE,25 May 2020,9/10,"Clever and darkly humorous, 'Parasite' is Bong Joon-ho all the way through, and he gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast, the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor - those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve; how being one or the other defines who you are, and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that. Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director's bleak outlook doesn't affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is."
PARASITE,28 June 2020,7/10,"A brilliant must see, combined with Ho's direction, the script he co-wrote with Han, the performances of the cast, Jung's score, Hong's cinematography, Yang's editing, Lee's production design, Cho's set decoration, Choi's costume design, action sequences and visual, the story and world in which Parasite explores proves that without a doubt it rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture of 2019 and stands as one of the absolute best films of the 2010s!!!"
PARASITE,13 May 2020,8/10,"One of the most intense films. The second half of the movie was just so great. Started with comedy and I loved the wits of them they literally hired the whole family! There were so many twists as well. A secret chamber or whatever it was called and the maids husband.
The rich family's way of looking at athe poor and the comparisons of the situations this movie is damn straight amazing!!"
PARASITE,4 March 2020,3/10,Nice build up to a powerful educational message that bursts into a Grotesque none sense resolution. The characters decisions make no sense. Absurd it won best film oscar
PARASITE,8 February 2020,9/10,"It's weird watching foreign films because you aren't always sure if you're watching a good performance or not. But in this film you don't have to question. The movie starts out intriguing for the first hour or so then becomes exhaustingly exhilarating. The entire last hour is a nonstop thrill ride, for lack of a better cliche."
PARASITE,3 November 2019,10/10,"It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,1/10,"I went into this movie with very high hopes. So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days).So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy.I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp. Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense, I found myself cringing at the actors' performances as they weren't believable and was confused at how poorly-written the dialogue was. Not everything that's out there and different hits the mark. This did NOT hit the mark for me."
PARASITE,28 July 2019,5/10,"I am a fan of Korean movies. Most Korean movies are good. This one is not an exception as to story line and actors. Comparing with the great hits like Along with the God and Train to Busan, this one is less active. What surprised me is that this mediocre get more rating than those great films. Actually, the whole movie is done in a house. I don't know why a lot of people overrate this movie."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,2/10,A mediocre movie. Did not get at all what all fuss is about.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,3/10,"I cant understand why this movie, won the oscar. A boring film with nothing interest. A hysterical plot and a naive scenario..."
PARASITE,26 March 2020,9/10,While I myself did not love this movie like other people I have to say this film is so smart on so many levels. It is beyond anything I may ever be able to do. While I may have not loved it liked some other people I still think this is truly one of the greatest movies of the year. 9/10
PARASITE,31 May 2020,9/10,"At first the idea of a poor family full of con artists going after an upper class family seemed kinda been there done that sort of. I wasn't really into this at the start. Once it got to the halfway part, it took a very unexpected turn and the suspense kicked in big time. I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill, getting bigger and bigger and then BAM! because that climax was crazy. I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit, besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. Good choice here."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,2/10,It does not deserve all the Oscars it has got and its just an averagely done movie. More deserving movies have been left out of oscars just to oppose the government. Such a shame.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,6/10,OK movie. Don't really see why people are claiming that it the director is always one step ahead. I personally felt that it was unrealistic and therefore had little sympathy for both sides of society.
PARASITE,2 February 2020,10/10,"The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,8/10,This is a story of a poor family who decides to wage war on many fronts. There are some moments that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you in shock.
PARASITE,23 October 2019,10/10,"Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!"
PARASITE,6 January 2020,1/10,It's in a foreign language they should add subtitles to the top of the screen instead of the bottom so that way you can read it and watch it at the same time
PARASITE,30 January 2020,8/10,"One of the best films!
The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes.
If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie.
One of the best movies in 2019"
PARASITE,21 October 2019,7/10,It's hard to define the genre of this movie. It starts as a subtle and enjoyable comedy before veering into overdone goriness. Reminded me of Chinese cinema of the 70ies. The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors (cfr. Burning from Chang-dong Lee) : the abusive crossing of social class lines... Too bad for the ending. My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too. Still the movie is good and enjoyable.
PARASITE,8 March 2020,10/10,"I've never been moved by a movie more than this. At times I was shouting at he screen and pulling my hair, practically jumping out of my seat. If you have ever wanted to know how to build tension in a movie in a subversive way, this would be the guide.
Don't even get me started on the cinematography, either. From the physical symbolism to the beautiful shots and angles the composition was majestic in a way. Like watching a master hunter track and slaughter it's pray, the viewer, who is completely unaware of what is about to unfold.
Not to mention the statement it's making about the class pyramid. The ending illuminates that part of the film perfectly; it feels as though it all comes together then. The story, the statement, the cinematography, and the symbolism. It all creates that beautiful ending that helps the audience truly piece it all together.What a masterpiece"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,3/10,"Soo so poor direction and Soo many mistakes in this movie , I don't how this movie got an Oscar it's really disappointing."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,I just couldn't expect to this. Brilliant and captivating. Deserves every damn prize
PARASITE,10 November 2019,1/10,"What a wreck of a movie; filled with thoroughly loathsome characters plodding through a sophomoric plot towards a thoroughly predictable end (we didn't bother to hang around to confirm our expectations but having now read some of the reviews I see we weren't far off the mark).
The frequently high ratings for this travesty leave me totally mystified."
PARASITE,3 July 2020,10/10,"A well-deserved win for the behemoth of a movie. So many undertones are explored and subtly depicted through the runtime of the movie. If foreign language films are anything like this movie, it is bound to have more nominations from across the world for the Academy's best picture award. The movie fantastically talks about social stratification and class-divide and how struggle and entitlement eats up the humanity inside.The genius screenplay and plot-line is accompanied by artistic sense of cinematography and an incredible score. The ensemble cast have shown ingenuity in playing the characters. The one question that remains even after the end of the movie is who is the ""Parasite"" or is just the concept of hope for a Utopian world and fulfillment of all desires or simply our ""real"" society. Its a must-watch!
The use of architecture, design, imagery and visual composition is magnificent. The daylight shows the better, a more hopeful and upper echelon way of life whereas the dungeons like basements and semi basements show how life feels trapped, difficult and how it ""stinks"" of poverty. Bong Joon Ho has masterfully drawn parallels and intersections between the two kinds of life and the chosen way to represent them, from an architectural stand point, says volumes. The camerawork is exquisite in depicting serious situations which have greater impact on the whole story. The parts to whole and whole to parts sequencing of shots brings to each scene a sense of completeness, yet a mystery that continues onto the next."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,9/10,"Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, breathing the air in the dark room can only walk like a ghost. You can't let go of a poor stone for a lifetime, and you will never get rid of the cheap smell. Curly bed bugs, sterilize yourself with windows of potions; hosts in high places, use money to hire people to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked the blood of the poor soared, the poor sent their lives to the rich, the people and ghosts shared food in the same room, and the insects and beasts developed together to develop enemies. In ""The Parasite"", we saw President Park's family who were blinded by money. In a high society, they respect wealth and status, but ignore the lower class people who live in darkness. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased the antagonism between the two major class relations, and has become the trigger for the tragedy."
PARASITE,28 November 2019,9/10,It did shown us a different but real world between the poor and the rich. I think it is upset that the poor may never have a opportunity to catch up with the rich since they born.
PARASITE,3 March 2020,10/10,"The movie is quite amazing just as the title of this review said. You get to like the Kim Family all throughout and you get the hope that their plan fully works without complications.The ending of the movie has Ki-taek (the father of the Kim Family) killing the father of the Park Family and I was pretty much going ""Oh my god!"" which had my eyes wide open. It isn't too long until the final scene shows Ki-taek living in the Park Family bunker, hiding out from the police and the scene of Ki-woo writing to his hidden father is one that will make you question ""Will Ki-woo buy the house or not so that they can be reunited?"" It was a shame that we never saw Park Da-hye after her father's death and I kept hoping that she and Ki-woo will be back together in the future since they were amazing together.If you don't mind the movie being subtitled, go watch this amazing movie and you won't regret it."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,9/10,"It says it on the trailer,"" you expect this movie to be one thing', but it turns out to be something else"". This film shows an excessive amount of multilayered symbolism and all the ideologies portrayed in the film mainly revolved around the central idea of class distinction. At first glance, the theme may seem quite simple,, but then you start to understand the true nature of the film. The film is filled with finesse in terms of direction. Every little thing has a meaning behind it and all the credit goes to the director ( Bon joon ho) for depicting things so beautifully. The title,""parasite"", suggest how a parasite ( in the film- underclassmen) devours the host. But the movie shows how even in something so nether there are feelings and emotions present. The part where the blood falls onto the pale bread is a masterpiece in my opinion as it perfectly summarizes the movie and it has such depth of meaning behind it. I was trying not to give away too much and that is the reason the review seems quite awkward but honestly, i do not words to describe Bon Joon ho's depth of thought and make sure you add this film in your watch list right now."
PARASITE,12 January 2020,10/10,"Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result.
I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE"
PARASITE,12 March 2021,,Amazing let no trick be hiden in this woumdeful tale watch it now.
PARASITE,3 May 2020,1/10,"At first it was nice to watch, it was funny and harmless, but after a while, they started using violence and it wasn't nice anymore. I didn't like it anymore, I started to watch it because I wanted a fun movie night but it ended in a disaster. I don't recommend this movie if you want a funny movie."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,10/10,"Wow, just wow. This is one of the most perplexing films I have watched. I don't recall feeling so conflicted after a film since I watched Shutter Island. It's a fresh take on a common idea, and it is told in an unbelievablely beautiful manner. Everything about it was simply brilliant.This film is unlike any film you would watch these days. Rather than having a cliché ""good guy wins, bad guy loses"" theme, it actually makes you wonder: who is the good guy here? Who is the villain? It's been about half an hour since I finished this film and I'm still not sure who I'm meant to root with.""Parasite"" starts as a light-hearted comedy about a poor family tricking a rich family into employing them, and it takes an exciting turn which will leave you on the edge of your seat.Then, a very dark plot twist occurs and the movie suddenly becomes scary and completely different to what you would expect from the first 30 minutes of watching. Just as you think the film would end in the next 10 minutes, it simply goes on and on, taking more and more turns along the way.I watched the film because of some of the reviews I read on here and I am very glad I did. If you haven't watched it then I would HIGHLY recommend it."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,9/10,Brilliant way to depict the late capitalism era we are living.
PARASITE,11 January 2020,9/10,"Cinema at its best. Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!"
PARASITE,27 April 2020,10/10,"I love korean movies very much, but this, this is the first time i review a movie, because i really like it, and i heard Parasite won the oscar 2019 woow"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"An incredible piece of cinema, pulls you in from the start, superb directing from Bong Joon-ho"
PARASITE,5 June 2020,10/10,This movie was so enjoyable from start to finish. Didn't know where is was going and that's what I found captivating.So refreshing
PARASITE,19 February 2020,8/10,"This was a very good movie even though I had to read subtitles. I enjoyed it and found the movie entertaining with a message. However, I did find the second part of the movie a little rushed. But, the movie is worth watching."
PARASITE,31 July 2020,10/10,"Parasite is done exactly how a perfect film should be.The exposition introduces the characters, their personality and characteristics, their significance, and what they mean in the context of the film in a way that is interesting, well-paced, and fresh. I deeply cared for the well-being and outcome of all these characters, and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures. It's a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family, but Bong Joon-ho does it perfectly.The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture, giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters. The film takes long winding turns. Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated.The film also does well to never put itself in a box. At times it is comedic, often thrilling, very dramatic, and sometimes even horrific. It has highlights in all categories of appeal.I have nothing bad to say. This is the first film I've watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S. Kings Misery. This movie is realistic and immersive, simply a must watch film, with lots of hard work and time put into it, unforgettable."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"In more years than I want to think about, I never would rate a movie a 10. However, this was impressive. From dark comedy, to violence, to reading everything (which is difficult because I'm not much of a reader) to dissecting each character, it blew my mind. I kept thinking about it days on end. I kept wondering what details I missed that I wanted to find again. This movie is for the creative mind. It isn't for those who just see black and white. From production to writing to music to directing, it was an incredible movie. I'm looking forward to waiting a year or so, so I can relive that magic again."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,6/10,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,5/10,"This movie is so over hyped. I WANTED to love this movie. But as soon as I saw the Palm D'Or logo at the beginning of the movie I knew they were telling me I was supposed to like it and find it intellectual. I didn't. Still don't. The dialogue was bad. The story was meh and none of the tension came from between characters. The most tense movie came from when they were hiding under the table in a will they or won't they be found. Honestly, the same scene played out in Jurassic Park but with the dinosaurs vs the humans. I actually like Jurassic Park more."
PARASITE,3 April 2020,10/10,Parasite was my favorite film from 2019. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The conflict escalates to a boiling point at the end that left me in total shock. A true masterpiece.
PARASITE,23 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is very well written and filmed, having many twists and scenes that leave you in complete shock wondering how someone managed to think about it, Bong Joon-Ho film has several genres within it, it goes through a very sarcastic comedy, for a terror, with a lot of suspense and tension involved, still being able to deal with social drama. This movie is stunning and completamente amazing, You need to watch at least two times to get all the inside things that this movie brings
It is so interesting when someone it is able to do something knew and stand out this days, with the internet it seems like everything has already been done, and this movie was definitely something knew, the way they told the story and the shoots made watch the film much more unic.
Beside all the action that this movie brings they also made a criticism about the differents classes, showing us the upper class and the lower one, how maybe a raining day was good and calm for you, but for others could be the complete opposite."
PARASITE,29 May 2020,9/10,"This movie was sick (you know like good). I felt like I was waiting for everything to come crashing down at any moment, it was insane how much you wanted the family to succeed in their endeavors. They were lovable, even though their actions were meant to be revered you felt like you could relate to them. This movie definitely deserved the praise it received.
That ending tho....."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite, which combines elements of crime, comedy, suspense and social criticism, is almost perfect in the rhythm of the story. This paper attempts to analyze and interpret some of the problems in the film from different perspectives."
PARASITE,18 March 2020,1/10,"I have many video boxes and I bought this and watched it because IT WON A OSCAR.
So it was very bad. It was very boring. As president Donald J Trump said the film was bad. Shame on you hollywood."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,9/10,"I absolutely loved this! The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed. The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened. This was beautiful acted and so well done, I haven't seen a movie as good as this was in a long time. I have no points of improvement, everything was so well thought. This was a movie which took a while to get out of my head, cause everything was so intense. I would really recommend this to anyone!!"
PARASITE,13 November 2021,6/10,"Interesting story, good acting and very good directing.It was far overrated for what it was and it's sad that something this average gets accolades for the sake of promoting inclusivity. It certainly was worth a watch but it didn't deserve any awards."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,Decades have passed since we had such a masterpiece
PARASITE,15 August 2020,10/10,"Best movie i've ever seen. Amazing cast, little bit of comedy, the ending was WOW. Everything about this movie is great."
PARASITE,20 May 2020,7/10,"I thought the movie was great, the plot was very solid and intriguing, even though it felt long because of the subtitles, it was a very enjoyable film. As mentioned in other reviews this movie has a lot of different elements. It has some action at the end, romance, mystery, and horror. The movie does get a bit creepy some times but it doesn't take away anything from the film.However, I just didn't think it was as great as some of the other nominees, even though I haven't seen many, I don't think it's as good as 1917 and others. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic movie, but it's not up there. The movie did get a bit confusing at times but it's still relatively easy to follow.Parasite is still a must watch though, I would recommend it to anyone who is fine with reading subtitles."
PARASITE,1 April 2020,9/10,"I went into the movie pretty skeptical - I'm not normally huge on thrillers, but Parasite pulled out all the right stops. The film was shot well, the score was impressive but not overbearing, and there was hardly a dull point over its two hour run time. Absolutely deserving of the acclaim it's received, and a must watch for those who enjoy social commentary and gripping storytelling."
PARASITE,27 October 2020,9/10,This movieA miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.
PARASITE,8 May 2020,6/10,"The movie itself isn't too bad. It's worth watching if you want something different from what you're used to watching. The story-line is good, it really makes you pay attention on little things, but it's also too simple.Acting was amazing, but I didn't like the directing. Maybe it was just directed in a unique way that not everyone will find its true value, but for me it was boring. In my personal opinion, this movie is kinda overrated."
PARASITE,23 April 2020,8/10,"""If you make a plan, life never works out that way"" A classic line carved in the frame of new concepts and innovative structure of new cinematography. ""Parasite"" belongs to drama? ""Parasite"" belongs to psychological horror? Minute by minute, my mind and thoughts weren't able to keep up with the con family's plan. Through Boon Joon-ho's symbolic symmetrical following shots and a strong narrative all the way till the family dinner at the upper-class house. What lies between those wines is something that the audiences wanted but never expected? There was a shot of the former housekeeper shutting off the light of the basement stairs when it was placed between Kim Ki-jung and Mrs. Park, with a flip of a switch, the mysterious curtain of the house opened. Clearly Boon Joon-ho knows the fine line between a soap opera and a drama. Carrying those anxious and bubbly fragile plans of the con family, I was able to look back and reflect with the father, his emotional status is the needle that penetrates and pinpoint the map of this story. Class between class, what do we expect from wealth and what do we despise from the poor. When we look at these two family, what I noticed is the ""benefit"" that the poor family acquired from the rich gradually shifted into hate later on. By using Mrs. Park's ignorance and her pursuing of reaching a certain hierarchy in her specific social status, and Mr. Park who is the main income source of the family but constant absence of family. Preciousness runs through the upper-class, their vanity of stepping stone to those who truly has exclusive and graceful lifestyles. Surprisingly the story of ""Parasite"" never used something as tangible and as cheap as money to be the bait of desire in the film. Instead it used something as common as daydreaming and curiosity, as we can see, the poor family came to the house with a purpose of fulfilling a purpose of living in quality and wellness. They never planned to harm or manipulate the Parks, all they ever want is sunlight and a clean space with each other. But their plan was jeopardized by another similar family that longs for a stronger purpose - shelter which is conflicted and somehow shifted their impression towards the Parks. To them, the Parks are the emotionless snakes that harvest their effort and their goal of being well in the same society. The scene when two families revealed themselves was tremendous, seeing the Parks reveal what's behind their deceptive looks and words, and seeing the Kims burst with a stronger bond and unity between them is such a horrifying and realistic comparison. Then when we think about it, did Mrs. Park pass out for her husband or for the end of her ""class"". Or we can ask was Kevin's dream of eventually moving into the house realistic or just another anguishing and beguiling plan of his"
PARASITE,9 May 2020,8/10,This movie is excellent and unique. The entirety of the film is like a puzzle that fits perfectly. This movie is intense and exciting. A perfectly crafted lie that is created too hastily and greedily and ruined just as quickly. The bigger they are the harder they fall and the path to success has no shortcuts.
PARASITE,10 May 2020,9/10,"Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!"
PARASITE,12 May 2020,10/10,"It's describing our society these days. You can enjoy it and giving you a new perspective about how lifes in world works. The plot was spectacular with some twist, giving you a stage of excitement about what will happen in the next second."
PARASITE,16 October 2020,1/10,"I don't know why this much of hype created for this movie. I have seen many movies with much great story, screenplay and neutrality. This one too is same as simple as an average movie. It's very boring and I thought it will blown away my mind with great script. But failed to impress me."
PARASITE,5 June 2020,9/10,"Even though, it's not originally in English and you'll probably have to watch it with subtitles; Still You are going to love it so much!"
PARASITE,22 July 2020,10/10,It should have got more Oscars if you ask me. What's not to like? This movie has everything. It's very rare to find a film like that. I think Americans have to start giving subtitles a second chance. Korean movies actually are doing great. I've been watching a lot of Asian films lately for a change I was surprised of how good some of them are. American movies are going down sooner or later.
PARASITE,16 June 2020,8/10,"It was a really great and funny movie, but really predictable which makes it hard to say if it really is one of the greatest. Of course, it was funny, creative and overall just good.
Highly recommend if you're into Mr Bean/Charlie Chaplin comedy"
PARASITE,21 June 2020,10/10,The shows some excellent combination of need and how a family lived in poor slum where even water got lodged during rain. The movie starts on some brilliant note showing how struggling life some people live with. But suddenly thier life changes time by time and all family members got employed. This also shows how their poverty forced them to lie. The movie on some point feels as real world situation. Overall it shows how and what problems a family have to went through for their family and forces them to do wrong things. Must watch !
PARASITE,26 June 2020,10/10,"The film is one of the best examples taking us to the past cinematography, when the storyline, screenplay and acting are so organically harmonized. It does not have a ""happy end"" but gives the exellent picture of the modern society full of harmfool idols."
PARASITE,28 June 2020,10/10,"The best description with which they could represent this movie, a plot of favors that you pay for until it is expensive. incredible well deserved that oscar"
PARASITE,8 July 2020,10/10,"A brilliant Korean movie with strong characters. Such a big divide between the wealthy and the lower socio economic class. You gotta do what you gotta do to survive! Subtitle movie, so prepare to read the whole thing but it is so very worth it."
PARASITE,26 July 2020,10/10,"I love it because it's an amazing movie, perfect cast, amazing direction and cinematography, production value to the 100... plus it's not American! This is brilliant!"
PARASITE,28 July 2020,10/10,I still can believe that a Korean movie crashed everyone in the Oscars! I am really glad that happened. And the good news is that the movie actually is fantastic. Maybe Joker was a better film but who is going to give Joker a chance? Better Parasite than 1917!
PARASITE,19 August 2020,10/10,Thrilling and hauntingly funny. A just winner for the best Oscar! My favourite film of the decade.
PARASITE,6 September 2020,3/10,How could someone like this movie.by far the most overrated movie to win an oscar.
PARASITE,13 September 2020,10/10,This movie is one of the most unique I have seen. The ending is definitely one you will remember. The combination of the whole film and the ending leaves you on thoughts and gives a feeling you may have never experienced. I highly recommend this movie. Absolute masterpiece!
PARASITE,10 October 2020,10/10,"Wonderful movie in 2K19, I'm watched this film several times, every time I'm thrilled. I specially thanks to movie director."
PARASITE,11 September 2020,9/10,"A very very well made movie with fantastic acting, storyline and direction. Even just with the subtitles, you understand the movie fully because it is so gripping. It seems natural ! Its funny, dramatic, emotional and what not."
PARASITE,26 April 2021,6/10,Movie has good story but hue made for this makes it over rated.
PARASITE,1 November 2020,9/10,"In fact when I was first watching the movie I had no idea that it was nominated for any reward. To tell you tge truth I am absessed with kdramas and because of the country memtioned in the movie I was expecting sth in that scenario.
Of course it has nothing with kdramas!
Very interesting and for me a little unusual movie. It evakes emotions (mainly negative) but it doesn't mean to be bad. In my opinion art is about evoking emotions (no matter what kind of). So in this perspective this movie is all about art."
PARASITE,10 December 2020,10/10,All actors and director both done great work i can't explain
PARASITE,22 July 2021,9/10,"If you are wondering how the hell did a Korean Film win the Best Picture award at the Oscars, your doubts will all be cleared after watching the film just once ! The perfect mixture of all departments gives us a picture, strong both in narrative and filmmaking. The story touches upon the social lines between the poor and the rich and easily weaves it into the story. The production quality is top- notch and the actors do a really good job in conveying the emotions. This is a must watch for any cinephile and normal viewers alike."
PARASITE,7 August 2021,10/10,"Ive seen many reviewers here rate it low because you ""are supposed to feel bad because the main characters are poor"" which I do not agree with at all. No one is the ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"", it's the true world of humans with good and bad qualities. And how it's survival of the fittest. It truly represents a part of the South Korean society where looks, money and social status come before anything else. The name parasite is very clear, how the Kim family feed of the Park family's wealth.It has amazing cinematography. The lightning, settings, the Park house and the vision just works. You notice more and more every time you watch it. It's a true experience like no other I've had. I really recommend it and to watch it with little to no info before. This is one of my favorite movies of all time."
PARASITE,4 January 2021,10/10,"The 2019 film ""Parasite"" is as simple as a stroke of brilliance by director Bong Joon-ho. The film perfectly encapsulates its message of classism in way that few would find offensive or biased. As both the Lower Class Parks and Upper Class Kim's are shown as living their lives to the best of their abilities. The classism perpetuated by the Kim's truly does not seem intentional, but rather from their misguided views about the world that simply leave them unaware of the suffering of lower class families such as the parks. One scene that beautifully encapsulates this unintentional ignorance of the Kim family is the scene of the rain. While the Kim's see the beauty of a rainy season saying that their son loves the rain. The Park's see the world completely differently, as the flood quite literally is a hazard and a destroyer of the park's sub basement living space. Even when a character looks evil such as the former house keeper and her husband, their motivations fit with their situation. When Chung Sook threatens to call the police, Moon Gwang is left with no other choice then to snap the picture of the family and threaten to expose the Park's. Near the end of the movie Geun Se goes on a murder spree but only as a way of revenge for the park's unintentional murder of Moon Gwang."
PARASITE,14 December 2020,9/10,"One of the best movies in recent years!
Quirky,original and visually stunning.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat with constant plot changing.All in a very subtle way.
Finally a worthy winner!
It will stay with you for days and most importantly ....it will make you forget La La Land."
PARASITE,3 August 2021,10/10,"The film ends with Ki-woo narrating the aftermath: He awakens in the hospital from head injuries only to have his Miranda rights read to him. He's charged and on probation with his mother; his sister, Ki-jung, has died; their father long disappeared and his whereabouts unknown. On a hunch, Ki-woo hikes a mountainside that overlooks the Park house where he notices a flicker of light that registers as Morse code. His father, using a method Kun-sae perfected, is tapping out a message to him. The film ends with Ki-woo writing a reply. As he speaks in a voice-over, we see his fantasy take shape: He has a plan. He's going to go to college, and get a job, and make a lot of money. He's going to make so much money that one day he'll be able to buy the house himself, and all his father will have to do is go up the stairs and walk out into the sun.Parasite's penultimate shot is swathed in fantasy: father and son hugging on the bright, green lawn of the Park house that is now rightfully theirs. Bong could have ended the film on that note of dreamlike ambiguity, but instead he returns to the half-basement where the movie started, descending from the cramped window space down to Ki-woo writing the letter to his father. There is no mistaking what the reality is. His desire to continue striving is Sisyphean and is the boulder that will eventually crush him. Hope is the emotional parasite in the film: the thing that keeps us going but sucks our marrow dry."
PARASITE,28 January 2021,10/10,"Much was said about this film, and when that happens it is difficult for reality to live up to expectations. In my case, it did. Its structure and script are sharp, and it is replete with subtleties and subtext. We need more films like Parasite."
PARASITE,12 June 2021,6/10,For me this movie give uncomfortable feeling... Even though it has nice first half... I don't why this movie got Oscar 😒
PARASITE,25 January 2021,10/10,"This movie is full of suspense and thriller, drama, crime and many movie, that's why it got an Oscar award. Must Watch!"
PARASITE,14 February 2021,9/10,"I purposely didn't find anything out about this movie and it was worth it.
It was one of those films where you don't have a clue what's going to happen or where it's going. It's brilliant and the acting is amazing. I've not see a film like this before. The only film that I could very loosely compare it to is Once upon a time in Hollywood only because you didn't know where that film was heading also (I loved that film too).
The Parasite was definitely a worthy winner of its Oscars."
PARASITE,21 February 2021,9/10,No words for this movie... Must watch movie for everyone
PARASITE,29 June 2021,10/10,This is a well written and well performed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
PARASITE,5 April 2021,9/10,"This really incredible movies, Korean have a great direction for this movies, they deserve for the Oscar winner a really masterpiece."
PARASITE,16 April 2021,9/10,"Definitely worth the watch. Acting is great and so is the plot. Only complaint is the pacing, the ""big reveal"" about 2/3rds in is a bit odd and feels out of place, especially considering how important it is to the climax of the film. All in all, a must watch."
PARASITE,22 May 2021,8/10,"The first half of the movie was slow but not in the bad way. It builds up each character, gives you an interesting story to keep your attention and shows the true nature of each of our main characters, all before the second half of the movie which is packed with tense moments that made me want to hold my own breath and ends with exactly what I wanted the story to end with, a great conclusion with a satisfying ending.The music and acting throughout was great and made each scene shine as bright as it could. Overall, Parasite is a really good film and was really fun to watch, very interesting and would highly recommend!"
PARASITE,29 May 2021,9/10,"This is a nice movie with full of metaphor. I don't say this is a masterpiece like many people say but I don't agree that someone say it is a mediocre movie. Personally, I don't want to watch this movie again because it is too profound. I felt uncomfortable after watching it. I think this is exactly what the director's intention and actually he succeeded on that point."
PARASITE,24 June 2021,10/10,"Yet another adrenaline-filled , suspense thriller by the director Bong Joon-Ho , the master director of thriller movies.The movie is set in South Korea depicting two families and their ways
Parasite follows the Kim's family struggling to make ends meet until his son Ki-woo comes across an unexpected opportunity. With no experience in teaching English, he decides to accept a job tutoring Da-hye, a daughter from the wealthy Park family. And thus, a mission ensues for the entire Kim family to intrude the lavish household.One by one, each family member secures a job under the guise that they're vaguely connected through mutual contacts. And although the two families eventually settle into a give-and-take relationship of service and riches, there is an unforeseen parasite that threatens to destroy it all by exposing the truth.The film is brilliantly written and directed and it covers the very minute details.It shows the conflict between the rich and the poor and the difference in their lives and problems. It is a roller coaster ride of all the emotions combined together and will absorb you into its world of thrill.I would strongly recommend this movie to all the viewers seeking the depth of suspense."
PARASITE,26 June 2021,9/10,Such a amazing film. Impeccable and intelligent story that takes a strategic turn throughout the film.
PARASITE,2 July 2021,9/10,"In over a year I have watched one single film, starting from April I went back to watching the series format, but a film experience is different, especially with one that lasts little more than two hours. I grow a little tired as the story progressed, but I assume it is only because I have not watched the format for a long time. Nonetheless, I did not feel boredom, it was a good start for a return to watching the film format.My second exposure to South Korean cinema, after watching Oldboy, presents a number of elements that direct the story and give the viewer an explanation to accept what is going on and immerse themselves into the narrative that is taking place, these elements don't strike as being obvious but if accepted or ignored the viewer is to be rewarded by being emotionally engaged and producing both laughter and tears as well as experiencing the high suspense than any good thriller is meant to create.It is a professional work, the acting is engaging, the script even if translated seems authentic and the cinematography and the directing are innovative and tasty. One prominent example that makes this film a unique experience is a scene where the mother of the Park family tells the mother of the Kim family, in the kitchen in front of the fridge, about an event in her son's earliest years that involves a ghost, the first mother will go about telling the story and meanwhile the fridge will open slowly, and the view will be focused on the fridge and we will see in front of it a cake with candles that are lit right after a birthday cake was mentioned by the first mother. In this scene, elements from the past and the present were fused triggering a response suitable for a scary ghost story, it was succeeded by a scene representing the event.An obvious theme in this film is the disparities between the classes of society. The Kim family face many daily struggles and they are driven to engage in a ridiculous activity to get paid and that is cutting pizza boxes in a specific shape. Once an opportunity arises, even one that bring morale into question, they seize it, and we can see how the family is happy for coming upon such an opportunity. Once the Kim and Park families were connected, more opportunities presented themselves that were again taken even though the morale stakes were increasing. We witnessed the Kim family plotting to remove people from their jobs only to take them. The end product is different jobs around the Park family where the Kim family pretend to not know each other. This is where the title can be introduced, a Parasite. Many falsified premises were provided to the Park family and many plots were put into action only to receive money, to receive payment for tasks that are actually accomplished. The parasitic behavior is portrayed in how the Kim family assumed control over the Park house when they were away. The film goes into deeper lengths to present what those in fight for survival go through, from living in atrocious conditions to being forced into acting like an Indian highwayman. The poor strip themselves from morality and dignity for survival, and the rich afford to be oblivious."
PARASITE,4 October 2021,2/10,First half was ok- acceptable. Second half full of farfetched storylines and violence.
PARASITE,31 October 2021,9/10,"Ki-woo being crippled by something that really started this movie is very ironic and sad at the same time. Something that really excited me in this movie is the cinematography and the turning point of this movie - from the funny joke to the absolute psycho mode. Can't get enough of the idea of this movie, how everyone from success ended up being that one they were trying to get rid off. This movie comes-off like a great art with absurd soundtrack that still sounds good. This movie is near 10, it could be more artistic from the cinematography point, but still a must-watch."
PARASITE,23 February 2020,3/10,"I don't care much for farce. Farce is a story where all the plot tension comes from a pretense. A quarter of the way into this, it's clear we're in the land of farce. Halfway in, we're bored and restless and merely waiting for the pretense to be caught out.The cinematography is nice. The acting is competent. The struggle of class against class is forever relevant. But it's still farce."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,7/10,"That sums up it all. When the characters seem to have been made to order, so as to fit the plot no matter what, chances are you won't enjoy the film. You will still be curious to see how it ends, though."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite (2019)With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking.
I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension.
The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting.
That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place!
Enjoy it!"
PARASITE,15 September 2019,8/10,"A great Korean movie that doesn't disappoint. This movie starts off as a comedy drama, then turns into a mystery followed up by a thriller and ending with heart. A great ride for those not afraid of subtitles."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,7/10,It was a really good dark comedy. It was boring in parts. Definitely some flaws. I'd say the 1st half was the better part. It didn't deserve any of the oscars it received. Snow piercer was a better movie by the director and even that didn't deserve any oscars. I love the director though.
PARASITE,3 March 2020,1/10,Maybe I dont understand how to watch a movie or rest of the world dont understand how to watch a movie. I'm on the side of this movie is overrated movie. This film not deserve Oscar or something. Movie get all the awards because of there is a little political message. I will give hint also Kim jong-un
PARASITE,29 January 2020,5/10,"The high reviews for this movie say everything about the maturity of the critics and nothing about the so-called quality of this film. It's an average film. The story is mediocre and unoriginal. The humour is juvenile (exploding toilets tells you everything). The gore you'e definitely seen before. It is beautifully shot, and with a decent script the director could make a solid film but this certainly isn't it."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,10/10,"I can't believe how good Parasite was. All three acts of the movie were so weirdly great. Hilarious throughout and somehow tense, I love both of the family's characters, and the ending was perfect."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,Being a great fan of Dark Comedy Movies...I loved the film. It deserves all the osacars and all awards it received. An amazing film to watch. I have seen it again and again and looks like lots of things to learn in this film. Congratulations to the creators of this great piece of art.
PARASITE,24 February 2020,5/10,"The directing is ameteurish compared to the other nominated directors.
The story is interesting but not excessively.
The characters are all paper thin and one dimensional. Their motivations and actions are not justified. E.g. the main murder is almost comically undeserved, serving only the useless final plot twist.
Americans must not have seen any Korean movies before because this tone is very common. There was nothing exceptional about this film but it probably surprised American audiences with many aspects unfamiliar to them. That is the only reason I can imagine this won the academy award.And best director? Really? No. Definitely not. Any director that can't justify major main character actions with his or her storytelling still needs some work,not an academy award."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"This movie have some very unexpected turns. I found it pretty entertaining to watch. Oscar-worthy? Well, not in my opinion. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just that good. I found the dialogue between the characters quite exaggerated a lot of the times. All in all, it is a pretty good movie. But not worthy the extreme praise given from a lot of movie critiques, and not really worth the very high rating given here by the users of IMDB."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,10/10,"It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,9/10,"This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,,I'd like the first intention of the film but doesn't like the way it's developed
PARASITE,11 February 2020,3/10,Mother in 2009 is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie was weak with a terrible & predictable ending. It only won an Oscar the downward slide of Hollywoods unoriginality
PARASITE,14 February 2020,7/10,"The movie is definitely well made and has a good twisted ending but to be honest, it is nothing special. I watched it because of so many great reviews and awards and while I loved the slick way it moved instead of being slow - I have watched enough such movies in Indian cinema to know that it is not a masterpiece."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,3/10,"I hate this movie. There is no story. What is the point? How this movie got an Oscar? Am I that stupid that I can't understand the ""art"" behind this movie? So many questions."
PARASITE,15 May 2021,10/10,"Tuesday afternoon. Summer is coming to a close. I hear that the local independent cinema is showing the new film 'Parasite' that has been getting tons of hype. Whats all the fuss about? Well let me tell you.Cinema was packed. Opening Credits, then the movie begins until the final credits at which point the movie had ended.Final reflections: This movie does not fit into a genre. It feels totally fresh and has comedic moments which landed with the audience in the room whilst exploring much darker themes and moments. The cinematography is beautiful and innovative and is a great palette and paintbrush for the social commentary that exists in the movie. The casting is brilliant and the dynamics that exist between the characters is entirely believable."
PARASITE,24 December 2020,1/10,Overhyped. Story is usual one. Why it is so much rated?
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,Every frame of this movie is a film diploma itself .. Surely one of the best movies in last 10 years
PARASITE,27 September 2020,3/10,"I don't get why this movie got so many awards. The acting is not great and it looks a bit dumb. All the near moments they almost get caugt. And then in the end hey found the money after coming from nothing.Someone described it as the best movie he saw in 2019 so that is why I watched it. But I feel like I lost a bit of my life here. But still interesting to see I am in the minority here. Ah well, there goes my hope for humanity lol."
PARASITE,26 April 2020,10/10,"I watched this movie one week ago, was bored after 30 min and shut my pc down. Then my father and friends told me to give it a chance, I was like why not. I am so happy to listen to them, I have never seen a movie going from super boring to super thrilling and shocking. This movie well deserved an oscar. Avoid spoilers."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,9/10,"Yes, that's a question i put up to people saying they were bored and talking all trash about the movie. It's by far the best movie I've seen in a foreign language. The plot twist and the twisted end is worth it. If this doesn't satisfy movie watchers, god knows what will."
PARASITE,26 April 2021,9/10,"The smell of being poor is hard to scrub off. Mr Kim and his resourceful and conniving family are working on it, but its engrained right in there. They come up with a plan to infiltrate a wealthy household and live vicariously through them. First, his son, then his daughter, then his wife and, finally, him end up working for the upper-class Park family. Their plan is simple: recommend each other to the nervous mistress of the household, while spreading mistrust about the existing staff. It's a plan which works perfectly.Bong Joon Jo's narrative, humour, incredibly beautiful and thoughtful direction is deserving of every plaudit it's received. The film just oozes intelligence, conscience and is masterclass in filmmaking. But equally as important is the casting-there isn't a passenger in this film. So-dam Park as Ki Jung, the daughter, Woo-ski Choi as Ki Woo, the son, and Lee Jeong-eun, the mother, are stand out, for me.The social commentary about class in this film is worth taking the time to watch it, even if it wasn't so thoughtfully entertaining. If this is the quality of Korean cinema, then keep them coming."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"I have deep roots in Korea and for obvious reasons i like korean cinematography.
In this case i am really pleased that this movie is the first ever in history to have won an oscar as the best movie of the year and not being an english speaking one.
What i do not get, is the hype around it. It is an OK movie, like a modern black-noir comedy thriller about nowadays korean society, and it depicts it quite well...BUT this is not enough to be so astonishingly over-rated. Tons of korean movies are better, but for some reason this year, whole word decided to give PARASITE the green light to the top of movies sancta sanctorum world."
PARASITE,25 June 2020,7/10,"I don't blame this movie.. overall it has story (Ok) , good screenplay (though most scenes were so predictable!) and a typical chinese thriller drama movie.. still wondering So,is this enough to won Oscar?!"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,3/10,"I gave initially 7 stars, but I changed it to 4. Why? It's not close to get even 1 Oscar. 7 stars was for a little sympathy for the Korean films. But getting undeserved 5 Oscar's has let me lose all the sympathy for this film. A Bollywood kind ending was terrible enough. The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences. I'm very disappointed in the Academy Awards. There has been many good foreigner films in last decade and non has won any decent prize."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,2/10,"This ""movie"" is anything but good. I do not understand why some critics say it is a masterpiece!?!? Wtf!!! At least 7 movies of 2019 where far better. The movie is improbable and pretentious! Very dumb movie."
PARASITE,10 January 2020,1/10,Skip this movie. Cannot understand how anyone can think this is good.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,6/10,"It's not a bad movie, it's a good perspective on society and what money creates. But I couldn't agree less with Oscar for best motion picture, come on, so good movies in 2019! WTF Hollywood?"
PARASITE,1 March 2020,10/10,"I could not wait to see this film again as soon as I walked out of the theatre!The film making is incredible, script writing is perfection! And the beautifully shot cinematography all blend together to create such a funny, sad and often tense story!"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you."
PARASITE,30 December 2020,1/10,"I don't like to read a movie, give me a book. At the very least, an overdub would be better."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,4/10,"One movie I definitely recommend you DO NOT see is ""Parasite."" For the first hour it is a clever and engaging black comedy, with pointed social satire, but it gradually morphs into an over the top slasher movie. It was like Tarantino and the Cohen brothers took over the set in the second half-- or they may have turned the plot development over to a team of adolescent skin-heads.
The fact that ""Parasite"" has received so many accolades is testimony to the state of aesthetic blindness of our culture today."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"I'm sure I'm not the only one to see the similarities - which is not meant as a negative comment in any way ... if anything I hope it leads to an Inside no. 9 film - that said - I seem to remember the League of Gentlemen film being a bit crap even though I loved the TV series.Parasite keeps you interested from start to finish with great comedy, great characters, great twists & turns, great cinematography during the flood sequences and I especially enjoyed seeing the contrast between living standards in South Korea.So many good things to enjoy like the impression of a North Korean news anchor, dark humour. My favourite character was probably the father but I loved them all for different reasons.Definitely going to seek out more Asian films now."
PARASITE,18 October 2019,10/10,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
PARASITE,18 November 2019,6/10,"This is an entertaining movie, but count me among those mystified by the hypr it's generated.
1. It presents the Parks more synpathetically than the Kims. I suspect the rich will take more inspiration from this movie than the poor, and ""Parasites"" sure seems like a call to arms by billionaires.
2. As someone else pointed out, at the start of the movie the Kims can't even fold pizza boxes, but a few days later they're suddenly geniuses.
3. Shouldn't the first chauffeur have turned up in the bomb shelter as the son of the first housekeeper? An opportunity to reinfoce the theme that was carelessly missed by the screenwriters."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,7/10,"Finally a movie comes what matches Hollywood's standards of cinematography and direction # Ideally a very simple tale of a struggling family trying to make ends meet thru a con job when desperation becomes the hour & that goes horribly wrong at the end # but what makes or let Parasite deserve the Best Oscar Movie award is the drama that unfolds in each of these characters justified to their suitable roles , epic dialogues and role play give a definite meaning to the film , but what Boong John Hoo could have done is continued the timeline after the climax unfolds since he stretched it this far to get the message of class divide thru a comical yet satirical approach thru a con family trying to meet ends and justified the true purpose of the movie , that backstabbing in the climax got a bit too far and took away the message of the film and instead the previous climax when it rains showed the true perspective, should have continued with that & with the character of Kang Ho Song proving his loyalty and finding out the true thief in the end and make it thrilling with a twist with still ends to meet like they ended up where they started at the grave end of things # Beautiful Movie shows a degree in Direction of Cinema does hold weightage # So ideally it's nice publicity for a Foreign Film to win the Oscar to gain worldwide audience and throw light on a different culture as this year I dunno Hollywood couldn't live up to its directorial concepts despite big names , Well done Bong Joon Ho could have ended up well and more insightful had it thrown light on other subjects in the city but certainly a great attempt # Korea @ Parasite #"
PARASITE,28 July 2019,9/10,"After watching movies Please say that it is not normal. Have all the emotions Not like general movies If listening to it from Korea, it will be fun to watch. Worth the ticket to see"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"The critically acclaimed South Korean film 'Parasite' recently won 4 Oscar awards, namely, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Foreign Film and Best Picture. While fans are in awe of the film, many Twitter users from India are now claiming that the film is inspired by Tamil film 'Minsara Kanna' starring Vijay, directed by KS Ravikumar. The films revolve around a poor family who work at a rich family's place in order to survive. While 'Parasite' did amazingly at the box office, 'Minsara Kanna' which was a 1999 release received average reviews."
PARASITE,29 September 2020,9/10,Was absolutely blown away by this movie. Some scenes had me crying with laughter and some scenes made me sit on edge.Knew this movie would be good but the storyline is so funny but also so unique and clever and it just keeps getting better and better with larger plot twists. The movie is also quite easy to follow and isnt extremely complex. Had a lot of respect for Korean filmography and this has added to that respect a lot.Looking forward to see what Bong comes up with next for sure
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,Best movie in 2019 really it fantastic I really enjoyed and loved a actors and I feeled I was lived with them that is the first Korea move I ever watch
PARASITE,5 September 2019,9/10,"Boon Jong ho's parasite is a slow burner 2hr film telling a story about two families (actually3) whose lives gets entangled within a house. Although the last half hour movie do make out of the lost time initially where the story takes some time for the build up.
The mansion has a special eerie feel throughout the film and you will know why it feels like that later on. The background score supports the eerieness. I watched the film in Korean language using eng subtitles edited by a Korean guy who knew only handful of English. So there were scenes where I had to literally assume what had happened by looking at the frame alone.
Overall you won't regret watching parasite ,infact it's a must watch for people who likes seeing unpredictable films"
PARASITE,16 September 2020,7/10,"The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors, but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary!You won't be disappointed watching it.
Again, highly overrated."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,1/10,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit through. Despicable characters, a drawn out storyline, and annoying dialogue made the enjoyable act of movie watching a chore."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,9/10,"There is hardly any doubt that with every discovery and innovation we are inching towards a drastic change simultaneously progressing as well as transgressing. Some people like to call this the end of the human race. However, there is a lot of churning and grinding that remains before one finally reaches the highest level of degeneracy or supremacy. To put it succinctly, Parasite is an animated movie with humans as lead characters and in fact, it is a movie with 'animals' as its prime audience. And animals don't 'see' ; their primary sense is instinct and avoiding all sorts of dangers, their major interest. The question that needs to be posed here is not who is blind but to what degree is one blind. Parasite can't be seen. This particular movie poster is interesting as everyone is blindfolded somehow implying that everyone is blind.
Subterranean Views
On the surface the Park family has a prosperous life; they possess a huge villa along with a driver, housekeeper and tutors. The Teks, on the contrary, stay in a sub-basement infested with pests. Both their dwellings have severed ties with the outside world and provide an incomplete picture - the sub-basement only allows visual access to the lower half of the lane where passer-bys mindless of the fact that corners where they were so shamelessly urinating could be a home to a family whereas through the French windows of the villa, one has an idyllic panoramic view of the pruned garden which in its own way is a slice of manufactured reality as it is guarded by high walls on all sides.
Picturesque Panorama
The movie does explore the disparity between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' but not simply in a matter-of-fact way; it goes beyond realistic depiction and shows how in this post-modern day and age the dividing lines between these two classes become blurred. What seems as a prosperous household is in fact rife in conflicts.Basti-esque
One of the rudimentary manifestations of this can be seen in the rich son, Da Song who is supposed to have internalised the American Indian, the essence of experience that he captured from his previous expedition. This in any case would have been any other nine year alone indulging in make-believe; however, for Mrs.Park this seemed to be erratic behaviour which had to be kept under check. She likes to think of his artworks as 'Basquiat-esque' and justifies his eccentricity as genius. Neither the mother nor the father try to address what could be the root cause of this problem, instead they keep hunting for a tutor. On the other hand, his sister, Da-hye doesn't seem to be a predominant subject of parental concern.
Da song as American Indian
Ki-jeong and Ki-woo act as foils to the rich siblings as at least superficially they seem to have a better control over their lives, it's the lack of resources wherein they are challenged. In spite of not having completed their studies, they are quite adept to take on the world. Needless, to mention here that Ki-woo invests a lot of faith in his father's plans unlike Ki-jeong about whom the family unanimously concurs that she doesn't belong with them and was meant to be the first deserving candidate to acquire a higher strata.Mrs.Park comes across as a docile homemaker ,the centre of gravity of the household but that partially is shared by the housekeeper as Mr.Park says that his wife had no talent for housework and that she was bad at cleaning and her cooking was awful and he was thankful to have Ms. Mun Kwang who cooked awesome braised ribs and kept the house in order. On being asked by Ki Tek,if he still loved his wife ,Mr Park sneered it off by saying let's call that love.The husband is highly class conscious and and in his interactions with his driver he makes it evident that he doesn't like his workers crossing the line. Unfortunately for him,the smell that Kim Ki-tek's family reeks of, doesn't adhere to the class boundaries that Mr.Park is vehemently determined to keep intact.
Subwayers' Stench
Kim Ki-Tek, the poor dad, on the contrary, is not class conscious but oblivious of his reality as a result of which he keeps coming up with make-shift plans, plans that lack planning as a cure to the daily problems that his family has to grapple with. To put it very crudely, he is a hopeless romantic who up until the climax retains his calm and composure. Soon, he is at the verge of losing this presumptuous pensive facade post climax when the story takes a riveting turn.
Plan is a common thread that runs throughout the movie especially for the working class family that is the only hope that keeps them going on in their lives, However, the nature of these plans are to be questioned as they are short term, based on addressing immediate needs and oblivious of the cries of posterity. Ultimately, the so-called plan boils down to its nascent state and ceases to exist as Kim-ki Tek says that the kind of plan that never fails is to have no plan at all.Therefore, Parasite is an apt title for the movie as it shows how the bourgeois as well as proletariat family exist as parasites, in case of the working class it is quite evident and the complete transformation corporeally too takes place on the night when the Parks' birthday plan to take Da song for camping fails and they have to return home and we see the Tek family hiding under the couch and they have to crawl out sneakily. Also, in the first few scenes when Ki-jeong and Ki-woo are hunting for the wi-fi signal, they sit huddled together in a corner beside the pot is also a visual simulation of pests hiding in a corner. Perhaps the underlying rule of the coexistence of these two classes bourgeoisie and proletariat is that they remain blind and follow their routine day in and day out."
PARASITE,18 July 2020,1/10,"It wants to be something that has been done before. That's ok. But it's not the best movie or the year, not even one of the best.
Reminds me of other Korean or Asian movies in general. So, simple story, same old cliches, and a crazy, but somehow predictable twist in the second half.
Would not watch it a second time."
PARASITE,7 December 2019,1/10,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019
PARASITE,11 February 2020,6/10,"I have watched the movie, it does not deserve all these awards and flattery at all. The story is good, and the film in general has a good quality, quite a bit, but it contains many directing errors, like how could the maid's husband tear up his bonds himself? And the father when he came out at the end of the movie, his beard was shaved and he is still very young ... and many other mistakes that make it unworthy of any Oscar. Perhaps it is a political game to say that the Academy is not racist. But even though, it should have not be done this way."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,10/10,"What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."
PARASITE,30 October 2019,10/10,"Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it.
I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars."
PARASITE,27 January 2020,10/10,This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.
PARASITE,10 June 2020,5/10,"That's it, it's overrated. It's not bad but it's not that good."
PARASITE,28 March 2020,6/10,"This movie is about good direction, good acting but it's a movie riddled with plot holes."
PARASITE,31 March 2020,4/10,"Maybe i miss something but i wonder if there's a character you that represents a positive emotion or sympathy. All characters were parasites (and still you can't see a ""cow""! Well, if you think that Almodovar meets Stephen King in Korea that's ok. i want to know, if any one believes this is the best movie ever would he of she will watch the film for a second time? Well, me no! Better from the Old boy? No! Funny? No! So 4 stars only for gasp of classes.-"
PARASITE,19 December 2020,7/10,"As well crafted as this film is, with gorgeous cinematography, a decent soundtrack and brilliant acting, I just found it too much of a slow burner with no payoffs to justify it. I have been a fan of slow burners in the past, namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films, yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it. I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue. The supposed climax never really peaked enough, the horror wasn't all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn't land otherwise to carry it through. Furthermore, the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative. Finally, the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director's discourse with more conviction. Again, I don't want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film. There's some real consideration that's been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary. Yet for me, it just didn't work.
Nevertheless, I invite you to try this one out for yourself."
PARASITE,9 January 2021,7/10,"Here we have a good example of story telling. The characters are presented in a such a way you can't help but feel empathy for their poor conditions. The characters don't really grow however, they aren't shown at any point to have progressed or have learnt anything, meaning they weren't really used to their full empathetic potential. The cinematography is rather beautiful, and keeps the story moving elegantly. But did it deserve the oscar? No. 1917 ticks every single box. It's enthralling, it's unique, the characters develop, and at the end you're left speechless. At the end of this, I didn't feel much. I'm glad it won the oscar, foreign films deserve high praise and are often overlooked, but i'd watch 1917 again and again and still feel as emotional and captivated, is that not what a best picture is supposed to achieve?"
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it. I've enjoyed Bong Joon Ho's previews work but I wanted to enter the cinema with with a clear mind and no expectations. And I was shocked. The movie, every aspect of it, is perfect, from music to script everything was just beautiful. Easy best movie of the year and one of the best of this decade."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho's chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class. Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system.
The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey.
Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963).
There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999).
The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness.
The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,5/10,"The start was cool but turned out to be a more comedy movie instead of a drama.
Despite being advertised. The film is highly unrealistic and beyond surprises."
PARASITE,21 March 2021,10/10,"An Incredible film with great cinematography and great acting. A true masterpiece with a funny yet heartbreaking story, and a well deserved best picture winner."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,2/10,"A overrated movie,plane and simple. They should decide are the oscars about politics or about movies."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,7/10,"So the politically correct award of the year was given to the movie that was a rip-off. Not entirely, but there was so much of Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden in this movie. Just minus the lesbian story and plus the social commentary on rich and the poor.
If you put that aside, it's was a really strange movie for me - the first part of the movie was rather dull, but the second was much intense and even quite shocking. The ending was great and made me think about this movie for few days. So - 7/10."
PARASITE,15 April 2020,8/10,"This movie is a concept that humans have in real too - Greediness. If you being greedy, you will loose things permanently. This movie shows this very perfectly.
Movie starts from a very basic level and turns out very connecting.
Lies,Lies and more lies creates very big mess that in the end one has to die. and for that one many has to die.
Action,romance,drama and suspense bhara hua h sb movie me.
worth watching."
PARASITE,4 January 2020,9/10,"Watched in plane. First 2/3 of the film was superb.
Last act was little silly. Going to see in theater also."
PARASITE,26 November 2019,8/10,"An impressive film, both in terms of its themes, as well as its direction and atmosphere. Excellent plot, multilevel with a good balance. The only, perhaps a disadvantage, are the interpretations, which had weaknesses in expression."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,7/10,Not sure if it's because of coronavirus but I find this movie seriously disturbing. Definitely rank it as dark comedy. Because it is not the hilarious kind. Funny in the 1st part but not that funny in the last bit. Subtle I guess but not that subtle either. Sad was the feeling I got after seeing this movie. Social cast type.
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,What can one not love about this movie...the movie operates at so many layers of metaphors and ironies...the best that has come out of South Korea till date...expect some fireworks this Oscar season...#Bonghivethe movie basically portrays class divide in South Korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor family...the rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor family...the Parasite!!!The beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayed...how the parasite slowly befriends the host...and how it gradually morphs into something else completely...think of all the plot twists and their manifestations in society...specifically the relationship between the owner and the working class...just brings out global sentiments of Capitalism going crazy so beautifully!!!As this movie is being released globally...I am sure the rankings and ratings will further improve...it was released in India around 1st Feb...this movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live in...Recommended...just go and watch this in your nearest theatre!!!
PARASITE,16 December 2019,1/10,"The worst movie I have ever seen. The story is very bad and boring. Waste of time. I shocked when I saw that it got high ratings!! Really if I could rate it with (Zero), I will do. The only way that I can understand that its rate is 8.6 that IMDb forgot to put (-) and its real rate is (-8.6)."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,7/10,"It was good but for one time only, I dont understand why it got Oscar, Overrated in one word."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is great. The cinematography, the acting, the music, the writing, the directing, everything was great! The movie has some really funny scenes too.
This is a darkly comedic, shocking, masterpiece about rich and poor."
PARASITE,29 March 2020,7/10,OK nice film but not the best of the year and also not deserving that much award. I think the story is childish and boringly exaggerated. 7 is the exact point it deserves.
PARASITE,9 February 2020,2/10,"Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."
PARASITE,25 April 2020,1/10,This movies story is very critical and lame. Overrated movi.
PARASITE,20 January 2020,10/10,"I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
PARASITE,23 November 2019,10/10,"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
PARASITE,14 October 2020,6/10,Good if you don't watch the last part of the movie.
PARASITE,16 December 2019,7/10,The story is as good as the cinematography...but 2nd half could be much better as well as the ending.Overall it seems to be overrated considering everything.
PARASITE,2 May 2020,1/10,"It does not represent neither the human being nor the humankind
It's important to watch in original language
The actors are really awful and the ensemble does not convey anything.
The direction is always not enough to create the right path!
Do not watch!"
PARASITE,26 May 2021,10/10,Its just brilliant it became one of my fav movies.
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,This movies is so beautifuly woven together. It's a good look at how humans seperate because of that piece of green paper called money. It shows the sadness and weight of what the poor deal with. Their lives not unimportant but treated as unimportant. It shows that education although a tool for wealth does not teach common sense or protect anyone from their safety called money. Just as the poor are not protected in their strong hunger for it. It's a mad cycle. Eye opener to look within your heart and find out the agenda of how valuable life is over money. Make sure you watch for all the beautifully done allegory's in the film.
PARASITE,21 March 2020,10/10,Nothing much to say. Absolutely amazing. The implicit examples of division between rich and poor were beyond imaginations.
PARASITE,24 January 2020,8/10,"So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation.
Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love."
PARASITE,31 May 2020,1/10,"There was nothing in this movie, bad story, bad acting.. and the worst ending... stupid movie..."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,10/10,"This film is not for everyone, as it is a totally unique style of film and story. In my opinion though, it is done to perfection. I love how it is a bit of everything: a horror, thriller, comedy, romance, crime, etc.I honestly think it's best to just go in not knowing what to expect, and you'll be taken on a wild and fun ride."
PARASITE,14 September 2020,10/10,"This definitely deserved an oscar! It's a masterpiece of photography, acting, and script. I can't say what's the gender of this movie...Start as a comedy and exactly in the middle turns to be a thriller/horror (I'm not joking, it's evenly divided).
It's a ''cult movie'' with subtle meanings behind the obvious, when I finished I didn't understand all the things in the movie. But after a moment of reflection and see reviews and comments on Youtube, I realize the depth in history, how the social injustices were represented, and why the title is ''parasite''.
There's no villain, there aren't the simplistic division between ''bad'' and ''good'' guys, all the people had at least a little bit of parasitism..."
PARASITE,3 March 2021,10/10,I wasn't expecting something as good as this. Excellent. A modern masterpiece.
PARASITE,13 February 2020,6/10,Don't believe the hype. This a a good movie don't get me wrong. It's well made and keeps you interested for most of it. But it completely unravels in the ending where it just seemed rushed to finish it. It reminded me of Game of Thrones where they didn't know how to wrap it up.
PARASITE,28 December 2020,10/10,"It's very good movie. You must watch this movie once in your life. Movie direction is great, story is amazing, acting cast I think everything is perfect."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,9/10,This movie shocked you Avery moment. Story is very power full.
PARASITE,11 October 2019,10/10,"You will watch it and you know it has subtleties
It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other
It doesn't bore you for a single minute
It is the best this year"
PARASITE,7 October 2021,10/10,"I just can't believe it... no matter how many times I watch this movie, it always has an impact on me. It always leaves such strong emotions, it makes you wonder about many things, especially your way of thinking and behaving towards people. I love this movie and I am forever grateful for it - it shows how money makes the world go round... and not in a good way."
PARASITE,30 April 2020,9/10,"Parasite is a film that sends a deep message about people, especially the class system of Korea and maybe the world. The story follows two families that are in great disparity, The rich but Naive Park Family and the Poor but Cunning Kim Family.Kim Ki-woo (Kevin) the son from the Kim Family is the main protagonist in light of the fact that the plot focuses on him finding work for his unemployed Family. quite arguably my favorite character because of how his arc ends, from an unambitious blameless teenager to a determined,decided deceiver with a fleeting glimpse of wealth. His character is lesson in how innocent people must commit repulsive actions in order to protect their loved ones (from what I interpret at least)The Story is written tightly since each setup has a payoff. This is because Director Bong Joon-Ho has written a screenplay that is heavy on Dialogue and the importance of Character Interaction. He further Succeeds by filming scenes with immense detail. The Cinematography is lush yet intentionally metaphorical, for instance when Kevin's Father Drives Mr Park for the first time there is a brighter atmosphere but as his relationship with Mr Park deepens it is intentionally much darker. Close ups are key in presenting the provocative nature of each character especially during the end.Overall I will say this, I have always been a fan of Bong Joon Ho ever since Snowpiercer (2013) became a part of my all time favorite films and Parasite just extends his talented abilities to write and direct entertaining and thought provoking films.Korean Cinema has successfully entered western Cinema and I pray that more foreign films embellish the art that is Cinema."
PARASITE,16 November 2019,10/10,"Just like the movie The Shape of Water ..... this movie is for all intensive purposes banned in Canada .....From the Cineplex site: The movie Parasite (Korean w/e.s.t.) is not playing in TORONTO - ON on 11/16/2019It is playing in Oakville in 1 theater. I will play the local art theater that seats 30 in my town later this month.Interestingly, Google Play has this movie and even has reviews BUT it is not rent-able or buy-able in Canada.Parasite is about the caste systems that operate worldwide, including Canada .... and is a taboo topic"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,10/10,It's hard to pinpoint what's so great about this movie. Just watch it.
PARASITE,25 May 2020,9/10,Genre defying. There is so much happening in this movie - just when you think you have figured it out it shows you something different. It leaves you wondering - who really is the Parasite?
PARASITE,1 February 2021,10/10,These movie is LESSON and the movie is filled with spectacular actor's please do watch movie you will really enjoyed... Finally thanks to DIRECTOR and PRODUCERS for these PHENOMENAL movie.. Only one word.. AWESOME
PARASITE,24 August 2019,10/10,"One thing I always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like ""yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal. Movie is fast paced and I quite liked the ending. Surely one of the best movie of this decade"
PARASITE,4 November 2019,9/10,"I thought was it was one of the best films for 2019. Story was a little confusing. It involves two families: one poor, one rich. The poor family does everything they can to ingratiate themselves into the rich family's lives. They get caught up in a web of lies, starting their own lies with their employment with the family.The movie's plot was a little misleading. You thought it was going to start off as a family comedy heist. Later on the movie starts to take a darker, more sinister turn.Overall, movie was spectacular. The acting was phenomenal. The cinematography was breathtaking.Wouldn't give the movie all 10 stars because of the plot but, would definitely recommend to Korean film fans."
PARASITE,3 October 2019,6/10,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,6/10,I was hoping for something more.I thought it was going to surprise me but it wasnt.It is fun but lacking of wow factors.
PARASITE,26 September 2020,10/10,"Compared to the ""peace and love"" situation in Chinese movie, Korean movie is bold and willingly to talk about the black side of the society.
The class difference is bigger and bigger in both China and Korea. And it is difficult for people to jump from lower classes. This situation has been shown in this movie, however, it is not the main point of it. The greed of the family is what really matters.
The shooting scene is marvelous. It is difficult for you to be surprised when people can be like cockroaches when they are found to parasite at others' home. They are afraid of being found and light. The stair is shown several times to show the great difference between classes.
It is enjoyable to watch this movie, to wonder how it goes and be amazed when the entrance of the secret basement is disclosed."
PARASITE,9 July 2021,3/10,"I liked the first half a little bit and i was hoping the second half will deliver , and nope it's like when you try to cook something nice you get everything ready and start cooking then it comes out bad and you throw it to the trash like this movie exactly 2 hours i will not get back !"
PARASITE,12 December 2019,10/10,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
PARASITE,26 March 2020,9/10,"Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like ""Breaking Bad"" it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!"
PARASITE,1 June 2020,9/10,"A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying ""wow""."
PARASITE,7 March 2021,4/10,"I don't want to bash this film - it had a lot of very good qualities: Nice cinematography, well edited, good sound design, good art direction and decent acting. I'll go as far as to say the story was a very good premise and had incredible potential. BUT: No story is complete without good character development, and this is where this film fails CATASTROPHICALLY.Here it is in a nutshell: WHO CARES?! Besides the imposter family (protagonists) being of low economic status, the writers make almost no effort to make this family likeable in any way shape or form. They are all pretty much detestable scumbags right out of the gate. There is ZERO conflict of interest or moral dilemmas as the family goes about their con games - you know, the kind of writing that would normally draw the audience in and generate sympathy for the protagonists as they make their poor and ultimately tragic decisions.In any good tragic tale, the audience should feel conflicted in their emotions when the protagonists meet their ultimate fate, but this film achieves none of that, at least in my opinion. I was literally rooting for their downfall through the whole film. Honestly, how do you screw that up?! It's classic 101 storytelling.Honestly, if you feel sorry for this family in any form during this film, you're probably a sociopath - and the fact that this film is held in such great regard is very concerning."
PARASITE,29 September 2020,4/10,"Sure, its well shot, crafty in its production. I like the original story, but I am not sure if it is as much of a great movie as it is ""meant"" to be. It's a good watch, but I find it to be far fetch in the negligence of some of its characters and relies on stupidity in their favors."
PARASITE,6 August 2019,8/10,"So well crafted and shaped that it can at times feel a little obvious. It is a very good film and has something to say, an important message for our times."
PARASITE,18 May 2020,4/10,"Story revolves around a Family which goes to an extent of earning money that they accept all types of crimes like fraud, cheating, culpable homicide and even Murder.
Message is pretty clear - Parasite (It's Harmful)
Movie is good till it hits the climax."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,5/10,"I often go to the movie but never write any reviews. Given all the fuss around this one, I felt the need to make an exception: this is so overrated. Do not get me wrong, it's not bad: camera work is good, story is not boring and acting is ok for the most parts (with the possible exception of the girl trying to act drunk on the sofa - think Japanese drama). But describing this as the film of the decade? I guess you need to be pretty illiterate in movies."
PARASITE,7 June 2021,1/10,"I do not like the Korean films, I do not think that they are as transcendental or innovative, much less films that remain in the memory of the viewer as the American ones of the past and I think that people only see them because of the crisis that Hollywood is going through. Sorry my bad english."
PARASITE,22 September 2019,10/10,"I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative.
The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,7/10,"Disturbingly good. Even though I don't like the plot and the ending, there are so many messages in the movie. And this is not american fairy tale, so watched it and I realized this movie was not made to entertain myself."
PARASITE,29 June 2020,9/10,"Very captivating movie, will keep you on the top of your chair at each moment."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,9/10,"South Korean cinema is taking more and more presence in the film industry, proof of them was the last installment of the Oscars, where the main protagonist of the night was the director Bong Joon-ho, who has made several films of diverse genres , among the best known we can find ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja, whose original language is in English, and are productions with original content, with details of great value that makes them hardly unnoticed; However, where this director's genius is really appreciated is in his films ""The Host"", ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder"", really outstanding films, full of surprises and unexpected endings, so in truth my emotion startled the find out that he made another movie, after 10 years since the last one!""Parasites"" is one of the most acclaimed films at the Cannes festival and even won the golden palm, in turn was acclaimed in the ""Oscar Awards"" and won the best film, best International film and best director.Like many of his previous films, he manages to put elements of comedy and drama, comedy is well written and inserted in such a structured way that he cannot take seriousness from the other scenes that were sometimes extremely dramatic, exciting and in some terrifying parts.This film is the culmination of Bong as a total author, since he manages to link several genres in a total collision and thus generate the magic he looks for in one of his works, because ""Parasites"" is one of those works so well spun in its history and in the way in which it is said that he manages to wrap the viewer so that he cannot get rid of the screen.Like all the great movies in history, I consider the experience to be better if you don't know too much about what you are going to experience (I hate spoilers). So I will not reveal almost anything about the plot, I will only mention that several genres at the same time, a comedy, then a thriller and even a robbery movie. It is a really ambitious film and there is too much happening in matters of messages and themes, it is also incredibly well acted thanks to the depth of the characters.
It is a really accessible film that can be enjoyed, because it is one of ""those films"" that you can show people who generally do not choose to watch Asian films, since it entertains you from the beginning and never gets boring, highlighting that It is taken with a beautiful cinematography, the music is fantastic with proper use, and all the characters add to the experience, making it not feel that time is wasted.Movie I would definitely see again."
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece
I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits."
PARASITE,27 November 2020,10/10,Stop reading this review now and just go see Parasite! This movie worth every second of your life.
PARASITE,15 September 2020,10/10,This film is the best. Every hidden message respectively meshes together for a mind blowing theme throughout the film. You can definitely see the directors were passionate about this. Don't listen when people say reading the sub isn't worth it because it is.
PARASITE,17 December 2019,10/10,One of the best films of the decade... With an impressive cast and a talented and an critically acclaimed directed this movie delivers what it promises.
PARASITE,25 June 2019,10/10,This is the first time i have ever seen such a good Asia film like that! You will not regret if you pay some money to see that
PARASITE,22 December 2019,10/10,Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.
PARASITE,31 December 2020,10/10,"Although watching a foreign movie can be daunting for some, Parasite is a great starting point. There are no weak elements to this movie and it is filled with clever reincorporation and satisfying pay-offs to earlier events. The sets are fantastic and the music is appropriate. All of the actors are stellar. This is a movie that all should see even if you don't think it'd be your type of thing."
PARASITE,30 December 2019,10/10,"This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb"
PARASITE,8 April 2020,10/10,"A technically flawless film, director Bong Joon-ho has created a modern film classic that, not only transcends the language and cultural barriers separating it from the rest of the world, but has resonated on such a level allowing it to take home multiple Academy Awards at the 2019 ceremony, including the coveted ""Best Picture"" award. Kudos Mr. Bong Joon-ho.Kudos."
PARASITE,18 November 2020,8/10,"I had no idea this movie existed until the 2020 Oscars, the sypnosis made Paraiste look boring but let me tell you - it's amazing! If you like slowburns and feeling disturbed, this is the movie for you.I would recomend going in blind as you'll get a better experience but reading the description won't spoil anything. Also - don't watch it in dub, I promise the sub is way more efficent and WILL make the movie better.The only reason for rating it 8/10 is because it isn't my favourite movie, there's some flaws and rabbit-holes but the diector did confirm that Parasite will be turned into a series."
PARASITE,7 September 2019,5/10,"Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong. The acting is jarring and obnoxious until you get used to it, the characters and plot are one dimensional, the praised twists by the trailers and critics aren't exciting but shallow and even almost predictable. The scenes that are supposed to be thrilling, like the scene in which the rich family comes home earlier than expected from the vacation to the horror of the parasites, are ridiculous in a cartoonish way without anything of value to contradict it. The cinematography and shots are constantly almost awkward in their cheesy-ness and obvious structure. The film belittles its viewers as well, what only takes away from its own intelligence, by feeding them with a spoon its meaning - immediately explaining in words what was already told in visuals, which more often than not was completely unnecessary and dense. None of the characters make any truly moving progress, and even though the director claims in his movie there are no good and bad guys - he mostly failed to translate this sentiment into the film itself by making one dimensional, static confrontational characters.
No matter how aesthetically calculated cinematic shots are, if there is no core-deep meaning in the film to back them up, they're worth nothing. Moreover, you can't calculate emotion. The visual storytelling of the shots in the film is so obviously calculated almost mathematically, with barely no internal intuition or feeling. And it only makes them awkward, as if the director only now graduated film school and wanted to show off everything he was taught without much experience (which isn't the actual case for Bong Joon-ho).
It seemed like the director tried to achieve what Burning succeeded in obtaining, with addition of supposed-to-be-impressive high budget visuals, music and ""show"", but failed. Burning is a fantastic example to a mind and emotion intriguing film, full of thrilling twists and turns, true dark and concerning aura and human characters that touch the core of your being, which doesn't belittle it's viewers and taken straight out of the heart. Burning is what everything Parasite attempted to be without success. Bong Joon-ho thought too much, and ended up with barely anything of actual worth. Lee Chang-dong listened to his heart and intuition, and graced us with a beautiful, well crafted masterpiece, which in its humble and quiet progression spoke volumes and echoed in the viewer's mind and heart.
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a perfect example to a film which is all bark and no bite.
In one word: disappointing."
PARASITE,5 March 2020,9/10,"Before seeing this movie due to all the hype, I had seen very few foreign films. Not because I never had wanted to, but rather because they are not exactly easy to locate. Naturally since the United States is an English speaking nation, Korean productions and other foreign language productions are not advertised as grandly as say a Quentin Tarantino film. With that being said this review is an advocation for research and stepping out of the confines of ones comfort zone. In the words of the director of this incredible film Bong Joon Ho ""Once you get over the 1- inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."" So let's do as he says... let's take a leap and do something out of our comfort zone. As this film demonstrates in unequivocal terms the leap is certainly worth it!"
PARASITE,14 August 2019,9/10,"First up, the movie is overrated, mostly by film critics. From a critic's point of view, it deserved a 9/10 solely for the great manipulation of scripting, acting, plot design and pace-setting.Plus, I would understand why film makers/ critics are crazy about this movie as the Director successfully played the audience, tricking them to accept a typical family, class-climbing drama with the simplest of tools and minimal resources into a blockbuster. Thus, I rate it as 9 as well.However, from one's own enjoyment as an audience, it is just hanging between a so-so 7/10 and probably, a better 8/10 as there are some solid and memorable moments that I truly enjoyed.Still, there are many reasons to why this movie has not done enough to justify a perfect score or rated as a masterpiece from a production point of view, especially since it did not deliver enough punches to make it relatively great in the big screen.The GOOD,
Its success mainly lies in its ability to engage the audience (I would not say to all but mostly with South Koreans and foreigners who is interested with their culture) and my greatest applaud for it would be the deliberate shift from a classic cliche of Poor vs Rich. Instead, the two sides never collide in a direct manner, that is the only refreshing point of the typical plot and that in itself, is REALISTIC.The BAD,
the movie does not live up fully to its title, Parasite as the effect of parasitic relationship would be to cause its host, harms to certain degree of annoyance.
However, the host family in this movie barely felt any sense of hostility or annoyance or discomfort from the ""parasitism"".
In fact, the accident to the Host family in the end just is completely unrelated to Parasite theme of the movie.Is it easily a fine line between cheap drama, shot well in terms of cinematography and a great classic as there are no elements of a blockbuster tool or shortage of an A-list cast to match its perfect score rating.
In my opinion, instead of the camping twist that everyone is talking about, the impressive note that could have been a game changer would be the flood scene. Unfortunately, that was not well played and became a redundant scene instead.Still, the director is a genius, I would call him the Magician of the Cinema world as he effortlessly got everyone hooked into this illusion of a drama turned blockbuster. Well done!"
PARASITE,3 April 2020,9/10,"I saw the other film of Bong Joon-ho ""Memories of a murder"" and seince that day i wached every movies that i could from Joon-ho and the other directors from his country. He taught me that no mater where are you from and no mater what is your background. All people around the world have the same questions about their life. After watching this movie you do not know who was the parasite. I even thought myself as a parasite..
I can only call this great movie as a masterpiece."
PARASITE,9 March 2020,10/10,"I've never seen a film build up, so artfully, the desire in its audience to see a rich person get killed just for being rich. So well done. The twists and turns, the comedy, the horror. Flawlessly crafted film."
PARASITE,23 August 2019,7/10,"All I thought about was I wanna be rich, I wanna have a girl like Da-hye until the birthday party of Da-song.
It's all about the Kims' desperation. They are struggling to live but it seems they are fated to live in that semibasement.
It would be better if some scenes can be more dramatic."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible."
PARASITE,30 April 2020,9/10,"I first thought not to watch it but as soon as the story goes on we get mix with the characters . They are unbelievable , amazing , authentic , fantastic and funny ."
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"The beginning of the movie was really fun. It was a series of really great scenes. But the mood of the movie has changed. The twist continued, and I was overwhelmed by the actors' tremendous performance. This movie, which ended in tragedy, shocked me. I was amazed at the double tracks and details hidden all over the movie, and I'm proud that it's a Korean film. The best Korean film ever, and the first Academy Award-winning Korean film, ""Parasite."""
PARASITE,19 April 2020,2/10,"If you like this movie, you have a sick taste. Literally. You light laugh and be surprised during the movie, sure, but the ""message"" in this movie is given to you in the first three minutes. Poor people are evil leaches trying to lure the rich. What a fantastic message. And this film was given four Oscars? Laughable."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,10/10,Literally so many unexpected twists and non-clichéLiterally I can watch this movie every single day without getting bored
PARASITE,25 October 2019,10/10,"I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth ""Brilliant"", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥"
PARASITE,18 February 2020,8/10,"After the film getting an Oscar and recommendations from from friends I went to see this movie with high expectations. I enjoyed it, laughed quite a bit at the carnage, but could see what was going to happen from a mile off. Only surprise was much more mundane than what I expected. Interesting and insightful about Korean culture and disparities in living conditions, and the hopes and aspirations of all but felt something was missing. I read that Bong Joon-ho relied on intensive story boarding and this film did feel like enacted somewhat in segments. I thought the first half was slow and somewhat predictable, second half livelier and more enjoyable. Did not think it worthy of an Oscar."
PARASITE,21 September 2020,9/10,The Movie was a totally masterpiece deserving oscar
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,4/10,"After this movie bagged the most coveted oscar,I finally decided to watch this movie.
The first hour went well with the tight plot and realistic situations and performance by the characters but somehow it lost its grip in the second half and characters strangely appeared overdoing. Finally the climax of the movie totally turned out to be a big disappointment. I would have preferred 1917 or Ford vs Ferrari to win the accolades. Even Joker or once upon a time in Hollywood would have been a better choice."
PARASITE,23 December 2019,10/10,"Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece."
PARASITE,15 January 2021,10/10,"I thought this is supposed to be a comedy... And the first half even convinced me it was. And that was a very unexpected turn, this must be the most scariest and saddest movie I've ever watched (even though I don't watch them),"
PARASITE,25 January 2020,8/10,It's great movie with good story and you should watch it one time in your life and it's a best movie I ever watched in my life that explain you the feel of poor life and rich life but its have some unclear things for example why the children didn't tell his parents about the man s massageBut finally its deserve good ranking on IMDb
PARASITE,25 April 2020,8/10,"I am not a movie enthusiast, to be frank. Have seen some of the good movies. Most of them were really very good. Watched this one after it had won oscars and created a lot of buzz. I hate to say this but i couldn't agree with most of the audiences here. I think it is overrated. I can't explain why. Well, not now. May be sometimes later. But, yeah it is overrated. Its a good one time watch though. Can't recommend to anyone i can think of right now. Sorry."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"I was just stunned as the movie ends. The plot is both unreal and real at the same time. So unreal, so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people's moral..The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters, as when Ki-woo was entering Parks' villa, the surrounding was just pushing towards him.I really like some of the details of the movie's plot, especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain, probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain-free dwelling, only to find out the basement flooded. The scene when Ki-jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic. No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done, the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound. The scene when the Parkers' dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun-sae's back was also amazing. I might be over interpreting, but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun-sae dies, nobody would care, not even human's best friend.Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors' expressions when watching the subbed version.And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles, the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn't read them. Maybe I'll watch it online someday and figure out what I missed."
PARASITE,13 January 2020,1/10,"It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things.
I don't recommend this movie."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"Alright so I see a lot of words like BRILLIANT and PERFECT being thrown around and I have to admit.. going into the movie I had some pretty high expectations. I love the suspense Korean directors/writers are able to portray in their movies and tend to create some pretty memorable and surprising endings.
Having said that I watched Parasite with the anticipation that I was in for a wild ride.
First half of this movie I was mildly entertained. I thought to myself okay this seems to be more of a comedic approach to a subject that has been explored countless times in movies. I then thought to myself, wait a minute, the main characters are actually kind of evil. And the rich folks, beside the remarks about crossing lines and Mr. Kims funny smell, seem pretty naive yet nice.
I wasn't sure who we were suppose to like in this movie as i quickly found myself not really rooting for anyone. I didn't really connect with anyone. I just kept thinking they were smart enough to pull off this scheme but were not smart enough to think ahead at making the best of this opportunity?
Instead pride is what seems to ultimately lead to their downfall... They basically lived in a gutter before all this...
NOW sure we can talk about how beautifully it was shot and no doubt the acting was excellent but while this was a good movie it was far from being excellent. Its a good movie. Lets all calm down..."
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.
The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.Grade: A+"

PARASITE,20 January 2020,2/10,"I don't understand how this did so well as the movie is really substandard compared to other movies that come from this region. The way it's scored across all sites I thought it was going to be as good if not better than Oldboy. The reviews kept saying stick with it and there's a mad twist at the end. So I stuck with it even though it bored me half way through and the twist at the end was so underwhelming I was a little bit angry and wasted my time. This scored a strong ""Meh"" with me. Dont waste your time"
PARASITE,4 March 2020,9/10,"First things first, this movie has an incredible cast, all acting their roles with precision on the more serious times and humour when needed. Visually this movie was solid, with the camrea set-ups being almost poetic. I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter."
PARASITE,5 February 2020,10/10,"""A waterproof toy tent, and a semi-basement house that got flooded"""
PARASITE,12 February 2020,7/10,"Pleased for South Korean cinema it got the Oscar nod, but personally for South Korean cinema I much preferred The Handmaiden.
As a film from thus year's contenders, I liked 1917 the most"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,10/10,"I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece."
PARASITE,26 January 2020,10/10,"Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,5/10,"Was it a good movie, meh. Was it a bad movie? No, but certainly not a Oscar worthy movie if you ask me. Te first 30 minutes of the movie are really good, but after the 30 minutes it starts to become a awkward movie with a strange twist. I do like a good twist in a movie but this became just to strange that it didn't make any sense anymore."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,3/10,"This is the most fu*ked up movie I have seen in a long time. I thought the idea was exciting and the beginning was a bit of fun. But it got more and more crazy, I felt sick in the end. just wanted it to end. But I understand why some would like it."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,9/10,"There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,9/10,"It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.Great movie, very psycho!"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,8/10,"A surprisingly interesting film. I absolutely did not expect such a plot. I put off watching for a long time, but when I decided, I never regretted it."
PARASITE,8 October 2020,8/10,I saw this movie about a year ago when it came out in cinemas and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I think its a bit overrated but its still good and enjoyable. I would recommend people see this if they have not already.
PARASITE,13 February 2020,2/10,"At a loss to figure out why this film 1) won best picture of the year US Oscars 2) Cannes Palme d'Or. Also at a loss to understand why film categorized as a comedy.There are moments of humor, but they are few and far between. The violence is also unwelcome.On the Oscars award: ""Joker"" is a much stronger candidate. At least the audience has been advised of the violence in advance.Save yourself time, and possibly money. Skip it"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,4/10,"I found the plot corny, especially the 2nd half from when they let the old housekeeper back in the housef or whatever reasonI couldn't watch the entire film, thought all aspects amateurish. Lost interest half way.After watching Joker and 1917 I thought this film must be darn good to get best picture.So disappointed."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,Such a perfect mirage of spoiled and discriminated minds and society we are living in.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"Some people say that this movie is ""disgusting"", thats because actually it is: social inequality unveiled, disgusting and unpleasant as it is.
Who are the parasites?"
PARASITE,24 February 2020,9/10,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,9/10,"Unbelievable, great movie! Lovin' it!
I think, someday another country will remake this movie."
PARASITE,9 May 2021,10/10,"Great film. One of my favourite movie all time.Actors performance,direction, technical side... everything is perfect."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"Great movie lived up to all of the hype, definitely a must see👍"
PARASITE,2 June 2020,10/10,Simply Amazing. I dont have anything else to tell you..
PARASITE,28 February 2020,8/10,"It's Korean movie , based on survival of poor family on one rich and dumb businessman. It starts with tutor who belongs to poor family and smartly he makes the room for other family members as well in rich family. Movie gets Dramatic turn when old maid came to know that these all tutor driver belongs to same family when owner went on vacation. 1st half is quite good and full of presense of mind and tricks, 2nd half turned violent . If you expect some happy ending kind stuff then The parasite will not for you."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a masterpiece. From it's funny, engaging opening, to it's shocking, sudden end has beautiful cinematography and great hidden meanings throughout the movie. I need say no more.
9.9/10"
PARASITE,13 March 2020,10/10,"No one is ""evil"". Then how come the bad things happen?This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal.
It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer.
It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it."
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,Was a very thrilling movie. Loved the graphics and mood.
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,Very good all up. Loved all the high graphics and soundtrack that went with it. Would see this movie again. Overall very good a solid 10/10
PARASITE,7 March 2020,2/10,That is loved and cherished by who else other than the spcialist commie equality lovers of hollywoodAs president Donald j. Trump esq. said HOLLYWOOD WAKE UP AND HNOR AMERICAThis is boring
PARASITE,8 March 2020,,"This film is Brilliant! I loved it. The portrayal of class struggles, the twists and the tense moments...amazing. This film was brilliantly executed! It is a masterpiece. If you havent seen it yet, dont wait."
PARASITE,9 March 2020,4/10,"I loke the movie, but i hated the actors.. and i don't think this movie deserves the Oscars"
PARASITE,17 March 2020,10/10,"When i saw this movie, i felt very excited due to the stunning story.A lot of actors in this movie are extremely wonderful in acting,which gave me deep and great impression.I am attracted by the story, because it releases the social phenomenon that worths thinking for the rich and the poor. I admire the movie director who is very wonderful."
PARASITE,20 March 2020,8/10,"Gisaengchung is a really good film. I really liked the story and how the family is slowly taking control of the rich family. The methods to make fire the employees are really smart and realistic. Althought I don't think deserve all the prizes he had.
It's a really good film, I can't deny it but it isn't incredible.
The poor family is also really endearing so we can better dive in the movie and his atmosphere. The the plot twists are very surprising and unexpected (i won't spoil).
And finally the end is also unexpected and really clever, but also a little bit disapointing. I recommend this movie."
PARASITE,20 November 2020,1/10,"Parasite is a parody of sorts that crosses genres (comedy, drama, horror). I rather liked the first part, but then the film de-generates into what could be ""sick"" territory.The film touches on some important social issues (e.g., class struggle, relations
among the various social classes) and has accomplished actors, as well as great cinematography, but that does not in itself make for a great movie.This movie does not succeed as a comedy, drama or horror. The descriptors that come to mind for me are: repugnant, de-generate, immoral (or at least amoral), and having an 'eat the rich"" mentality.Perhaps, you shouldn't pay too much attention to my ramblings, however. The film, after all, is rated well into the 8's and won four Oscars.Makes me think of the Colosseum in Rome, which apparently was quite popular in its day."
PARASITE,26 March 2020,9/10,"You really can't ask for more from a movie. Bong Joon Ho tackles inequality with a wonderfully strange concept that unfurls like an onion, becoming stranger and more duplicitous as you reach the core of his ideas--never polemical--not that this reviewer is troubled by polemics--Parasite maintains tension with his usual spiking of lacerating humor. The weird core, the subbasement of the film, reveals itself with creeping vigor. Love."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,9/10,"For all the movie lovers out there, this is a movie to feed on, think about and feel on different levels.
The movie is about a family trying to meet their ends and their way is unique. They try all sorts of small, odd jobs to earn their living until the son in the family gets a job as a highly paid private tutor and the life of this family changes drastically. With him, he pulls along his family and their fate changes.
As drastically the good changes take place in their life, it falls apart quickly too. In a night, everything changes. Bong Joon-ho does magic here.
From the very beginning, the movie starts with a dark undertone and ends in a manner no one would expect it to and that's what makes it worth all the hype and praise.
The story-telling is amazing in the movie. The climax of the movie cannot be anticipated.
This movie gives it's viewers so much to think about, wonder on. It very well justifies the title of the film and the viewer gets their perspective clear at the end. The drastic differences in the lifestyles of the characters is very well portrayed. Inspite of that, how each character has maintained the part they played is commendably shown. Their planning, the difficulties along the way and how they overcome them or whether they overcome them or not, makes the film interesting at every moment.
No wonder how even the language couldn't stop the sheer brilliance of the movie from winning the hearts of movie lovers all over the world."
PARASITE,31 March 2020,9/10,Such a great and funny movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. This kind of movies makes me happy!
PARASITE,1 April 2020,9/10,"I like the film, the way the director presented the family, trying to fit into an non realistic life, but the get exposes by the smell of the poverty."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,8/10,Its a great movie. It has a dark humor vibe than takes a sarl turn and becomes a horror/thriller movie and I love it.
PARASITE,2 April 2020,10/10,"Again, flawless, mind boggling and genius, I'm out of words"
PARASITE,4 April 2020,9/10,"Bong Joon Ho's one of the best masterpiece of portraying social class division with twisting plots are nothing but incredible.The concept of the movie starts with showing the difference between upper class and lower class people lifestyle and their dependency. It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here.The first half of the film follows the family living at a semi basement apartment in poor locality. After the son is given an opportunity by his friend to teach as a English Tutor in rich family and came to realise that although he is earning more , his family is getting what they deserve. As they are not as bright as the son , so son decides to make a plan to employ their family in that house where he teaches. Sooner they become wealthy as they all working in different positions in the same house.
The first half may look flat and give some impression of the base of movie .
But when it comes to the second half there is a major plot twisting. It clears the display of showing the struggle of poor within the unjust society and hence this sudden joyful life comes into tragedy.
This cast members brilliantly performed their role. The cinematography and background score of make the audience more focused!
Its funny , thrilling, emotional and moral based script makes it a masterpiece !No doubt, it is one of my favourite movie and I am strongly recommend it to watch ( although it is an S.Korean movie )."
PARASITE,16 May 2020,9/10,"The story of the film is simple, with no clichés or predictable scenes. As we watch the film, we become more and more attached to the content transmitted there, the light touch of humor makes the film very pleasant. The innovation that Joon-Ho Bong brings in this script is spectacular, simple, but at the same time genuine. Even with very common scenarios and mediocre performances, the film is excellent, really worthy of Oscar. This production shows that we should not be stuck with Hollywood productions, get out of the box, look at the world, there are several other masterpieces like this all over the world without due recognition."
PARASITE,15 April 2020,8/10,"Spoiler alert
Im glad to hear that a foreign movie has practically won all the prizes on the Oscars and not some American Hollywood films.
I liked the movie, but sometimes it was feeling slow. Maybe it was what they wanted to achieve.
I like how they show us a genuine family, with actual issues, and some injustices that nowadays happens more than ever.
But the thing is...
Did they tried to tell us that if you are born in a social class you act like one?
Maybe I just did not get the message that the director tried to tell.Also I found the amount of violence was unnecessary and did not seem credible to me.Besides that, I like how they showed actual problems. When the Dad tells his kid this quote: ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?"""
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,"What an amazing, clever movie. It definitely deserves all of the awards it has gotten!"
PARASITE,16 April 2020,8/10,I suggest you to watch it! Not predictable and enthusiastic thriller
PARASITE,14 May 2020,9/10,"This film has different genres which makes the film unique.Overall, if you're wanting a movie of mixed emotions (comedy, horror/thriller, mystery, sad, psychological, etc.), this movie has it.The story of the family mixed with different genres and sub-genres such as comedy,thriller,suspense,horror is done seamlessly and quite brilliantly such that it feels earned. The shift in the quirky fun heist comedy to horrific edge of the seat thriller is the highlight of the film. There is meaning conveyed in almost every scene,every shot constructed with such precision with much deeper layers into it connected throughout the film,for instance, the Native American reference or the line that Mr. Park crosses that urges Mr. Kim to take such a sudden and extreme action.Such films don't come very often and this movie proves why Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,5/10,I like it. the ending is unexpected and cool. it give me different view on the struggle that rich and poor people face in this world.
PARASITE,16 April 2020,9/10,Amazing film. Masterful direction and performances. Best of 2019.
PARASITE,18 April 2020,7/10,Good movie but it wasn't a good choice to win an oscar
PARASITE,19 April 2020,2/10,"This movie was well written, well acted, and the theme (the have's & have not's, & what they do for personal gain and how to keep it) was, indeed, vividly executed. I'm just regretful that it spent so much time on the dark sides of human nature. It's my own fault for sticking with it to the bitter end, but can you blame me? It's a pandemic, for crissake! I've already watched all the movies that actually make me feel good about the human race. This just isn't one of those."
PARASITE,23 April 2020,1/10,"After watching few moments, I thought 10 star is not enough for this movie. But when i continue, I found that 1 star is more than enough for this movie. Regret. You may like the movie, but this movie was not for me ."
PARASITE,25 July 2021,9/10,"I don't usually watch movies that make me think, it defeats the purpose of mindless entertainment. But this had such great reviews that I had to give it a go, and I was hooked.Don't be alarmed by the adults guide claiming that it is severely gory, it is not. There is some violence but nothing that should deter anyone from watching this.No spoilers here, just do yourself a favour and watch this."
PARASITE,29 May 2020,10/10,Lovely movie.but last part of the movie is just shoking.i felt like.. Wow..awesome
PARASITE,2 May 2020,9/10,"Greed and class discrimination. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect."
PARASITE,31 May 2020,10/10,"It's been 2 days since i watched this movie.
But the story, the characters spacially ki jung are in my mind.
At last when she died was most sad moment 😭😭."
PARASITE,26 April 2020,8/10,"Fantastic storyline, a must watch for all movie buffs"
PARASITE,19 August 2021,5/10,"I watched this film a few months ago and was underwhelmed to say the least. Can't remember much of the finer points of the plot, which tells you all you need to know. Yawn."
PARASITE,25 July 2020,5/10,Second half is very boring and ending is even more
PARASITE,4 May 2020,9/10,"It is a suspenseful movie with some unexpected twists that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Watch and judge for yourself, I totally recomend it."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,7/10,Most of the time when my opinion does not jibe with the majority I am confident in my assessment. With this one I am not so sure for some reason. That being said I think it is ridiculously overrated. I just really did not find it to be anything special. I thought the Japanese movie shoplifters was infinitely better.
PARASITE,5 May 2020,10/10,"Love this story, characters, humor. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's no question tags, doubts. When you are thinking that everything what could happen just happened something new appears."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,8/10,"The tone of the whole film is bleak, with many small details hinting at poor families and rich families."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,8/10,"This movie is very nice and thought-provoking, it shocked me and struck me."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,5/10,"Too much conspiracy.. for a low budget movie .
And beacose it takes 2 hours you must have a lot of patience"
PARASITE,15 May 2020,5/10,"I think the movie is totally overhyped and definitely not worth the 8.6 score. In my opinion there's simply no way you'd score it with anything beyond 6 Stars, let alone prize it with 4 Oscars. Politics... again played a huge role in the Oscars SMH.
Politicizing the nomination and the awards is disgusting. This must be stopped immediately."
PARASITE,18 May 2020,9/10,"Full of surprises, quirky and entertaining. Definitely recommend this film!"
PARASITE,9 June 2020,9/10,"This movie depicts the cultural hints of inequality and respect present in most Asian cultures beautifully. To a certain degree, the 1% disregards the human rights of the help and considers them as just parasites; creatures that will do anything for a paycheck. Subsequently, money is the determinant of cultural status-not identity nor character. The conservative nature of this feudalistic mentality is brought to light with this movie, to which Bong Joon-ho metaphorically uses a symbiotic relationship between the two families. With Parasite, he suggests an egalitarian approach to status and respect, in which uncommonly practiced in today's globalized Asian cultures. The movie does a great job in breaking the barriers and presenting this message!"
PARASITE,29 June 2020,9/10,"Since there are already lengthy reviews here that explained and summed up how original and excellent this movie is, I will focus on the emotions that I felt while watching this unexpected story. The scene that made the most impact for me is the part where the father and children hid under the table while the two owners of the house had an intercourse in the sofa next to them. Beforehand, I had felt a lot of the embarrassment the father was feeling, and it was this scene that I felt it the greatest, aside from the ""killing"" part. We should remember he's a father. He had been setting aside his pride for the longest time, and in that moment his pride was shattered within earshot of his children, and the ""love making"" is making it even worse. The comments about ""crossing the line"", his smell, and other factors a parent would understand, he was absolutely humiliated. And to think that among all the characters of that poor family, it was him that seemed to be a little ""better"" the rest. It felt like a scene that I have been watching for for years, poor parents doing everything and receiving humiliation for their family's sake, and the ones above that doesnt give a damn. To be fair, the rich family didnt seem to be evil, but that's what makes this movie's message so genuine and precise. sometimes, we dont know ourselves that we are doing wrong, because it is already etched in our society. And I loveeee how the characters are really realistic. I love how the director didnt opt for the ""one side is evil and one side is likeable"" play like most do. It just made the meaning very genuine fpr me. And let me just praise the trailer. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and the movie did justice."
PARASITE,11 July 2020,1/10,"Really terrible
I know I am a SAG member myself but let me call this out. it is full of chinamen and chinawomen and the lieberals with no taste will like it. I much prefer Gone With The Wind."
PARASITE,28 January 2021,9/10,"Creating a delicate, yet powerful in its message, masterpiece, Bong Joon-Ho shows to the occidental world once again why South Korean cinema, his cinema in particular, is so great: alternating on point motifs to great performances by the actor, this film really earned its Oscar in the finest way."
PARASITE,25 July 2020,10/10,"I liked this film. The story is very interesting and deep meaning. Who are the parasites really? I think , this is the main question of the film."
PARASITE,24 July 2020,10/10,"What a movie! It was such a pleasure to watch, the hours kept passing and I was completely amazed by the masterpiece that the briliant Joon-Ho Bong made. This is the kind of movie, that makes me so deeply in love with cinema! So, all I can say is thank you Joon-Ho Bong for making this speechless movie."
PARASITE,3 August 2020,10/10,There is a lot of comedy and drama in the film but I consider it a thriller and a good one. I learned a lot of stuff about the culture and pretty much we are not different. It's always the same situation with slightly different dimensions. This is a cruel world.
PARASITE,5 August 2020,10/10,This is maybe one of the best films ever existed. AND ITS KOREAN!!! Amazing. In your face Hollywood.!!! I am a big fun of the director. Kim family vs. Park family. Wow.
PARASITE,30 August 2020,10/10,"I want to salute this movie's director... When I watched this movie, I fell in love with movie's director. Don't hesitate to watch this movie"
PARASITE,22 September 2020,4/10,"These are some films or musics got frame and publicities for no reason at all and actually good ones got no mention at all - this is A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF This. Much much better recent Korean Film would be Deranged, The Berlin File, Miracle in Cell Number 7 and etc."
PARASITE,3 September 2020,10/10,"First of all, my friend recommended me that movie so I saw the movie first I thought the movie will be boring but after sometime I can't get my eyes out becaus it was suspicious and funny movie. The narrator and the actors were excellent and the ending is quit good.
Overall I really enjoy the movie😇"
PARASITE,18 September 2020,9/10,What I loved about this movie was the story. A simple and tragic yet original story of some unfortunate families. It tells you the way people are ready to survive with and without having social insecurities. It portrays good and bad sides of all the characters.
PARASITE,11 October 2020,1/10,"This movie will literally make you wonder what you're even watching. A con artist family ruins another families life and the father kills a kind husband and father of two for no reason. Those of you who think this was about ""classes"" or ""crossing the line"" have 0 moral compass and couldn't tell their arse from their elbow. Do not waste your time watching this dirty con family destroy another's like psychopath or rather ....parasites...."
PARASITE,23 November 2020,1/10,"Parasite has been on my watchlist for about a year now. I went in with exceptionally high expectations, given the glowing reviews and high ratings. Having watched it earlier today, I can confidentially say, it was the most disappointing movie I have watched, so much so, I felt the need to write a review. It's a movie that simply doesn't live up to its hype whatsoever. Not only is it a poor representation of the class divide that exists in many parts of the world, portraying a lower class family in a degrading and deceitful way, but most if not every scene that was meant to be suspenseful, was just outright anti climatic, to the point where I was like ""oh... is that it"". To make things worse, the movie was 2 hours long! 2 hours that I will never get back."
PARASITE,20 November 2020,6/10,"Overall a decent movie that differs from recent successful thrillers, but the movie isn't as exciting as you would expect. Lots of time you are sitting there hoping for speed up story telling. The tension between the two families isn't really build up, so the end comes surprising."
PARASITE,21 November 2020,1/10,"I have seen many Korean movies and they are al great and winners but not this one, and this one takes the cake?Movie lovers these days are a bunch jokers or what?Film critics and fans have one thing in common: give 10 out of 10 just because they read the headlines.It's bizarre that we live in a world that biased thinking makes the movie bigger.This is not a winner the real winner from Korea is JSL or Old Boy or The Host."
PARASITE,3 December 2020,9/10,"Like I Said, Parasite Is A Term Which Is Very Sincere . The Way Our World Has Build Up Is Constantly Changing Our Way Of Living, Our Seeing & Most Importantly Our Thinking.This Movie Is Basically Based On A True Fact Of Society. The Way The Director Portrayed This Whole Story With An Amazing Cinematography Is Simply Amazing.Haven't Seen It Yet?? Do Watch First."
PARASITE,9 December 2020,10/10,It was the first corean movie that I've watched and I loved it! It starts as regular story of 2 families with opposite lifestyle and all of a sudden you feel like not blinking your eyes so you can capture all the details of this intriguing drama/thriller.
PARASITE,13 December 2020,10/10,"What a film of our time! It is the perfect film . It has everything.
I remember seeing it in a packed cinema early Jan 2020. It is a work of beauty and says so much about our world now."
PARASITE,13 December 2020,10/10,"A film for our time. It stays with you for a long time after.
It is a work of beauty and says so much about the world we live in today."
PARASITE,21 December 2020,9/10,"One of the best you'll see... I'll echo the words of the director ; once you are able to overcome the one inch barrier of subtitles, my god will u enter into a world of some epicness... In this case, a south korean masterclass..."
PARASITE,2 August 2021,10/10,"Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great."
PARASITE,24 January 2021,9/10,Class diffrence could not be explained better. The scenario is thunk in a very good way. The soundtrack of the movie is quite good and music gives you motivation.Everyone maybe did not like the end of the movie but I think end of the movie fits scenario in a good way. The reason why I loved the end of the movie was showing the audience money doesn't bring happiness. So I found meaningfull the end of movie but the reason I cut 1 point is about the Park's pureness because at least people suspect when suddenly your servants changed but Park's family isn't like that they belive whatever Kim's family says so that did not seem realisctic to me. But overall I think it's best movie of 2019.
PARASITE,1 February 2021,10/10,One of the best movies of the decade and 2019. Surely Oscar-Worthy
PARASITE,31 January 2021,1/10,The storyline is bad and nonsense. They even use a 19 years old girl to do the kissing scene. Wtf ? And nude scene on the sofa out of nowhere. This movie ruined my mood. I expected too much by lookin at high rating.
PARASITE,3 February 2021,7/10,I like the film but some scenes are kinda wird for me. But I think you should definitely see it
PARASITE,11 August 2021,10/10,"I give this movie a 10. The director need not make any more movies. They have created a masterpiece. Every single line of dialogue and action undertaken in this movie leads to its inevitable conclusion. There is not one thing out of place, much like the house in which much of the movie resides.The thing that stands out the most to me, are the dynamics of the families involved.We'll start with the rich family. They live idyllic. Everything is perfect in their world. Everything is in its place. The father works very hard for his money, he is home to be with his kids. But there's a problem. But we'll look at the poor family why.The poor family are thieves, con artists, morally reprehensible. They will deceive and cheat others within their vicinity. They will use whomever and whatever they can to get ahead and get something for themselves.But not once does any member of this family put the other one down. Never. They are completely and utterly supportive of one another. No one is blamed for things going wrong. No one is told they did not do things good enough for the family. Everyone is appreciated for what they bring to the table. They are congratulated when they succeed at a task. They are told how amazing they are at the skills they provide. There is so much love in this family for one another, it is nearly possible to look away from their actions towards anyone else. They are a lovable family. They would not turn their back on eachother in a heartbeat. They express thanks for the fortune and opportunities they have been provided, no matter how they came to them. They thought of the people they had undermined, and their fates.Go back to the rich family. The father is critical of the mother's housekeeping, cooking, general matriatchal skills. The mother is extremely impressionable and willing to cover up any discretion without a thought for the welfare of those affected. The sister criticises the younger brother for being a charlatan and fake. The brother shows open disrespect for his mother's commands and authority. He is showered with gifts rather than attention. They are willing to believe he is schizophrenic and prone to distraction than actually believe he ""saw a ghost"".This is why the poor family's father, when hearing the criticism's the rich family's father has about his wife asks him ""but you love her."" Despite all her flaws that you have mentioned. Despite all your criticisms about her abilities in the kitchen and housekeeping skills. You still love her don't you. And you see that the rich man has to pause when delivering that answer. Does he?You can see in the poor family that they are eachother's biggest fans. Not one word of criticism for eachother is ever uttered. Apart from the mother stating the father would run like a cockroach if discovered. He pretends to be angry with her. He fools the children into thinking he would ever strike her with a fist or open hand. He laughs at them for ever believing such a thing could, would or should happen. And they all laugh together in the end at what the mother replies. This family loves eachother unconditionally. They support, applaud, congratulate and openly tell eachother ""I think you're amazing.""But they are con artists and crooks. Thieves and liars to everyone else.And to get off for an evening the rich family's mother and father pretend to be ""the morally reprehensible"" for sexual kicks. Though they treat their help with respect, they find them beneath them as people. They find them dirty. And this gets them off sexually. Because that's what they really want to be, but they can't. Because they have surrounded themselves with everything that says they are supposed to be better. If they slip, if they fall, the facade will come crashing down. And it will show everyone else what they really are. No better than anyone else in the end. The same. And the poor family have a dignity and an integrity with one another that says they deserve the best of everything. But life has not worked out ""as planned.""This movie is a masterpiece."
PARASITE,23 February 2021,10/10,I won't be forgetting this movie anytime soon.... It blew my mind..
PARASITE,27 February 2021,9/10,"I've watch this movie 5th times. And still learn something new, from many perspective: Story development, theme, cinematography, acting, ect.Well-deserved for oscar."
PARASITE,27 February 2021,9/10,"I've watch this 5th times and still learn something brilliant. The Plot, The theme, cinematography, Acting, Architecture, All really Outstanding."
PARASITE,27 February 2021,10/10,Strongly recommended. Although need to follow subtitle in english as movie.
PARASITE,2 March 2021,10/10,"I won't get into the details of the movie as I do not want to spoil the fun. The contrast between the wealthy family, the Parks, and the poor one, the Kims is well set. Starting from a seemingly classic story of social class it evolves in a great family drama with a great plot twist.
I particularly enjoy the bitter sweet aspect of this story. You are at times rooting for the Kims and at other times for the Parks.
I'm glad this movie got the Oscar. It is a refreshing view on society class and its impacts; and a welcome change from the typical, 'always end well"" type of Hollywood movies."
PARASITE,22 November 2021,10/10,Everything is very good the characters the acting music story line a masterpiece the character development is very good writen i camera angel are perfect.
PARASITE,2 May 2021,,This movie was a masterpiece. I will always appreciate movies that are unique and brilliantly executed.
PARASITE,6 July 2021,10/10,As a Visual FX artist I am amazed to know that I was fooled in thinking that all the sets were practical when in reality alot was done in post-production. Amazing job on the visual side and an outstanding job for the overall story and acting.
PARASITE,31 March 2021,8/10,"I have never watched a korean movie before, but this one is on different level. But it could be more extraordinary if it has a dubbed version its really hard to watch it with subtitles. Ill recommend to wait for a dubbed version for whose going to watch it."
PARASITE,9 April 2021,10/10,Parasite is one of the best films I have seen this decade I would highly recommend it to anyone.
PARASITE,18 June 2021,10/10,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
PARASITE,20 April 2021,9/10,"The human mind's is unpredictable, they has talent but instead uses it to become a parasite. I am quite surprised by the other side of South Korea which is featured in this film, it turns out that economic inequality, is in various parts of the world."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies of all time!
Screenplay and directing are amazing. Acting is superb"
PARASITE,2 February 2020,6/10,"The film keeps the viewer in suspense until the very end. Visually stunning, with the actors' play easy to believe.
However the moral side of the message the movie is trying to deliver, if any, is less clear. The plot contrasts two families, poor and rich. We do not know the background of their social status so the viewer cannot judge them based on it.
Both families want the best for their relatives, they are kind to them, they both presumably want to work to earn for their families (the rich wife does not need to).
This is where the similarities end. The dividing line between the families is not that that one is cunning and the other is mostly naive, not that one is squeamish and the other is untidy. The difference is that the boy from the poor family is ready to kill his competitor hidden in the basement and the father of the poor family does kill his counterpart for what he perceives as a top-down view based on social inequality.
Despite such drastically different moral standing, the movie equalizes the families by leaving one member of each family dead. Of course, it does not happen in life that the evil is punished and the good is rewarded. However the movie leaves the feeling that everything is random and pointless."
PARASITE,7 May 2021,6/10,"I was dying to watch this movie with a point like this but' it just doesn't deserve this score. If Inception is 8,6 this movie had a 7,5 with a good perspective. The movie got really meaningless every minute. It ended so ridiculous, ""Oh, I have a plan. Let's make us rich."" Wow, why didn't you do that before? It can be enjoyed very hard but never gets this score."
PARASITE,16 May 2021,3/10,"This film was like Jean Genet's The Maids, but uninteresting. The filth that the lower class lived in was extreme, dirty sewage water juxtaposed with upper middle class cleanliness. I don't know why Bong Hoon said Kurosawa was an influence. His film was excessively violent. The murder scene at the birthday party was treated comically but depended on serious commentary. The characters were crass, which says a lot about the director."
PARASITE,24 May 2021,10/10,What a though provoking film. It is quiet and smart. It is the type of film that one tends to ponder about long after seeing it.
PARASITE,13 October 2021,10/10,"*Message To Those Who Didn't Watched This Movie Yet.If You're Looking A Movie For Genre Crime,Thriller,Mystery ,Comedy, Drama, Romance, Emotional, It Is More Than These .And
This Movie Will Not Disappoint You..*Note For Parents- This Movie Is Not Suitable For Those Who Are Under Age Of 15."
PARASITE,15 June 2021,10/10,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."
PARASITE,13 July 2021,9/10,This movie was really good. I loved the whole plot of it. It has a really good plot twist in the end. I really hope we get a sequel.
PARASITE,20 July 2021,10/10,"I love it. The best film from Korea. Ty koreans! Is it still short? Really love it, I'm not joking."
PARASITE,16 August 2021,10/10,This movie is so good bro honestly don't know how everybody doesn't love it.
PARASITE,26 August 2021,10/10,So many different emotions in this film. The director very well highlighted the theme of the movie and also made it spectacular to watch. Definitely worth a watch.
PARASITE,9 September 2021,10/10,"Definitely not the greatest film ever made but pretty damn close. The cinematography is consistently amazing, all the performances are incredible even the child actor who plays Park Dasong isn't that bad. Screenplay is very impressive despite the fact that the pacing of the second act feels a little bit boring. Really impressively implemented social commentary because it's really subtle. Mr Kim's motivation for killing Mr Park makes sense as you can see the distain me feels for the Parks in his earlier performance and it obviouslt comes to a head when Kijung is stabbed. The conclusion felt a little messy but was effective, but probably could have done without the ""flash-forward"" sequence. Overall incredible 10/10."
PARASITE,28 September 2021,9/10,"Don't try to define the genre of this excellent movie. It starts as social drama, veers into thriller and gets a finishing zest of horror and nudge of absurdity. No dull moment and truly entertaining."
PARASITE,23 November 2021,10/10,It show what the actual world is. Depending on culture and society the life is different but concept is same in whole world. IN real world we see these reflection everywhere. Nice movie.
PARASITE,27 February 2020,1/10,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry.
This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters.
It's a simple hype job.
The movie here is the real Parasite."
PARASITE,4 July 2020,6/10,It is a ok kind of movie. It is over hyped beyond its worth.
PARASITE,19 November 2019,9/10,"Bong Joon Wo's 'Parasite' is a disturbing yet beautifully woven tale depicting the dehumanizing gap between the haves and have-nots. Metaphorically and figuratively, Ki Tae's family live below the ground of the haves. Their toilet is even higher than their dwelling ground. This is how poor they are. They struggle to barely crawl up to the surface of economic adequacy, resorting to scams and deceptions, scrapping to make ends meet. The seeming victims are the Parks, a well to do family enveloped in the world of luxury and complacency. Much of the depictions of Ki Tae's family members would initially make the audience think of how despicable they are. While the parks are portrayed to be adequately tolerant of the underprivileged as long as their life is not in any way imposed. Slowly but surely the movie unravels. The subtext of hopelessness of classism soon reveals itself, mixed in with a very well thought out plot twists. 'Parasites' shows a world where the underprivileged are too wrapped in their own survival to recognize the trap they are in while the privileged are too busy meandering the labyrinth of western luxury. One of the best movies ever crafted for sure."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,10/10,"Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed.
Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed.
Go for it, and you'll not be disappointed."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,9/10,"Superbly acted, brilliantly written and gorgeous to look at. Not faultless and a couple of cracks/gripes in the last act but overall a beautifully constructed film.
Nice to be kept thinking long afterwards and looking forward to seeing again."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,6/10,"This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it."
PARASITE,11 April 2021,8/10,"So the 996th title for me was 'Parasite', where status envy breeds evil, with redemption found in repentance than in genuine moral conviction.Personally, I consider cinema artful when it lays by the wayside, experiences that are commonly available to us, and thereafter presents a narrative that defies such common experiences.Poor people smelling funny was one of the reasons some of my national law school acquaintances wouldn't ride the delhi metro - something that agitated me, but far from such behaviour being a 'morbid distaste for the poor' as the film's leftist reviewers would point out - it's merely an outcome of their socio-economic realities where their lifestyles are cocooned. It's nothing that is maliciously intentioned.That's why, Parasite failed to enthuse me as much as it seemed to have enlivened reviewers to become a concert of uniform appreciation. I take that to be more a sign of the Marxist class consciousness becoming mainstream in our times than a sincere and objective appreciation of the cinematic mode.It should be said that the rising popularity of such class consciousness could have made it possible for both - such a theme to be adapted for the screen, and for the reviewers to overlook the lack of artfulness.Far from 'shocking' and 'emotionally riveting' ending that induces gasps as per The Guardian's film reviewers, the film lazily climaxes through a chaotic ending and tries to paper over the dangerous rationalization of poor people engaging in lies, deceit, and violence against the rich. Criminal and unethical behaviour is not warranted against anyone - irrespective of any markers of personal identity.Half-way through the reel, the film did issue a poser: another one of the common experiences I spoke of earlier - whether 'niceness' is a result of being 'financially well-off'?As answers to that poser, the poor husband and his wife held opposing views in a binary. However, the film does not even try to portray any tension in any of the characters with respect to that binary. The characters were straightjacketed into fixed outlooks on life - with the poor father redeeming his crookedness only after being at the receiving end of pain. Without further deliberation or exposition of that poser, one would tend to think that it was inserted more for effect than as part of a well thought out thematic tapestry.In fact, I find it shocking that review after review imagines the film to be an exegesis of the growing inequality, class divide, and immobility of social classes. It shouldn't happen - that bad or criminal behaviour is passed off as justifiable under any circumstances, not so, especially in a democracy, where political equality is unshakeable and which guarantees a form of equality that is more powerful and capable of overcoming barriers to class immobility through modern welfare states and well functioning institutions."
PARASITE,6 October 2020,2/10,"I hated the film did not get the plot. I have seen many foreign films, from the amazing Amour in French to the great Spirited AwayI hated the plot. Like the Kim family lied and cheated. Once I can sort of understand as a favour for tutor. But they poisoned the paid . They faked crimes to get what they wanted. Like who does this?I thought the movie would be about how the rich take advantage of the poor. And the rich family would be bad. I say this as a person who went to a private school. And yes i know rich people are bad. But for the sake of the movie it would work.But they ended up destroying and killing the poor. Like what?Also the rich family Park family were very nice people , very naive and not street smart. But nice. Insane thing to do to a human been"
PARASITE,2 January 2021,8/10,"Objectively good by most measures, but nothing particularly remarkable about it"
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,2/10,"I didn't enjoy a single minute of this movie. OK, the plot was interesting, the actors were good, but when ALL of the characters are unpleasant and most of them are a bunch of lazy, nasty parasites I can't have any positive feelings.
And it is not about being poor. The characters in Slumdog millionaire were in worse situation, but there was so much more humanity there...
Here, I saw an example of a mental cesspool.1917 was my choice."
PARASITE,6 April 2020,1/10,"This movie is overrated. The only reason why it won an Oscar is because the Academy wanted to demonstrate to the world how ""progressive"" they are by (1) supporting a movie about class division and (2) desegregating the award categories so a foreign film could win best picture."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,9/10,"Besides excellent plot, directing,.. This movie also has incredible hidden excellent cinematography!"
PARASITE,16 March 2020,6/10,"I do not understand the insane hype surrounding this movie. It was good. Just good. I'm a big Bong Joon Ho fan. And I get what he was going for here. Social commentary/satire with finesse. But he missed the mark with this one. This was no masterpiece, as almost everyone is calling it. Joon Ho did make a masterpiece. It just wasn't ""Parasite"". It was ""Okja"". Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse.
As far as ""Parasite"", like I said, it was just good. What keeps it from being great, in my opinion, is the fact that there were no likable characters. I didn't care at all about any of them. Big miss. There were many glaring plot holes, but I could have overlooked those if he had given me just one character to root for.It's like eating at a high end restaurant where nothing on the menu looks appealing to you. Disappointment. All of these 10 star reviews are just hive-mind on display."
PARASITE,30 May 2019,10/10,"As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."
PARASITE,22 December 2019,3/10,"A huge disappointment. Had the film ended after the first hour, it would deserve 8*. Like this, it is a tasteless hodgepodge."
PARASITE,4 January 2021,7/10,It deserved the Oscars because of its amazing creativity. Great film and very authentic casting and acting throughout. With subtitles it was very easy to follow.at few places few sound issues were there. makeup and art direction could have been better. camera and locations worked for the film. all actors were super good. very well done.
PARASITE,1 February 2020,9/10,"Epic tale of class distinctions in modern-day South Korea. Ironic, clever, and touching."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,In todays world a vision and film like Parasite was really an achivement by its film makers. Film was very well placed and was connected and holding interests throughout to watch. The expressions of the characters were really very funny and interesting at the same time. Overall an amazing work and well deserved Oscar.
PARASITE,9 December 2019,10/10,"One of the greatest films I have ever seen
The movie directing and the inferences that the director used to direct the film were very genius
The acting performance is great
Worth winning an Oscar for Best Foreign Film"
PARASITE,20 May 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies I have seen so far. It is intuitive, funny and keep you watching with fascination. The best is that you can't predict the course of the movie and it continues to surprise throughout. I can highly recommend anyone to watch this movie."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,1/10,"The worst film i see in my life. Its boring, horrible, 2 hours of my life lost. I dont know the 8,6 score in imdb."
PARASITE,23 October 2019,10/10,"This movie is not a horror movie not a suspense movie but I was just on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece  with your morals as well as your feelings for justice."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,3/10,"I think the hype that they created for this movie was what caused me to build my expectations when I started watching the movie and I was kind of waiting for something to happen that would blow my mind, as the story progresses. But that moment never came... It just seemed to be just an ordinary movie and does not deserve the hype. The movie is completely overrated... watch it for yourself and tell me I am wrong. There was another reviewer who gave a low rating that said ""did we watch the same movie?"". That's exactly the feeling I got after watching the movie.Rating wise it's probably not a 3 but a 5 or 6 at best but I am so disappointed after watching the movie that I couldn't resist scoring it low."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite better than Joker. And it won the Oscar. Joker is only just good, Parasite is perfect. Deal with it."
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,"Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"Main dichotomies:
Upstairs vs. downstairsComedy vs. tragedyHope/planning vs. survivingBelieve in work/effort vs. believing in luck or fate (the stone)Comments:
Ultimately a conservative movie about how bad characters take bad decisionsKey scene where the parasite family is finally all hired and are together in the rich families house alone - and what do they use the time for? They drink eat and mess everything up instead of acting as civilized human beings. They are basically portraited as parasites invading better people's homes and lives.The upstairs upper class can be claimed of living in a bubble or being naïve - but that is the worst you can say about them.Many has also claimed they movie portraits how climate changes affects the poor harder, e.g. in the rain scene where the rich look at the weather as an esthetic phenomena and the poor suffer with drought. But this is portrayed comically as in the toilet scene - where it explodes and the daughters is taking a smoke. Furthermore, the window places a central role as they deliberately leave it open (both for the poison in the beginning and the rain)Also, the son (Choi) is promising to take care of the daughter for his friend hos I going to study abroad, and the first thing he does it to seduce her in order to enable his family to invade and push out all the other workers of the upper class familyHowever, overall a good well-made and unpredictable movie where the characters are not labelled as good or bad but in between a continuum of acting within their means and dreams"
PARASITE,17 April 2021,10/10,"Up until the end , the movie's is filled whith surprises and you definitely will not guess whats going to happen
Amazing acting and script , well done."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,9/10,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite takes on the age-old theme of wealth and poverty and human fate and what a take it is. Artistically powerful and captivating, it throws the viewer into the middle of a very modern and ugly problem: stark wealth inequality and how an individual's life is worth only the size of his wallet. Yet, the film shows how fragile these lives are, whether through the invocation of missiles from neighbouring nuclear power (cornered by imperialism like the husband in the basement - a Frankenstein inadvertently or maybe inevitably created by Mr Park), or other hazards from which even the wealthy have no protection.The film offers a damning critique of capitalism, which benefits the upper classes of the world, and is ultimately tied up with the global hierarchy of power and wealth - a global system that benefits the rich and powerful. The same way as the damned basement-dweller worships the rich Mr Park for what he believes is ""feeding him"", the working class of the world has been led to believe that it is the Jeff Bezos, Jack Mas, and others who are the wealth creators, who feed the talentless 98%. The film is also a direct critique of the colonised mind, which aims at the Korean (and other) society's worship of the capitalist and colonialist West. The obsession with the English language, their replication of the normalisation of the genocide of Native Americans - ""Indians,"" references to studying abroad and the relentless pursuit of mastering the English language as essential social capital is not unique to South Korea or culturally closer Asian countries, notably China. It is virtually every other country that is in Muhammad Iqbal's words ""have been hypnotized by the West,"" yet fail to see, like the members of the Kim family did before taking a closer look, that beyond the façade of extravagance and cash, Mr Park is an impotent man and his wife is a naive woman with no distinction from the rest of the society. There must be something rotten in the system then.The film has sacrifices: the younger daughter dies amidst the drama in the backyard of the bourgeoisie, the poor goes back to the basement. His son gets his Morse-coded message but rescuing him from that place remains a dream. This is a depressing and hopeless take of Parasite on our modern world.The film sells as a black comedy, but I didn't even smile - not once. This is perhaps I was absorbed by the poignant subtext. Secondly, I don't see a solution is offered. But I welcome the open-endedness: we can choose whether it the Parks family who is the parasite, or the global capitalism of the 2%. But, it is the hopeless aspiration of the son, that is to become rich enough to buy the house is built upon the his father's prison, that is the most depressing part? If this is the solution, we are at a deadlock."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"I'm utterly shocked with this whole situation of this oscar winning movie and it's reviews here. This movie is a total joke... Bad acting, hopelessly predictable and the humour of 10 year old kids. What is this craze? Is it a throw at political correctness? And people with no taste in movies uttering prechewed reviews that are totally untrue? Total Kafka."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,7/10,"First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar! I think it's a good example of todays influence by the media considering this huge hype and overinterpretation. At least the Movie is polarizing but it's far from a masterpiece - it's ok!"
PARASITE,18 March 2020,10/10,"Partly because i had to read the movie. No but seriously, wow, one of those movies that you just never want to end. So many things about this movie that is pleasing. From beginning to end, the movie is absolutely jam packed with stimulation. Deception, violence, unpredictability, bits of arousal, cultural reference, so much comedy, and an ending that definitely does not disappoint. From 1/8th in until the end, you'll just constantly be saying OMG. This movie was definitely deserving of best picture, perhaps even one of the best of the decade. I saw this about a week after I saw Joker, which was also amazing, and similarly disturbing. However, Parasite is just a masterpiece."
PARASITE,8 August 2020,8/10,"But whomever shouted the nip flick shoplifters, thank you, both shows a kind of reality that is true, in western perspective we often have this illusion than korea an japan are perfect societes, but reality is, everyone hussle and struggle at some point"
PARASITE,11 January 2020,1/10,"This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this."
PARASITE,13 July 2019,6/10,"I think that this movie isn't best movie in bong junho director.
But you can watch this movie for understanding his movies."
PARASITE,17 April 2021,10/10,This is the first time I really felt like writing a review because I LOOOOVE this movie it's truly a masterpiece! The amount of attention to detail is absolutely insane!
PARASITE,21 April 2020,5/10,I don't know how the Oscar jury works. This is just a normal movie that explains the rich and poor. That's all. I expected this to much better than snowpiercer. But it doesn't.
PARASITE,10 April 2021,10/10,One of the finest movie I have seen after a long time. The movie gels with the current world scenario. What a story.
PARASITE,15 December 2019,9/10,"Everything about the movie is great and fun to watch. Plot,acting and whole stuff are unexpectedly good. Gives you chills and laughs at the same time, reminds me of 'Get Out' . 10/10 would recommend."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality."
PARASITE,9 September 2019,7/10,"I watched ""Parasite"" a Korean film last night. I have been hearing how great this movie is and how IMDB rating is 8.5 IGN 9.5 Rotten Tomatoes giving it 100%. Well, am I missing something? I do think it's a good film but almost a perfect 10 I don't feel that. The actions of the main family seems so realist. The story, the way it's written, and just the performance of the actors is good. You can imagine that something like this can maybe happen to people that is just gullible. But I felt like everything was very predictable. But some questions were unanswered Like, Why was the original house keeper (Moon-gwang) face messed up? Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off? I do like the Director (Joon-ho Bong) and other films he had made but I just feel like this movie is more a 6.5 / 7 for me."
PARASITE,30 May 2021,10/10,"This movie exceeded my expectations, acting, direction and all other fields class of its own, benchmark set by these cast and crew to inspire global audience."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,2/10,I usually don't put in negative reviews but omg this was sooooo bad. 😑😑 bored out of my mind
PARASITE,17 November 2019,4/10,"This film is not the great film that some say. Given we are so lost in class conflict reviewers act as if this says something about class and privilege. It doesn't beyond a few obvious scenes of class resentment. It also shows the bad influence of Tarantino by ending the film with idiotic and meaningless violence. It is clear that Hollywood like the rest of America is brutal in the way it cuts out any real mention of class so a film that highlights some obvious aspects of class conflict is seen as something special. This film is not special and Snowpiercer was far better. The rich are too clueless in this film (the rich are never this clueless, they are savage in the protection of their wealth--just look at the state of the world). And things happen without reason. Why would the maid let the maid in at night who was fired? Why wouldn't the rich check references on the people they let in their house? Why would the rich home owner accuse the driver without any real evidence? Still there are some great scenes, some memorable lines."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,2/10,"2/10 for this, this movie was extremely slow not engaging and tediously boring, if you want to catchup on some sleep this will work? This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movieI saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves."
PARASITE,25 May 2020,8/10,"I wasn't quite sure where this movie was going at first but like with all good movies, this one puts this caper into place with precision. The only criticism I would give is that it plays out quite slowly. In fact, there are some areas that I felt could have been cut from the movie to save a little time but not detract from how the story is told.I won't go into too much detail about the movie as I don't want to spoil anything. All I will say is that this movie is really enjoyable, has good humour and sorrow but overall, it plays out brilliantly and it is certainly understandable why it won an oscar for best picture and best screenplay, to name a couple."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,10/10,This movie is 100% AWESOME! I now understand all the hype...All the awards this movie has won is well deserved!!! Awesome...awesome...awesome film!!! Watch it you will not be sorry!!!
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"You may not like everything you see, but you will be moved. I can't add much to the many excellent reviews here except to say that this is a film for true film lovers, not movie-goers. It's a film that makes you laugh, cry and most of all, think. Do not try to interpret the plot literally. The story is metaphoric. Zen, not Hollywood."
PARASITE,29 June 2020,6/10,"Probably the movie collapsed under the expectations I had because of all the hype (and specially awards).
First the good bits, the rare mix of various genres into one movie is something that might keep you on the edge of your seat or overburden your cognitive ability.
All the actors have delivered a good performance and cinematography is good too.
Some scenes depicting abject urban poverty are really riveting. But if the writer or director wanted to deliver a message about poverty, they have further muddied the waters by expressing this as poverty. A few healthy adults, who had no unforeseen shocks to their ability to work hard and earn a decent living, go on to do things which range from boundaryline unethical to pure heinous crimes.
A long drawn second half makes it boring.
One of the reviews I watched about this film says ""A good movie is the one where you can't tell who is the villain"". Well you will be able to tell all the villains by the time the movie ends, and you guessed it right, its definitely not ""poverty"".This movie definitely did not deserve the Oscars over 1917 and Joker. period."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,9/10,"The film Parasite follows the story of a South Korean family living day to day in desperate measures to find steady work but by sheer luck and manipulative tactics they are able to find work with a family who are living their dream life of riches. This Tragicomedy captivates you till the very end and that's a rarity in today's era without the blinding use of CGI and fast paced super hero movies. I thought maybe the Oscars were hyping this movie up but it truly deserved all the awards it got and shows true craftsmanship in its screenplay, cinematography, character development, acting, and so much more."
PARASITE,18 December 2019,10/10,"When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art. The plot refelects human nature and what limits we are ready to cross in order to make ourselves secure and ignore our inhibitions no matter the cost. 2019 couldn't end any better...."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best film in foreign language !!!
Actually it's not a film,
It's our real life story...
I have nothing more to say about this great creation....."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"I watched Parasite yesterday before the Oscars, and was truly disappointed. The ending just turned what could've been a great movie into a good one.
So I was shocked for the all the love that it received from the Academy! I truly believe there were so many better international films that deserved best script/director/picture awards such as Separation by Asghar Farahadi !!"
PARASITE,15 October 2019,4/10,"Simply for me its the worst movie of Bong Joon ho. Plot has a multiple and serious goofs and all the screenplay seems to be a pretension for the director/writer to express all of his ideas about injustice and cruelty of modern Korea and of course the world. In order to do that in good cinematic manner, a writer should first write a good screenplay that the plot twists come from the characters and believable situations and then the director visualizes it in his point of view to accomplish his ideas, something we saw in great Ken Loach movie, ""I, Daniel Blake"".I exampled this movie because it has same theme about injustice. Of course Bong Joon ho is a great writer/director and i love ""Memories of Murder"",""Mother"" and ""Snowpiercer"", but after seeing this movie i was disappointed,as simple as that!"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,4/10,"Quite original,but thats all... the Academy made a weird choice this year..a bit disappointed."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,8/10,"This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once. Makes you question about right and wrong in a unique way.
But it has also a darker side that makes you feel overwhelmed apart from the story itself. It may be the coloring of the movie."
PARASITE,23 April 2020,10/10,"I am one of those people who watched this movie only after it won the Oscar. And one thing about giving in to any kind of hype is that it mostly doesn't live up to it. But boy, Parasite blew me away and how.The point the maker is trying to make will definitely hit anyone who watches it. Humor is used beautifully. The climax is mindblowing. This movie comes closest to being absolutely perfect."
PARASITE,14 December 2020,3/10,This movie won best picture and this proves best picture winners are often times terrible like this movie. Its not funny and is extremely slow and pointless. The last 40 mins is completely different than the first part of the movie. This movie may have been a 5 if it was not for subtitles.
PARASITE,23 February 2020,9/10,"Just when you think you understand exactly what's going on, TWIST, and everything changes. Can't wait to see it again. Fabulous performances."
PARASITE,5 December 2019,8/10,"I'm not usually a fan of Korean movies, but this one got me very interested from the very beginning, it's not the first time a movie makes us root for someone even though they're not necessarily doing the right thing, but it makes us question once again, what is the right thing? I really loved the representation of society in this one, it shows a whole different side.. even though the family was very poor they still had energy and were clever enough to actually go out and try and change it.
The movie was dramatic, funny, scary in all the right ways."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.10/10 First a trickle, then a flood"
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"I normally do not watch subtitle movies yet the reviews, awards, and comments from friends had me curious. I am thrilled I saw it. Not sure what to make of it. Acting and photography was grand. I know I will watch it again. I missed parts of the subtitles because they went by too fast. I got the gist so I allowed it to play through. Rented it through Apple TV, watched it in the comfort of our home 😎"
PARASITE,14 May 2020,4/10,"Too bad the story couldn't keep up, a bunch of randos with no higher education suddenly become a family of professional grifters and fool this rich family. Ok, over night perfect Family of criminals...on that topic the poor family was awful, not a redeeming action among that wasn't ultimately self serving. The rich family were just victims, the existed merely to move the story along. What happen to the poor boy!!?? Idgaf about the poor family at this point, they deserve any bad fortune they are subjected to. The Parks seemed like caring parents to they're maladjusted children, they're just regular messed up kids. The other family is just irredeemable, the son made out with the under age daughter ...wtf! The ending was the absolute worst, a letter to no one...and he's just going to live in someone else's house? I've not even touched on the people in the basement first ...WTF!In the end, disappointment, I'm so glad I didn't pay money for this."
PARASITE,21 January 2020,7/10,"I liked it, just don't understand why it got so hyped . I don't find anything too special about the movie ; yeah there are a couple twists but nothing new."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,3/10,"Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror.
Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting.
What a film."
PARASITE,6 July 2020,1/10,"One of the worst movies I ever watched , and first time seeing high rated movie and idiots with a scam reviews recommending it ,just a waste of 2 hours"
PARASITE,30 July 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon Ho Is No Stranger To Masterfull Storytelling And Directing And Eversince He Made "" Memories of Murder "" (Which Is An Amazing Film) He Has Been Uping His Own Game. The Directing In This Film Is One Word Superb. And The Story Of Poor And Rich Are Told Masterfully , This Film Is So Touching That After The Credits Roll You Have A Smile On Your Face Despite The Darkness And Sorrow The Mivie Conveys. That Is A Well Told Story , That Is Perfect Film Making."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,9/10,"The best movie of the year won the Academy Award for Best Picture and all of us.
Masterful direction from Bong,perfect ensemble cast but two hours..."
PARASITE,10 January 2021,6/10,"Comparing the nominees, this movie is surely not an Oscar wining movie. Ahhhh but Hollywood has something else in their mind.
Anyways, a good watch though, unique story about the class difference."
PARASITE,28 November 2020,10/10,"Loved so much about this film from the story to the cinematography, the performances the direction.
A refreshing change from superhero films and over the top CGI studio films.
It's funny it's sad it's intense. So switch off the phone, turn on the film and enjoy. You won't regret it."
PARASITE,12 October 2019,10/10,I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,Amazing job all around from all that were involved in making this masterpiece. It starts slow but trust me stay along for the ride because at the end you will just say WOW !!!
PARASITE,7 January 2020,9/10,"Two poor families, one not lucky in money gathering,other one unlucky in social experience. That's what parasites do, they find most vulnerable people, who has no immune developed against them, who never met them before and use their healthy trust. I thought Birdman will be a far leader on the best movie of decade, but this Korean dreamteam jumped to the bus and almost made driver to give up his seat. Lines with preexisting diseases changed after new parasites arrived killed it at the end.
Will be waiting for next one with wet lips."
PARASITE,16 March 2021,2/10,One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen. The hype was for nothing and everything was predictable.
PARASITE,2 May 2020,2/10,"It's a sheer time waste. Till end you got bored, bored. I can't give 2 ranking too
But i spent whole 2.11 hours that's why this is."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,10/10,"It's a great story about social differences which will leave you amazed by its photographic qualities, the performances by the actors, and the plot!I adore the way this movie is able to tell the story without being so stereotypically in-your-face about who is the bad guy and who is the good one.If you like Lars von Trier and Stanley Kubrick, I think you will love this movie."
PARASITE,8 June 2020,4/10,"Watched with high expectations, based largely on almost exclusively gushing reviews. It was... ok. To me, nothing special. Perhaps it contains a kernel of greatness which I'm unequipped to get at. In which case it can go and rammit. I'm definitely hearing 'green needle' where the majority (at least of those who have voiced their opinion) are getting 'brainstorm'. While I'm here I'll recommend a Korean film that WAS deserving of its acclaim, Oldboy. See it, or see it again (it rewards repeat viewings). Oldboy is film you can easily fall in love with and sets a benchmark for fantastic cinema - Parasite doesn't come remotely close."
PARASITE,14 April 2020,10/10,I am not someone who gives high high ratings. Seeing this film I now understand the awards it has one. This story transcends all cultures in all countries. The haves and the have nots. It exemplifies that it does not matter in the full realm how life ends up. The acting was superb and watching it in the original language made it so more realistic.
PARASITE,27 October 2019,10/10,"A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish."
PARASITE,7 March 2020,1/10,Not a realistic point of view to class differences at all. Seriously? A man lives in the underground of a house for years and no one notices!! like cheap and childish horror movies. Showing rich being nice and poors having deceptive and disgusting maners which is showing lack of respect to this class.
PARASITE,1 May 2020,10/10,"After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres, making it a masterpiece. Being a non-English film winning an Oscar sure explains it. This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes, especially portraying the rage of the lower class.Other than those, the cinematography, lighting, foreshadowing of events, the plot were outstanding. This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad.. Won't give out any spoilers, this is a must watch film for anyone! This will probably go down in history as one of the best movies of all time."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone. This genre-defying film picks up the social differences between rich and poor and mix it up with some of the best twists in the entire history of cinema."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,2/10,"After the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking ""was this scene necessary, What's the point?"" right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me."
PARASITE,11 August 2019,8/10,"It's so good for a movie to make me feel like unseeing the movie✌ or maybe if I were a part in the movie plot I wish to change some decisions and actions , I mean to say I am so into this movie, that I can't sleep without thinking for few days.. Korean movies are making me obsessed with fantasy.."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"Just the rest of the world, and the academy, catching up with what my husband and I have known for years: Korean writers are absolute masters at plot twists and characterization! If you don't agree, watch a few more Korean movies to get adjusted to the cultural differences, and you'll see."
PARASITE,18 November 2019,10/10,"From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie. This truly original story was a once in a lifetime journey that had me laughing, crying and frighten all in one sitting. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself!"
PARASITE,25 May 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies of 2019! A powerful, incredible and emotional picture."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,1/10,"I didn't understand the film. Maybe because of the Korean style of life! But for sure for me it was just a waste of time!
At the beginning it seems to be a comedy, a stupid comedy, but slightly pleasant. All the characters seem to be stupid, liars, but also gullible children.
But then, this stupid comedy turns on into a very bad horror movie.
And at the end, ... a very stupid .... Happy end!I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively.... but steel I think I'm wright and the others are wrong or are manipulated by politics!.I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is a very bad and stupid film!"
PARASITE,14 February 2020,4/10,"Just didn't cut if for me, too dark of a story about a family of creepy grifters."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,7/10,I loved the characters so much.Everyone was so clever and different.
PARASITE,6 April 2021,5/10,Not bad but in no way Oscar winning stuff. The smell of the poor is a visceral punctum though.
PARASITE,12 April 2020,10/10,"I was wondering about whether or not to watch this movie. Not a fan of Asian movies ... but I started watching it and within 2 minutes I was completely fascinated with it !! the purest Tarantino & Almodovar style... cast, script, dialogues, etc... you don't know if laugh or cry !!"
PARASITE,19 November 2020,9/10,"It was a interesting movie for sure. I would happily watch it again.
I wish i knew korean however subtitles isnt so bad.
The only reason i saw this movie was because it has won lots of awards and every reporter keeps giving it best score, i agree."
PARASITE,28 October 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,2/10,This film has interesting scenes & cinematic direction but the suspense fell flat for me. Going into this film I thought it would be amazing because of all the reviews but I couldn't cling to the concepts. This movie is in no way a masterpiece.
PARASITE,18 February 2020,7/10,"Dramatic, okay. I don't understand the motive behind the movie & the plot . The scene was alright. Okay movie just the same 👍"
PARASITE,22 January 2020,10/10,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all."
PARASITE,28 March 2020,1/10,Such a pathetic movie. this is nothing but politics of Oscar.Some hypocrites and pseudo intellectuals promote this movie. please dont waste your valuable time by watching this idiotic movie.
PARASITE,7 March 2020,7/10,Literally the movie was good until the last 30 minutes were literally nothing main sense !!
PARASITE,15 September 2020,10/10,"I got way much more then I actually expected.
I was confused, impressed, entertained at the same time.
I loved the way movie described the huge distance between rich and poor,as they were 2 different species. It is really rare you come across to a movie which is way more unrealistic and yet again able to describe the reality as it is."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,10/10,"Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10.
If you have watched some good old Korean movies such as bediveled, old boy, yellow sea and memories of murder you know this movie stands on equal footing with those movie
I've watched joker
Fordvs Ferrari
Jojo rabbit
1917
Marriage storyParasite beats all these movies by a huge difference."
PARASITE,24 November 2019,10/10,"This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks
very subtly written, amazing comedia
I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars
And it deserves more than this
Best Korean movie ever made!
----------I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,8/10,"Not your run of the mill movie this, twists and turns but its almost always watchable. Recommended."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,1/10,Stupid story and unlogic. boring..
PARASITE,17 February 2020,8/10,"This kind of story about poverty and inequality isn't uncommon throughout the rest of the world. They nearly always have a tragic ending because, and let's be real here, this is the only kind of ending most of the people in the world can accept as real. Things don't work out. That brief peek at happiness we see at the end? That's what the few fortunates might expect; it's how our stories typically end, and so it was a brutal but honest last point in case there was any doubt."
PARASITE,19 November 2021,10/10,"A morality tale that is uncompromising through to the end. Brilliant plotting, superb performances and direction, and art direction that surrounds you in the shiny opulence of the rich and the downtrodden squalor of the underclass."
PARASITE,28 October 2019,9/10,"Everything is almost perfect from start to finish. It goes from comedy to drama to thriller so seamlessly that you never recognize the transition taking place. The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because I never give anything a ""perfect"" rating. But this is pretty damn close.If this doesn't get nominated AND win Best Foreign Film at the 2020 Oscars then it will be a robbery."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,10/10,"I don't review movies on IMDB but when I do they are mostly for the exceptional ones in my opinion. That said, there is a notion that Oscar winning movies are overhyped and though I feel there's some truth to that....this movie is an outlier! This movie deserved the ""Best Picture"" award.On a side note, name a genre and this movie covers it comedy, thriller, drama, dark comedy, empathy. Hats off to the actors, producers and the director!"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,Racists can stay pressed. Best movie of all time and deserved even more Oscars.
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,Orange beast and his supporters can stay fuming! Best Picture lol.
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,A truly well deserved oscar winner🏆🎉🏆. This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen. The movie keeps you engaged and thrilled till the end. The director has extraordinary capabilities to have presented an ordinary plot into an overwhelming rollercoaster ride. A must watch for all the thriller folks out there.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,1/10,"What new in content...
Waste of 2hrs by watching this movie
Simply overhyped the movie"
PARASITE,13 February 2021,7/10,"Definitely a nice movie to watch. Extreme and unreal situations with scenes that will keep you on your toes. Funny at times and dramatic at others. Acting was very good and the characters were played very well. I don't thing its a movie that you would watch again though, thus 7."
PARASITE,27 January 2020,7/10,Great story and wonderful genre mix-up...well described thin line between rich and poor society in a constant threat above their heads.
PARASITE,8 January 2020,9/10,"For me, Oldboy is still the best South-Korean movie, but this movie shows us that not only movies from the 'west' are worth to watch. Wow what a movie is this one. A good storyline, great acting, a scene which tarantino would be proud of and a clear and good message! Well done!"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,"The art of the uncomfortable..
When words and images are not enough to articulate the feel..
'Parasite' is one such powerful, subtle, sublime, sinister (brother.basement.scholar rock) social satire on the class conflict, social inequality, underbelly of capitalism, superficial niceties and the hidden apathy & empathy that this world holds or may be it was always like this..
One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'?
One has to reflect to understand the comedy of ever sinful poverty, appropriation of cultures, shotput, medal, the disgusting flooding, the housekeeper, respect, forgery artist and the simpleton brother laughing..
A little more realization and there you find the ghost, the lights switching on and off, obliviously acting master, the smell of poverty and anchor of the story 'The Morse code' with its knowledge to interchangeable parasite(s) and the host(s)..
Between so much more was said in the unsaid and that is the beauty of this cleverly written, acted, directed Korean tragic, haunting, conflicting, comedy classic..
A must watch👍👍👍"
PARASITE,1 March 2020,4/10,I am absolutely baffled as to the reason why this film has received such praise. Best movie of the decade? Best Picture of the year? Uhmmm no way no how. The movie was perfectly fine. I'd go so far as to say it was an average movie... perfectly fine. Certainly not a film I would watch ever again though. 1917 was amazing in my opinion and should've easily walked away with Best Picture.
PARASITE,29 February 2020,6/10,"I think this is the second time I review a movie. I just had to comment on this, what is happening here? Did everyone really liked this movie??? I have a lot of feelings towards this movie but it's not adoration. This movie is very disturbing and not easy to watch at times but it does drag you inside. I was disappointed from the turn of events. At the beginning you are let to think this is a light and humorous comedy but then it gets darker and violent and you realize that maybe it's best to just stop watching but I didn't listen to my gut feeling. I wish I just stopped at the middle. I don't like these kind of misleading movies. Starts with Interesting, funny, surprising, then turns to Creepy, violent, tragic, sad and intense.?This is my description. Ughhhhh !"
PARASITE,28 September 2019,8/10,"This a real gem. It made me laugh, think, shiver. I love satires and this is one of the best I've seen."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,7/10,"I think there are far better movies that have been underrated I believe this is not better than ""meet the parents """
PARASITE,28 March 2020,9/10,"Even though it took a while for me to catch up with the scenes and the translated English subtitles, (as I do not understand the regional language), the movie kept me glued to the screen the entire time.The movie is sure to give to chills in the spine by the end, as all the super richie-rich, goody-goody, cute-cute, sophisticated scenes suddenly goes down the drain (literally, with the floods).Loopholes:
The movie would had been even more realistic if - they had shown how a person feels the pinch of sunlight when they come out of the basement and sees the sun after a long time. Rubbing through eyes and showing the transition while entering the kitchen would have made the scene look more real.Living in the basement would make the skin dull and pale. But the characters looked as healthy as ever, even after staying there for over 4 years.Instead of all clean shaven and hair styled up, showing haphazard hair growth and beards would have made the characters look more genuine.The scenes never showed any traces of blood footprints after all the murdering, especially, when Kang-ho song escapes.Plus points:
Overall, it was definitely worth a watch as it showcases the socioeconomic gap and difference.As I firmly believe that there are only two religions - the rich and the poor. The movie proved that a rich person's life goes on while the poor keeps struggling for the rest of their life."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,,"The film's momentum transcends words however all I can say is ""Bong Joon-ho created a a masterpiece. Unspoken subtle truths overlayed by am immersive cinematic experience you will not forget. Definitely a must see if you tired of the same old movies."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,6/10,"This is a well-made film but is far from achieving masterpiece status, and those who are capriciously throwing that word around must be cinematically starved. To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film's screenplay is definitely intriguing, character development is sorely lacking, along with any kind of memorable performances. Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another ""Green Book"" cop out. I'm also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity, a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests. Good film? Yes!! Masterpiece and Best Picture of The Year? Absolutely Not!! And we might as well just do away with the foreign film category now that this boundary no longer seems to mean anything."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,10/10,"Such a brilliant film, I've been thinking about it all day and I saw it last night, I tried to think of any faults with this film, there are none! Funny, and suspenseful and edge of your seat! One of the best films I've ever seen!"
PARASITE,1 September 2019,10/10,"High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain"
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,"Thrilling and epic film, you wouldn't avoid feel overwhelmed of sensations watching this movie. I'm very surprised"
PARASITE,28 March 2020,1/10,Story is not digestive..no way around the truth of life..how one family can easily destroy another Happy family..
PARASITE,9 June 2020,9/10,I am a an impatient person but I watched all of it.
PARASITE,17 February 2020,6/10,"As for the rich , basic thing dey do is instal CCTVs in their households , found it overrated as it has too many cinematic liberties taken. Tuition teacher or houskeeping of an internation category cant be done overnight even without a proper interview frm the rich. With all respekt for its oscars , Parasite is a good one time watch & not on par with The old boy"
PARASITE,18 November 2019,8/10,"This should be a nomination for a foreign language Oscar. This is enjoyable and fun but not deserving a 9 or 10. The Asian move ""Farewell "" is a superior movie. This is mostly unbelievable and has a questionable ending sequence but still enjoyable. It is worth seeing and deserves a strong 8 and Oscar consideration."
PARASITE,10 May 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho's masterful film Parasite is a wicked and brutal satire about wealth disparity. The film's setup has a poor family, the Kims, infiltrating the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, by becoming their new employees. Kim Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) is legitimately a tutor for the Parks' daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso), but he uses his standing to then usher in his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park), who poses as an art tutor for the Parks' young son, Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung). The Kim kids then frame the Parks' driver for being a creep, which allows them to bring in their own father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Sang), for the job. Finally, the family gets rid of the Parks' housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee), by making her seem sickly due to a peach allergy, which paves the way for the Kims' mother, Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang), to get the gig. The Parks don't learn that the Kims are related, and everything seems to be going fine until they learn that Moon-gwang has been hiding her husband, Geun-se (Myeong-hoon Park), in the Parks' basement.What makes the twist in ""Parasite"" so great is that it's as predictable as it is impossible to see coming. The basement in question is featured only twice in the film for less than a minute before its actual role is revealed. But it's a twist that doesn't feel out of question, as we've seen it happen already, just through the eyes of another family.What makes ""Parasite"" so perfect is that it understands the rules and power of storytelling. Everything on screen has a specific purpose and a meaning that transforms the story as it unpacks. And it's ironic that, as brilliant as Bong's plan for the story is, the genius of ""Parasite"" lies in the 10-minute sequence where an entire plan is demolished on sight."
PARASITE,3 May 2020,10/10,"This movie is just different from other movies that I have watched & it's reality based too.
Its just awesome how they unfold the mysteries and I'll surely say that you'll not get bored watching this movie.It has a mixture of different feelings and the musics that were choosen is just perfectly matched.Besides the actors also done great job in acting.To be honest,the ending was kinda unexpected and surprising to me but in conclusion i have to say that it has done a perfect ending though.
Overall its a great movie too watch for everyone because it I'll give you thrill,romance,crime, mystery, comedy and even horror vibes too."
PARASITE,12 December 2019,9/10,"Perfect in everything it does, except in focusing on what divides humans rather than what unites us"
PARASITE,23 February 2021,8/10,"I am writing this almost straight after watching, I feel I probably need more time to process the whirlwind of a film i just watched but it was truly great.The build up of the plot, tension and the characters is great. You find yourself guessing where this is going at various times. There were some minor breadcrumbs along the way, intentional or not your guess is as good as mine.The fact that we were guessing where this was heading was a great thrill alone but the action and climax was great when it finally arrived. The soy sauce on the pizza was a sign of bloodshed in my opinion but even at this point I was unsure on what form it would be delivered to us, and from whom. It was a 'fasten your seatbelt' moment.it was a dark film but done in a way which made you chuckle along the way, and cheering for the family despite the fact that are committing multiple crimes against a completely innocent family. When you step back its quite a terrifying thought and in no way should we be cheering these people on, but I was!The little hits of comedy took the edge off and gave us light breather, even towards the end, despite the craziness and drama unfolding we managed to chuckle at a smalls dogs unconventional snack. I love the ending, having something left to you own interpretation like that is something a lot of people do not like but I for one like it and find it genius.Overall I loved it, for its uniqueness (which is always welcome) the tension the drama, the dark comedy. I would thoroughly recommend.My only question, where the hell is Min?Film 7"
PARASITE,1 February 2020,10/10,"This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence.
It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life."
PARASITE,3 May 2021,9/10,"The Screenplay of the movie is really good. The movie starts from a Comedy Genre and ends up in a Sad and Thriller. I would really appreciate the Cameraman/Camerawoman, The angles of the Camera are very decent and clear."
PARASITE,4 May 2020,10/10,It is an awesome roller coaster ride which you dont want to stop even after the movie ends you want more and more. Perfact combination of stars awesome story something new each and every scene sticks you like a glue. And you got hangover of this movie for days.
PARASITE,29 June 2020,9/10,Beautifully written screen play. loved the camera work. Always appreciated the performance of Kang-ho Song.
PARASITE,3 February 2020,9/10,"This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes."
PARASITE,16 August 2019,10/10,Gonna be the Oscar winning movie! What a movie! It reflects the different level of society! Directly totally control the cadence which bring us into the deep thinking mind!
PARASITE,18 March 2020,1/10,"How the hell did this garbage win the best film award? Better yet, how was it even nominated?
It was so horrible, I stopped watching after the first 15 minutes. Poor acting! Very basic story without a plot. Worst of all, who wants to read captions and listen to this other language.
I look at all these other reviews with 10s and elaborate comments, and I wonder what exactly people are thinking! It is shameful that the Academy allowed this foreign film to compete against all the other amazing films of the year.
Was this some kind of sick political statement?"
PARASITE,29 September 2019,10/10,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,8/10,"Although more a thriller than a true horror, the movie delivered on several levels notably acting, cinematography and direction.Don't expect too many twists and turns, but this psychological story will certainly mess with your mind in places.A great movie, easily digested thanks to some nicely voiced and believable dubbing."
PARASITE,26 October 2019,10/10,"This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best.
This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth.
The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood.
Everybody must watch this movie."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,"Besides it is a huge narrative, it is also a really politic picture. Easily the best movie in 2019 and one of the most important film of the decade."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,8/10,"This film seemed very good in the photographic and scenic part, good characters and a decent plot that is losing its strength at the end where in my case, I get out of the experience of those people by putting a complex and very twisted twist with a style Oriental that for my taste does not work at all. Is it the best of the year? I do not think so, but I do think it is an excellent foreign film with a clear criticism about class conflicts but I like it much more as the movie shoplifters puts it, being more realistic and cruel to the point of making you reflect and depress you for its plot. sorry for my English."
PARASITE,31 May 2020,7/10,How come that the girl didn't report to police about the basement after she found her teacher in blood?!
PARASITE,9 October 2019,9/10,"The Screenplay is soooo good.
Joon-ho Bong is one of my favorite Directors working right now.
An unordinary story which takes you on a journey where you never know where you end up.Somehow South Korea produces so many quality movie its unreal.Great movie, the less you know, the better.And watch Memories of Murder too, imo his best work ;)"
PARASITE,4 April 2020,7/10,Its a very good movie thats it. but very overrated.
PARASITE,25 March 2020,5/10,Complicated with less meaning. Briefly not what I was expected at all.
PARASITE,5 March 2020,10/10,"I forgot I was watching a Korean movie. Was too captivated by everything that happened in the movie. Pitiful, comical, thrilling and horrifying. It's not simple to understand though. One can interpret in many ways.
Anyone shud watch it in a lifetime."
PARASITE,4 December 2019,10/10,"There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,But they killed my girl jessica so im gonna have to give it a 9/10
PARASITE,24 September 2019,9/10,"I've seen some Korean movies such as ""I saw the Devil"" or ""A Bittersweet Life"" but ths one tops them all. It was the first time, that I felt different feelings for the same movies. I laughed for a scene and 3 minutes later I was grabbed on my seat for the tension.
The characters tend a little bit to the stereotype (the naive rich wife, the spoiled children, and the hard working poor family) but enjoyable to watch. You feel attracted to them because you can understand their despair for trying to ""fit in"", especially the younger son.
However, I recommend this movie. Beautifully directed, with some nice shots (the last one when the poor father flees after murdering the wealthy father), convincing acting and a interesting subject about societal classes.
The only flaw is the characters who have a too stereotypical part but it can be easily forgotten."
PARASITE,26 April 2020,10/10,A best Korea movie . It's a masterpiece. Must watch movie 👀
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending."
PARASITE,30 June 2019,3/10,"Boring movie, the acting is fine but there are too many unnecessary scenes and the plot is bland, uninteresting . A waste of time"
PARASITE,2 May 2020,9/10,"South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. Certainly Parasite might feel uneven to some audiences because of its radical shifts in tone -- from clever comedy to violent, dark tragedy -- but it's more likely that Bong has executed everything as planned. Each insignificant detail, from the young boy Da-song's love of Native Americans to a peach allergy to the Kim family's sad little half-basement apartment, has been planted for some specific, exacting reason.Cleanly and slickly constructed, Parasite takes perverse pleasure in scamming the rich during its leisurely, funny first half, and that pleasure is contagious. When the second half comes, it's not only a narrative shock, but it also forces viewers to ask hard questions about why the first half was so enjoyable. In earlier films Bong slyly explored the impact that humans have had on our environment. In Parasite, he looks at an even bigger picture. He wonders why humans tend to look away from, or insulate themselves from, others' troubles and suffering. In this movie, reaching the high ground is certainly desirable, but those occupying the low ground aren't going anywhere."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"Hi At first glance at the movie It looks simple But I sink deep into the film Throughout the film, one looks at the power of thinking and the power of man himself But wealth is everything And poverty incapacity Thanks"
PARASITE,2 August 2020,5/10,Why this modern day soap opera even won the best picture at oscars its a no no in a million years for me. 5 stars for the exceptional acting though
PARASITE,25 March 2020,3/10,"The movie has a very nice direction throughout, it however gives a wrong message to society. The Park family was not doing any wrong to kim family , they have earned money by their hardwork and luck.
The kim family did all wrong means to enter the house and slowly slowly they became careless of their responsibility. Mr Park and his wife were decent people, but the movie did not talk about it, rather it tries to justify the murder of Mr Park by Kim family."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,9/10,"It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing ""parasiting"" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer."
PARASITE,16 September 2020,10/10,"Impressive, uncomfortable, a masterpiece.
at times you can feel the smell that the moments emanate"
PARASITE,9 May 2020,9/10,"It's a movie from an unfamiliar part of the world(South-Korea) that paints an uncannily familiar picture. But, be warned there are no victories in ""Parasite"" and no one gets away unpunished.The ""parasite"" of the title applies to every character in this film the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class.""Parasite"" introduces us to the Kims, a South Korean family of four living in a basement apartment. They're so poor they can't afford Wi-Fi ,they leech it from nearby cafes and earn their meager income folding pizza boxes. A gift from the son's friend, a heavy stone that promises wealth to its owner, works its magic when the son, Ki-woo lands a job teaching English to a wealthy schoolgirl, Park Da-hye. She's part of the Park family, that looks like the negative (or maybe the positive) image of the Kims, living comfortably in a modernist mansion high on a hill.The Park patriarch Dong-ik is a tech CEO who's barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specializes in angry, rebellious scribbles.It's into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the family employed in the Park family. Their schemes are exhilarating, clever and intricately plotted.For much of the film the audience is swept up in the thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines.Much of this story, however, isn't told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They're a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame.""Parasite"" moves effortlessly between capitalist parable, horror film and situation comedy as the natures of the two families are revealed: The Kims, grasping and greedy yet unfairly stigmatized by poverty (even in their newly bought clothes, they give off an odor that can't be masked), and the Parks, harmless and well intentioned yet coasting through life on the backs of others."
PARASITE,4 May 2020,10/10,"The writer/director of ""Parasite"" , Bong Joon Ho takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected Wi-Fi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers."
PARASITE,23 June 2020,10/10,"ITS A MASTERPIECE
IF IT WERE A PAINTING
IT WOULD BELONG IN THE LOUVREAesthetics
Accuracy
Humour
EmpathyThank you Bong"
PARASITE,24 December 2019,9/10,"This is the first subbed movie I have watched in awhile and was easier to follow than I remembered.This movie is filled with unexpected and surprisingly simple techniques that will keep you guessing. Though the plot is not very complex, it's interesting and flows well. A few surprises were present in the movie and makes you stop and rethink what is actually going on.Acting is spot on in all aspects and part of the joy of this movie.My first film review so I'll keep it simple.. I tried to talk my girlfriend into watching this great movie but she declined... really the only sad part about this movie experience to date. ;)watch it."
PARASITE,6 February 2021,7/10,"I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hypeIts good, but not top 50 goodI feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exoticAsk yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner."
PARASITE,3 March 2020,4/10,"Just wondering why it's highly rated. The story is weak and it's another ordinary story. Maybe because it's Korean.
I believe the Founder movie is away better."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,1/10,A veiled approval of violent interaction between the 'classes' this is an incredibly disturbing movie which should NEVER have been granted Best Picture as the first Foreign language film to get that acclaim. Claims of stealing the plot are still under legal review. SHAME on the Academy for this dirty little movie...others of the year were far more deserving
PARASITE,17 January 2020,10/10,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days."
PARASITE,2 February 2021,9/10,But the light signal used for sending messages was very awkward. No one tried to fix that Bulb.Any father would save their daughter/son in that situation but he killed that Rich guy who was asking for Car's Key to get his daughter to the hospital!
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"Bit of a mazza throughout cannot lie. Mazza at the start, big mazza middle, mega mazza end. Overall, top mazza"
PARASITE,26 September 2019,10/10,"So just lemme give a short review about points that make Parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century:1- It's a literal Dark Comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept that's actually thrown every where on media2- the economic gab wasn't about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politics/economy3- the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario4- ""best plans are those never existed""5-no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if6- the end show the human's priority for 'survival'"
PARASITE,27 October 2019,10/10,"So, you think you're going to ""fast track"" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)So you decide to take the ""easy"" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.
But one night...~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~...comes a flood.And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.Look at how wrong you were.In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.Until then."
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,5/10,"You know how good movies make you feel, leaving you expired and with some thoughts and questions in your mind. Well it's not one of them. The only question this movie leaves you with is: ""What is this"" and the only though is ""I just wasted 2 hours and 12 minutes of my life"".
The whole movie doesn't have a flow, is so predictable in the first part, like they try to put oh the poor vs the rich, phrases like 'oh he smells like underground'. Whatever the creators wanted to show they failed.
Watching this movie thinking it got all the Oscars made this bad movie feel even worse."
PARASITE,27 November 2020,10/10,"It is pulling you into reality and at the same time to the illusion.
Showing both side and connecting them well.
Spectacular ending.
Congrats!"
PARASITE,24 August 2019,9/10,"Masterpiece across all human emotions,
Insightful at every level"
PARASITE,7 April 2020,5/10,"I watched the movie and I liked it but there were some very strange and odd things in the movie or I have to say plot holes.and by the way I don't remeber the names so I just explain about them.
1.how did taht guy in the basment free himself?
2.when kevins girlfriend goes and picks him up in the basment at the end of the movie doesn't she realise what is this door going downstairs which looks too creepy?
I would like you to reply to this review."
PARASITE,17 April 2021,1/10,"Let me say from the outset that I love films that are extraordinary. They take you out of your comfort zone, full of surprises, and have a totally new slant on the art of film making.Well, unfortunately Parasite is none of these things.There are very few films I have actually walked out of the cinema before the end out of pure boredom. Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Junior was a notable 'lowlight' (truly truly awful!).Well Parasite has just joined this illustrious group.I'm not going to criticise or question the sanity of people who say this is a masterpiece. That's up to them. But I genuinely just don't get it.Awful acting, boring dialogue, no direction...this film has no redeeming feature in my 'humble opinion'. Hence the title of this review - this film isn't average...it's way, way worse than that.But go see it yourself - you may love it.. Just don't try to convince me that this is anything more than a total snore-fest."
PARASITE,29 January 2021,10/10,"All I can say is this film was very well thought out on the acting, editing, directing, and just general storytelling. Love the diversity and highly recommend to watch!"
PARASITE,11 March 2020,9/10,"In every sense, this film captivates my heart. Everything from the story to the filming is fun."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,1/10,Made me feel depressed it was a waste of time and it overrated for no reason
PARASITE,13 May 2020,3/10,More than just a foreign language film. A true depiction of how far dependency can take a poor household. Bold humour at its best
PARASITE,7 February 2020,2/10,"After reading several great reviews of this movie, i had to see it.Hated it from start to finish.I love ""out of the box"" movies... the weirdest, the better.
This is just dull.
No good actingwaht so ever.
Good story but the guy in the basement?! Really??Not believable, to say the least.
And the rich mother? Just to stupid to be convincing.Just my opinon, but if you like good acting, don't watch this.Just one of those trendy movies everyone loves to love, to be in aline with the supposedly ""intelectually advanced"" reviewers out there."
PARASITE,15 February 2021,10/10,Funny. with a great twist . I will totally watch it again.
PARASITE,30 November 2021,6/10,"This movie was ok. Nothing incredible. Interesting idea but nothing special. This movie was not better than Joker, Once upon a time in Hollywood or The Irishman. Its just my opinion."
PARASITE,28 December 2019,8/10,"One that will leave you thinking
One that will leave you thinking"
PARASITE,5 January 2020,10/10,This movie left me speechless. A true masterpiece. Really creative and innovative.
PARASITE,3 April 2020,10/10,"Well deserved best movie of the year!You have to watch it untill someone thinks to copy it! It's brilliant!
Normally i stay away from foreign movies but this one changed my mind,also i do not write reviews this one deserves it!"
PARASITE,24 March 2020,3/10,"Really thats movie winning 4 oscars !
Sure u r kidding with me ..
Not good at all , the only good thing in this movie was music , any thing else not..
There is no story in this .
Not happy for seeing this ."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,9/10,This movie clearly visualize the difference between lower class family and the rich family.
PARASITE,5 November 2019,10/10,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
PARASITE,3 October 2019,9/10,"Parasite is my second korean movie after oldboy and i have fallen in love with this country.parasite is the kind of moveis you will never forget the soundtrack , the cenimatography all amazing."
PARASITE,30 May 2020,10/10,"An original movie about class ""fight"" in today's society. Bong Joon Ho never fails when he writes and directs, and i think this is his masterpiece until now. A real gem of cinematography, writing, edit and everything, really. The number of genres i've seen in this film is ridiculous, but at the same time, they're all consistent together thanks to the ability of the people that worked behind this. I also recommend this movie to who has never seen a korean/non english movie!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,8/10,"I wonder if this movie/story would've gotten an Oscar if it was made in Hollywood and in English.
Surely had it been done in Hollywood it would've been just another well made thriller drama movie / very ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" like.Don't get me wrong, it's a very well done and interesting film with a strong agenda. But imo should've been just a Foreign language award.
Perhaps there were no stronger candidates this year from Hollywood that show life. And Parasite showed life and disparity in life really well.
Put any country as a setting for this film and the story would still stick."
PARASITE,4 June 2020,2/10,I don't like the movie It is kinda boating u will really not enjoy watching this
PARASITE,31 January 2020,7/10,"After first half of movie I had my expectations really high, I got some good laughs and thought this would actually be that 8.6 IMDB that I was expecting. But what ever happened during that second half of this movie... I have no idea how this mediocre movie got so many main Oscar nominations. It ain't worth that, plot is nonsense and no matter how much I want, I can't justify it.Movie itself is worth to watch, but there just isn't nothing special here..."
PARASITE,3 December 2021,9/10,"I watched this film at least 5 times now and I can't get tired of it. I love the way how this film plays with our moral while simultaneously building up this indescribable tension. The Characters are amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and the sets are amazing. I can only recommend this movie."
PARASITE,7 June 2019,10/10,"The Parasite shows Korean house architects that calls 'Banjiha'(lower level house). Because it appears only at Korea, I taught its mood for Korean, but all over the world liked it!."
PARASITE,19 January 2020,10/10,"This film had me hooked from the beginning. A fast-paced, and well thought out storyline. No details were left unanswered in my eyes. Brilliant and humble acting from all the cast with believable characteristics and flaws. The subtitles throughout are worth it for what is unveiled during the film."
PARASITE,17 April 2020,2/10,"As a fan of foreign films I was excited to watch this after its Oscar success, but unfortunately it collapsed in its second half -- so badly I had to abandon viewing it.The opening of the film, introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family. It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy.The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way.Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives.The failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience."
PARASITE,21 October 2020,1/10,The stupidest movie I've ever seen. I'm really sorry for those who voted for this junk movie.
PARASITE,30 September 2019,8/10,"Very funny movie, fast paced, nice aesthetics
relatable plot"
PARASITE,6 March 2020,9/10,"Basking in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing the air in the dark room will only walk like a ghost. Poverty on the stone can not be removed for life, smell of cheap can never be removed for good. The bedbug that curdles underground, with medicated open a window to sterilize oneself; The host at the top pays someone to sterilize himself. The rich suck the blood of the poor rise, the poor send in the house of the rich survive, people and ghosts share food in one room, insect and beast parasitic body development enmity."
PARASITE,28 January 2020,10/10,This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019
PARASITE,4 January 2020,9/10,It's like taking steps to reach the top! The climax would blow your mind.
PARASITE,19 March 2020,7/10,"This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough. The whole story is quite metaphoric,hinting the notion of class struggle. However , in my opinion I think the metaphors are too explicit and at the same time can be disturbing.
It just ain't oscar- wrothy!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,Such a great unique master piece! the kind of movie that surprises you. its hard to know whats coming next.
PARASITE,14 July 2019,9/10,"Just watch it people !! I assure you won't regret it. I love it how the film can move you from one state of emotion to another in just a blink of an eye. I laughed, shocked, confused altogether but I enjoyed it. I'm so thrilled watching this. I kinda wanna watch it again while it still in theater."
PARASITE,14 July 2019,7/10,"The movie and all the comedy elements in it are good, but the plot points are just too weird and too over the top.7 is okay and logical but 8 or more is too much for this.
Seriously guys."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,"Good actors, well filmed, but the story is predictable and too depressing. It does not deserve at all its oscars and all this fuss about it."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,5/10,"I am flabbergasted, I went expecting so much from an Oscar winner, and my cousin has relocated to Korea and loves the country, and was left speechless. The plot is tired, the characters unlikely and I was just bored. Half the cinema had their phones out. In fact a 5 minute trip to the toilet felt like blessed relief from the tedium. I will never get that evening back. Shockingly bad."
PARASITE,27 October 2019,1/10,"I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not."
PARASITE,21 December 2020,9/10,"This film is amazing, a little scary but it left me unfazed. There are so many plot twists, and it's incredible filmed. 9.5/10. Loved it, wouldn't watch again just because it's a one-time kind of movie."
PARASITE,6 June 2020,6/10,"OK the film is technically beautiful. So forget that. In an era of global inequality this film inverts reality. The rich in this film are lethargic and foolish, the poor are schemers. In reality, it is the rich who are the schemers and rip off artists (how else would they get rich) and the poor who are not able to survive. No rich person worth their salt would ever be as dumb as they rich people are. No way. No in South Korea and not in America. It is the rich who constantly scam the poor into working for them at ridiculously low wages. No rich person ever hires a driver without 5 million checks first. That just doesn't happen. That being said, the moments where the poor get to live like rich people in the house are moving. Because no American film would ever touch inequality like this, it was a shock to the system. And the ending is pure Tarantino meaningless violence, like what do we do for the ending? Have a guy coming running out with a knife...Which means there is no ending."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,5/10,"The history is fine, but why does it have an disaster ending?"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty. In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims.If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims.Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation.It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break.10 out of 10"
PARASITE,4 March 2020,10/10,"Throughly enjoyable throughout, big anime fan so the subtitles were no issue."
PARASITE,17 September 2019,10/10,"A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"Parasite is undoubtebly an outstanding movie. The plot is clever and jam-packed with twists, the actors do a fabulous work, the concept and the story is ambitious and it is all held together by a crippling atmosphere. It is alltogether thought provoking, it exposes our societys fundamental problems and contradictions.
While not arguing Parasites worthiness for all the nominations and prizes it has received (including the four Oscars), I must point out one weakness (I might be amongs the few considering it one), that made me give it only eight stars. In some scenes, I have found the movie just as gullible as Mr. Park and his wife. One example for this the way Kim and his family get out of the house after the owners come home. It is so naive that it would perfectly fit into a Home alone movie. I know that this senselessness is an essential of the movie and is supposed to bring a grotesque balance to it, but it also makes the film quite predictable.
But even this predictability is not able to ruin this work of art, and that makes one realize how marvelous Parasite is despite all if its flaws."
PARASITE,21 September 2020,10/10,"Parasite is one of the best movies ever made. It is a visually stunning movie where Hong Kyung-pyo has done phenomenal work with the cinematography. The actors in the movie are all great and live up to their expectations. The movie is funny and entertaining, but at the same time relatively dark. This movie will not make you bored!"
PARASITE,2 April 2020,10/10,"Excellent movie, must see period
Story, acting, everything was perfect."
PARASITE,2 January 2020,6/10,"I don't really understand the high rate for the movie, it is very normal expected movie."
PARASITE,13 June 2020,9/10,Spectacular movie by pretty much any point of view as said many times by pretty much everyone. The thing is: in my opinion the best part of this movie is sharply the cinematography. How it's possible that it won best direction and not best cinematography?? I mean obviously direction is really great but cinematography is simply perfect!
PARASITE,8 October 2020,10/10,One of the best movie I ever watched.This is the first movie of South Korea that I had watch in my life and now I can say that Parasite is better and outstanding movie .This move is far good than Hollywood movies.I rate this movie as No.1 and yes this movie deserves oscar and they did it also.
PARASITE,28 September 2019,2/10,"This movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time."
PARASITE,27 November 2019,8/10,"Enjoyed this film, funny yet scary and thought provoking, would recommend to anyone"
PARASITE,11 February 2020,8/10,"The film is not bad, it opened the way for me to the world of features of South Korean cinema. but I can't give it 10/10. I expected a lot more from a film with such a buzz around it and four Oscars, two of them for ""best Director"" and ""best film"". the idea and message are clear, but I'm only talking about the first hour of the movie. somewhere in the middle of the story begins to gain momentum incomprehensible to me, and the genre of the film changes in the opposite direction. the ending of the film is no less strange. apparently, these are the features of South Korean cinema that I could not understand, alas. I put this film 8/10 and believe that it received this rating from me as undeservedly as its 4 Oscars.. ."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,8/10,"The movie was going in a good phase, suddenly it changed the track in d climax. may be that part could be shown differently. and also climax was too fast. everything was happening like a flash. i didnt like the ending,but the movie is great to watch for its cinematography. its hard to assign a genre for this movie. u can say its social drama-comedy-thriller kinda. and congrtz for winning the oscars."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,1/10,Just goes to show you most people like dumb shows. Not sure what the hype is. Political
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,Far and away one of the best films you'll ever see.
PARASITE,10 November 2020,9/10,"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.Filming a movie is like painting a picture, you need to put time and effort into it and boy the people who worked on this film knew what there doing."
PARASITE,2 November 2019,,"Perhaps it is a ""dark comedy"" that is ""hysterically funny"" as some reviewers wrote. Well, for me it ain't so. The pure nastiness and bloodletting in this movie reminds me of Fargo, which I loved but didn't find funny either. Come to think of it, this movie could have been written by the Coen brothers. It is very long and ultra creepy and I left the movie feeling slightly sick, kinda the way I felt after watching the Dutch version of the movie ""The Vanishing"".
Is it a good movie? In terms of story telling, imagery, and acting, I suppose it is. Should you see it, expecting a good laugh? Definitely no! Even ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is funnier than this movie. Want to laugh? Go see ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday."""
PARASITE,1 January 2020,1/10,"The story is not believable at all and also so predictable.
The director couldn't work on characters and that is why we don't care about them at all, there is no sympathy.
It is a teenage level movie, I laughed throughout the movie but not because it is funny! I was laughing because the story was so naive. However, from the rate he has got so far, I can say he knows people even around world to make such a bad movie but get credits and who knows awards!! So disappointing to see what credits and stars he has got for this kind of movie!!!!There is a lot of holes in this one such as stabbing the rich guy for nothing! Just not treating well! If the director would like us to believe it, he should take much more time on this character.
In the first 30 minutes, at most, we can predict even the final. Ok, the director doesn't focus on this, but what else he gave us!
My suggestion, do not waste your time on it."
PARASITE,25 May 2021,10/10,"First of all let me tell you my experience about Parasite. Back in time as everyone was talking , I thought ""okay it has to be something special that's why everyone is recommending"" and on top of that the film won Best Picture in Cannes film festival , was also nominated by Oscar in couple of categories. Also won several awards in Golden Globes. And when there is so much hype about something obviously we all want to watch it immediately. But as it was not released in India , I had no options other than to wait..Finally after huge public demand they released the film in several multiplexes. Sadly on a very low scale. After some time I watched it and My God , What an experience! I was just looking at screen with my wide eyes open throughout the runtime. I wanted to understand what Director is trying to convey through it. I had my imagination about it like ""oh it'll be some commercial sci-fi alien film or zombie action film"" , you know something like that... But HELL NO. It was nothing like that , infact not even close. With every upcoming scene my all the imagination was fading away like a weathery cloud. As if the Director made it just to prove me wrong. Jokes apart but it was really unexpected. Every scene was interesting and metaphorically shot. Visual storytelling is one of the beauties of Parasite. And of course those periodic twists. Damn.Shortly , The film was engaging and especially if you haven't watched the trailer or if you don't know anything about the plot , this film will surprise you so much more.. and I have personally experienced it. During the whole time I couldn't even imagined or guessed whats going to happen next ?So , you can watch this film. You should watch this film and try to find what it tries to speak.It started as a black comedy , then it became a family and social kind of drama , after some time it was a thriller , again after some time it was a mystery , later it was a revenge , climax was horror and ending was a tragedy! I mean what else can I say? Seriously man that Director 'Bong Joon-ho' is a South Korean diamond. After Parasite I watched some of his previous work and was mesmerized by this man's vision and brilliance of storytelling. 'Memories of Murder - 2003' , 'Okja - 2017' , 'The host - 2006' , 'Mother - 2009' are some his movies that I want everyone to watch. This are more or less equally good movies that you will not regret after watching."
PARASITE,22 June 2020,8/10,"My first korean movie, and was a great surprise; No one can say this is not a good movie, but the ending and the director explanation about the themes is very disappointing. It's supposed to be another anti capitalism movie, but they failed miserably, only the leftists will relate with the parasite family."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,3/10,"I walked out near the end of the movie.
I highly recommend you don't spend time and money on it
It made me very uncomfortable watching two hours of people scamming other people (and worse) for personal gain.
Yes, you see that in movies all the time, but this one simmered in cruelty in slow motion...surrounded by beautiful people and sets.
I didn't like ANY of the characters in the movie and that is hard to do
I felt a hollow sadness when I left
Maybe because it had a lot of ""10's"" or maybe it is a reflection of what society thinks is a good film.
The only redeeming quality I saw was that the Korean people are sweeter than us , like 1950's bad guys in suits."
PARASITE,8 November 2019,1/10,"Waste of time waste of money, frankly speaking i didnt like it at all"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"Best Picture well deserved. Thank you Bong, very cool."
PARASITE,12 March 2021,5/10,"10 main characters, all paper-thin in their description, none of which appealing. Story is stretched beyond credibility, for a story meant to provide ""social commentary"". But well filmed, and the house looks nice, for sure!"
PARASITE,10 November 2019,10/10,"This is a rollercoaster of a film,it starts off with us seeing the situation of a poor family,the friend of the family's son gives him an offer of his job and tells him to forge his graduation documents,after learning the son needs an art tutor he lies to get his sister in,I can talk about a lot of things,but the garden scene,phew what a scene. The underground husband stabs Jessica (the sister),the father attempts to save his daughter,Mr park asks for the car keys,the father tosses them and...well anyone who's seen the film knows the scene,bong joon-ho has proven he is an amazing director worthy of winning many rewards with this film alone"
PARASITE,12 November 2019,10/10,"This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized."
PARASITE,2 February 2021,10/10,"Not many films in the past 10 years have made as strong of an impression as Parasite. The commentary of capitalism and the division of class and how it tears apart all families involved even shines through this growingly dark drama. Although, not an American film, its universal themes still amplify the ubiquity of a global issue."
PARASITE,21 November 2019,10/10,"Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists.
Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away.
Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals.
But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.
9,8 / 10"
PARASITE,25 November 2019,9/10,"The comparison of the poor Kim family to parasites is not clear from the beginning. Their underground ""apartment"" does stink and yes, bad enough, they have to look at a drunken guy pee in front of them during dinner. No job, no hope, no direction, the bland and quiet acceptance of their status quo at the beginning makes me wonder how they resonate with the film title.However, step by step, through perfect acting schemes, the well thought out ploys, they make a dream of living off of the Parks come true, thereby transforming themselves into parasites. Throughout the period when they enjoy the ""improving"" living standards: from eating in the dungeon to a treat dinner with the drivers, to the actual pizzas whose boxes they were making to earn bread and butter, etc. All this time I struggle with the heartbreaking fact that at least three parties (1) the Parks (2) the previous driver (3) the previous maid were all innocently suffering from the Kims' wrongdoing. The lack of apologetic thinking is absolutely horrifying. Yet when the class difference is so drastic, I am not sure whether they are too be judged. After all what other options do they have, without a morally sound means to access anything else other than their smelly dungeon? It only became more intense when the previous maid showed her true parasitic self, together with her husband.""Money is an almighty iron that straightens out all wrinkles"" - on the surface yes, but it is exactly this dangerous, monotonic pursuit of money, and money only, that has cost three families their chance to make peace with what is given.""People with money are always nice."" It sounds almost absurd and I can think of millions of counterexamples, yet the director sets the story up exactly this way in the film. I think I dare thinking outside of the film context, it is rather that ""the people who do not have money sometimes cannot afford to be nice."" Either way, when the cutoff of wealth is base-line subsistence, it is clear that dignity is at risk.What is the dad's plan? It sounds like a family who are so good at planning ""scenes"" to act out in fact have not a clue about planning long term for their lives. Is planning also out of reach for a lot of the poor? It turns a bit positive when the boy sets himself a goal to one day make enough money to buy that mansion, but is that enough? Or is it rather another episode of self-deceiving wishful thinking only?"
PARASITE,4 January 2020,7/10,"The entire basement characters arc felt almost dissatisfying just existing. This includes everything from the tacked on morse code shenanigans, to the being held hostage by a damn camera phone. I really would love to watch a version of this movie's plot where the basement just doesn't exist, and focus on the 2 primary families intriguing plot line."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,3/10,I really didn't like it it just wasn't a good movie for me others may enjoy it but it's not for me. Great cinematography though
PARASITE,21 December 2019,10/10,Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.
PARASITE,9 December 2019,6/10,"I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable.
For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people. And a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,5/10,"The movie was kind of original on the history, but feels pretty slow. I cant understand the hype, maybe the exotics of the culture and the neccesity of the academy to achieve more diversity. No such a great movie as other said."
PARASITE,20 August 2020,10/10,"This movie was incredible!Glad I saw this, and was introduced to this director through this movie."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,1/10,I'm not asking anyone to agree with me ... but I did not find this film beautiful moving or touching in any way shape or form... nothing that happened in this film was believable... and if we just give out acadamy awards for a bunch of random crap happening in a movie .... there is a reason this one won 4... don't fall for the hype and accidentally pay for this film like I did... waste of money and time...
PARASITE,30 December 2019,,"If you are emotionally sensitive or an empath, I suggest you consider whether or not you want to experience the horrific pain (pain & horror) this movie elicits. If you are in recovery from any type of addictive, emotional, physical or psychological condition, be aware that seeing this movie may trigger a relapse. If you are more intellectual than feeling, and/or know how to healthily manage painful feeling, you'll find this an outstanding movie. The acting is superb. The emotional horror is devastating."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,7/10,"The story was really good and enjoyable but, it was kinda a let down knowing how much people hyped this movie. It won so many awards but why. It was not that shocking at all. But the best part about it was the acting and cinematography.If you want to watch a really crazy mind blowing movie you should watch Old Boy. It's another Korean film that deserved more praise than this movie."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen. It teaches a lot about things we spot in everyday life. Movie starts from comedy to thriller.
PARASITE,1 January 2020,6/10,Definitely not worth more than 8 stars. A good movie to watch at home but not at the theatre.
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.
PARASITE,2 January 2020,9/10,Just watch the movie. trust me. A truly Masterpiece from Bong Joon Ho.
PARASITE,30 March 2020,5/10,I watched this movie because it won so many awards last year. About 1.5 hours in i got up and started playing on my computer... this movie wasted 2 hours of my life. Its nothing special and i think there are way better movies out there.
PARASITE,11 April 2020,10/10,"I was avoiding the movie for several months, because I wasn't sure how I feel about korean movies - I have a history with korean dramas and korean music, but the movies - there are a few, that I have seen and let's jut say that they weren't my cup of tea. But because of the nominations, I decided that I shoudn't skip the movie. And I am NOT sorry at all. Parasite is just a masterpiece and totally deserved to win the Oscar"
PARASITE,4 July 2021,10/10,"Don't let the subtitles scare you, after a while you forget they're even there. It's like you just forget that you're even reading them and you get so caught up in the story. At first I wasn't sure where it was headed but it soon becomes clear. There is this poor family who sort of invades this rich family and starts living off of their wealth, hence the title Parasite. The son becomes a tutor for the family's daughter and then her recommends his own sister for a tutor for the rich family's son but he doesn't tell them it's his sister, and then they get a job for their dad and their mom as well. It's really clever the way it all unfolds. I wish they did stuff like that in other movies too because I really can't think of any and I really liked it."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,5/10,"Really overhyped and overrated. The movie is OK but far from ""best of the decade"" to be honest. When watching the movie I felt that I was always 2 or 3 seconds ahead of the plot, which (especially the first half) vibes like that of a cliche sitcom show, squeezed and polished (really hard) into an ""artsy"" crowd-pleasing movie. This whole unprecedented praise around the movie, which I guess I will never understand, somehow reminds me of the fanatics about Kpop, which, (un)surprisingly, shares the initial ""K""."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape."
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"Opening scene .. quite funny .. and wity .. movie goes in a very funny way and .. keep us for there ..
later the movie is gets involving and .. stroy pick ups yhe the pace ... hats off to the actors .. and director giving a such good content .. it's not a movie it's ART ..
MUST WATCH MOVIE"
PARASITE,31 January 2020,8/10,Great movie with likable characters. There were a lot of surprises. I was really rooting for them to succeed and couldn't believe how some things turned out. I was somewhat disappointed how it took a turn for the worse in the movie. Definitely shocking.
PARASITE,20 January 2020,10/10,"The best movie l've seen! I wanna see it again!
You mast see!"
PARASITE,11 August 2020,4/10,"Nothing really happens in this movie, the first 1 hour and 50 minutes nothing happens, then a very medicore thing happens, and that's it."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,9/10,"An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.
There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.
Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.
Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,
Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.
Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.
In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?
A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy
Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.
Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.
The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.
The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.
The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.
However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.
Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.
The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."
PARASITE,15 January 2020,7/10,Beautiful movie congratulations. story beautiful movie
PARASITE,17 January 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,9/10,"Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end"
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.
PARASITE,19 January 2020,3/10,"I watched it because of the excellent reviews. It starts as an interesting and creative film, but be aware that it turns out to be a very violent and depressing movie.
I really don't understand why some people call it a ""masterpiece"".
Yes it is creative and thought provoking, but if you finish watching it with a very bad feeling, then in my opinion it doesn't worth watching at all."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,1/10,"I did not enjoy this movie at all and nearly walked out. My 2 adult daughters and I went, 1 had read the parent guide and was totally unprepared for the sex scene. It was WAY too graphic. We ended up looking away from the screen, but it was disgusting. Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor. There are solutions to our issues and I wish the media (including ""entertainment"" media) would stop pushing their agenda."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,"Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,9/10,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,9/10,"Much like it's creature name sake, Bong Joon-ho' s Parasite is a movie that latches on to you and won't let go. The story of Parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family, the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything. Multiple times in the film, We are shown scenes of the humiliation, abuse and the depravity of the poor family, the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away. The shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value.Parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,10/10,"An instant classic! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch. Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the ""top"". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film's atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life."
PARASITE,24 January 2020,9/10,"A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,7/10,Very original story with a lot of symbolism...but I was expecting more of a plot twist based on critic reviews. I also struggled with reading English sub-titles while trying to follow actors emotions...found it distracting. Maybe it's one of those films like Inception that requires several viewings...except Inception was waaaay better :)
PARASITE,18 April 2020,4/10,"When comparing and competing against other movies on a world wide scale, it falls quite short. Stereotypical and to be honest I'm getting sick of movies coming out of Asia that portray the upper class in the exact same style. The story never captured me throughout the whole movie. Sorry but other foreign movies this year deserved the awards."
PARASITE,31 January 2020,7/10,"This film didn't impress me.
But ""Joker"" did...and i weep at theater and felt catharsis."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,10/10,"I was surprised that it was so much fun. The entertainment, the artistry, and the social grasp were also the best. It is an oversized home run of a giant stadium that the greatest genius of this era struck."
PARASITE,17 June 2020,7/10,"You will not get bored, you will enjoy most of it, but it does not get that level of a masterpiece!"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!
PARASITE,5 February 2020,10/10,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.
PARASITE,7 February 2020,2/10,"The idea that the Kim family are underdogs simply because they're poor is what makes this movie unenjoyable. I like dark comedies as much as the next guy, and I like watching well-deserving people get their just desserts. But every single character in this film, minus the Park kids, are just so awful - to each other, to others, to themselves - that I never felt any sympathy to the Kims and instead just sighed my way through the movie thinking, ""oh my god, of course this is where this is going because what else could possibly happen."""
PARASITE,14 February 2020,9/10,"I think people are too quick to dish out 10s and on the flip side of that a bit too harsh to give anything less than a 7 just to its popularity. This film isnt a ground breaking once in a lifetime masterpiece but it is beautifully shot, acted and written. With any film, I think you must give some room to believe the unbelievable. It's a movie. It's meant to entertain, to move, to inspire, to question. People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think. For me, personally, it was meant to leave us torn. In a place where no real sides were taken, so that we question it constantly, never really reaching a definitive stance. The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be, simultaneously.
It was deserving of the oscar over its competition and it is deserving of your full attention, as a remarkably well crafted piece of cinema by a very talented director/writer."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,I will not waste anymore of my time. I already wasted too much watching it. Terrible.I guess great if you are Korean.The oscars trying to make up for past mistakes........terrible movie.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"I have seen many films this decade, especially in 2019. However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"There are four people starring in the film, father, mother, son, daughter, they live in the bottom society, son, as a person, he has seven emotions and six desires, the father represents selfishness, greed and violence, the mother represents hard-working and pragmatic duty, the younger sister represents happiness, happy and chic, in order to achieve the goal, he first sacrificed happiness, hidden selfishness, with pragmatism. As a result......"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"I always respected Academy for their independence and the best professional group of critics in cinematography in the world. They didn't hesitate to award Parasite with 4 Oscars in the most important categories.I watched Parasite over and over again since Cannes award. The progression of the film storyline is amazing as every episode links each other seamlessly but with more deeper tensions.The intermission was when Mr. Park's family was away for camping. Director Bong probably wanted to provide the audiance a moment to enjoy, relax but with the thunderstorm the fatal second half deploys.This movie embraces all genre (I would call it neo-genre by Bong) and detailed beauty of the social diversity unfold to its extream.I have a habit of reading reviews before choosing films and especially I read most of the reviews just before the Oscars announcement. Most of the IMDB members left 8-10 (mostly 10) but after the awards, I can see unexplainable reviews 1 or 2 with non-sense. I know it's out of jealousy and lack of understanding for the Korean films. Hope you watch Parasite again and rethink..."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"Movie was class. Like very class. If you know what i mean? This was so class, imagine Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. Class."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"I thought that this was definetly one generic movie (everything nice-something happens- that situation is solved) but it was not. I was amazed by the expression that the director has put on this film. Very nice original story and graphism.
I would recommend everyone to watch this.
This movie truly deserved the oscar."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"The Academy has made a great decision on to laureate Parasite as Oscars' 2020 Best Original Screenplay, Best Film, Best Directing and Best Picture Awards. Besides having written a new chapter on Cinema's History as the first non-English-language movie to have gained this epic achievement, the Korean film is a timeless masterpiece, whose stylistics, cinematography, editing work, original screenplay and final outcome will be studied for decades and ever!Best Picture to Parasite!
More than well-deserved!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"Just saw it, blown away like everyone else. As I walked out the theater door I started reading the film reviews that I'd been avoiding in order to dodge spoilers. I was met with yet another shock:
Instead of finding others peeling their jaws off the pavement at the miracle of Bong's ingenious and politically powerful satire of a satire film, all the reviews seem to stop at ground level (maybe half-basement run-down 1960s Seoul apartment level-- you'll understand that if you've seen the film,) and they never 'cross the line' to descend into the full-on hidden underground BUNKER level of what Bong is doing with this film.
I'm reading review after review, all authored by viewers smug that they were sharp enough to deduce the film's 'subtle commentary' on 'economic inequality' and ''the evils of consumerism.'
WHAT? Idiots! That commentary was NOT subtle. It was obvious to the point of being ridiculous. Bong has made fools of you, although I don't think that was his ultimate intention. He made use of the satire genre to throw fresh light on another subject, and it's a subject that has been overdone by everyone, especially westerners, in the arts, in international politics, in every possible aspect: It's that whole pesky North/South thing that all 77 million KOREANS, north and south, have to deal with.
In support of this, there are dozens of scenes worth citing. But the most glaringly obvious one is crazy little DaSong's backyard overnight during a brutal rainstorm. He's in a mini-teepee (he's obsessed w/ US 'indians,' who are used as code for 'americans' throughout the film) w/his floodlight & walkie-talkie. His parents are sitting on the couch in their grand living room watching his antics through the huge window that frames their backyard like a big-screen TV.Dad: 'Do you think that tent will keep the storm out?'
Mom: We had it made by americans, so we should be fine....'
I'm sorry, that backyard IS the DMZ, with its floodlights and speakers. The kid is the 'crossing line' between N. and S. Korea. During the brutal murder scene @ the climax of the film, the guest tables for the 'party' are laid out like combat lines around the DMZ 'teepeet' that was 'made in america' so 'we'll be safe.'And the whole scene @ the b-day party when Park, Sr. is instructing Driver Kim, (both wearing american native headdresses) on the 'role' he is supposed to play in the fight scene they're staging around the teepee....never has an actual Native American man been cast to play a Hollywood role where he looked more like an american stereotype than Kang Ho Song did in the scene where the camera paused on his sad/irate face in that ridiculous headdress. Kang Ho Song's character represents THE AVERAGE KOREAN, not north, not south, that has succeeded @ living through the last 600 yrs of Korean history. At the end of the film, he's a KOREAN, who just needs to 'walk up the stairs' (or, 'cross the DMZ line') into the world South Koreans are making for themselves now that they're economically capable of 'buying the (national) house.'I swear I could write a 300 pg thesis on this film, but I'll just leave it at this: since Bong won the Oscars, N Korea's 'dear leader' Kim Jung weasel has used the film as propaganda supporting the idea that South Koreans have been forced into capitalism by 'americans' and would really prefer to be like supposedly less consumerist N. Koreans. There's therefore an EXCELLENT chance that at least some form of the film will be widely viewed in North Korea. And Bong is hoping that North Koreans will, unlike western reviewers, be smart enough to deduce the REAL content of his message.
Fave, & very telling quotes:""Brilliant! That's a gorilla isn't it?'
--""It's supposed to be a self-portrait...""
(pause) ""Oh, yeah, of course it is....""""Opening my eyes for the first time in a month, I saw a detective who looked nothing like a detective. Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke...""Clue in, fools... this film is NOTHING that it appears to be to the average internet keyboard warrior reviewer who thinks he's smart enough to have decoded Bong's 'anti-capitalist' message. AND, R. Brody's attempt @ a review in the NY Times is particularly pathetic and misguided. Just sad."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,9/10,The movie is a little bit dramatic but it portrays the inequality in every society. Full of twists too
PARASITE,12 February 2020,5/10,I thought character development was great and pacing. That's about it. A ten year old could figure out the plot twist. I just don't get it. But in all fairness I hated Midsommar more.
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,The storytelling is amazing! Bong Joon Ho did it again.
PARASITE,24 April 2020,10/10,"Parasite looks at the totally different lives of kim and Park families and incidents that change their lives totally.
Kim lives with his family with limited facilities where they search for wifi all around the house in opening scene.Park family lives a luxurious life with high paid workers all around them for everything.
The best thing is how the director potrays the class division and the relation between families of different extend.
Starting as a usual story of struggling family, Parasite navigates through relatable dark humour and ends in emotional note.Conversations between the park couple too show their attitude towards the kim family.
Director uses rain to show the difference in situations between the families.Rain is shown as beautiful view of nature in Park's house (nice frames too in park family scenes) and as destructive devil in Kim's house.
Director aptly uses objects to connect the story.For instance, After an incident, young kim throws a rock that his friend gifts to bring prosperity to the family.That scene shows the kind of superstitious beliefs still existing within us.Look out for the final Kim father-son conversation scene.
Technically,bgm enhances the dark satire aspect and conveys the emotion towards the end.Cuts made sure that viewer isn't detached from the progression of the movie at any point once the plot gets interesting.
All just performed excellently except Mrs.Park.Her emotions were a bit over-done .
I can't justify the final twist where Mr.Kim kills Mr.Park without clear justification and that sums up the only major drawback after watching the movie.
Parasite sums up to be the resultant of the script duo's work in the thin plot and some smart execution that makes sure that viewer forgets to think about the wafer thin plot"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"A really good movie, that deserved the Oscar, i was cheering for Joker but what the hell right?"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks?
Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently.
Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family.
Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband.
One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites?
One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success.
The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"The movie is like a travel on its own, good details and an amazing story. It covers all the genres in one."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,I am grateful to have learned to read early and not have problems with subtitles. Americans should try a little to be less lazy.
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,Absolutely Fantastic. The best movie i've seen in my life.
PARASITE,13 February 2020,1/10,"I must have watched a different movie called Parasite"" than the one that won the Oscar. The Parasite that I watched was boring, meaningless, senselessly violent and did not evoke one emotion other than disgust and bewilderment that this movie won Best Picture. There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic. It was a grand gesture for the Academy to award this subtitled, foreign movie, however, receiving an underdog award does not make the movie good. People are easily swayed and like to be part of the ""group"" who like a movie. Like ""drinking the Koolaid""."
PARASITE,13 February 2020,3/10,"Did not like The movie, and did not understand why it was on The Oscars
Crap."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"As a fan of Korean movies it's impossible for me to avoid various titles which leave me the feeling of adaptations from western and europe movies.So far not disappointed
Koreans knows how to spice thingsParasite (2019)
Borgman (2013)
3-Iron (2004)"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"I don't even know what to say. In fact, I don't even want to say anything about this movie. Just go see it if you haven't. You'll be glad you did."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,1/10,"I love Korean movies, but this movie is horrible. I wasted my time! Or maybe I can't understand the movie. Anyway I don't recommend it.Boring,
Worst movie I have seen all year."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"Oscars, golden globe.. I had to see why. Now I know. my english is not good enough to say anything smart :) all I can say is wow.."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"There's 0 comedy from start to finish, I don't know why the tag is there.Good job imdb."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,"The credit of 8 Oscars and praises of all the critics makes you to watch through the movie and hope to finally get stunned by some spectacular element or surprise, but instead the more you go forward with the movie, the more you get disgusted by the superficial and typical story which you one can easily guess the next event which of course you assume that it would be the most stupid thing that can follow! This movie has nothing to offer."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"It's one of the greatest films I've ever watched in my life. Truly a masterpiece. It was so captivating and an emotional roller coaster. It's an absolute must see!! It deserved every award it got and I'm so proud to see it win 4 oscars. Truly deserved and more. Bong joon ho created one of the most creative, unique, amazing films I've seen."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"This movie was freaking amazing!! On top of the genius commentary on class in developed countries and all the nuances it uses in that story, it is absolutely gorgeous. Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,8/10,"This is a great movie and exciting scenario except from the ending.
The Oscars awards lost its reputation in my eyes.
The movie definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar and if it's the opposite then I'm the cruelest critic ever!!!"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,2/10,"This movie lacks depth, nuance, and completely misses the mark when it comes to emotionally impacting its audience. I'm baffled how this film has won so many awards as it doesn't draw one in to really care about what is being shown. It's silly, shallow, and makes for an okay horror flick but if you're looking to learn something, be moved or gain new perspective I suggest just reading the newspaper instead."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,10/10,"This film is full of symbolism that gives it amazing rewatchability. It meshes heist, humor, and horror genres incredibly well all while delivering important social commentary."
PARASITE,17 February 2020,9/10,"This is a film you either love or despise due to its portrayal of social desperation. If you don't like this film you may have missed many artistic cinematographic aspects related to the whole story and the subliminal messages within it about an unfair elitist society. It can be considered a grotesque film that keeps you watching and expectant of the unexpected till the end, which is so thrilling because it combines the sublime with horror at the same time. As Nolan implied in Inception, one more time, we come across with a film that incite us to be chasers not of dreams but of our own reality, in this case, at any cost."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,10/10,"What more is there to say? I never rate movies a 10/10 but this is an 11. It's just amazing, there isn't a single thing about it i didn't love. This is my favorite movie, hands down."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,9/10,"This shook me so good my ponytail elastic snapped, it's a good thing I wore pigtails."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,7/10,"This is a wonderful film ruined by its last half hour including very graphic violence.Even if the plot required violence in the finale, it could have been done in a less graphic manner.Parasite, despite its successes in black humor, social criticism, music, photography, script and acting it falls victim to the ""culture of violence"" in cinema."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,8/10,The story it self is kind of predictable but it is very eye opening and touching. The characters make you feel like they're real; for a second I forgot I was in a movie. I understand why it won best picture. The shooting of the film was AMAZING.
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"In this film the author captured the ratio of lower social class in South Korea. Even though he portrays the family in a very comical way, he managed to show us their desire for a better life. It shows how they are able to do anything: lie, cheat just to achieve their dream.
On the other hand, we have another family that stands as a representative of a higher class, they employ Kim Ki-woo' s family as a servant in their house. We can see big differences between social classes.
The storyline of the movie changes drastically when Kim Ki-woo receives a stone talisman as a gift from his friend. This stone is supposed to provide them with happiness and money. And the boy believes in it, he puts all his faith in the stone, leans on it, and carries the stone with him even in the most difficult moment. He thinks that everything good in his life is due to the stone. Woo-sik Choi perfectly portrayed the character of a boy who looks innocent on the outside but hides a cunning plan inside.
At the end of the movie Kim Ki- woo said : "" Dad, today I made a plan - a fundamental plan. I'm going to earn money, a lot of it. University, a career, marriage, those are all fine, but first I'll earn money. When I have money, I'll buy the house. On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard. Because the sunshine is so nice there."" Which seems like an American dream. To study, to marry someone and be rich. That's what he wanted the whole movie. But we all know, that's never going to happen. It's just a beautiful lie. And American dream is a beautiful lie as well."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite is an amazing film which depicts social disparity in Korea with an incredible sarcastic tone. It brings forward the idea of the American Dream on a surreal atnosphere, with one of the most effective twists in cinema this year. Having the rock serve as a metaphor to the plot itself and how it progresses was a very smart choice by Joon Ho.
9.5/10, favourite scenes: The peach sequence, The opening scene and the scene with the twist."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"Parasite includes drama, mystery, comedy, romance, thriller and a few more genre, which makes it so multilateral, that everyone will find his part. Some people say it could be compared to the ""american dream"", which isn't wrong, because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college. But this is not the only background story. The whole movie is filled with metaphors, what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it. The pictures and camera angels aren't just good, they also imply a great many symbols, which makes it even more interesting to watch it. Sometimes it was a little too much for me, that's why I gave only nine stars. Anyway, if you want to see a great movie, Parasite is a good choice."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,8/10,"So, movie contains a good amount of metaphors.Color Scheme of movie creates a suspense and shot framing is perfect everytime. Clearly depicts a life of a poor family's life. Contains a good amount of humor and NSFW scenes present too."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,10/10,"I liked parasite.It was... at least a movie. As someone who watched Parasite.
Watch it if you enjoy movies, as it is one.
With a run time of two hours, it is longer than any movie over two hours.
The characters ran at multiple points throughout the film, it made me think about running; very scary.
If you are a fan of morse code, this movie is for you. With some really representation for morse and braille speakers.
I rate this movie.As someone who had a parasite, I feel like this does my strife justice.10 Clapping Emoji's out of 10."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,,"In the beginning I'll talk about the story.
It was really good, but it's shouldn't end like that.
He should change the end of the storyBut if we talk about cinematography, It was really goodEnjoy watching."
PARASITE,25 February 2020,9/10,"**Spoiler alert**Winning an Oscar despite being a foreign language film is remarkable. Inspired by the Oscar win and the surrounding publicity if you watch the trailer, it will intrigue you enough to feel an urgency for watching the movie.That this is a class war movie will be evident by then. That there is a parasite central to the story is implied too but who preys on whom is still subject to interpretation or is at least a twisted discovery you make as the story unravels.There is a rich family, gullible & nice but also self-centered and afflicted with class divide enough to dominate everyday decisions in their high-ground lives.
There is a poor family struggling for food and shelter in their below the ground apartment life and yet reveling in their laziness and short term merry making of whatever bounty they can get from odd jobs.When an opportunity comes knocking, promising an easy way of pulling them out of their pit, they pursue it full throttle morality and legalities be damned.
The momentum of their success builds up for a while and descend begins as they encounter a secret and fraud of another kind threatening their new found prosperity.As they discover people like themselves who have stakes in uncovering their frauds, they have to win the fight to not slip back to their below the ground existence. The unfolding of surrounding events also leads to a realization that the idea of their affluence is also just a mirage. After all the stench of the basement remains in them and rich people will forever pinch their nose in disgust as their stench wafts through the rich people's perfumed houses.There is a moment of irony too when a few hours after they had savored the rainfall as they lay usurping the living room of their bosses and pretending that they belonged their after all, they realize that unknown to them the same heavy rain had filled up their basement house with dirty sewer water, destroying their belongings and rendering them homeless in real life.
The pretense of being rich as a part of their rich bosses life suddenly becomes exhausting and together with the chaos of meeting their possible nemesis shocks them out of their reveries of affluence, shatters all their future planning and leads to a complete meltdown a day later.The final scene plays out amidst an ominous setting. The feeling about an impending tragedy is strong. It still manages to be darkly-funny as Geun-Sey plays out his murderous streak with a comical frenzy.The movie won an Oscar for original screenplay and is as much a masterpiece as implied by that accolade. It talks literally and metaphorically about the chasms in the society and leaves the viewers to decide if there are any heroes or villains at all.The movie shows self-imposed helplessness that poverty brings along, how the urge to come out of its grips fast and easy often pushes people further in to its throes. That the need for escapism is so strong that precious reality is lost and often the only way out through education, a steady job is completely lost.Ki-Woo often promises himself and others about the rightful things he will do and achieve, but often leaves it to a later day. At present he is too busy forging the documents, fencing off his day to day struggles or later, longing for the good days that happened, and this is likely to be his way of life throughout in the absence of any supportive surrounding.That is also how the movie ends, with a promise by him which he is sure to never fulfill and so the longing, the aspirations, the needs will remain along with the helplessness of never quiet achieving them.The parasite in the meantime could either be the one who had resigned to an underground life living off the bounty stolen from his rich savior as long as he lived, or the one who is still alive and hiding in the same underground hell albeit with a hope of one day coming out of it.
Or it could be both of them or all the poor men in a hurry to attach their woeful life to those better off around them and be like parasites by the awful choices they make or maybe as a natural order of things or a bit of both."
PARASITE,20 April 2020,,My new favourite movie congrats bong very good i like when every part of the movie so yea go watch this movie cause it is worth the watch
PARASITE,27 February 2020,5/10,"There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
PARASITE,27 February 2020,1/10,"Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece, is incredibly dim-witted. I'll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast.
1. Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family's house.They say it's hard to cover up one lie. You know what's harder? Covering up a whole lot of them and that's what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.
2. Kevin's best friend problemYour best friend has gave you an opportunity, to earn some cash, to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad. He also tells you that he's coming back and will ask the rich's family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he's interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn't.What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his ""best friend"", and also finds out the ""best friend"" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man's family, working under false pretenses.A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you?
B: Expose you and your entire family?Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.Anyone care to tell me? The answer is B! They would be exposed! Who would have thought about that right!?
3. Dining in the rich man's house like you own the placeAlso, with your whole family without a care in the world. Yeah, let us make a mess of this table, get the wine, get the snacks, let's leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here! Oh crap, the rich man family is coming back? Help! I left so much mess here, what do I do now?
4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I'm going to die.Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C'mon. There's only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character.
I could go on and on. The rock and its supposed ""symbolism"" that doesn't exist. How the ending went down, the absurd morse code. But I'm tired, tired of people over glorifying, thinking this is masterpiece when it isn't, of people explaining the ""hidden meaning"" of symbolism in different scenes that doesn't exist. Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status, how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status. How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism.All in all, I don't actually think the movie was all that bad. But grossly overrated. Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has.If you think otherwise, you've been factually proven wrong."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,1/10,"Worst movie EVER. Cannot believe how the hell this movie have got 8,6 in rating. Use your time to something more valueable."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,9/10,"To quote director, Bong Joon Ho, ""I'd like to say as little as possible here, because the film is best when you go into it cold."" That being said, this picture has it all, drama, suspense, mystery and thrills. It has an effective slow build that culminates to a tension filled conclusion."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,10/10,"Truly one of the best movies I've seen so far. A first part which seems quite classic but intriguing, and then a memorable second part that makes us go through all the emotions. An instant classic."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,10/10,"A true masterpiece, left me feel-after a really long time-that I had watched a wholesome movie with an original theme. I found everything perfect-The cinematography, cast, music, picture, constant twists in plot that stirred up all different kinds of feelings -everything!
I definitely recommend to watch even just for the sake of watching something non hollywood style!!"
PARASITE,1 March 2020,1/10,"Considering the rave reviews, I'm stunned how much I disliked this film. Could not wait for it to be over. My wife on the other hand liked it so I kept watching. The garden scene was in my opinion in poor taste as was the scenes back home with flooding rains and sewerage. Mind boggling it won best picture. Must be me though as everyone else loved it."
PARASITE,2 March 2020,1/10,"So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is...What am going to tell you, those who didn't watch it yet..Please don't. Please don't waist your time on this BS.
No Plot, no acting, no music, no dialogs, no nothing.What was it? Oscars winner? Were they kidding? :("
PARASITE,4 March 2020,7/10,"This is a good film, but personally it's not the best I've seen recently.
I watched this before all the hype exploded and the movie went mainstream and thought nothing much of it at the time. I enjoyed it though, it was a great story and very well made, but didn't think it worthy of all the hype. I went to see it again after all the hullabaloo and didn't really think anything different for the first time. I didn't miss anything and I still 'get' it.There was a little too much slapstick and ridiculousness for me, and the acting was only ok. Kang-Ho Song was definitely the best of the bunch."
PARASITE,4 March 2020,10/10,"I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion.
I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot.
Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous.
For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption."
PARASITE,6 March 2020,1/10,This movie is over rated. It's a very regular foreign movie with no creativity at all in the story or the image.
PARASITE,8 March 2020,7/10,"Such a realistic live-movie. Opening with a funny scene, becomes to thriller, a comparison about the rich and the poor nowadays."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,,"The first thing that attract me about these movie was the title, it shows a type of misery about what is going to happen in the movie and what it is about, the poster also catch my attention because in the poster it show us a family with the faces behind a black band so is very intriguing for the person's that what to watch it.In the movie they present a poor family that live in misery, but a great opportunity is going to change their lives .A friend of the youngest son of the family offers him a job in a rich house because he was one of the best English speakers in the city, the poor men accepted the job and went to the house of the rich family. He quickly won the confidence of the family, and he started to enter all his family to work on the rich house, the poor father was the driver, the poor mother was the new housekeeper, and the poor sister was the art teacher. When all of this happens they realise that the house have a dark secret.
In conclusión this is one of the best movies in the world, it won an Oscar for the best movie and its not a waste of time to watch it."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,8/10,"Even if the parasite is high, the smell of poverty cannot be removed"
PARASITE,17 March 2020,4/10,"Overrated film,
a naive and commonplace view of the modern life with absence of deepening and with scenes just to impress us, but from a technical view have a mastery of skill"
PARASITE,8 August 2020,9/10,"Starts as a comedy but turns philosophical, movie although in korean is easy to understand with subtitles"
PARASITE,16 March 2020,9/10,"There is a strong sense of moral contortion throughout the story. The rich did nothing wrong but people hate them.The poor swindle and wield a knife, but you may feel sorry for them."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,3/10,"I have no idea why people are so hyped about this movie. Poor family was shown as people who doesn't have any values/character, greedy and ready to do whatever it takes even to the people who are nice to them or the ones who are struggling as them. I found it wrong completely."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,9/10,"The portrayal of a wealthy family getting ""infested"" by not only a poor family and their former housekeepers demonstrates the different faces of parasitism. First, the poor family is capable to completely get the trust of the wealthy family by being good servants though their motivations are dominantly evil from the beginning. A starting potential love between young members of the two families never has a true chance since it is always overruled by the evil inclinations. The thought arises that the wealthy house's architecture somehow supports the hidden presence of parasites. Now, there is a deeper level of the story: Mt 13:24-29 (The Parable of the weeds). The movie tells the story of many people in this world. It tells the story of indifference. We get good things in life and we are so indifferent and ungrateful for them, that at the end we get unworthy of them and only then do we start to learn the deeper connections of the world soul while we have to compensate for the suffering we caused with our indifference. We are never only poor sheep torn by the wolves. The wealthy family is as guilty as the poor one and a war of philosophies is launched that ends detrimental for both families."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,"A masterly crafted movie with multiple layers of meaning. Full of enexpected twists and turns, packed with details and visually crafted in a masterly fashion.It's hard to properly write a review without giving out spoilers but this movie truly deserves to be enjoyed unspoiled."
PARASITE,2 April 2020,1/10,A predictable plot from the beginning with a ridiculous twist at the end. Possibly the worst movie I have seen in my lifetime. Don't be fooled by its Oscars'. A waste of time and money.
PARASITE,27 March 2020,10/10,"The movie was good. The cinematography is flawless, the script is well written, and the story is wildly original. Parasite is funny, incredibly original, gorgeous, and dark all at the same time."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,1/10,It is not a good movie. I am shocked. why people like this movie
PARASITE,3 April 2020,5/10,"What does this movie want to tell us?
That the people living at the bottom have a tough life?
That these people are evil and shameless?
That they are continue to be like this as if THEY are the heroes?
I can't believe this movie won 4 Oscars!"
PARASITE,8 April 2020,6/10,"So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant)."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,1/10,Please for God sake dont waste your time in seeing this worst ever movie.
PARASITE,4 April 2020,8/10,"The film is about 2 social classes, rich and poor actors very well, I am worth 8/10 for this film very well"
PARASITE,4 April 2020,10/10,"No matter if you are rich, if you are poor. If you work or you are jobless. This movie will preserve deep in your heart for your whole life.Take care of each other and don't cry about everything. No education needed, you just have to watch this film once in your lifetime."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,8/10,"First time in the history, a foreign movie got oscar and that is parasite 2019. There are some extraordinary characteristics which make this movie a unique one.
One of the these exclusive traits is high ambition and downfall. Bong Joon Ho uses a middle class family and their sky high ambition in the movie in a very subtle way which must mesmerize a viewer.If you want see the struggle of middle class and their cravings for money , the Parasite 2019 is for you."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,9/10,"Wow, what a surprise - was not really sure about that kind of Story, but after a lot of good reviews I have to seen it.
Great movie, very good actors!
A kind of movie, in my opinion, didn't existing before!"
PARASITE,6 April 2020,4/10,"I love Japanese films but this one is so OVERRATED. I raised my expectations so high but didn't get what I envisioned from it. I don't know where all the hype is coming from, I'm sorry."
PARASITE,7 April 2020,8/10,"This oscar winning movie of 2019 gives clear pictures of our society ,where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer.
This movie is on class war which is shown very cleverly .Even small things are shown with fine details.
There is not much action in this movie but whatever it is they seems to be real.The comedy has also been added to this movie and that too in different way.The film has been made horror but we hardly can realize it .it is build so well that we don't know what is going to happen next .Suddenly movie takes 360 turn which is very interesting.
overall movie is great , the only problem is that it's in korean language but with english subtitle."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,10/10,"Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema."
PARASITE,8 April 2020,3/10,"This movie is one of the most overrated/overhyped of all time. ""Deep clever multi-layered metaphors and nuances""? Sure, like a pretentious piece of modern art. Guess social commentary plus neat cinematography appeals like a valley girl that reads comic books."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,10/10,"Aside from the film's encapsulating theme of socio-economic disparity, Bong Joon-ho achieves a Hitchcock-like presence that will have you at the edge of your seat. Suspense, comedy, and drama fall short in describing the intersectional and multimodal genre of this on-screen Román a clef. Setting the tone for the 2020's, Parasite is internationally relatable, aesthetically pleasing, and witty - ""we all have a crazy family"" comes to life as more than just a phrase in this two-hour phenomenon of the decade."
PARASITE,12 April 2020,10/10,"'Parasite' illustrates the Kim's persistent inclination to transcend social classes. It is essentially a realistic scrutinization of how the rich and poor are parasitic towards one another, however the beauty of this film is that this idea merely one of the countless interpretations out there. Each scene in this film has been articulated with such thought, while subtle, and the use of cinematography, mis-en-scene, motif and symbolism (to name a few film techniques prevalent) all cohesively work together to portray the social disparity. There is so much yet so little going on...for me, this film was minimalistic but incredibly insightful and meaningful. It is the epitome of perfection.I also love Choi Woo Sik, he is easily one of my favourite actors. This movie, from the actors to the filming is absolutely flawless. If you don't want to watch it because you don't want to read subtitles, well you're missing something incredibly special. Bong-Joon Ho is a genius, alongside the many amazing members of the production team. They all worked together to create such a masterpiece.A good movie leaves you speechless after but a GREAT movie, like Parasite, will keep you invested for months and months and perhaps, for the rest of your life because of how realistic this is.Amazing movie, 10/10"
PARASITE,13 April 2020,3/10,It's a shame that this movie won so many awards over much better movies like 1917. This movie was terrible. Filled with unlikeable characters doing horrible things to others. It actually made me angry that this movie got so much critical acclaim. Very disappointed.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,5/10,"Despite its social commentary and clever cinematography, this movie is still kinda cliche, with predictable and forced plots, with cringeworthy acting here and there.BTW, Bong Joon Ho = Ki Woo, Hollywood = Park family."
PARASITE,13 April 2020,5/10,"I don't like this movie not because I hate subtitles, am racist or bigoted, but simply because I don't regard this movie as that good."
PARASITE,11 May 2020,9/10,"Objective as i could get, this one really had everything right for me. i even watched it at the right time even if it was too late but i think it was worth it. i loved every frame of it and it delivered its message in the best way it could. dark comedy is one of my favorite genres and this further solidified it's position and worth in my opinion. i'm not a movie critic, i enjoy them. everyone in its own. so i really don't have the dictionary or the knowledge to throw big words, all i have is my feelings and they were obvious. thank you bong joon-ho for the experience. it was the best i've had in a long time."
PARASITE,15 April 2020,8/10,"Best korean movie and one of best movie i see in 2019, my favorit movie by bong jo ho"
PARASITE,22 April 2020,10/10,I am out of words. THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL! What a masterpiece. This made me laugh and shock with the series of happenings.
PARASITE,16 April 2020,9/10,"The movie was really amazing but the plot twist wasn't the surprising, though."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,10/10,Incredible twist that leaves you in disbelief. Must watch
PARASITE,16 April 2020,10/10,Parasite is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I feel like I could turn off the sound on my TV and just watch everything visually unfold. Everything from the camera's perspective is just beautiful.
PARASITE,17 April 2020,1/10,"What a boring movie. I can't believe there are some people who like it. And it got an Oscar, joke."
PARASITE,24 April 2020,9/10,It seems like everything that's needed to be said about Parasite has already been said. Fantastic movie that can be taken at surface level or read into. The tension and suspense builds up to levels I have seen in few other movies. It stays with you.

Film Rating-8.5/10This is such a good movie. After hearing so much buzz about this film at the Oscars, somehow I still had no idea what the movie was about going into it.A great moment for Korean cinema and an extremely thought provoking film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.
If you want to be told a story, but without too much detail upfront that would give it all away, sit down for this one.Boong Joon Ho directs this Oscar winning movie about the disreputable behaviour of a Korean family who infiltrate the home and lives of a wealthy couple by gradually taking over the roles of domestic helpers.The Parks family is the opposite of all of this.Naive,not so much - probably just out of touch with the real world. The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed.The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened.
The actors were great, the plot was super strong, and I can't say enough good things about how beautiful this film is just to look at.Though I really did enjoy the film, I personally, didn't think this deserved the Oscar win for best movie as although a strong and powerful tale, for me, there were better films in the preceding year. I also do not think this is the best of Boong Joon Ho's movies. However, the fact that it did win is to be applauded as a massive step forward in the recognition that there are movies made outside Hollywood.
It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the real world, the destination is always uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.
Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them.Taking everything into account,Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece."
PARASITE,21 April 2020,10/10,"I know plenty of people disliked this movie, and understandably so - but I mean every word I say when I claim that this is one of the best movies I've seen. For fans of darker storylines with twists throughout, those who don't mind sitting still for a few hours and reading subtitles to get completely immersed into a story, this movie is a wonderful way to do so."
PARASITE,23 April 2020,10/10,"Fun and exciting movie
Junho Bong is the one of the popular man in korea
I totally trust his movie is always fun"
PARASITE,2 May 2020,9/10,"It's a masterpiece film.Directed by Bong Joon-ho.At the first of the movie it will charm you.But the more you go ahead the more It's mystery will shock you.The direction of ""Bong Joon-ho"" is very typical.If you once see this movie you can understand what type of Director ""Bong Joon-ho"" is!"
PARASITE,25 April 2020,5/10,"Amazing show. Keep it up this way
My fav decades are my past decades."
PARASITE,28 April 2020,8/10,"Winner of four Oscars, Palme d'Or 2019 and Best Foreign Motion Picture at the Golden Globes, Parasite boldly attempts satire about Seoul's haves and have-nots.The South Korean film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay. It has also made cinema history by becoming the first foreign language film to win Best Picture
Parasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits - a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants."
PARASITE,6 May 2020,9/10,"It was amazing!!!
a movie that molded con artistry/heist vibes, comedy, horror, suspense, psychological, and horror into a striking cinematic experience that can't be replicated. The only reason I didn't give a ten was I wish the ending was different but that's a personal opinion. full respect to the director, marvelous movie."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,"Now, what is there in the movie that gave it an Oscar? So the answer is its powerful but realistic concept. A difference that has spread among humans for centuries. I am rich you are poor, I will always be a master and you will always be a servant. Every time you watch the parasite, you will get a new perspective in the story. This is one of those films that you cannot understand very well at once. The ending of the movie has been cleverly presented so that every human can understand it with his thought. The direction of the movie is so vicious that you try to mind each of the senses of the movie, even then you will be forced to give up. The movie's original language is Korean, but despite this, people around the world are appreciating it."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,It is a masterpiece movie. In the movie we see the difference classes in society and the behavior of the people of this society. One class people straggling for some food and other class has it even much than their need. Most of the thing of this movie we can compare with our real life. Really like this movie.
PARASITE,29 April 2020,9/10,"Drama and exciting movie. The situation Turning situation, comedy"
PARASITE,2 May 2020,1/10,"I see this movie get a high rate and has a high hope. At first I though this would be a copycat of Japanese manga with same titles lol. So I watch the trailer and not impress at all. One day my brother play the movie and I though I give it a try. But after the first half hour I suprise is this a high rate movie ?? I can't stand to watch it. I still curious by the rates (but didn't stand to watch it) so read the synopsys with spoiler instead.. And (sorry), at the end I'm thinking isn't this should be categorized as a very low rate comedy-thriller movie? What an exaggerated ratings."
PARASITE,9 March 2021,10/10,"One of my favorite films is ""Parasite"". Despite the fact the film's plot reflects social inequality, it is presented straightforwardly and simply. Throughout the story, the film asks us to ask questions in our heads. More than that, it is excellent in terms of production. Every point of view, color grading, and sound effects are meaningful and exciting, drawing the audience even deeper into the film. Overall, it's still a fantastic film with a great script. To make it more understandable, the film concerns heavy topics like class and social inequality. The audience can answer the question at the end of the story that the villain of the story is not poor or the rich, but social inequality, which causes people to be villains."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,5/10,"Interesting plot, held my attention throughout most of the movie, although rather long. didn't care for the excessive violence. not sure it was oscar worthy."
PARASITE,7 May 2020,5/10,"Visually it was amazing, a korean film with international appeal made it fun to see.. but thats it! I was expecting a deep dive psychological thriller and got confused along the way with the message it was trying to relay to the viewer... how can others say this was some deep discussion on class differences when the poor cant fold boxes, are con artists and liars, and the rich are a well off family that work hard and care for each other, whose only crime was having a bad smell problem... its not riveting, its weak. There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities. This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for, rich or poor... who are you supposed to root for? Definitely not the poor con artists, and if thats done on purpose it shows a tremendous pretentiousness.
Its an average well done movie, receiving high praise because it was korean made... ive seen better in the last 10 years.
By all means, watch it though."
PARASITE,9 May 2020,9/10,"Combining effective thriller elements with a biting commentary on social disparity, I challenge you to point out an element of this film that feels out of place. Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively."
PARASITE,12 May 2020,4/10,"This movie just wasted over two hours of my precious life. I would rather stick cacti in my eyes than re-watch this horrible film. It had an interesting beginning but in the middle of the movie it made me realize that it was going nowhere. On top of that, the ending was just stupid. If you value your life, you won't waste time on this movie."
PARASITE,13 May 2020,10/10,One of the best flim i have ever seen.Truly recommended to see the flim everyon.
PARASITE,29 May 2020,6/10,The story is not intriguing. I would not recommend this to my friends and family. overated and didn't deserve oscar at all.
PARASITE,17 May 2020,10/10,"This one is a masterpiece. It will make you laugh sometimes, it will chill you sometimes, and it will make you cry sometimes. This movie will be with to the end"
PARASITE,18 May 2020,10/10,"Fav movie of the year. Consistent and contrasting, heartbreaking and breathtaking, beautiful yet ugly, morality and mentality. Just love every frame of the movie. Stunning. Speechless."
PARASITE,10 June 2020,10/10,A great movie with mindblowing ending. very recommended!
PARASITE,26 May 2020,10/10,Best movie I've ever seen. The story is dark but the meanings are deep. The most of the scene was memorable.
PARASITE,1 June 2020,10/10,"This is a remarkable film of the century which depicts many social issues we confront everyday such as class system, racism, global warming, gap between the rich and the poor and discrimination against poverty along many other social issues that we face everyday. Director Bong Joon-Ho has dealt with various topics as such in his previous films yet this film has the best story telling and cinematography as seen. This film deserves global attention not just for film lovers but for all in which we can all relate one way or another to criticise what needs attention and correction in our society. Recommend to all genre of movie lovers as this has hints of humour, comedy, action as well as drama."
PARASITE,2 June 2020,9/10,I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards! A MUST WATCH!
PARASITE,4 June 2020,9/10,"Incredible movie about differences between social classes, but in a very unusual way."
PARASITE,22 July 2020,10/10,A true masterpiece. first time i saw it as soon as it finished i rewatched it again. loved everything about it the director is a genius.
PARASITE,10 June 2020,9/10,"A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying ""wow""."
PARASITE,14 June 2020,5/10,"I didn't see anything special about this movie. It wasn't unique, mind provoking, mind blowing or anything special. I feel I've seen several similar movies in the past. I think if you keep everything the same except for the language, setting and subtitles (American made) then this movie would have been just another, 'it was okay', movie."
PARASITE,15 June 2020,1/10,Rly bed movie I sleeped when my friends watched it
PARASITE,4 December 2020,10/10,"From the beginning to the end, the film feels fluid and just perfect in its way. The Crew did an awesome job.
One of the best Oscar winners of all time!"
PARASITE,22 June 2020,10/10,The best movie ever! Unexpected twist. Great actors. Great storyline. Amazing movie!
PARASITE,4 July 2020,3/10,"The movie does not establish humanistic values, depicting disgusting human sins.
The Korean entourage makes it even more repulsive.
I'm not sure why such a poor movie received so many high praises."
PARASITE,16 July 2020,10/10,"Parasite is one of the greatest films of the last decade and maybe of all time, but it's sure that it's the greatest international feature film of all time"
PARASITE,22 July 2020,10/10,I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'.
PARASITE,31 December 2020,7/10,"Despite the positive reviews of the film critics, it didn't inspire me much. Honestly, after watching it, it was hard for me to imagine how this film won Oscar and other awards. Both in terms of technical aspects, as well as the characterization and the way the story was told, I believe it was an ordinary film. Therefore, I would give it 60 out of 100. The only thing I liked was the story itself and its message for the audience, regardless of attention to professionalism in storytelling. During the film, I was waiting for a scene passionate and influential but I couldn't get it. However, I suggest you watch it. It worths doing that. Happy New year 🙂"
PARASITE,24 July 2020,9/10,This movie absorbs its audience form start to finish. Easy to connect with the characters. I strongly recommend watching this to those who have limited time to waste on movies that need nowhere.
PARASITE,28 July 2020,10/10,Wow very interested . I like it very much. I enjoyed it too. Best app I have ever seen. Well contents and features are available here. Really magnificent.
PARASITE,30 July 2020,10/10,"Pure diamond in cinema. Brilliantly made, showing a figurative depiction if the great class divide not only in Korea but around fhe world"
PARASITE,2 August 2020,9/10,"A film living up to the word ""amazing"", from all aspects, bringing up issues like class-divide and showing a plethora of emotions and thoughts throughout the film, like irony, rage, selfish desires.
The whole film revolves around the word ""Parasite"". The film clearly shows how one class leeches off the resources of the other. The poor and financially needy, taking advantage of the wealth of the rich, while the rich leech off the labor of the poor.
A great experience, which gets over the cultural boundaries in a heartbeat. You feel immersed in the narrative, as the story unfolds.
A must watch for all movie fans."
PARASITE,6 August 2020,8/10,"The movie Parasite lifts up to its name as the plot revolves around the Kim family-- a family who lives in a small semi-basement in Korea using different tactics to leech off the Park family-- a well-off family who live in a mansion. The plot of Parasite was attractive, but what I found more appealing are the conflicts created by the gap between the rich and poor.The structure of classism was displayed in the movie in scenes where the audience could see vast physical differences between the Park and Kim family-- the semi-basement that the Kim family live in is shabby, wet, and has little light, and the mansion on the hill is sleek, modern, and filled with light. What the Park possess is out of reach for the Kims, but it is also what they dream of eventually having themselves. Despite living a life of privilege, the Parks show no sympathy for the poor. They choose not to see or do anything about the wide divide in classes around them as society allows them to exist in oblivion. There is no blame put upon the upper class for not understanding the hardships of the poor. This oblivion can be seen in the movie after the huge rain storm. The next day, Mrs, Park expresses her satisfaction of the rain bringing blue skies for her son's birthday party. She fails to think about all of the people, such as the Kims, who have lost all of their possessions during the storm. She even has the audacity to make a comment about the smell coming from Mr. Kim as he helps her shop for the party.It is also striking that although the Kim family is poor and dislikes the upper class, they do little to move out of the position that they are in. The Kim family possesses different forms of capital from the beginning, yet they are unwilling to develop the skill sets that they have and move upwards in a way that does not involve lying and deceit. Mrs. Kim is a past champion in hammer throwing, and both the son and daughter are intelligent and resourceful people who have the ability to succeed in school and get stable jobs. Besides, the son and daughter of the Kim family are already on track in terms of collecting more capitals by attending college to be educated and accumulate knowledge. Instead, they deceive the Parks into hiring their whole family, ultimately ending in deaths and pain for both families.There are many metaphors that exist within the movie that illustrate the difference in class and the potential conflicts that exist. The tall stairs between the street levels that the Kim family goes down after sneaking into the Park's house to have a party show the massive gap between the rich and the poor. The places where different families live mark their social status-the Park who belongs to upper-class live on top of a hill; the Kim who is in lower-class live in a semi-basement, and the old housekeeper family who is poorer than the Kim live in an actual basement. In addition, the stone that the Kim family totes around from the beginning of the movie signifies their desire to enter the upper class. However, the placing of the stone back into the river shows lessons learned and the fact that some of the Kim family is finally able to achieve a life of wealth by the end of the movie, but only through hard work and dedication.This movie shows the inevitable conflict in the social structure created by the ignorance of the vast wealth gap, as well as the different social ideologies and forms among different groups of people."
PARASITE,10 August 2020,10/10,"Bong Joon-Ho's epic thriller opened me up to South Korea's expanding film culture.With clever dialogue, detailed set design and edge of your seat moments like I've never seen before, Parasite very much deserved its 4 Oscars it received, including Best Picture."
PARASITE,11 August 2020,10/10,Korean movies are far better than Hollywood. Have you seen the productions they do? They care a little bit more on the quality rather than gaining money doing low budget movies.
PARASITE,21 August 2020,10/10,"I'll be honest, when I first watched Parasite, it was after the Academy Awards and the hype had been around for a while. On first watch, my first watch for me it seemed like an okay movie that seemed messy. On second watch, I thought it was a good movie that had a mediocre script. And on third watch, I thought that it was a really good movie with a decent story. But on fourth watch, I finally understood the hype. Parasite is not only my favorite movie of all time, but I would bet that it is practically flawless. I think it should be up there with the top 10 films of all time. There's the obvious proof of Parasite's excellence with the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature, Best Director, and Best Picture. But I promise this film is much more than a typical Oscar film. It is complex and fun movie that has one of the best screenplays ever written and I'd argue the best direction of any film I've ever seen. Granted, I haven't seen Citizen Kane or The Godfather. If you are someone who appreciates or likes the Oscars, it is an absolute must watch. And if you don't care about the Oscars or awards season, I highly recommend it."
PARASITE,23 November 2020,9/10,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this film. People saying one of the best of the last ten years. And where I'm not sure about that, I'm sure it's a great film. You'd be hard pushed to find a genre for it. As it has a bit of everything. Really recommend giving it a watch. It's available on Prime now, there's also a black and white version that I watched but to be honest doesn't really bring much else to the film. Just felt a little pretentious. I've heard their also planning to remake this in Hollywood. So don't wait for that as we know it'll lose all the charm and subtleness of the original."
PARASITE,20 November 2020,10/10,"The cinematography of this film is fantastic, but the story is the special ingredient here."
PARASITE,1 September 2020,10/10,"The way Bong directed this movie is amazing,no word can describe its details.It shows very aspect of class difference and ungratefulness.This movie to the meaning of class difference to a whole new level.Spoiler:In the movie,we see that the poor family has their toilet in the highest point of their house,this indicates that the poor class people's standard is even lower than the toilet"
PARASITE,3 September 2020,10/10,"As a movie fanatic, I always have a thirst to find that one movie that makes me say ""Oh, so that just happened. I can't believe it went down like that. BUT I LIKED IT!""
And that's exactly how this movie made me feel. There are a few great movies that don't get the recognition they deserve but I'm glad that this one did.
Not only is it a brilliant but MOST IMPORTANTLY a UNIQUE story, which I feel that nowadays is pretty hard to find a movie with these two important concepts.
Director Bong Joon-ho not only created a brilliant story, but also did an amazing work flushing out every single character in this film.
I had the privilege of going in completely blind, in other words not knowing a single thing about this movie when I saw it for the first time. I didn't know what the film was was about, ( which the trailer did a good job of not spoiling ) I didn't know who the director was ( which I later found out that it was the same director who made 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', which are movies that I personally enjoyed watching ) I didn't know any of the actors ( which I think that they did an amazing job with their acting in this film, but I did know who the actor Kang-Ho Song was, seeing him in many other well known movies such as 'The Host' and 'The Drug KIng' ).
I think that Bong Joon-ho did an amazing work with the cinematography and visual storytelling in this film.
I cannot put every single emotion that this movie made me feel into words.
I am happy that this movie did well at the box office, I'm also happy that it has become a universal classic and deserves every praise it gets!GO WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT'S A MUST WATCH!"
PARASITE,5 September 2020,10/10,"It's awesome really awesome
I couldn't think that it will gone so far
Oh god i loved this movie"
PARASITE,20 September 2020,9/10,One of the most amazing movie. Those who don't like they don't know about the inside picture of the movie. great job by team.
PARASITE,9 September 2020,8/10,"Good story good acting
Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho
Absolutely deserve the Oscar
The haters of this movie are the lovers of the garbage movie 🤢 (moonlight)"
PARASITE,11 September 2020,8/10,Definately everyone should watch this movie once in life. a great cinematic narration with great storyline .
PARASITE,15 September 2020,10/10,"I have seen many movies in 2019,but i have to admit,this is by far the most mysterious& beautifully depicted movie of 2019.I found this movie to be equally exciting and edge of the seat kind of movie.I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot.In the second half it was lagging a little bit,but the climax shook me up.Family melodrama, comedy, social commentary ,it has everything.
I was confused of who, exactly, is the parasite: the poverty-stricken family who are living off the rich, or the rich one that reaps the benefits of their hard work.It is a story of the poor, basement-dwelling Kim family,who are living off the rich park family . The park are total opposites.They live in a grand, modernist mansion in a hilly Seoul suburb; The scam takes shape when the Kims' bright young son chances upon a job as a language tutor for the Parks' teenage daughter. He recommends his sister as an 'art therapist' for their son,and says she's a distant, renowned acquaintance, and soon his parents start working as the family driver and housemaid, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the little kid points out that they all smell alike - and they smell of poor people.This really is a horribly fascinating film, brilliantly written.
Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that congeals into hostility.The first half was going on smoothly and building tension about what is going to happen next.The last half unraveled the dark truth of the family.The discovery by the kim family of another family already living at the basement of the park family and their trying to lead the day with luxury, when park family went for a outing.The horrifying behavior of the kim family with the basement dewellers,and at last the murders of the park family in the hands of the kim.It was a heart wrenching and edge of the seat kind movie.I believe anyone who loves thrillers and mystery and yes,some surprises,they would surely love the movie.The filmmaker Bong Joon Ho really knows exactly what he's doing and why he's doing it. It is a remarkably well-edited film.The name is perfect for the movie.The kim family is the parasite,who are like leeches sucking blood off the park family.Technically there are no villains in here.But the kim family are so gory and ferocious.Where as the rich park family can also be termed as parasites as they are dependent on these untrustworthy people for every sort of job.So the villain here is the situation,the capitalist society.A society where there is a huge gap between the income of the rich and the poor.the poor becomes poorer and the rich gets richer.Whatever the kim family did, they did out of outrage,the ignorance of the park;s about the poor kim's.The kim's just wanted to change their fate of poverty.Overall this movie is one of a kind movie of the year 2019.I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
PARASITE,29 June 2021,10/10,"A masterpiece, easily the best movie of the decade in my opinion. The biggest roller-coaster of emotion with greater suspense than any horror film I can think of. The themes of class struggles are also very well portrayed. 10/10."
PARASITE,17 September 2020,9/10,"Parasite is a widely successful South Korean movie that won several Academy Awards and is one of my most favorite movies. This movie belongs to the thriller genre and uses metaphor and symbols to portray a deeper meaning.
Through showing the contrast between the lifestyle of the rich and the poor, the movie portrayed how different the world is for different people. Although the end of the movie has a very tragic and somewhat gory vibe, the start of the movie was like that of a dark comedy show. In the movie, there was an ambitious poor household, the Kim family, who were with no jobs. There were 4 members in the family and all of them were clever charlatans. As the movie progressed it was seen that all of the members got jobs in a very wealthy family by using tricks. To get the jobs they had to fire the previous workers. Through deceit, they made the house owners, the Park family, fire all their previous workers. At this point, the movie turns a little dark and strange. It was seen that the previous caretaker of the house was also in extreme need of the job and upon learning the deceit of the Kim family, hoped to gain access to the house by blackmailing the Kim family. Both parties fought for the job and ultimately killed the previous caretaker. Then the movie turned even bleaker when Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park due to his lack of empathy for the poor.
What makes this movie such a masterpiece is the apt naming. The name parasite refers to the hierarchy of the society and its living conditions. The poor must rely on the rich for their existence in our current world. They must serve the rich. But the poor must fight amongst themselves to get the opportunity to serve the self-absorbed rich. Even then they remain unseen, the society does not share in their joy, nor does it flinch in their misery. In the movie, there was a scene in which the Kim family lost their home due to heavy rainfall. It was a matter of absolute devastation for them. But the rich Park family called the rain a blessing as the weather after the rain was very soothing. This portrays how different reality is for people of different classes. In the movie, there was a scene where a man killed the daughter of Mr. Kim in front of Mr. Park. But all Mr. Park did was ask for the car keys so he can leave the danger zone with his family. Mr. Park did not care that Mr. Kim's daughter died. There were many more scenes in the movie which showed how little the poor means to the rich and how brutally the poor must fight to find the opportunity to serve the rich."
PARASITE,8 July 2021,10/10,"I mean, what else could you really ask for? The film does so many things right, sorry, it does everything right and for that reason it's a masterpiece. Like, how the hell did anyone not expect this film to win Best Picture at the Oscars."
PARASITE,17 September 2020,9/10,"Parasite 2019 is a movie about a poor family's tragedy who wanted to live a better life than they have but ended up far worse than they already were. This great movie showed struggle, cunningness of people, lives of poor and rich people, poor people's cravings for a better life, desperation, rich people's view toward poor people and much more. The director of the movie Bong Joon-ho was able to show exactly what he wanted in the movie. This movie earned a lot of awards such as academy award for best picture, academy award for best writing, academy award for best directing etc.
Parasite tells the story of two inverse families: the Parks and the Kims. The Kim family work low paying jobs while barely living above ground. The Park family has everything readily available and they live in a beautiful, bright, modern contemporary home. The poor family lived in a slum and lived their life by creating packs for products. Then fortune came with a bottle of alcohol and his friend who told him to teach a rich family's daughter English language because he was very good in it. Then ki hoo gave the rich family's son an art teacher who was none other than his own sister Ki-jeong. But the Park family were unaware of it. Through his sister the rich family selected the father of the poor family Dong-ik as their driver. Also he cunningly made his wife their house worker. All of this happened and the rich family had no idea about it. This showed how fortunate and cunning people can be.
Later in the movie while the Parks went on a vacation the Kim family came into the house and was partying but they were caught up in a bad situation. They found out that previous house worker was keeping his husband in a secret bunker of the house. Later the previous houseworker Moon-gwang found out what the kim family did so they decided to imprison them in that room and they did. But while doing it the previous house worker died in front of his husband. After that we can see that Mr Kim's home was flooded and the desperation they were in. At the last scene of the movie we can see that Geun-sae the husband of the previous house worker Moon-gwang went on a rampage and stabed Mr Kim's daughter. Mr kim managed to kill Geun-sae and demanded to Mr park to give him the keys to the car so he can take his daughter to the hospital. But Mr park makes a face of disgust at Geun-sae's smell and it triggerss Mr kim. He fatally stabs Mr Park and then runs out of the party. But he didn't actually escaped, he took Geun-sae place which was discovered by his son later who made a promise to himself to to work hard, make a bunch of money, and buy the house, allowing his father to finally roam free again. The final scene of Parasite fades away from Mr kim's sons fantasy to reveal him still in the Kim family's original barely-above-ground apartment.
The story was different. Poor people always crave for a better life, but here they cheated their way to a better life. But god won't accept it and that's what the writer wanted to show. If one resort to cheating and deceiving it will only end more badly. Also we can't only dream about a great future. We have to work on it. People can get a reminder of it after watching this movie."
PARASITE,3 October 2020,1/10,"Overhyped, nothing great to watch.. It is Common story of society."
PARASITE,13 October 2020,7/10,"It's a nice movie overall. I personally like this type of movie; it has the elements that I like, e.g. the contrast between the poor and the rich- their different living conditions and lifestyles. However, I would like to see more locations rather than just between the two places where the two families live. I would also like to see more interactions between those in the underground hiding and those living in the house, something like The Hidden Face, with more suspense and a better twist."
PARASITE,29 September 2020,10/10,"This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. It was full of hidden messages and had a clever message over all, would recommend."
PARASITE,1 October 2020,10/10,Super movie of all time in the day of corona.this movie is having a good storyline also have some great amazing scane that make us totally amazed.
PARASITE,15 November 2020,6/10,It is ok and I would say watch it but don't understand the whole hype in the media. If at all I would prise the script...
PARASITE,25 October 2020,4/10,"I am really confused by the hype regarding this film. Its an ok film but there is nothing special about a story of rich people living in a bubble and not connecting to the harsh realities of the Poor. So this film was judged to be better than 1917, joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the Irishman. It had long periods of boring non engaging dialogue and for sure soon will be forgotten ."
PARASITE,25 October 2020,8/10,"At first glance you think this is going to be terrible. The acting is sooo bad. The rich guy walks with his head high, chest puffed up, almost like an animated character while the poor characters are crawling, bend over like Quasimodos ... It's way to much even for a slapstick comedy. It's sort of like GOT, once you discover that everyone on screen is acting really pourly you accept it, and go along with the story. And what a great story. A few minor plotholes but it doesn't matter. The cinematography and set design makes it all worth the while. Definitely watchable.********"
PARASITE,26 October 2020,10/10,"Best movie i had ever watched.Good Concept 😇
I like the way they potrai their roles quite Excellent"
PARASITE,7 November 2020,10/10,If you give this any less than 10/10 you have missed something and need to watch it again.
PARASITE,24 April 2020,10/10,"Why is this movie a masterpiece? Why did it become the first non-English-language Oscar-winning film? Why is it ideologically universal and international?
The poor slaves of North Korea evoke sympathy. The poor of South Korea at first - too. Until impunity and the prosperity that fell on their heads made them pigs, monsters, parasites that can't stop from greed. But what spoils their ""raspberry""? A sudden spark of sympathy that had been awakened in the new housekeeper's heart for the old, drenched, ill, and undeservedly turned out of the house and work - for the ex-housekeeper who had come to feed her husband. He lives in complete isolation, in prison-like the North Koreans, but, temporarily gaining the upper hand, they begin to mock the exposed family and, at the same time, Kim Jong-Un. Or the moment when the driver (for some reason?) he kills his master and the young entrepreneur just before he dies suddenly says: ""I recognized you!» (that's why!). North and South Koreans - both rich and poor-suddenly become so similar! What's it? National Korean mentality? Unlikely. So you think: the USSR and modern Russia, slave-owning America and modern superpower, Nazi Germany and the modern locomotive of the European Union-are they not mirror images? In the sense that on the other side of the mirror glass - they are the same, simply inverted.
Money didn't make rich people happy. They become indifferent and blind to someone else's misfortune, but turn into such blind suckers that it is easy to trick them around your finger.
Family values (""banana"" for a hungry husband) are beautiful, but their absolutization makes people sectarian, shackles them with a series of crimes in the yoke of circular bail.
In the age of technology, miracles happen when you suspect that all the teachers (a couple of phrases in English and OK), doctors (who put on a white coat becomes the doctor), lawyers (observe the formalities and enjoy yourself) + photoshop, arrogance and skill - all these professionals are just as fake as, for example, a housewife (I don't know what it is - I'll cook it according to the instructions on the label), not to mention art therapists (surf the Internet and that'll do), coaches, psychologists and other shamans.
Everyone plays, lies, pretends to believe, or wants to believe, but everyone follows the rules of the game. Until something happens that violates these rules: the spark of empathy I was talking about; an ancient stone (""it's so metaphorical!"") that is supposed to bring material well-being, and then slips out of your hands at the most inopportune moment and breaks the conspiracy, and that the hero can't tear away from himself. The smell of a basement that you can't get rid of. The flood is a natural disaster that you expect, but it always comes unexpectedly.
And the film turned out to be light. It talks about values that people neglect, but which nevertheless remind them of themselves in symbols: nature (flood), ancient traditions (stone), belonging to one's social class (smell), family relations (the banana, playing Indians), sympathy (helping a person who got wet in the rain).
A sure sign of a real work of art is motivation, non-randomness of EVERY DETAIL, which creates a harmonious ambivalence of art."
PARASITE,30 July 2021,10/10,Parasite is the story of a two family.Show us the conflict in the society.
PARASITE,26 October 2021,10/10,Terrific film. My girlfriend and I watched this with no idea of what the plot or sentiment was. The subtitles were an adjustment initially but the film was very much worth the time that it took us to adjust. I highly recommend Parasite for anyone who loves an attention grabbing film.
PARASITE,11 August 2021,8/10,This movie tell us a story about a class struggle in South Korea. I like the plot twist.
PARASITE,21 November 2020,10/10,"Absolute masterpiece, soundtrack, cinematography simply amazing. The twist of the movie caught me by surprise. Just an amazing experience."
PARASITE,25 November 2020,,"I really like it. It is one of our favorite movies of the year, it is the top 3 !! As a film that received the Golden Palm Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.This is an award-winning movie. But it is one very easy movie Because the film communicates directly from the title Parasite or the chic Thai title ""parasite "", it is clear that the film plays the issue of the differences of ""class"" in society, it is not difficult to understand for anyone who is afraid to It is not fun to watch because the picture is difficult to remember the award movie. You can still watch with peace of mind, because even if we don't care about any issues, you can still enjoy the movie."
PARASITE,12 December 2020,10/10,"Every aspect that makes a ""great"" movie, this film has. I could not find a fault, no matter how hard I tried. ""Perfection""."
PARASITE,21 December 2020,10/10,"This film brought me into a different world. Such an intriguing story, like a Molier comedy at the bigining but in the end, the truth is more like a Seneca Horror Theatre.
I like it very much."
PARASITE,25 December 2020,9/10,"I love this film, the soundtrack is great, the themes and story line are very smartly written. I love the acting in this film, they make the scenes so tense! a great thriller film."
PARASITE,26 December 2020,10/10,"This film has opened my eyes to so much more foreign film. I already enjoyed a lot of Russian film and the odd Anime, but this film was really a masterpiece. You won't regret watching it. If on Amazon prime, don't turn subtitles on thinking that's how it works, you have to have them off for the subtitles to appear. It took me a moment to figure that out."
PARASITE,1 January 2021,10/10,Parasite is amazing not the just the story or the acting the whole direction and camera work and the added thriller it the only movie i have seen which has so many genres mixed it movie to be watched at least once by everybody it is stellar
PARASITE,1 January 2021,8/10,"I like this movie but the ending, everything is mix up for me.
i just doesn't like the last one, that's all
but i 100% recommended it though ...."
PARASITE,2 January 2021,10/10,"Unpredictable. Real & Entertaining. The emotions, dialogues are very well connected to the every human mind.
Must watched movie"
PARASITE,25 April 2021,1/10,"This movie is surely a masterpiece in testing the viewers' patience, it reflects some usual ambiences going on between two families.Keeping acting apart, this movie really falls short of its greatness. I mean you can win audiences heart by just acting well, there's a need of content to fulfil, without the content you can't even perform, that how it goes with this movie. After seeing many positive reviews, I think that this movie is just a disquieting exception."
PARASITE,19 January 2021,10/10,Best movie for greedy people. One should not so greedy that after sometime he fall down on his own net.
PARASITE,7 February 2021,8/10,"I absolutely loved it. The twist at the end and how it ended really made it surprised. After a promising start, the film changes into a simplistic, cliche-ridden, predictable mess, filled with the graphic violence that's out of strictness of contemporary films."
PARASITE,14 February 2021,10/10,"I can undoubtedly say Parasite was one of the most touching movies I have watched. I was not expecting a foreign language, occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much. Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But, every element of this movie was so well put together together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink. The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning, but it wasn't too far out of sight either. The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience. Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us.
This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society. The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood. Their son is taking over a friend's job to teach English in a very wealthy house. The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them, from cook to chauffeur. The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller, drama and eventually a bit horror.
The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about. It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don't see. The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us. We are all living in one place, but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition. This is a society where one family is thrilled to see the rain and the other is seeking shelter because the overflooded rain has ruined their basement.
If you want an eye-opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world, then this is the movie for you. It makes you wonder of what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea? It gives you insights of rarely discussed struggles in societies that doesn't care much about the poor. I don't want to spoil it more than I did already, but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people. What one might do to reach the top? How much this gap between classes put pressure on lower classes? This movie has brilliantly pictured the answer to these questions. I myself have watched this a few times and with a group of people, it is a great movie for conversations! I believe Parasite unquestionably deserved the four Oscars it received including the best picture for the first time ever for a foreign movie."
PARASITE,5 February 2021,10/10,This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.
PARASITE,2 March 2021,9/10,"This movie has a little bit for everyone that I think makes this a good watch for anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. Personally, I actually enjoy using subtitles but my friends who don't regularly like them and were skeptical about watching a foreign film loved it as well. It's satirical, dark, at times it is heartbreaking, and at others it is thrilling. This movie works in key details like a magician doing a trick right under your nose. We still must give this film time to age but I must say that in my opinion it is one of the best films of the definitely past few years. The one thing that holds back this movie is an ending that isn't bad but leaves a bit to be desired."
PARASITE,15 February 2021,7/10,"Had to see what everyone was raving about and that it won best picture. Started ok but became tedious very quickly. No subplots, gave impression of gullible rich. Lacking imagination and poor ending. Yep it was okish"
PARASITE,18 February 2021,9/10,"It's rare for a movie to combine cinematic fireworks and social commentary in the thrilling way that Korean director Bong Joon-ho manages with 'Parasite', a slick home-invasion drama that mirrors the masks worn by its characters: polite until they drop the pretence. The director of 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer' is no stranger to genre gymnastics, and here he tells the story of a poor Seoul family infiltrating the lives of a super-rich household through suspense, drama, laughs and farce, allowing moments of pure terror, quiet observation and baroque noise to sit happily alongside each other. It never jars as it glides from one state of being to the next.
The appeal of 'Parasite' is simple and age-old: inequality, class, manners and how we behave to protect what's ours, or to gain that which we believe should be ours."
PARASITE,22 February 2021,8/10,"The idea of the film is perfect, action is good, storyline is clean, only what is missing is a little bit more of action in film, by that I mean more intrigue etc."
PARASITE,23 February 2021,1/10,"Didn't even know why this movie is so overrated,
Fell asleep watching this."
PARASITE,24 February 2021,9/10,Goood blalalalallalalalallalalalhsjsnsn I seeeee youuuuu
PARASITE,1 April 2021,7/10,This movie is not so good. Because it is too loud. But it is thrilling until the design collapse. Perhaps one of the causes of I don't like this movie is I don't like Korean movies. Even so I think the house's design is nice.
PARASITE,5 March 2021,9/10,"""Parasite"" is one of my favorite movies. Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real ""parasite class""? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more.
In the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain."
PARASITE,2 March 2021,9/10,"This film left me on the edge of my seat, fascinated throughout it's running time. The effort and genius poured into Parasite astounded me with every, single, shot. It does everything it sets out to do and more. I'm intentionally not giving specifics because you owe it to yourself to see this film as blind as possible. Then again, even if you know every story beat the execution on it's own is more than enough to earn multiple viewings. It doesn't take detailed analysis or film expertise to love this movie, but there's so many more layers to dissect if you seek them out. Just watch it, Parasite is a damn near masterpiece, and no matter your taste you will find a lot to appreciate."
PARASITE,3 March 2021,3/10,"I had such high hopes for this movie after I started watching it - it seemed like a brilliant drama-comedy highlighting the problems with class differences. But about 2/3 through the movie, I started asking myself... Is that it?
I've watched several videos and read reviews explaining the ending, but it still seems like really bad writing to me. I feel like extreme violence is used as a poorly applied trope in this movie to highlight the point but it just doesn't work. It doesn't fit the story. It seems like a desperate attempt to add a shocking ending and ends up seeming like a pretentious interpretation."
PARASITE,9 March 2021,9/10,"From my point of view, I love how the movie tell the story, it doesn't make me feel confuse a lot, but it has some. I love when I movie pull me in the movie feeling, I have many emotional during the movie show, some part was heartbreak, and some was suspenseful. This movie can reflect what really happen in South Korea society, but I trust it doesn't have only in South Korea. This movie can makes other know more about poor person that we might unforeseen. After I watched, I ask myself who is the real parasite poor person or the rich one or everyone is parasite. This movie has a lot of small detail such as speech, action such as in a gag it also has some real situation which is bad joke in their life too but when they play joke it makes me laugh too. Not only details in the action but the scene has a lot of small details too such as tone of movie, sound, and camera angle such as the divide line in the movie that always divide between rich person and poor person. I trust that everyone works really hard to make this movie, performer can do good perform and script writer can write really good script too. But I give 9/10 because some scene it's a bit hard to understand such as about the person who is maybe the old mate's family, I confuse in their relationship how they come and why he is here. May be I miss some part of the movie."
PARASITE,12 March 2021,9/10,"This movie is about two families living in the same town, the Park family and Kim family, that has a lot of differences such as dweller and residence, status, opportunity, and more. Then ""Min Hyuk""; Ki Woo (older brother of Kim family)'s friend gives a present ""viewing stone"" and an opportunity to Ki Woo to work as an English tutor for the Park family then Ki Woo make a plan that the entire Kim family can infiltrate the Park's home. The plot twisted when the old housekeeper returns to Park's home while they make a camping trip and Kim family takes over this home, only she knew about the basement under the kitchen and she hides his husband in this basement without anyone know. And the breaking point of this movie comes from the anger of the Father of Kim family that makes him kill Mr. Park because Mr. Park is talked about their family as not equality and the smell of people that use subway train; That is the inescapable poverty and the meaning of poor people.
You can understand the message of the movie just the bad people got punished at the end but there is symbolism in the movie. It is the story of capitalism and reflects the social inequality problem in the present that makes people struggle from poverty. The ladder that shows in the movie is about social class, the rich family is living above the hill but the poor family living underneath such as the semi-basement house that has a small window for them. The raining screen, Kim family that live underneath flooded with sewer water but Park family just think that the fair weather will come and they can celebrate for their son's birthday."
PARASITE,21 March 2021,10/10,Brilliant movie i ever watch makes my breath goes away !!!
PARASITE,15 April 2021,9/10,"The movie is well conducted and deserves the cannne nomination, the accesories the choice of actors, all the visuals and sounds create the story telling style of the movie , hats off for the director , the DOP and all the crew."
PARASITE,27 March 2021,10/10,"Great movie, and for those that think this isn't a masterpiece, well, they don't know movies or maybe it's the subtitles. I think it was a brilliant movie that leaves you thinking about it for hours afterwords. Get past the subtitles and fall into a new world..."
PARASITE,2 April 2021,9/10,"The incredible story orchestrated throughout this film was breathtaking. The shifts in tone done just so so perfectly. The portrayal of the upper and lower class divides are so cleverly done, any doubt i had about this movie before watching it about it's quality then i can't remember them. The only reason it isn't 10/10 is that it's not the cat in the hat by doctor suess."
PARASITE,10 April 2021,10/10,"This movie is so metaphorical.His is a simple yet unheard-of story! Really nice ! Congratulations to the film director, artists, everyone. We want to see such real stories of class division repeatedly."
PARASITE,21 April 2021,10/10,That ending was so crazy. Great film with lots of suspense.
PARASITE,15 August 2021,5/10,Very over rated. I watched this movie because of its good reviews. Wasn't as good as it was rated.
PARASITE,3 May 2021,10/10,This movie is must watch for everyone. If you never seen a Korean movie still go watch it. The Direction of this movie is so good. This movie is filled with many indirect references to the Society.
PARASITE,10 May 2021,7/10,This movie fantastically describe about the financial gap between rich and poor people and their emotions their needs.
PARASITE,16 May 2021,9/10,Amazing story plot with thrilling scenes.The characters were so beautifully matched.
PARASITE,20 November 2021,9/10,"Very original, engaging, superb in every segment be it script,story,acting,camera,background music..in short must watch n definitely not to be missed movie."
PARASITE,18 May 2021,10/10,What a phenomenal film! This is an amazing one! One ofe. Thebest tottally recomend it.
PARASITE,3 June 2021,6/10,"After all the hype I came away from this film terribly disappointed. I gave it 6/10 because the beginning captured me, then sadly the whole plot got lost in the brutality. I have seen better films about Rich and Poor come out of South Korea. Sadly this is not one of them.The story lacked good direction, and logic. It felt like the writers were struggling with the whole flow of the plot. Not something I could recommend as a must see."
PARASITE,22 May 2021,10/10,"I would have thought that parasite might have been overhyped like the reviews were telling me, particularly after the best picture win, but somehow it managed to overcome all that. What a brilliant vision Bong Joon Ho has, his sly socio economic commentary mixed in with humour, thriller and tragedy. This film feels almost impenetrable, because it's so well crafted and held together, masterfully created from a technical standpoint but it's refreshingly accessible to pretty much any audience. I don't like using the word masterpiece a lot, but in my mind, this is one of them. Films like Parasite remind me of why I love films. Absolutely recommend."
PARASITE,25 May 2021,6/10,It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.
PARASITE,27 May 2021,8/10,"Parasite is a film capable of accompanying you in the narration halfway, hand by hand making you amazed and sometimes laugh at the situations that the family devises, then all of a sudden, the hand that accompanied you on that journey gives you a loud slap. And plunges you into an even more paradoxical situation, in which hatred and fear (which for the entire film remain slightly below the surface) take over, until the last scene that makes you understand the profound dramatic condition in which the family will have to live for years to come."
PARASITE,28 May 2021,10/10,"Masterpiece best korian movie ever 10/10
And call and forgotten this 3 movies is the best 3korian movies."
PARASITE,3 June 2021,10/10,"Parasite is a movie that hits you like a shock with its twist in the story.The movie starts with a lower class family and as we progress on we are introduced to a upper class family which is directly opposite in many way to the lower class family.This movie is an extraordinary piece of work. Everything from direction,writing,screenplay,production and performances of actors are amzing.I highly recommend this movie to everybody.A review by Jayesh Kumar.Date - 25/05/21."
PARASITE,20 June 2021,10/10,This says a lot about society.That's all I have to say.
PARASITE,13 September 2021,10/10,"This film does everything well, the way it is written generates one of the best rhythms that I have seen in a film of this magnitude, the plot is built in such an interesting way that at all times you are aware of what is going to happen or in tension of key moments in history. The construction of the characters is very well defined in both families, with realistic personalities and behaviors, about the direction and script of Bong Joon-ho is magnificent and is evidenced in the final result with the subtext before the criticism of classism and clearly the title of the work where the parasites are reflected in both extremes, both the Park that benefit from the workforce of the Kim, and the families of less resources that benefit from the wealth of the Park family, both the Kim family and the people who were hiding in the bunker. The production design is also perfect to favor the concept of the film, building the first floor of the main home from scratch or using the stairs as a metaphorical narrative resource. Ending with cinematography, the photographic direction seems incredible to me and in addition to being of high quality, it is connected with the general concept of the division of social classes simply accompanied by visual resources such as literal lines or the simple fact of raising or lowering levels , at the narrative and literary level it is also complete to generate a true impact with events such as the deaths and dreams of families, in general I believe that this film will revolutionize the artistic level of other productions with so much acting, technical and directing talent, it is a example of South Korea to the world."
PARASITE,20 July 2021,7/10,Wasn't really horror or creepy more like comedy / drama.
PARASITE,14 June 2021,10/10,Stunningly beautiful. Narratively strong. A must see production. The Director breaths cinema to the project.
PARASITE,17 June 2021,10/10,"Parasite is a well crafted movie which grips the audience and push them deeper into the plot and shakes them in a manner they couldn't imagine. The movie is both entertaining and deep thinking. The message of the movie is quite well depicted almost every scene. The class difference is wonderfully shown whether by the steep stairs of the society or that of the basement. The best part about the film is that if you want to watch it just for entertainment you have it. If you want to think deep , you have it. If you want to get thrilled, you have it. The screenplay is exceptional as well as the background score. The characters are vibrant and contrasting. The film will leave you emotional despite being a thriller-comedy. If this isn't a masterpiece then there's no masterpiece. This movie is a sure 10/10."
PARASITE,20 June 2021,5/10,"This movie was well acted, with a unquie plot. It included pieces of well done comedy but should be considered more like a drama. The characters were believable up till they were impersonating roles that were unfamilar to them. But the movie would have done well to end at the halfway point when the house owners returned. It could have had a nice wrap up while illuminating the theme of the story. However the writer went off the deep end and turned it into a slasher movie , which I did not appreciate and felt that it greatly detracted from the movie's theme."
PARASITE,25 June 2021,10/10,"This is very amazing movie...fun.thriller,sadness is there in overall movie..This is well written and well performed original film. The naretive and the actors were excellent . Parasite has made me think more than most films i have seen. They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be greatful about it too!Give it watch , see it with friends or family Members... you'll enjoy this movie a lot."
PARASITE,28 June 2021,10/10,"It was so unpredictable, such a twist, so off the rails into the stratosphere, it's just - wow. Utterly a roller-coaster.I never would have expected something like this from a Korean movie - it's just not how they usually feel to me, it's more something like Seth MacFarlane does in his Family Guy or American Dad.It's serious, meaningful, so alive, and so tragic, so heart-breaking and so terrifying. And in the same time kinda light and funny. It never an overdose of either emotion, it's just enough to enjoy their somewhat sharp sensation. I just usually like those things, and this one is perfectly done, perfectly balanced, spiced and fresh."
PARASITE,10 July 2021,9/10,Movie did not have a bad storyline which kept me interested and also the way the scenes look felt like I was watching from there. The drama really begins at the end but it was worth watching it.
PARASITE,2 May 2020,6/10,"Rich people bad. Poor people good. This movie was Marxist trash. Not one character was likable, but the ""protagonists"" were particularly reprehensible in that they lacked character or any sense decency and morality. Inept and unable to fold a simple pizza box, but certain they were entitled to what those who worked harder had achieved. What incensed me was that I was left with the feeling that I was supposed to feel sorry for these creeps? Seriously? I say this as a liberal who happens to believe in capitalism (gasp). I'm giving it 6 stars because of the pace and cinematography, but the message of the film was garbage."
PARASITE,29 July 2021,10/10,Great movie from a great director. After whatching the movie; it is highly recommended to read about different symbols and things used in the movie so that it can be understood better.
PARASITE,22 July 2021,10/10,"I would have to say this is one of the best movies I have watched. Not only is the cinematography on point, but the storyline and the messages embedded into the film was apparent and very fun to dissect."
PARASITE,2 October 2021,10/10,Nothing much....a pure sign of deep art. An amazing artistic pattern that will leave you speechless..
PARASITE,7 August 2021,10/10,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and my heart was racing in every scene. It has elements of all genres from comedy, suspense and thriller. After the movie ended I was speechless, it even brought me to tears and I still don't know why. The director successfully makes the viewers feel like they are part of the movie but also gets a message across about the standards of living for lower class Koreans. I had never heard of this director but after seeing Paradite, I'll be sure to check out his other movies!"
PARASITE,19 August 2021,1/10,This is a movie with no story!!! I dont know what they tried to do!!! Is it that easy to recruit people for job!!! Then the criminals killed 3 innocent lives!!! They even escaped the law & jurisdiction!!! I just didnt like it. Waste of time & boring movie. And most importantly no moral.
PARASITE,28 August 2021,6/10,It didn't add much to me except that I learned that Korean rich people are building such shelters in their homes out of fear of North Korea.
PARASITE,10 September 2021,10/10,"5 Minutes after watcing the movie for 2 hours I felt like rewatching it just in hopes to see the ""plan"" the son has in the ending."
PARASITE,13 September 2021,10/10,"This show is really really exquisite in terms of defining the privilege of upper class and the severity of being in the lower class. At the end of the movie, you would truly question your existence and the inevitable presence of modern society that we would be living in. This show really would pull you down to earth."
PARASITE,15 September 2021,8/10,The movie completely breaks our whole expectation about the movie the actors are astonishing and the movie overall is fascinating.
PARASITE,14 February 2020,1/10,I watched the film it is heavy insult ...
PARASITE,5 October 2021,10/10,"A foreign film that won four Oscars is unheard of. In 2020, the film Parasite directed by Bong Joon-Ho won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. During this time many Asians and Asian-American people were facing a lot of racism because of Covid and much other generational racism, therefore it was a very BIG deal that a foreign film that was all in Korean with an all-Korean cast was winning Oscars back-to-back. It was a tremendous accomplishment, especially considering the Academy Awards have been chastised for being racially biased against persons of color and for failing to recognize Asian actors. Parasite is set in a modern-day society in the city of Seoul, the film shows the dark reality of societal structures. The Park family, a working-class family cunning their way into the Kim home. The Kim family, a wealthy family, clinging to the working class by living comfortably off the backs of their labor. The movie Parasite critiques societal class and shows us how two classes can co-exist but never interact.The stairs, which depict how the Parks and the Kims are separated and show the double meaning of societal class distinction, are one of the primary symbols in the movie Parasite. The depiction of stairs in this film is quite repetitive; there are stairs in practically every scene, especially as the plot begins. For instance, to go into the Parks' house, you must descend the stairs, while to get into the Kims' home, you must ascend the steps. To illustrate, there's a scene where there's a rainstorm and the Parks have to hurry from the Kims' house to theirs because it's flooding, and we can see how far the Parks reside from the Kims at this point. The cameras are filming the Parks as they descend the steps that lead to their neighborhood. Every scene shot during this period depicts the Parks going down the stairs, which represents their stance in societal class. The rain was a curse for the Parks, but a blessing for the Kims, who found the rain to be beautiful and allowed for the sky to be blue and clear the next morning. I appreciated how Bong Joon-Ho took his time to outline the symbolism of the stairs and show how two different families viewed the rainstorm. It gives the rich-poor divide a whole new level of significance.This film was beautifully crafted, the direction of the cinematography captures the stillness of the scenes and it is also able to capture the expressions of characters and we're able to understand how something makes them feel. Majority of the film is set inside the Kim's family estate, an architectural wonder. There's a scene where Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the main character's son from a working-class family, pays a visit to Kim's home. On his way to the house, the camera captures him walking up a hill, from which we can see a wealthy neighborhood. The angles make Ki-woo appear small in comparison to the big houses, emphasizing how Ki-woo is looked down upon and how unattainable this lifestyle is for him. The visual composition of the daylight depicts a better way of life, as represented by the Kims, whereas the basements and crowded streets depict how life feels trapped, as portrayed by the Parks. The cinematography undoubtedly supports the film's plot and the direction that director Bong Joon-Ho was pursuing.Typically Hollywood films portray the less fortunate families as fools. For instance, Joker (2019) was an outcast; the rich would always promise him assistance, but Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) Joker's real name never received assistance and was constantly exploited. As a result, he harbored a grudge against the wealthy. However, in Parasite, the Parks are incredibly intelligent because they don't have the resources of a wealthy family. The Parks are essentially scavengers, which necessitates a high level of intelligence. Many terrifying events occur in the Kims' home. The story has a Stephen King vibe, however, his typical American suburban life is replaced with a capitalist social class in Seoul. Although the film is initially amusing and contains some extremely clever jokes, the plot shifts, and the film becomes less amusing and more serious. When you watch the film, you can't help but think that anything like that could happen, which is unnerving.Parasite is a brilliant movie, flawlessly shot and the actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. It shows a great depiction of how the working class is compelled to compete with one another, while families like the Parks enjoy a comforting life of leisure. Described by Bong Joon-Ho Parasite is ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" This film did an excellent job of delving into the characters' personalities, desires, and pain. Its serious message is delivered effectively while maintaining a dark horror tone. This film kept me on the edge of my seat, mesmerized me, and kept me guessing about the beginning, middle, and end. The collateral crossovers between the families, as well as the overall meaning of the film, continue to pique my interest. Who is the real parasite? The rich or the poor."
PARASITE,12 November 2021,8/10,"I loved the way you think you have learned alla bout a character, and little by little it changes the message on the film, and it comes from a very dramatic and suspense driven story, to a very gore and impactful finale. Lovely movie."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,I wish I could give a thousand stars. This is a masterpiece and a love letter to cinema.
PARASITE,18 November 2021,10/10,"This movie puts human nature on a pedestal and spins it until you are face to face with some of the most dark, bitter truths of society and our place. You will laugh, you will hide your eyes behind a decor couch pillow, and you will curse until you start to wonder: whose side am I really on? Who are the ""good guys"" in a world full of competition and ladders? Fantastic."
PARASITE,5 December 2021,9/10,"A very entertaining movie that focused on the social issues in Korea. Nowadays it is very rare to see a film like Parasite, that conveyed its message so well, yet still able to be entertaining throughout the whole film.Overall, this movie is a must watch."

PARASITE,3 October 2020,4/10,"This movie is not worth watching.
1- It is too Hollywood
2- The movie started as a comedy and ended up as horror. To me it was like a horror version of Tom & Jerry cartoons. Way too silly.
3- There was no need for all that killing because it did not fit the characters or this kind of a script
5- Comparing it, for example, to ""No Country for Old Men."" I would give No Country 9/10 and this one 4/10.
6- Comparing it to all that garbage out there then yeah it was one step above garbage."
PARASITE,19 January 2020,9/10,"Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,5/10,"If it was only the 8.6 on IMDB I could say it's because of the accounts, or anyone can vote or something like that... But it has 6 Oscar nominees, won Palm d'Or, and hundreds of other awards and I really can't get HOW?
It's an ordinary movie, I'll only remember it for how overrated it was."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,10/10,"I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening.
This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser.
Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles."
PARASITE,26 February 2020,10/10,"Just watch it. It has everything; entertainment, comedy, thrill, horror (yes!), suspense, drama, tragedy everything!!
Movie has several messages, several anecdotes, things shown metaphorically."
PARASITE,24 December 2020,5/10,"In the disguise of highlighting social inequality they just manage to show 2 extremes of society but in most cumbersome & blatant way. In fact the poor been shown as if to leach on the rich and live off (right from the title) no creativity or novelty in incidents or scenes. Characters are not at all introduced or given depth, everything is hurried throw. Climax is hotchpotch and forced upon. Much much over rated movie. Oscar ???"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,9/10,"I watched this movie three times.
it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said.
there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube.
I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep.
light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful."
PARASITE,22 March 2020,5/10,"Kim family members are intelligent yet very poor. They somehow persuades rich ""Parks family ""into entering their home as servants, housekeepers etc. Kim family starts to suck blood from ""Parks family"" Because Parks family is so rich they have already been exploiting poor families for years. So they deserve it completely.Kim family tries to be rich at the expense of others, but it is OK. They are poor, they are victims of the system, so they have right to do that. They make other poor people lose their jobs. They don't waste their time and immediately starts drinking alcohol and having a big feast in the ""host"" family's house.Joking aside, why do some people refuse to criticize Kim family's greed. They already got one good job, why not stop? Let the others benefit too. They get other jobs by defaming previous employees.I am not a great fan of ""Parks family"", but am I supposed to hate them. What's wrong with them. They are just rich and extremely gullible. They even help other families by giving jobs, they don't make them work like slaves.By the way, at the end the man from the poor family kills the man from the rich family because the rich guy hates the poor he even thinks they smell bad. (God, can you imagine that? How can a man be that evil?)The film which deserves this year's Oscar is definitely ""Joker"" which truly depicts a man who is systematically and unceasingly ignored and looked down on. It is the real critic of greedy and selfish society.Parasite got Oscar because it is an Asian movie. Joker didn't get Oscar because it is so American. It is even part of DC comics, so that makes it definitely not Oscar-worthy. The academy wanted to show they care about rest of the world and other cultures. (which is good in theory.), but art should be universal regardless of director's gender, race, or culture."
PARASITE,8 February 2020,6/10,It's a good movie but really it's over rated. It is also little boring and slow
PARASITE,20 February 2020,9/10,We like this movie. Really interesting story. The actors play is very good.
PARASITE,8 May 2020,5/10,"Not new. The feeling brought by the movie is so normal. Coming from a 3rd world country, this is understandably not a hype for me. I guess the strong impact made by this overhyped movie is applicable to to those 1st world countries only."
PARASITE,11 April 2021,6/10,It was a disappointing. It was not bad. But it was to long. And the story starts strong and then the story changed from poor people to smart people and back to stupid people. The rich family didn.t do anything wrong. In my opinion you don't hated both families. So at the end i was thinking: Where is the rich family? I didn't get any connection with the poor family.
PARASITE,23 May 2020,2/10,"It's a travesty that this won Best Picture over ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood."" Very predictable. I kept waiting for it to turn into a great movie. It didn't."
PARASITE,14 January 2020,5/10,"Very bad.
The picture is overrated by critics. Does not contain a story. Only an aversion to the main characters."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,5/10,Wow. Is this movie most overrated movie of the all time? Definitely. People see cheap metaphors and they are losing themselves. Someone said f-cking thought thought provoking about this movie. wtf? this is classic lower class upper class tale with a twist and absurdity. Andavals who do not think in any way in their daily life thinks this movie is so good cuz metaphors. this movie is f-cking so absurd that even the unicorn with rainbow fart is more real than this movie. even snowpiercer were even better. this movie is definition of overrated and bandwagon effect. gj.
PARASITE,17 August 2019,3/10,"I lost interest in this film as soon as the poor, downtrodden family (who I assume the audience is supposed to feel sorry for? I didn't - they were criminals) suddenly became criminal masterminds and were able to outwit the rich, pompous, 'bad guys' (rich family).The plot wasn't remotely believable. In fact, it was laughable (see above).Overall the film was mildly entertaining and certainly 'different' but the plot was entirely predictable, unconvincing, and overly-political.In the end I found myself actually rooting for the rich family. The poor family were bad people. Being poor does not excuse immoral behavior. They demonstrated little to no remorse for their actions and them being poor didn't change my perception of their wrongdoings.They were con-men. They lied, cheated and conned their way into temporary luxury and, in the end, it all predictably backfired. I didn't care for any of the main characters and, whatever political message this film was trying to convey, it's important to remember being wealthy in and of itself doesn't make you a bad person, and being poor doesn't give you a free pass to do bad things."
PARASITE,18 June 2020,9/10,Never expected a movie from a foreign language would make me like so much as i liked this movie...the story is realy good too
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,9/10,"Four highly coveted Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay), being awarded to a foreign-language film, is an unprecedented event in my memory. This makes Parasite (South Korean 2019 tragicomedy) a must-see movie.
Having just come out of the theatre, I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels. But before broaching the poignant essentials, should firstly dispense with the banal, which I expect the woke and self-righteous movie-goers are likely to focus on. These will undoubtedly include such predictable clichés as injustices of income inequality, disdain of the chauffeur-driven elite towards ""smelly"" subway riders, aloof callousness to the upper classes, etc. These elements are undeniably featured in the film, but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche, which deserves to be examined with some specificity.
Viewer warning: Parasite, while a monumental piece of cinematic work, is not a joyous viewing experience. The unrelenting intensity, unleashed on the viewer almost from the start (not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net), is sustained without respite throughout the two-hour-plus duration.
Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society, culture, and class hierarchy, I felt somewhat disadvantaged, particularly during the early scenes. At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous, I fear that most of the US movie-going public might be in the same boat, despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung, KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets. If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north, we would probably know even less about the Region. While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss, in the case of Parasite, not knowing the Korean societal dynamics, one can't help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start.
On the one hand, we are presented with:
a close-knit Kim family, exhibiting an unmistakably cooperative and mutually supportive spirit;healthy, good-looking, clever and articulate offsprings;athletically accomplished mother (the inference is drawn from a prominently placed photo, displaying her hammer throwing prowess in what appears to be a serious track & field event).While on the other hand:
all seemingly underemployed (e.g., relegated to pizza box assembly as an income source);underpaid (e.g., mooching off the neighbors for WIFI signal);under-housed (i.e., shabby, vermin-infested, basement-level dwelling, where drunken public urination in front of their window is a near-regular occurrence).The initial culturally ""foreign"" element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self-reliant and skilled family members, the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to ""come up with the plan"". An accomplished hammer-thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting (pun intended) when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances.
What makes these incompatible realities even more disjointed is the apparent inability of the siblings, who clearly exhibit an above-average portfolio of skills, to claim their proper station in society. The brother, while devoid of formal university education, has superior math, English and college entrance test-acing skills. The sister, in addition to her mastery of drawing and appealing looks, has perfected the improv and BS artistry to such an extent that in any meritocratic setting she would easily achieve a distinguished career in marketing, politics or screenplay writing. The film creators are seemingly posing a two-part question:
1. is it the social status and family pedigree, rather than merit, that acts as a dominant determinant of one's ability to succeed; or perhaps...
2. it is a self-inflicted limitation imposed by one's own belief system that places the current circumstance or family history to be the obstacle to advancement?
The filmmakers are hinting at the latter by incorporating the heavy rock imagery, introduced to the audience in a form of a gift by a family friend (looks more like a ginormous paperweight, rather than heirloom). The brother becomes so inextricably linked to the rock, particularly during periods of high stress, that he seems unable to separate himself from it no matter where he goes. Predictably (in keeping with Chekhov's dramatic principle) this heavy rock becomes the instrument of his near demise. Curiously, it is the same metaphorically tuned brother who misses such an obvious boulder of a symbol (again pun intended).
However, it is the juxtaposition of the affluent Parks vs the poor Kims in the film that takes the cake (definitely, pun intended). An unspoken shield seems to reliably insulate the wealthy from various external forces. While a heavy downpour can dispossess the slum dwellers of their property entirely, it is only a minor inconvenience for the wealthy (down to the leak-proof pretend American Indian tents). While basements of the rich can withstand a nuclear attack from the pot-bellied dictator north of the border, any substantial deluge simply drowns basements (or basement homes, as the case might be) of the poor in raw sewage. Another purpose of incorporating the heavy rain scene into the film is to remind us that often ""when it rains, it pours"". That is, while the Kims managed to cleverly contrive themselves into the Parks' household, the elation proved to be short-lived as they discovered other subterranean dwellers in the Parks' house, whose status is even lower than that of the Kims, leading to dramatic disequilibrium to a comfortable and promising situation.
According to the filmmakers, while the invisible walls of wealth and privilege protect the affluent class from external threats, no one is safe when it comes to the ""enemy within."" The message here seems to be that as long as the class resentment is obvious and inter-class mobility is driven by factors other than merit (e.g., antecedent, lack of connections, body odor, cheap underwear or any other subjective and artificial boundaries) the risk of societal discontent is always lurking in the background, bringing the fragility of human existence to the forefront, often causing the innocent to suffer.
The carnage scene in the latter part of the film, while abrupt and sudden, can indeed be foreshadowed as a natural consequence of open expression of disdain that Parks Sr. signals to Kim Sr. in no uncertain terms.
Where I struggle with my interpretation of the film is the title. There are no obvious parasites in the plot. Even the subterranean male dweller performs light sensor duties at appropriate moments, thereby communicating his respect and appreciation. The Kims dutifully fulfill their respective roles. While the Parks Sr. works for his money. Perhaps the idea behind the title is to suggest that there is a symbiotic feeding off one another that remains fundamentally destructive as long as the gulf between societal layers remains unbridged. Not sure. Need to think about it some more.
Nine out of ten."
PARASITE,3 June 2020,5/10,"I watched this movie because of the hype around it, it's extremely overrated, it's a popular story Idea in the Egyptian film industry.
This movie is to watch for once, never watch it again even after 10 years, never suggest it to anyone, very normal."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,10/10,"Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed.
It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino ..
Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .Kudo's"
PARASITE,28 August 2019,10/10,"Tigers every human emotionits hilarious
its dark
its original
its powerful
its thought provokingtime well spent"
PARASITE,8 March 2020,10/10,"It's actually perfect for an international scene, because the theme is relevant in every society but also because it plays with the western world view of how we all think Korea is regarding everything American= cool. Yet at the same time it's making fun of all people in the West at the same time. It is like a giant f... finger in our face, this is how a movie should be composed, so go back to your banal, predictable styles and continue as you were. You have not seen this one coming. It's clever and cute in its persona gallery. We are sitting there waiting for someone to hate but somehow come to like all the characters. 5 min into the movie you have forgotten that it's a Korean cast and the language is unknown to you. Something that impressed me. The sad ending is somehow terrible because it's real. This is life and it's Hollywood to think it would be any different. I truly love the originality and full circle of the script, it's like if you write a master thesis that just hits home where you were able to tie all knots elegantly and with great content. I loved this movie. And I actually can't remember if I ever saw something this original and mind blowing
which was not sci-fi."
PARASITE,18 January 2020,5/10,"The first of the movie was awesome, but the end is absurd"
PARASITE,15 February 2020,7/10,"Clever feel-good movie that transcends into Horror / slasher genre - similar to Hitchcock's Psycho.Limitations - Plot problems:
1. Kim family members are cunningly talented & smart - yet have the most menial of jobs.
2. Papa Kim's motivation to kill Papa Park is implausible.
3. Detectives in Korea are apparently useless - can't find Papa Kim.Benefits:
1. Suburb film making - pace / rhythm / continuity / acting / montage / symbolism / editing / cinematography
2. Consistent Theme of a sons love for his family/father (even a flawed father) and toiling to bring prosperity to his family."
PARASITE,26 September 2019,9/10,"Beautifully written and very masterfully crafted, definitely one of the best Korean movie of this year"
PARASITE,4 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is about so much more than class differences. It's survival,what you would do for your family.
Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions.
I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!"
PARASITE,25 April 2021,1/10,"Not funny, not realistic, and disturbing.I believe the ratings are highly rigged with Korean movie fans who has never seen a good movie!There are thousands of better movies that includes the very same message this movie is trying to give, but better."
PARASITE,6 March 2021,10/10,"It really does live up to the hype, truly a great film."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,1/10,"Interesting story line, nothing revolutionary, and very mediocre acting. Not sure how this movie can get so much attention, i suspect someone has pored a lot of money into the marketing."
PARASITE,30 May 2019,10/10,"Wide and narrow

Day and night

the rich and the poorodor and ....congratulations on Bong's great movie and achievement."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,9/10,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example ""Crossing the line"" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it."
PARASITE,16 April 2020,1/10,"This was my least favorite.
It seemed overlong and boring.
I didn't pay to watch it and I am glad I didn't."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,7/10,"Well produced, good entertaining, weird story that stands out of mediocre movies, but is not a masterpiece.Maybe can be different in culture, how korean people show feelings but the mr. kim lacks a lot of emotional depth, they do not sell very well a character full of resentment bursting out and killing his boss, yeah 3 scenes about smell, 2 scenes about crossing the line, and 1 scene talking about chaotic way of living about not creating any plans for the future, is not enough to see the build up of ressentment in the character, lack of expression, lack of close ups, lack of emotional anger, yeah i get it the character is a island, but even if that is true they did not sell well the anger burst, you can see this by how many people that were not convinced about that scene.The kid translate the SOS message and do not talk to any one or do not lead to anywhere, seems like a waste scene, the final about the boy recovering about 2 rock throws in his head feels cheap not constructed, and about dreaming of getting rich and buying the house is a soft ending that feels cheap as well.is not the first movie talking about class struggle, is not the first movie that gets a showdown in the end, is a good movie, is fun, has suspense, has comedy, is surreal, i would still recommend it, but to being a MASTERPIECE still lacks a LOT of depth."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,9/10,"The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes."
PARASITE,2 May 2021,5/10,"Why this film won the Oscar?Film is OK but Oscar??? Noo!!!10 point?? Noo!!!If you understood why this film won the Oscar, tell me why... :))"
PARASITE,26 January 2020,7/10,"I don't understand why this movie have 8.6, what in hell.... the story was good, nice story elements, acting, but the rest is blank! In middle of the movie it become a little boring, too long, and the end is awkward! A good message but bad conclusion , 7/10 top!"
PARASITE,6 March 2020,7/10,"The first half of the movie is brilliant, unfortunately the main characters go from being geniuses with great social skills in the first half to being idiots in the second half. Considering their social abilities, they should have easily been able to make a deal where everybody wins or to manipulate their opponents to their advantage in the second half of the movie. Instead they turn into idiots so that we can get a ""social commentary ending""."
PARASITE,16 January 2020,7/10,All I kept thinking as I watched this film was it should of been a book first vs a movie. The experience would have been more powerful reading it vs seeing it. Hard to rate it honestly.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,9/10,"This movie left me thinking and analysing it for hours after I left cinema. I had long discussions about days after I've watched.
It's fresh approach to making movies. With great emotional punchline.I'm happy I've seen it."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,3/10,I was really excited to watch this movie. When I started watching I was very disappointed that there were subtitles. It's hard for me to really view The characters and action While trying to read subtitles. Hopefully one day It will be dubbed in English. I know that my take a way from the movie for many but it makes a lot easier for me to enjoy it even if the lips aren't synced perfectly to the words. If they can sync English to old movies like Godzilla and Mothra they can certainly sync English to this movie.
PARASITE,11 April 2020,9/10,"I didn't feel long at all of the movie as the plot was so grabbing. Despite the dramatic shifts on plots and the human characters, I very much related to the human side of things. Big Kudos to the entire team on every aspect!"
PARASITE,14 July 2021,10/10,"Throughout the whole movie i felt panic build up internally. This movie creates a feeling through the whole runtime that makes you want to turn it of to spare yourself. At the same time it grips you so tightly and you can't pull yourself away. In a decade or two we will look back at this movie in the same way we look back at ""Silence of the Lambs"" and such films. A true 10/10."
PARASITE,8 August 2019,10/10,"Finally we have another all-Korean movie from the master.Bong Joon-ho is back and is unpredictable as always.Let me give you 5 reasons to watch this movie:1) You love a good crime/drama/thriller.2) You love Korean cinema with all your heart.3) You love Song Kang-ho (how one can not love him?)4) The script, acting and directing are perfect (as always when the Master is in business).5) Does the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival ring a bell for you?Welcome :)"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,5/10,"A history which somebody can use mostly one and a half hour, they needed two hours and eleven!
Nothing to talk about ...maybe about the unjustified success of this movie!!!"
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"This is the worst joke I have ever seen. 😢 When I saw that ""1917"" did not win I just had to watch this. Had such high hopes. I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a while, but this has nothing on Oldboy or even Mother. A win over Mendes' masterpiece just makes the Oscars the worst awards for cinema in the world (which btw was showing for a couple of decades now). Sad! 😢"
PARASITE,26 January 2020,10/10,"I want to say so much about this powerful movie but it is clear from the scores and reviews it is compelling, thought-provoking and subtly absorbing.Suffice to say it's a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people.This beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights.I am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning, as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you don't look down with compassion.Or was it all just a metaphor? If so, what for? I, for one, don't care."
PARASITE,20 February 2020,7/10,"Cinematography was amazing in this film. Very good acting.. the plot for me was really weak... I felt like I was watching an episode of Black mirror that was an 1 hour to long. I think this was a little over hyped and overrated. Of all the AMAZING foreign films out there I feel like saying this is ""masterpiece"" is a slap in the face. Still a solid film. I won't watch it again though."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,6/10,"I love when people get carried away and jump on the bandwagon. Enjoyable? It was ok. Best film of the year? Not a chance. Just because it has subtitles I think some people think they are getting their cultural diversity fix. Its been done better a hundred times over. The comedic element, watch Kung Fu hustle. The serious undertone, watch pretty much anything else. Won't be recommending, wasn't awful, just a bit meh."
PARASITE,28 June 2019,2/10,Ok .. everyine give high rating but i said this is a bad movie.. the acting is good.. but the movie is not..
PARASITE,10 February 2020,10/10,"This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret"
PARASITE,23 February 2020,1/10,"This movie was engaging and even suspenseful at times. The acting and directing are both very well done. But, the ending is over-the-top pathetic. Had I known, I wouldn't have invested 2 hours of my life for an utterly useless contribution to anything good. Pass. Save your 2 hours of life. Go for a walk. Rewatch Dumb and Dumber - you'll feel smarter than after wasting time on this attempt at a ground breaking movie. The Oscar win proves that Hollywood is morally bankrupt and void of ideas."
PARASITE,25 March 2020,10/10,"Loved every second of this movie.It starts off as a comedy/drama of a family trying to survive by whatever means possible.Then when the son lands a job through a friends recommendation, it adds romance and delves into the world of the rich family which contrasts the lifestyle and ideals of the poor.In that segment it plays with social ideas and it shows you how ""clean and mighty"" the rich are but later throughout conversations they have their true colors begin to shown.Out of nowhere it throws you into a survival situation where the old house maiden comes back but i don't want to spoil this part.And last it throws a bit of action at your face.All of this genre hopping but one thing was always present.
The parody.I felt anxious a lot throughout the film and i loved how the Title of the film had an allegorical meaning and it was changing depending on the situation/part of the film you are on.The last minutes of the film, how it was written, narrated and being setup are the most importand part of the film.
Without that scene this movie could have been a completely different thing."
PARASITE,26 May 2021,10/10,"The best Asian movie of the decade. It touches the most sensitive and delicate aspects of society and extents human behavior could possibly reach. With all that, it weaves a storyline which keep the audience engulfed throughout 120 mins and 4 distinct genres. I personally have not seen a smoothly navigated movie as Parasite which gives the audience the feeling of the plot frame by frame. Remarkable script, direction, acting and camera."
PARASITE,4 January 2020,5/10,"A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life."
PARASITE,24 April 2020,2/10,"A waste of time, of energy and of the stuff that award trinkets are made of. Why this shallow so-called satire has received accolades around the globe is far beyond me, but there you go: it's the emperor's clothes all over."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,6/10,"After watching the Oscars's and seeing the many awards this film won I decided to see it. It was a good movie. I was expecting so much more than just ""good"". It didn't move me emotionally the way I thought, or hoped it would. I didn't dislike it, but I wouldn't watch it again. Just like my review here, It was just ok."
PARASITE,9 July 2021,8/10,"I have seen this movie 5-6 times now and have shown it to 4 of my friends. This movie is a masterpiece. Acting, Directon, Story, Screenplay, Cinematography everything is top notch. This director's work is amazing and I cannot wait for his next film. Just watch it!"
PARASITE,26 May 2019,,"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,10/10,"This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time.
Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes.
The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting.
I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them."
PARASITE,8 May 2020,7/10,"Sure Parasite it's an original, well directed, and captivating movie, but it's not the masterpiece of this decade. I guess Sam Mendez has been quite deceived not receiving the best picture with 1917 instead of this movie."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,1/10,"This movie even made me lose trust in all Oscars awards and IMDB ratings,We've watched it as a family and we all hate it and regret the time wasted on it."
PARASITE,8 January 2020,10/10,"Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie."
PARASITE,4 March 2021,10/10,I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this good.
PARASITE,29 March 2020,5/10,All I wish to say is do not go by the rating or the hype. It is an average movie but with a slightly better storyline. There are way too many movies which are much much better.
PARASITE,9 January 2020,10/10,So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece
PARASITE,30 October 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies I watched, nice story, nice acting, totally unexpected ending. I'd watch this movie couple of times and ill be fine with it."
PARASITE,21 January 2020,9/10,"It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go."
PARASITE,10 January 2021,9/10,"I was very hesitant about watching this movie and it exceeded my expectations more then I thought it would. I understood the premise from hearing others discuss the film. I watched the trailer countless times (You did your job Ads) and I still had refused to watch it, until my boyfriend suggested it (The things we do for love).Needless to say I was very glad to have included this in my list of films I've watched. This movie gave me every emotion you could possibly get. I felt shocked, angered, comical, sorrowful, the list goes on!I would definitely recommend this movie to all movie lovers who want to feel a grasp through their screen."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,"Amazing why people love this movie, boring and very poor acting"
PARASITE,30 January 2021,8/10,This movie literally has it all and you're hooked within first 2 minutes a cinema masterpiece can't wait to see what's next
PARASITE,23 June 2020,1/10,"This film is what happens massive amounts of government funding is poured into a local film welfare system, since it now seems fashionable to have disdain for the west these days, most people in the west are practicing telescopic art appreciation, and the general public had been dumbed-down to the point that Hollywood can't make a dime with anything other than comic book characters. This film is visually dull and predictable. The characters are uni-dimensional and unrealistic, and the plot is beyond implausible It is Kung Fu Hustle without all the charm and CGI. My disbelief remained un-suspended through the entire cringe-fest. This film is beyond bad. It is insulting."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,6/10,"I enjoyed this movie with all the twists and turns and surprises. It's worth watching and there is not a dull moment in it. I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year.I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive. The poor people are conniving criminals willing to take what is not theirs, or cheat and lie if given the opportunity.Watch to be entertained. That's it. Don't read anything into it."
PARASITE,18 April 2020,8/10,"Wonderfully described the parasitic nature of human. The story of hardworking family struggling to meet ends of daily needs, start thriving off a host. Great comeback in end."
PARASITE,9 June 2021,9/10,Great film very well put together and very much takes an unexpected turn.
PARASITE,5 January 2020,10/10,"I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".P.S. The house is a dream of architecture."
PARASITE,9 April 2020,7/10,"As per me the movie does showed the consequences of ""bad guys"" in the end and no doubt that the first half of the movie is so amazingly plotted , the boy got referred then he refer her sister then she refer her father then mother - this really made it interesting but somehow i found the second half not that much interesting."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,10/10,"Parasite is a thrilling, funny, surprising and satirical society. This is perfect film."
PARASITE,23 May 2020,9/10,This movie is good :v I'm just trying to fill the profile checklist lol
PARASITE,18 September 2020,10/10,"Un ejemplo de las desigualdades sociables, La sicoología del dinero y los dramas que conllevan . Una foto profunda a la sociedad actual"
PARASITE,28 April 2020,5/10,Absoultly Overrated movie. Its a normal movie not so so good
PARASITE,6 November 2020,10/10,"This movie contains all the aspects that a good movie should have. Happy times, sad times, freaky times, surprising times, scary times, exciting times and funny times. All the aspects are checked in my book and they are so well put together and blended to a perfect experience. It was totally believable and also very amazing. The whole plot of the movie was just so good, I could never have come up with it myself."
PARASITE,22 January 2020,9/10,"Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious.
It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop...
Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.
The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable-
When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.
You haven't seen a film like this before"
PARASITE,21 September 2021,9/10,"This director is one of the best in Korea, one of how many jewels more than this is the best of all. Memories of a killer or the host are also very good. In addition to the way it is carried in whether several generos as a comedy moment, suspense, tension is a unique expectancy."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,6/10,"Was expecting a great movie about social inequality. I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating. But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status. It is about a down on their luck con artist family. Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for. But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting. Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears. But then the family lies, manipulates, and scams two people to get fired. Deplorable. Do people do this cause they are poor? No, it's cause they are criminals. There are criminals at all social levels. So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality. How disappointing.. but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers. But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,7/10,"First infiltrant, nice. Second infiltrant: nicely done, good scenario. although predictable. The rest of the starting plot? Well played and filmed, no surprise anymore. Than the scenario does not have clue anymore, and starts to disintegrate in random plotparts. You start to wait for THE END so you can leave the cinema. While the story could have been developed in several interesting ways.... could have been the best film of the year. What starts with an 8 ends less than a 6, thanks to the scenario. Overrated."
PARASITE,1 December 2020,10/10,"Parasite was a hell of a film. It kept me engaged and wondering where the plot twist would place itself. To my surprise, there were several twistings of the plot, if you will. All in all I enjoyed and celebrated the construction and deliverance of this project."
PARASITE,29 July 2020,9/10,"A true masterpiece in every area of film-making. Hats-off to the director, writers, the cast and all involved!"
PARASITE,7 March 2020,6/10,"I didn't find the movie so interesting. It felt like Mr. Bong was so confused about how to end the movie. The story ran so fast and the household shown was extra ordinary naive, which is also abnormal as a such big businessman.I couldn't break the 2 inch boundary of subtitle too. But this movie could be better."
PARASITE,13 September 2020,9/10,"The story is so well balanced between the two families, that you can't even tell who the lead actors or the supporting ones are. It is also one of those very few movies which don't have a Hero-Villain storyline. The way it dealt with social discrimination and flaws in human nature is beyond extraordinary. It clearly explains why it is only the third film in history to win both the Palme d'Or and Academy Award for Best Picture. A rare masterpiece indeed."
PARASITE,17 January 2020,8/10,"An interesting movie with a unusual concept and a great finael. Has a good balance betweem european and asian style, but i think it was long a bit. A good movie, but I don't understand this hype, and the enviable place in the top 250"
PARASITE,17 February 2020,1/10,I have no idea how this got any good reviews. It was confusing and boring. Not for me.
PARASITE,4 August 2019,10/10,"The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us."
PARASITE,21 October 2019,10/10,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."
PARASITE,3 July 2019,10/10,"After watching, I see my fight against the system (life, society, Capitalism) as a fight for all of the people who still eager for a fight."
PARASITE,5 March 2020,10/10,"Holy crap. This is a tense movie. You really won't see the twist coming and even then you won't predict what happens. Funny, scary, sad, and yet weirdly sweet. Definitely deserved best picture. Insane."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,"If you love gratuitous violence, this for you. Unbelievable this got those Oscars. Truly disgusting, I was ready to walk out numerous times, and am angry with myself for not having done so.UGH!"
PARASITE,19 January 2020,10/10,"I never write reviews but this film was a masterpiece! Definitely one of my favorite movies now. Go watch it, you won't regret it!"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,6/10,"It is understood that Hollywood wanted to attract more costumers in Asia by handing this movie Oscars' Best Picture and Best Directing. I can't see how this movie surpasses ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" or ""Irishman"" in terms of the acting. This movie is average at best. The suspense is average (not better than ""Knives Out""). The thrill is cheap. The cinematography is average. Too much implausibility. ""Marriage Story"" is even more entertaining that this movie."
PARASITE,27 March 2020,5/10,"What a shame Parasite won the Oscars instead of 1917.
I was expected a masterpiece and felt really disappointed. It is like watching 2 different movies. Second half too surrealistic for my taste"
PARASITE,25 February 2020,10/10,"By film critics awarded and praised movies are often an artistic statement on their own. But sometimes they do lack entertainment and the movie experience that mainstream viewers expect.This movie on the other hand combines the outstanding art of cinematography and an exceptional movie experience. Every minute from the beginning to the very last scene is enjoyable and executed perfectly.I read about the overwhelming critics and positive feedbacks about this film before I watched this movie. So I tried not to be too overhyped and biased. In fact, I tried to watch and enjoy it without thinking too much about the critics. And I was not disappointed at all.Just watch this film and enjoy:
the beautiful shots of this motion picturethe bizarre and absurd adventurethe way and pace of storytellingthe unexpected happeningsthe mix and transition throughout genresthe message and the intentionKorean cinema has brought us some gems to the big screen and Parasite is a diamond that is finally truely acknowledged by the academy."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,5/10,"Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed."
PARASITE,23 March 2020,10/10,"Interesting story within two levels of society poor and wealthy people,"
PARASITE,10 April 2021,10/10,I've only viewed this film once and everything about it was beautiful! From the addictive plot to the gorgeous cinematography Bong Joon Ho has crafted a modern masterpiece that I will be revisiting repeatedly.
PARASITE,2 February 2020,9/10,Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time. Enjoyably thrilling.
PARASITE,12 February 2020,8/10,"Great movie, great screenplay, fantastic twist, I just hoped it was more balanced, sometimes things happen too fast and sometimes to slow"
PARASITE,30 December 2019,10/10,"Best film I've seen in a long while, great plot good twist highly recommended"
PARASITE,25 June 2019,10/10,"At first, you'll see it as a comedy, but then the director take you on a magical mystery ride and you'll never know what waiting for you up ahead. 10/10 a must watch movie"
PARASITE,25 February 2020,10/10,"Won best picture, I understood why after watching it. Definitely a must watch."
PARASITE,12 June 2020,1/10,There is something truly wrong with our world when this movie is so overly hyped up. I wanted to walk out of the movie theater but I paid $20 for the movie ticket. The acting - NOT GOOD. Story Line - PREDICTABLE. Just watch something else - don't make the same mistake as I've done. You're been warned!
PARASITE,6 September 2019,9/10,The film is Evolutionary. It destroys all the backgrounds we have of the The film is destructive. It destroys all the backgrounds we have of the rich and rich classes of society and gives us a gray experience of both. The script has bugs that can be ignored (such as when the father goes into the basement in the end but doesn't see his injured son in front of him). Breaking the old cycle of good and evil is the hard and valuable work that Joon-ho Bong does well.
PARASITE,10 February 2020,6/10,"The film is wellmade in many aspects and maybe it deserves its Oscars this year. Certainly it is about time to award the Oscar for a film performed in another language than english. But it is not close to a masterpiece. It does not measure up to films like A Separation, Life is beautiful, The Postman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many others films that deserved an Oscar for best picture.There are many other things this film is not. It is more a tragic horror movie and a deliberative reflection on class society than a comedy. There are no laughing moments in this film unless you have an extremely dark sense of humor. The acting is very uneven, sometimes brilliant and sometimes amateurish, and the script, even though it is certainly original and in many aspects wellwritten, has several obvious plotholes."
PARASITE,27 July 2020,10/10,"This honestly is my most favorite movie of all time that I've seen so far! Theres a lot of fantastic movies but this is definitely no.1 then Get Out, all the John Wick sequels, Avatar and Titanic. Theres more but I'll stop here. But this movie right here in my 30 years of living tops every last one. Bong Joon-Ho is a genius! Him & BTS are doing their country really freaking proud. This just goes to show you theres so much outside most peoples bubble that they dont know about because they're unnecessarily to closed minded & prejudice. The world has so much to offer if you're open to all its possibilities & ignore the thousands telling you no. Higly recommended!!! 100/10"
PARASITE,13 February 2020,10/10,"NEVER seen a movie like this. Wow what a masterpiece! Twist after twist, it had it ALL!!!"
PARASITE,3 April 2020,10/10,"Simply put it deserved all the praise it got, and the movie is a masterpiece. One of Bong's best movies to date. Will become cult classic in a few years."
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"First: the girl went down and took her boyfriend out! Didn't see that hidden door!
Second: the Korean police just said the guy was homeless who came and killed the sister! However, the guy was living downstairs to hide from many people! I'm not sure if it was a gambling issue or not!
So ending was totally nonsense and a really overrated movie! I enjoyed JoJo Rabbit and Marriage story much more personally"
PARASITE,17 February 2021,10/10,"I don't even know what to say. from the story line, the plot, the actors, the meaning behind the movie is... incredibly artstanding ovation for Bong Joon Ho"
PARASITE,1 January 2020,10/10,A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,Perfect. What else can you say about the wonderful film.
PARASITE,22 March 2020,4/10,"Everyone praises thuis film for iets stylistic richness. Hype hype hurray. The truth is it lacks any tone at all. It is immature and silly. There is no chance of any identification. The rich people are immensely stupid, falling for the simplest tricks in the book. The poor are crafty but no more. The plot is farcical. Worst moment: the rich couple are starting what might be sex with three of the poor family under the tea table. The lights go on! They slide to safety. Someone is banging morse code on a light switch with his forehead.
Of course it ende in bizarre massacre. Motive? Unclear.
Is this serious satire about rich and poor? Are you kidding? Maybe of the South-Korean kind, where superficiality reigns. It is an immature product of an immature director. The acting is childish and over the top. The camerawork is great. But that is where it ends. Awful."
PARASITE,10 April 2020,1/10,"Do not watch this if your IQ surpass amoeba´s!!!!One of the worst movies I have ever seen.There is absolutely nothing in this crap worth of anybody´s time and attention.Except for the opening 5 mins or so, there is no smart moment in its132 min runtime.Title is fitting though."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"My dad is someone that doesn't even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great. If thay doesn't cry out how great this film is then I don't know what.This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything. Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite."
PARASITE,1 March 2020,9/10,"After only 5 minutes of watching this film you will be fully immersed into an unknown world (at least for outsiders of korean life) and thrown into a tale full of intrigue, wit, laughter and shock. All of this backed up with a smart plot and story twists at every turn ensuring the audience is kept on their toes at all time.There may be only but a few grey areas of the story that you feel a loss of understanding but that feeling quickly subsides as the next page of the story quickly unfolds.Great director and great film 9/10"
PARASITE,1 February 2020,1/10,"Wth??!! It's absolutely bad, the movie is boring, pure fantasy, like science fiction movie, I think it's like a someone smoke a big one and make and boring, fanciful and idealistic movie..."
PARASITE,26 April 2020,8/10,"Good movie. Not my type of movie, but it's good. I only looked at him because he's in a good reputation."
PARASITE,11 January 2020,10/10,"This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work."
PARASITE,6 February 2020,10/10,"One spoiler question. The father killed Park, went to the alley, ducked into the garage and slipped into the hidden basement. He then uses Morse code to communicate to his son outside the home. Did he not see his son in a pool of blood in front of the basement door? If he saw his son in that pool of blood why did he think he survived?"
PARASITE,11 November 2019,10/10,"I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!"
PARASITE,7 July 2020,10/10,"Even though somewhat too dramatic, I do really enjoy this movie.Most of the scenes and plots are well organized and designed, and also several key points about humanity."
PARASITE,27 September 2019,10/10,The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!
PARASITE,5 November 2019,9/10,"If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters. By a full 1.5 stars, this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019. Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely. I'm really happy that people are watching this, and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves.9.5/10, could be a 10 on the second watch."
PARASITE,13 March 2020,4/10,"I like movies that start normal and small actions add up to twists and drama later but in this movie it was everything very predictable. Nothing new. They're just a poor family that starts lying their way out of poverty. By the way it seems unbelievable that they would be such good actors and so coordinated with each-other. The next obvious thing is that the truth will leak somewhere and I kept hoping for some genius way for it to unfold. But it didn't.
It had many great moments such as the little guy being a genius or when the house was drown in sewage water but none of those moments developed further or had anything to do with the story.
I kept waiting for a twist but all I got was a hot mess. Maybe the twist would be if the nice rich people would turn out to be not so nice and naive; or a strange collaboration to happen between the family and the poor couple.
I know that most of the things that happened have a symbolic meaning that try to convey the differences between the rich and the poor but they didn't have a good logical excuse to happen the way they did."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,8/10,"We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.
Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.
In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.
This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.
Their crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner.
The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host."
PARASITE,27 June 2021,1/10,"Totaly Overated. Not my taste, cause boring as Hell. If you don't like it in the first 20 Minutes.. just dont watch further more. It will not get better."
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"Nice and deep, great movie! This Korean palm is worthy of the name!!"
PARASITE,19 April 2020,7/10,"While i watch movies i want to get immersed and not THINK about symbolism, so for me the exploring of the topic of class differences didn't offer much new for me. Even though the characters weren't in a black or white scheme, i didn't felt connected to something real and the main deceit plot was not that engaging.
So its about certain rich people dehumanizing poor people, this was not enough new there for me.This movie could be more for movie lovers who are into artistic shots,novel characters and symbolism."
PARASITE,5 January 2020,9/10,"I am shocked! Really wonderful film and it is not american. Thank you, Korea, but the ending was meh, that's why i give 9 stars."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,9/10,"Without giving away any major plot points Parasite can only be described as one of the most unmistakable yet subtle pieces of social commentary of the 21st century. Focused around the idea of class divide it explores the unavailability of social mobility as broken system and highlights the nonchalant attitude of the upper classes towards less fortunate people.
Shot beautifully and includes an incredible performance by Kang So Hong. All round a brilliant film."
PARASITE,7 January 2021,10/10,"I think the best movie of 2019. The movie keeps you with every character, every event, every moment."
PARASITE,3 May 2020,7/10,Just when you think this can't go on like this it gets even worse.
PARASITE,2 January 2020,10/10,"Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling ""Parasite,"" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none."
PARASITE,1 May 2020,10/10,"From its foreign dialogue to its perfect cinematography, this movie will keep you glued to your screen. I saw this movie not knowing anything at all about it, with no expectations, and yet it has been one of the best films I have seen. This film takes any genre you can think of to its maximum: drama, suspense, horror, action, vengeance, happiness, sadness, and many more. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is simply just that good. Hands down the best movie of 2019."
PARASITE,4 January 2020,9/10,Great film - one of the best in the last couple of years
PARASITE,2 February 2020,2/10,"The beginning of this film is fun and it reminds of a sitcom. Unfortunately, ending and movie's message are disappointing.If you are a normal, non-envious and not frustrated person you presume that the poor Kim family is ""parasiting"" on the rich Park family, using tricks and lies - which by any standard is NOT ok.
However in the end director is sending a different message.The rich family is somehow ""parasiting"" on the poor family and the director tries desperately to depict them as stupid and naive people that only care about themselves even though the poor family lies, steals, and kills.Through this film, the director shows his childish views of the world where income inequality must never exist and if you're poor it's okay to commit crimes because boo-hoo I'm poor give me money.It is a shame because it starts as a promising movie but it ends up too political."
PARASITE,29 August 2019,9/10,"Written and Directed by Bong Joon-Ho, Parasite evolves into something so gripping and unusual. While this would be seen as a thriller by many, it's also a dark comedy. This can often a very difficult thing to pull of, as too many tones can often leave an audience confused and disengaged. It also plays to audience's expectations only to then completely subvert them when you think you know whats going to happen. Parasite executes this all of these elements amazingly through Bong Joon-Ho's incredible direction and writing. Dialogue has depth and sounds organic. The themes that Parasite explores really hit home by the end of the movie and takes us to some unexpectedly emotional resolutions of character arcs. The cast which consists of Woo-sik Choi, Hye-jin Jang, So-dam Park and long term collaborator Kang-ho Sang, are all at the top of their game here, with an especially phenomenal performance by Kang-ho Sang. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hung returns with might be his best work yet. The sound design is great and the score fits perfectly and helps add to the tension of the movie.All of these elements combine to make an incredibly satisfying movie, while also being highly re-watchable. When introducing someone to foreign language movie, this would be one the first i'd recommend."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be ""woke"".Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being bornBong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,10/10,Amazing storyline with truth and depiction of difference between two class of our social stigma.
PARASITE,28 March 2020,5/10,Story line is good but not something new. Screen play little slow at times. Acting is not that great.
PARASITE,13 April 2020,10/10,"The Best Movie in the history Of cinema, great actors"
PARASITE,9 September 2019,10/10,"Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!"
PARASITE,23 February 2020,6/10,"Average movie and I still don't get it how this movie won the academy award for the best motion picture of the year.
It felt like it would never end."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,1/10,Now I understand why Trump said: 'What the hell was that about?'
PARASITE,13 June 2020,5/10,Looks great. Tired plot. If you didn't know what was going to happen you need to probably read some books or watch more movies. Something. Seriously.
PARASITE,5 January 2020,1/10,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie."
PARASITE,14 March 2020,3/10,"The movie is bad quality, and seeing people trying to feel good about their social sensibility upon a garbage like this is to see how lost people are nowadays."
PARASITE,7 November 2021,5/10,"This movie is barely mediocre. Usually IMDB and my tastes rank spot on, but this is the biggest chasm between our ratings. Terrible people, you don't want to like a single one, boring plot and even worse ending."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,"A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it.
Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot."
PARASITE,11 March 2020,9/10,"The score and the overall tone of the movie is so excellently filmed, each scene draws you in and you're not sure quite what will happen next."
PARASITE,8 May 2020,10/10,Never seen a movie like this before. It was brilliant.
PARASITE,23 February 2020,1/10,"I don't understand high ratings for this and I don't understand the Oscar award. Grasping vicious characters abound; bloodbath and no redeeming message. I rarely walk out of movies and stayed through this one to the awful end, but I had to force myself to stay in my seat. Hated it."
PARASITE,15 March 2020,7/10,I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
PARASITE,15 November 2020,10/10,Movie starts with a simple family story and slowly take it up for a ride and then a hard fall
PARASITE,26 March 2020,1/10,"The movie has no plot, no action, no development. It's boring and absurd. The whole time I was hoping something to happen and I ended deeply disappointed."
PARASITE,22 June 2020,3/10,"I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!!
Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious.
I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see."
PARASITE,8 March 2020,1/10,"First, for the film to make sense you need to believe at least four things about Koreans: all those who are poor can turn into skilled con artists on a dime, all those who are rich are gullible disinterested idiots, all Koreans are despicable, and Koreans from the same family never look alike ... or maybe all Koreans look alike, then no one can't tell if Korean people are related or not based on the way they look...Second, ""Parasite"" is actually two films: the first one, a kind of comedy, somehow funny, in which you don't follow characters but their schemes; and the second one, a kind of drama/thriller without tragedy, nor mystery, nor surprising, nor excitement, nor sadness ... a film that I would call ""What?""Third, deus ex machinas. Brilliant. The midpoint came from nowhere and switched the entire pace and genre. Then, a plague happened. Yes, a plague. Literally. Like in the Bible, but without the fantasy, the rubbish moral, nor the divine purpose that normally comes in a peplum. Nothing. And, the funny part is, just before the first deus ex machina, I thought: ""This film is going nowhere."" Well, the writers thought as well, so...Fourth, all the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end. What's the point? Was I supposed to care about someone? Might as well do a film featuring families of parasites! No, wait... Moreover, and this is the biggest weakness of the film, the characters are not developed. They are all one-dimensional people and they never evolve, only your perspective of them could change when then go through the deus ex machinas, but nothing of interest. And as the relationships between the characters are not exploited nor elaborated, when something positive or negative happens, we don't care.Fifth, if you want to create metaphors, write poetry. I need a story. Avoid at all cost, it's a waste of time. I gave it a point because I had to read subtitles, and reading is good for my brain."
PARASITE,9 December 2019,10/10,"It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!!
People need to watch this!!!!"
PARASITE,24 March 2020,9/10,"Satisfying and unexpected unfolding of plot.
Put you through different emotional states during its runtime
Despite of conflict in mind about actors and villain, all characters are equally valuable. You will care for each of them.
It almost covers all of the genre"
PARASITE,22 August 2021,2/10,"The idea of parasites was good but how they built the drama was totally rushed. They just wanted to jump right into the intense ironical situations of the parasite family so bad that they forgot building a strong opening. Like how on earth can amateurs play professional roles that easily? That was totally nonsense. A seasoned businessman can't realise something wrong with his driver who fakes years of experience after talking with him (for days)? Of course they can learn but the way they turned the daddy into a skillful driver overnight was insane. Also his boy and girl who plays perfectly those roles of intellectuals made it look impractically easy. Come on, the topic was potential and the directior's talent was on point some times but this was absolutely rushed. Too dramatic and not practical enough. It needs remaking on another level as the topic is worth it."
PARASITE,21 July 2019,3/10,"Obviously overrated plain movie about social cheating. Surprisingly, the movie was well-received by Korean fans..."
PARASITE,25 December 2019,10/10,"I don't know whether if it's just me but each member of the ""parasitic"" family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves. It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on-screen.
The film starts out portraying the Kim family, their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich. A ""lucky stone"" introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait, clinging to the narrator throughout the plot. The all-too-powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon.
One of them leading to the protogonists' running away from the affluent Park's home after an eventful night. This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers. This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me- the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of ""actions gone too far"" makes you feel for them.
The transformation that the narrator's father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio- economic casteism that is present in our world.
A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!"
PARASITE,17 December 2019,9/10,"Happening once every dacade , strong story , amazing acting and a very good pictures"
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,"WOWIf you see this one movie this year, make sure it's Parasite.I will remember this movie for a long time. So funny yet so dark towards the end of this excellent film. Bong Joon Ho deserves every award he has one for this absolute gem. Please see this movie!"
PARASITE,9 January 2020,9/10,"Really mundane and heartfelt until it's not! Exhilarating, edge of your seat thriller!"
PARASITE,21 May 2020,5/10,After all stories I was expecting a 8-9 rating movie. I was sad. Yes it's good for South korea but not for all world.
PARASITE,29 January 2020,8/10,"Well,this is a pretty decent movie.It is well written and its cinematography and background music is brilliant.I enjoy the tension it brings me everytime the Ki family was almost be caught.It is woefully that there are still gap between the rich and the poor.Like other good movies,there are no certan villian or hero in this movie.Despite this,I still can't get into this film.It is just not my type."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best films I've ever seen. Amazing. If you've not seen it yet, stop reading this and go watch it."
PARASITE,19 February 2020,8/10,"Usually I don't like movies, where i have to read subtitles, because movie is in foreign language, but in this case - i have to say - all in this movie was perfect - actors, directors work, writers...in these 2hours and 12 minutes i was excited to see how the movie will end up.
And I'm glad to say and knew, that this is Oscar winning movie.
Bong Joon Ho have to make a lot of new movies to our next generation."
PARASITE,21 February 2020,1/10,"Beautiful scenery. Wonderful acting. Worst plot, ending. I want my money back."
PARASITE,19 November 2019,10/10,"Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special."
PARASITE,25 January 2020,,"One of my best films, rarely comes across such a fascinating work that satisfies the soul's need to receive and taste creativity and art. According to Hegel, the soul also has its needs,i think that the parasite has fulfilled it."
PARASITE,15 June 2020,8/10,"An intriguing deep dive into class systems that pushes the cinematic needle. Parasite teeters on disturbing and rather brilliant, as the film progresses you begin to straddle the line of empathy for a less fortunate family that succumbed to the greed of man and a well off family's laughable negligence. The cinematography is amazing, the use of angles throughout the course of the film really drives home the class metaphor thats pushed throughout the movie. Some really stellar performances all around, definitely a must watch."
PARASITE,18 February 2020,6/10,"Solid-to-good movie (would almost give a 7) that I definitely enjoyed. It's got Bong's style and especially his tone written all over it, which is characteristically simultaneously all over the place (in this case, goofy, tense, thrilling, emotional, tragic, violent, and even reminiscent of Oceans 11) and seamlessly interwoven without feeling sudden moving one from one feeling to the other, which is something I don't know any other director to pull of so well. But that's something you can say about most of the guy's films.It's a ""fun"" move but that's where it stops more or less. Yeah, there's OMG THEMES and CLASS, but throwing those in doesn't change the movie.I'd go through the things that lessen the film for me, but I've typed enough as is, and the issues are pretty apparent on your second/third viewing.Don't know, it's a fine movie, but there were GREAT ones that people don't bat an eye over.I just dread hearing people talking about this and saying ""OMG DID U EVER TRY WATCHING KOREAN MOVIES BEFORE???"" It's sure happened to me. I hope it dies down.All in all, it's a decent, well-placed movie with masterful use of tone, but Cannes and the Oscars and all the people on this very site raving could do so much better. I just hope the movie will be a gateway for people rather than being that movie that lets you say ""Hey, I've seen FOREIGN films before!"""
PARASITE,1 May 2020,9/10,"Couldn't predict anything that would happen!! So good. Even when you don't want to watch you can't take your eyes off the screen
You might refrain yourself from watching it because it its in Korean, but looking back on it you don't even remember you read the entire story. Definitely worth it!!"
PARASITE,24 December 2019,10/10,One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.
PARASITE,10 April 2020,1/10,Spoiler alert. the moral is pathetic. There is no need to explain such a story. there's no point killing a lot of people almost for pleasure.
PARASITE,24 December 2019,10/10,Simply Amazing. The movie has a little bit of everything. One of the best films I've seen.
PARASITE,13 September 2020,10/10,Lanthimos meets Ken Loach somewhere in Korea aand they direct an artistic version of Shameless.
PARASITE,16 February 2020,1/10,I can't begin to explain how horrible this movie is. I painfully watched the whole movie expecting it be good. If I can rate it a negative I would
PARASITE,27 May 2021,10/10,"Parasite masterpiece in this decade, excellent work."
PARASITE,20 January 2020,2/10,"Underlining that every taste is different. I just have to say that my experience was too boring, there were even non-sense moments. Like every bad movie."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,10/10,"This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it."
PARASITE,13 November 2019,9/10,"Often we come across this saying that ""Ignorance is not the same as innocence"" and another saying that ""Ignorance is bliss"". This film captures them both. On the one hand there are the Kims, a family of four living in sorrowful condition in a semi basement structure, on the other hand there's the wealthy Park family, living in a rich neighborhood uptown. But with riches, comes ignorance. An eventful twist in the tale for the Kim family, leads all of them being employed by the Parks and how they start to feed off their hosts, just like a parasite, much to the ignorance of the ignorance of the Park family. When all things seem to be settled for the Kims, there comes another turn of events which gives the film a deeper metaphorical narrative. Parasite is one of such pictures that makes you look into the society you live in, makes you uncomfortable at times and questions your ignorance. You may think that your housemaid is working for you but is she really? Would you trust your car driver? Or your child's tutor?"
PARASITE,13 January 2020,10/10,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."
PARASITE,16 July 2019,1/10,"This movie is too over rated. I think it suite for 5/10. Its boring and had a bad ending for a 2.5 hours Movie.
I think it better for you to just watch from the review of other people."
PARASITE,16 February 2020,10/10,An extraordinary film and a rarity to see a film which is so startlingly original. I can't wait to see more of this director's work.
PARASITE,10 July 2019,9/10,"This film tell us about movie is not about budget, but we (filmmaker) can run with idea"
PARASITE,13 June 2020,3/10,"Summary: Grade 3 out of 10 for me. He is totally with globalist ideas, class struggle between poor and rich. The people rated it 10 out of 10, saying that the film opens their minds to new perspectives, but if you haven't seen the difference between rich and poor today, you must live on another planet. It depicts the revolt of the poor against the rich in a crude way, in addition they commit crimes and end up returning to a worse life than before. They had to revolt with the government that does not promote any improvement. So I mean, I'm poor and I'm going to go around committing crimes, being a criminal, but against the government I don't do anything? What a disappointment."
PARASITE,7 March 2020,10/10,It has been a longtime since I've had a viewing experience so unique for an initial watch and even more unique for the rewatch. There is so much to appreciate about this film on a surface level and even more the deeper you look into it. Simply put amazing. This film is best to see when you don't know too much about the plot.
PARASITE,13 August 2020,7/10,"It is definitely not a bad movie, but i feel like it is hyped up way too much.
The acting seems a little over the top a lot of the time.
The message is pretty clear, but that does not make the movie stand out.
Nice movie to pass some time, but in my opinion nit the masterpice a lot of people make it out to be.
Maybe I didn't get the message or maybe it's just not that good"
PARASITE,1 February 2020,10/10,"This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece"
PARASITE,17 August 2019,10/10,"This is a kind of a movie where you can never be disappointed. It is funny, it is ironic, it is still obsessing me"
PARASITE,11 March 2020,10/10,"It is simply beautiful. It is best to go into the movie with no knowledge of anything about it, and not having seen the trailers or read anything about it. Not having expectations made it much more exciting. I cannot recommend the movie enough, to really anyone who loves film and is willing to give it a chance. It won the Oscar for a reason. In my opinion, it very much deserved it."
PARASITE,11 April 2020,7/10,"Clever idea but ended up being farcical.
Excellent acting and original plot however how it ended up into a murder spree is where it was let down."
PARASITE,12 March 2020,5/10,"Are u serious? This movie not deserve the best movie oscar. I think "" oscar goes to 1917 "".."
PARASITE,10 February 2020,1/10,"Wondering what's the purpose behind this scenario, I hate it in all details."
PARASITE,7 August 2019,4/10,"I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.Subpar."
PARASITE,27 December 2020,9/10,"Parasite represents the example of a movie illustrating the social gap between the poor and the rich. With it's absurd language, utilizes a lot of theatrical elements. I recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh and cry at the same time. This movie will make you think about your place in society, but it will not make you sorry for occupying that place. There are a lot of movies about thic topic, but most of them take themselves too seriously, and their goal is to awake guilt in the spectator, thus the true message will be hidden under that feeling. In contrary, Parasite uses the language of humor, irony and absurdity. I think Bertolt Brecht would be proud of this masterpiece."
PARASITE,29 January 2020,4/10,It's not interesting. The director's excessive force has some emotions that cannot be expressed.
PARASITE,21 February 2020,5/10,"I finally gave up and watched this movie. There was so much hype around it, I was definitely intrigued.After a careful watch, I think we are in front of a weak movie. From a technical point of view, nothing to say about it: nice craft, beautiful photography. In-house scenes are delightful. The flood scene is perfect. Very interesting camera angles. Nice analogy by putting the poor in the bottom and the rich on top. This is clear when three members of the poor family are leaving the rich family house after the coffee table scene: they are headed home under the rain, and they go down and down and down till they get home. Corporal odor references are clever.My point about this movie is that we don't have a real story here. Instead, it's a social gag. The movie starts very slow and for more than one hour something that should not be possible at all (the poor family becoming a parasite of the rich family) happens in front of us in form of a perfect plan that works as a charm. The pace, though, is very slow and the whole situation is unlikely to say the least.After that, something unexpected happens (the housekeeper re-appears) and the whole story kind of accelerates. Couple of funny things happen, but Bong Joon-Ho looks a little bit lost. The plan, apparenty, is to set up everything so we can fit the usual ultra violent scene that every movie/tv show needs to capture the audience's attention. The strategy of the poor family moves all of a sudden from perfect to disastrous, the climax scene (fortunately) is short enough so we can easily forget about it and after that even some more weird things happen (the scene in the hospital is almost stupid, so it is the ending). Some characters are over-used (like the rich family mother) and some others are almost forgotten when they are super interesting (the young kid of the rich family), ... Even the sequence order in the second half of the movie is in my opinion wrong.Parasite is not a terrible movie and we live in a society full of people that will enjoy the main metaphor being depicted by Bong Joon-Ho, but by no means we are in front of a masterpiece."
PARASITE,5 April 2020,8/10,"The mastery of time and space is ingenious. It reflects the opposition between the rich and the poor,exposing the frustration of the bottom society."
PARASITE,24 February 2020,1/10,"Either I am living in an alternate universe - or this movie is being reviewed by paid reviewers in favor of promoting Parasite.I left the cinema after an hour. I haven't done that in 10 + years.
Incredibly boring movie.
Overacting pervasive.
Story-line pedestrian.
Give it a wide birth..don't waste your money , or more importantly your time on this movie."
PARASITE,22 November 2019,9/10,"A family with few resources, mother, father, son and daughter live in a sordid basement in a poor neighbourhood in Seoul. They don´t have a permanent job, they survive by doing temporary employment, nor can they pay for the necessary studies so that children can progress in the workplace. Thanks to a university friend, the son will be able to give private lessons to the newly adolescent of a rich family living in a large house, in which the whole family will gradually be placed. A relaxed night of fun in the absence of the owners will become, under an intense downpour and surprising discoveries, into a stressful nightmare, and from this kind social comedy a crazy thriller will be born that will mutate into black comedy.It has a very good narrative rhythm, it is a constant ascension of a ""harder still"" that surprises you at each inflection, and when it reaches its zenith you are already wondering what small mistake they will make that will cause everything to be discovered or, what new impersonation they will be imagining and thus, absolute chaos will arrive in a thrilling way that will leave you breathless. It's how to ride a roller coaster! The thing does not end here, there is a conclusion narrated in the first person by the protagonist that seems to leave everything clear, where both surprises and new dreams emerge. Bright, very bright!
Everything fits perfectly, the two families seem real, and the actors do an excellent job, all of them, the comparison between the two houses is dazzling, the script is brilliant and has a good photograph director and a very good director. A film that no one who likes cinema can miss or who is minimally interested in the current social trends can miss it.Punctuation: 8,7/10"
PARASITE,12 February 2020,1/10,"Worst movie by far I have ever watched.
Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring.
How did this even got nominated...?
How was this even released!???
I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize.
Don't waste a single second of your life watching that."
PARASITE,22 July 2020,5/10,"After watching this ""masterpiece"", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out.
I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge ""WHAT!?"" feel, which never came.
Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected.
I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho."
PARASITE,6 January 2020,10/10,"It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!"
PARASITE,3 February 2020,10/10,Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!
PARASITE,23 October 2019,10/10,"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it."
PARASITE,29 November 2020,9/10,"Well written. the ending was amazing, left me with an open space so my imagination could fill it as i would like."
PARASITE,14 April 2020,9/10,The architectural design of the building has made a special contribution to the film
PARASITE,4 January 2020,9/10,"Amazing music, amazing plot, fantastic pacing which really makes you pay attention throughout the whole movie. Interesting story with some deepness to it - I live in Denmark and thankfully the distance between the lower and upper class is honestly not that big and the perspective Parasite gave me made me appreciate this even more.I also appreciate the directors continuous comment on global warming like in Snowpiecer - another film I enjoyed, the difference between how the rich and the poor handles rain is brilliant, and the way that enter sequence was filmed really was outstanding. Parasite is definitely my favourite movie of his so far."
PARASITE,9 February 2020,3/10,"The fact that there are such a ridiculous number of 10/10 reviews proves most of them are not genuine. Who cares about the ""clever"" metaphors when a movie just fizzles out into an absurd and unbelievable nonsense conclusion."
PARASITE,12 December 2020,10/10,The plot of this film is captivating. The cinematography is simply amazing. I'll be watching this title several times a year.
PARASITE,2 August 2019,9/10,"Le film commence pour la comédie, tout d'un coup Pour la tragédie et terminé de manière romantique."
PARASITE,28 February 2020,10/10,"The cinematic excellence of this film is one of a kind. It has such an original approach to its meaning and thought process for each scene. This film is one like no other. The fact that it has subtitles adds to the raw feeling and authenticity of the film. Giving each character a real element. It has so many genuinely intelligent plays, you have to watch it more than once to explore its excellence. The first time you watch it, you will be captured by the emotional and breathtaking journey it takes you on, and then the second time, you will be able to appreciate the brilliance of each mirrored scene, each tactical foreshadow and each hint that as a first time watcher you would be sure to miss. It has an outstanding, in-depth analysis and projection of the upper and lower class separations; each one of these being shown throughout and uniquely. Highly, highly recommended, I will keep this film as one of my greats for a long long time."
PARASITE,12 February 2020,10/10,"I loved this movie so much!
The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist.
All my friends who watched it liked and so did I.
I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language.
Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.
After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films."
PARASITE,19 July 2020,9/10,"Lovely lineup, a great way to present data in a short interval. Title matches with story...."
PARASITE,18 November 2019,10/10,"Edit:
After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it.
Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.
I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry.
After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films.
I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder.
But there are many that I've yet to watch.
What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much.
I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line.
I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.So, regarding Parasite.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT!
Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer.
This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was!
My spoiler-free thoughts:
This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius!
All praise to director Bong!
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural.
When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"".
So, respect to the professionals.
This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless."
PARASITE,2 February 2020,8/10,"It was not bad, but honestly I don't understand how this movie can get a single 10 star review from some people. This movie is simply overrated."
PARASITE,15 February 2020,3/10,"The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day ""Slumdog Millionaire"". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like ""Slumdog"" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was."
PARASITE,17 May 2020,4/10,Over hyped. How can successful people be shown so dumb that they won't even bother to validate facts.Quite a sily movie over hyped. Not worth
PARASITE,18 August 2019,10/10,This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor
PARASITE,30 October 2019,10/10,"THATS THE WHOLE POINT!
ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a ""feel good movie"" to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed... the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such... so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families.. Are the rich really ""evil"" for ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? How people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad.."
PARASITE,8 December 2020,9/10,"It's weird how a movie can be so disturbing yet so hilarious at the same time, as well as a lot of gruesome moments towards the end. The acting was excellent and the scenes were not predictable which is what made it very intriguing. Not going to lie, my heart was racing in some of the scenes. 100% recommend watching this movie, truly a masterpiece."
PARASITE,13 September 2021,10/10,"In the opening scene the family is underground where is sad and dark=(povert), as Kim's family moves toward they move in to the light=(hope,wealth), how ever when the things fall apart, light disappeared and the family moves back to darkness, the final shot reflects the firts one but now is way more darker. Also when the rain star they ran many stairs signifying that they are going back to where they come from. And also in the begging the dad said he hates cockroaches but at the end he becomes one."
PARASITE,5 May 2020,5/10,Good film but not an oscar... or not should be an oscar!
PARASITE,20 January 2020,3/10,"3-Star for the amazing house and some of the cinematography, but nothing compares to the cinematography of some of the other epic films. The other 7-star for a film that's makes Dumb and Dumber and Mr Bean masterpieces."
PARASITE,16 March 2020,10/10,"Saw it in black and white, the score is fantastic, and balanced horrifying topics with hilarious ones. A MASTERPIECE"
PARASITE,16 April 2020,10/10,"This movie was immensely fun to watch! My wife and I heard a lot of buzz around this so we decided to give it a watch for ourselves. Acting was a 10/10 with a unique story that was executed 10/10 with fantastic cinematography and directing 10/10. I can't say enough about this movie, it's a MUST WATCH. On a side note going into the movie me and the wife watched the trailer but didn't get much out of it, GOOD! The less you know going into this, the more you will enjoy it!"
PARASITE,9 July 2020,9/10,I like it very very very very very very very very very much👍
PARASITE,14 August 2020,10/10,"* SPOILERS *this isnt meant to be helpful i just wanna give it 10 stars lmaoi remember seeing this on the airplane not knowing the hell i was going into ... yet i felt so satisfied at the end
.. I DO think that the son , its been a while since ive watched it again , wasnt able to get the house. since the imagery of him in such a suit and seeing his dad all in his letter. i mean bong joon ho did pan the camera back to the son just at their sewer home. but hey thats for u to figure out 👀"
PARASITE,19 October 2021,10/10,"Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' hits all the right notes. It's characters, story, twists and turns really drive home an unforgettable experience.10/10⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟"
PARASITE,22 February 2020,9/10,Best story telling climax is mind-blowingBest characterisations
PARASITE,6 December 2020,10/10,"Love it, I watch this In march, and think, how they can do a movie with no mistake in anything?))"
PARASITE,5 February 2020,9/10,"Inspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one..
So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues..."
PARASITE,26 June 2020,9/10,"I feel like this film deserves all the praise it gets.It is nearly impossible to say what genre this one belongs in; there are just so many contradicting emotions. As with perhaps any film, try to watch this with as little knowledge as possible - and prepare for a rollercoaster."
PARASITE,26 July 2020,10/10,"In the beginning the film was a bit strange (black humor). But I didn't find that disturbing at all. I cannot summarize the film, because otherwise I would betray the whole film. The film was just very, very well made and there is also a lot of humor in the film."
PARASITE,29 April 2020,10/10,"This movie had me speechless.
it literally covers all the genres and the message behind is a thing we should all consider once again.
the actors, the catchiness, THE SCENARIO. it's an absolute masterpiece.y'all should watch this movie
and when you're done, watch it again.."
PARASITE,14 November 2019,10/10,"Compelling characters, gripping plot, Parasite everything a movie should be. Stupefyingly unpredictable, it's remarkably refreshing and leaves you drop jawed at its conclusion."

PARASITE,26 April 2020,6/10,This is ok ok for me... If u like that type of movies then watched Trapped (bollywood) movie.
PARASITE,14 April 2020,10/10,This movie is must watch.What goes around comes around.
PARASITE,13 May 2020,8/10,During the Coronavirus Quarantine I've watch this movie although it's in Korean i still liked the movie.
PARASITE,22 June 2021,10/10,"With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il) as the film rapidly moves from one plot point to another. It results in a gripping yet poignant watch. The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch."
PARASITE,22 July 2019,10/10,"Honstly i never feel the need to write review but this one.. Wow i cant say anything coz it will ruin the surprise. But really , you would get out from the cinema feeling a mixture of everything.This is genius. 🙌🏻🙌🏻"
PARASITE,17 January 2020,10/10,Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!
PARASITE,29 February 2020,10/10,"Nothing more needs be said about this movie. If you haven't watched it yet, do so immediately."
PARASITE,3 January 2020,9/10,Parasite is just like that worm in the film you'll notice later in the film when.
PARASITE,20 February 2020,10/10,Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time.
PARASITE,6 May 2020,8/10,"Depicts the life, thinking and work culture of people living in a slum in a very crude sense."
PARASITE,17 August 2020,10/10,"I went in thinking it would be completely over-hyped and that the park family would be archetypal immoral rich people, but all the characters were well rounded, and although I didn't share Mr. Kim's viewpoint it is completely understandable. Parasite got its message across without being textbook, rich-people-bad post-modernist drivel, I didn't feel like my class was being criticized for no reason. The whole 2nd half had my jaw on the floor and gripping my seat, while the 1st half had my laughing every few lines. This movie is well worth the watch, and entirely lived up to the hype"
PARASITE,4 May 2020,10/10,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.
Never expected, from the cast to director.
I forced my friends to watch and everybody agreed with me."
PARASITE,1 February 2020,7/10,"This is a good film...a one time watch...but, nothing special about it....Just like the other OSCAR Nominated and winner films, the reason behind such a regular film to have such big release, talks and recognition is, it has made fun of Kim jong un and North Korea...just in between the scenes.....this film fall under the category of 'Brag about America or Curse it's enemy'....Again, just a one time watch!!!!"
PARASITE,15 October 2019,9/10,"From smart comedy to a violent drama in the best way I ever seen, from now on I will start taking Korean movies as serious as I ever did before, there is no way you gonna hate this peace of art"
PARASITE,19 February 2020,6/10,The only thing I agree with the critics on is that it would have been better in black & white. I mean it's a nice film but not an Oscar winner.
PARASITE,12 April 2020,5/10,"Has a good moral but not a good movie to watch.
The movie starts of good and seems interesting but eventually it becomes worse as the movie goes on.
Surely not a feel good but kind of a family crime drama."
PARASITE,24 January 2021,6/10,"It was pretty dang good man, I just personally thought it was a bit overrated. Maybe I'm to simple to get the major messages of the film, but hey man, check it out. This movie is a piece of film history."
PARASITE,4 January 2021,10/10,This movie is damn ...#masterpiece#fun#darkcomedy#oneofthebestmovie# ........such a different concept 💡 ✨ 😍
PARASITE,24 June 2020,9/10,"It is one of best film i watched. It brilliantly shows the greed, dark secrets and other emotions."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,8/10,"Although its a good piece of film making, I have some points to raise... The thing with ""parasite"" is that it puts one random unexpected event after the other, and sometimes it works pretty well, but sometimes it doens't... you reach the end and you wonder why dit it happened this way... maybe I ditn't get something, but this is what I got from the film..."
PARASITE,22 February 2020,10/10,"If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre. It's intense, gritty yet subtle like- rollercoaster inside of a maze- type journey will leave you speechless at the end of this masterpiece."
PARASITE,14 February 2020,10/10,"I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try."
PARASITE,29 February 2020,6/10,It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.
PARASITE,4 April 2020,9/10,Parasite is one of the best films in 2019 and the trailer goes in a completely different direction and does not spoil the whole film.
PARASITE,11 February 2020,7/10,"Just watched the movie and can't say it lives up to the hype around it. It had funny moments, thriller moments and a message. It was interesting overall but the ending could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this film to a friend, for instance. Not because it was bad but because I felt that it was missing something."
PARASITE,7 December 2019,7/10,Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..
PARASITE,14 February 2020,1/10,"I am happy people are giving a try to foreign-language films, but I couldn't consider this a masterpiece: The film is boring, predictable , the characters are really not interesting, and they made a really dramatic mood to make an obvious message, I don't see any necessity of exaggerating such a simple meaning. The rich and the poor cliché"
PARASITE,26 March 2020,10/10,This movie had me terrified the entire time which is incredibly rare. Easy 10. I've never experienced something like this.
PARASITE,14 August 2019,10/10,"Good movie to watch when u are boring
Really recommended!!"
