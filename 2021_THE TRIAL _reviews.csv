THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 August 2021,6/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" isa relatively new movie from 2020 and a co-production not only between the USA and UK, but also India which surprised me a bit. It runs for over two hours and was written and directed by Oscar-winning writer Aaron Sorkin, actually only his second movie as the man in charge behind the camera too. The first scored one single Oscar nomination, namely for his screenplay, the second (i.e. This one here) scored bigger, including a Best Picture nomination. Sorkin was also considered a potential winner for his writing once again, but came short this time. Maybe with his third film then. Seems as if he is getting in the groove. I will elaborate a little bit later on the story. What you should know for now is that the cast is pretty prominent here. British Oscars winners Redmayne and Rylance are on board. Sacha Baron Cohen is always easy to identify and he is the only one from the cast who scored major awards attention. Frank Langella has a great deal of screen time playing the main antagonist. Michael Keaton shows up briefly only, but plays a pretty significant character nonetheless. Also fairly telling he is clearly playing second fiddle to Redmayne again, just the way it was when it came to their clash at the Oscars a few years ago. But back to this one here: Even the lesser known actors like John Carroll Lynch, Jeremy Strong and Alex Sharp have decent recognition value. Oh and I must also mention J. C. MacKenzie. Not a key character he plays, but as a Dark Angel fan I shall not overlook him now around the age of 50. Oh yeah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is on board here too, but my enthusiasm linked to him is really not too big. Now you see this is a really male-dominated cast. We do have an actress playing Redmayne's character's girlfriend and another one playing an undercover agent, but that's it basically and they do not have a lot to work with. This of course also has to do with history as this film is set in the late 1960s, so over 50 years ago now, and everybody (or at least the majority of characters) you see in here is based on actual people.From the historic perspective I was struggling with the outcome though. I felt there were hardly no shades here and instead of really giving a truly accurate display of said trial, it felt more like a convenient choice to fit in with the political climate in 2021. The best (or worst) moment was maybe when Rylance's character asked another Black character if he can breathe. So blatantly obvious and honestly I am pretty glad that Sorkin did not win an Oscar for his screenplay here. The race aspect felt shoddy and rushed in. I am not sure to what extent there is really 100% credible evidence that the Black Panthers leader was beaten up while everybody in the courtroom was waiting. I guess his lawyer struggles and how he sat there gagged really happened like that and are based on actual happenings, but still. This was a key issue here and I truly felt that this movie was taking sides too much overall. Shades were missing entirely. Even JGL's character who was the closest to showing some character development by slightly swithcing to the good side (you can really say it like that) not only because he stands with everybody else in the end did not make much of an impact. There is a fitting moment relatively early on when all three (groups of) defendants are called the radical left, which is pretty accurate. They are just different in terms of style and manners. Honestly, with all the horrible crimes commited by the Black Panthers, I find it almost disgraceful how they are depicted in here and disrespectful to their victims. The leader is accused of murder, but of course he did not do it. He is severely discriminated against and one of the biggest victims in this movie. I mean it may be correct in this context, but people watching this film learn nothing about the Black Panthers at all. About who they really were.The deeper moments are tolerable, but not as great as they are presented to us. SBC's character's statement on being prosecuted because of his thoughts on a brief occasion was still among the finest moments, also thanks to his line delivery. I am not unhappy he got the Oscar nomination. Actually fairly fitting even with how he plays a stand-up comedian, even if his character does not want to be called like that. The crucial moment in the end, not just the list of the fallen, is when we find out about the blood that Redmayne's character is talking about and who it actually belongs to. Oh well. That was okay, but still felt a bit clumsy and difficult to believe in terms of how assuring it was that he really meant their own blood. And not the blood of the enemy or the police. The moment in which JCL's character becomes violent and apologizes to his family and we are supposed to understand that this blatant injustice brings out violence in even the most peaceful man? Well, did feel a bit written. I am sure that, even if the character had such an outburst in reality (and if there is video evidence including said outburst), what he tells his son early on was mostly scripted. Oh and yes, this film, despite occasional flashbacks and scenes outside the courtroom, is really a full-on depiction of the trial here. I like courtroom drama, but I can see how it may be a bit much for some.Let's talk a bit about the antagonist here. I don't mean the judge this time, but the prosecution. They are really evil, except JGL's character to some extent. Take a look at their dirty tricks to make sure some jurors have to leave. Or the idea with the undercover officer. Okay, she only belongs to them indirectly and actually is depicted as a smart woman. This is also where it became so obvious that they did not in any way want this film to have the slightest anti-female tendency with #metoo and everything still going on these days. She also develops some kind of liking for the defendants as we see during her face expression in the end and also how she will not leave the courtroom. As for the second woman, played by the stunning Alice Kremelberg, her perhaps biggest moment is when she gets an offensively racist call from people following the courtroom drama and those people are clearly right-wing (maybe far right-wing even) and they unleash in the most disgraceful and obscenes ways imaginable. Again, it felt more like about today's political climate than about the one back then. On a more positive side, SBC's ""Daddy, why???"" moment was perhaps the funniest thing I have come across all year in film. At the movie theater at least. Okay, I did not come across a lot, but I found this brief comment too funny and even had to smile from only thinking of it minutes afterwards. It was maybe these scenes that made it easy for Sacha Baron Cohen to get in at the Oscars. His successful second movie may have helped too, so they wanted to give him one acting nomination at least. Of course, also that his character here was not just a clown, but also pretty smart. Look at his Nixon comment or also when he clashes intellectually with Redmayne's character. But also what he had to say immediately afterwards made sure things are put into perspective again. His character just could not stay serious in the long run. Kinda sad to see he commited suicide eventually, even if it was many years later.Overall, I was nicely entertained by this movie, but as I said this may also have to do with the fact that I like courtroom drama. Others may appreciate it less from this perspective. I am still fairly generous with my rating, because in my opinion this film and the exact outcome are definitely a lost opportunity. Lacks shades, lacks real authentic depth and as a consequence also lacks historic significance. Moments like the judge saying he has never beenn accused of being racist towards Blacks and what follows immediately afterwards may feel funny for a second, but if you look at it from a more neutral perspective, I must also say it really felt pretty gimmicky, maybe even in a way that had the film try to hide its (nonetheless obvious) shortcomings between shenigans like this. The more I think about this movie, the less I like it. Sad, but true. My rating on rewatch is certainly more likely to go down two stars. Literally no chance of going up and that's a pity because I think Sorkin here had a cast at his disposal that could have turned this film into something really extraordinary. I am not surprised though that liberal Hollywood (among others) ended up being a massive sucker for this film (also with the SAG Awards win for the ensemble) because it really fits the current political climate. In the end, from my unbiased perspective a close call, but for now I give the outcome a hesitant thumbs-up and positive recommendation. With other actors though and a different setting, it would not have been enough. The script gets a thumbs-down from me overall. You can watch this film if you like, but it's not close to a must-see. Not even remotely close."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 February 2021,6/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is Aaron Sorkin's fictionalised account of the protest marches at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago which turned into a violent confrontation with the police.The film leaves little doubt that the protest movement was infiltrated by law enforcement acting as agent provocateurs. The police were looking for a fight.In some ways the film's structure is inspired by the sprawling and free wheeling The Big Short.It is one way to deal with the disparate characters that represented different strands of the 1960s protest movement.The defendants consisted of Yippies Abbie Hoffman (Sasha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong.) Pacifist David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch.) Social activist Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne.) Black Panther leader Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and protesters Rennie Davis, John Froines and Lee Weiner. The latter three were seen likely to get off so the jury would not feel so conflicted for finding the others guilty.The defence was led by the radical lawyer William Kunstler (Mark Rylance.) Seale had his own different lawyer who fell ill and so was denied an adjournment and the right to speak for himself at trial. At one point he appears in court bound and gagged.The prosecution led by Tom Foran (JC MacKenzie) and Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) were told by President Nixon's new attorney general to get a conviction at any cost.This was a political trial. A kangaroo court that turned into a circus in no small part by the bad tempered mean biased Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella.)Sorkin as director has trouble dealing with the material. Hoffman and Rubin play it for laughs when the trial starts. Hayden is the reasonable one. However this trial was weary, tiresome and divisive.Sorkin makes it too clinical and bland when it should had been messy and gritty. Although by the end tempers are frayed as Judge Hoffman throws contempt charges like confetti.It was a misstep to make Schultz appear reasonable when the real life person did not appear to be so.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an interesting movie but it should had been a better film. There is an element of smugness and hollowness about it. Sorkin wants to remind the viewers that things are not much different for the protest movement in 2020 under Trump's America."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,8/10,"This is another remake of the Trial. I believe I have seen them all unless there was an all African-American Broadway musical. In this one they didn't play ""the song"" which is required during the credit role. Jeremy Strong played Jerry Rubin like he was Rick Moranis. What was that all about?Remakes of trials are never done for no reason. This one was anti-Trump if you read between the lines. It includes Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton) claiming the President is not the AG client. We see the interpretation of the laws stretched to suit the political needs of the President. We see a judge appointed and rules against accepted norms in order to prejudice a trial. There was government witness tampering. It was a political trial.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2020,9/10,"Ah well ... I mean even without the current Potus trying to undermine the US elections with trial after trial - while being in denial ... even without that there are some similarities I reckon you can see here. Not too blunt and on the nose of course. So don't get overly excited, this is not about Trump - well not in an obvious sense.It is about a goverment that does not take its protestors for full people. What we get to see here (and man is this edited well, with powerhouse performances, not to mention great dialog) is heartbreaking and really almost crazy. Things you would not expect the American justice system would allow to happen. For the movie to work, you have to have a great villain of course and Frank Langella is quite the treat in that role ... mesmerizing. I am a bit surprised by how subtle Gordon Levitt is going about his character ... but it is fitting. Some may have issues with Sasha Baron Cohen (you may think of Borat or Ali G when you see him and maybe even hear him) ... but he also performs amazingly.So this is a drama, that you may know story wise, but will nevertheless be as engaging as they get ..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 January 2021,8/10,"I can't say this wasn't a fascinating movie depicting the trial of the Chicago 7, but I also can't say whether everything you see on screen is one hundred percent accurate representing the facts of the case and the personalities and attitudes of the defendants. Of course you never get a completely well rounded view of events as they occur either, and virtually anything that anybody remembers about the rioting at the Democratic National Convention of 1968 is blurred in the flailing batons and teargas of the police battling hundreds of protestors. The passage of time, say half a century, would have the media characterize them as peaceful demonstrators and you would probably see very little of it on your national news. I thought the casting for the film was brilliant, particularly with Eddie Redmayne in the role of Tom Hayden, Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman, and Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin. What comes through in the film that wasn't very evident back in the day, was how different both ideologically and attitudinally the defendants were from each other, with Tom Hayden seeming the voice of reason among the Seven, while Hoffman and Rubin carried off their belligerent streak throughout the trial, along with the often repeated outbursts of Black Panther leader Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), included in the trial for a time until his presence was ordered a mistrial by Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella), at the recommendation of prosecuting attorney Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). As over the top and seemingly reckless and domineering as the judge was, the one thing you never get to see in the film is the jury actually delivering the verdict. It's made to seem like Judge Hoffman personally made good on a vendetta against the defendants when they were found guilty of incitement to riot. The idea that this was a political trial is brought up any number of times in the story, and it's probably a safe bet to accept the fact that it was, with your memories of those tumultuous days back in '68 flooding back if you were around when it all went went down."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 February 2021,6/10,"The film industry has suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic, but thankfully Awards Season is going ahead, and there are plenty of films that were starting to get nominations, including this one from Netflix, from Golden Globe nominated writer and Golden Globe nominated director Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, The Social Network, Molly's Game). Based on the true story, in August 1968, eight men prepare to protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. These men are: Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) leader Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Youth International Party (Yippies) founder Abbie Hoffman (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sacha Baron Cohen) and his co-founder Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), MOBE organiser and SDS organiser Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), community activist and social worker Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins), chemist and anti-war activist John Froines (Daniel Flaherty), and Black Panther Party chairman Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Five months later, all eight of them are arrested and charged with trying to incite a riot. Attorney General John N. Mitchell (John Doman) appoints Tom Foran (J. C. MacKenzie) and Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and Leonard Weinglass (Ben Shenkman). Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella) shows significant prejudice for the prosecution. Seale's attorney, Charles Garry, cannot attend due to illness, leading Judge Hoffman to insist that Kunstler represents all eight defendants, but this is rejected repeatedly by both Kunstler and Seale. Fred Hampton (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) supports Seale throughout, which Judge Hoffman assumes is legal help. Abbie Hoffman openly antagonises the court. Judge Hoffman is forced to remove jurors suspected of sympathising with the defendants and reported threats from the Black Panther Party. Judge Hoffman is also forced to charge the defendants and their attorneys with multiple counts of contempt of court. Numerous undercover local police officers and FBI agents testify. At the time of the convention, Hayden noticed two police officers tailing Davis who was arrested. Abbie and others led a protest to the police station where Hayden was being kept. They turned around and intended to return to the park, seeing the police blockade, with orders to disperse the crowd. A riot ensued, and the protestors clashed with police in an attempt to claim the hill. Kunstler makes a point that none of the defendants instigated the riot. Days later, the defendants learn that Fred Hampton was killed during a police raid. Seale continuously interrupts court proceedings speaking up for his constitutional rights. Eventually, Judge Hoffman orders him to be taken out, to be beaten, and he returns gagged and chained. The prosecution and defence object to the judge's order and Judge Hoffman declares Seale's case a mistrial, the remaining men become known as the ""Chicago Seven"". The defence decides to put Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton), Attorney General during the riots, on the stand. Judge Hoffman refuses to let him testify in front of the jury that he had declined to initiate prosecutions after the riots because of evidence that the Chicago Police Department instigated them. Dellinger punches a bailiff, resulting in his arrest. Kunstler presents a tape implicating Hayden to the defendants, and preps Hayden for a cross-examination. On the night of the riot, Davis tried to calm officers trying to arrest a young man climbing a flagpole. After the police clubbed Davis's head, an enraged Hayden exclaimed, ""If blood is going to flow, then let it flow all over the city!"". The defendants were eventually cornered by police, who removed their badges and proceeded to assault them. Abbie deduces that Hayden's comment was taken out of context, claiming he was supposed to say ""If our blood is going to flow...""; Hayden asks him to testify. In his testimony, Abbie reinforces that Hayden was misconstrued, and states his disdain for the U. S. government's leadership. At the end of the trial, Hayden uses the closing statement to name the 4,752 soldiers who were killed in the Vietnam War since the trial began. Judge Hoffman instructs and objects for him stop, while this act prompts many in the court to stand and cheer. The end text describes what happened to Abbie, Hayden, and Judge Hoffman after the trial. Also starring Caitlin FitzGerald as Agent Daphne O'Connor, Meghan Rafferty as Mrs. Dellinger, and Alan Metoskie as Allen Ginsberg. The standouts from the ensemble cast are Redmayne (with an impeccable American accent) as the clean-cut moderate, Langella as the easily agitated judge with a short fuse, and especially Baron Cohen as the prankster with a sharp mind and a dedication to cultural revolution, there is also terrific support from the likes of Rylance, Gordon-Levitt, Strong, Abdul-Mateen II and Keaton. Almost the entire film is set in the courtroom, with the occasional dips out to see the night of the riot, and the characters in their own circumstances, it illustrates the volatility of the times, and the dirty tricks employed that led to the unjust guilty verdict. There are admittedly the moments that get very chatty, and you have focus to understand all the facts brought forward in both arguments, but it has a terrific script and splendid performances, with the period and issues captured perfectly, a most worthwhile historical legal drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Aaron Sorkin, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Original Song for ""Hear My Voice"" for Celeste and Daniel Pemberton (also nominated the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Good!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed this brilliant film about the trial of the Chicago Seven, which took place In Chicago in 1969-1970.Actually the seven represented different groups, but no matter, they were all painted with the same brush. At the Democratic Party Convention in 1968, there were protests by a group of moderates, led by Tom Hayden and militant ""Yippies"" led by Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong. Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), accused of something else, had his trial finally severed from that of the Seven. These men were arrested and arraigned on charges of Conspiracy by the Nixon administration.The trial itself was a joke, led by Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella) who had obviously decided beforehand that these men were all guilty of conspiracy and inciting violence.The prosecution lawyer was the reluctant Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon Levitt), and on the defendant's side, the fiery William Kuntsler (Mark Rylance).The Yippies as they were called made constant disturbances during the trial, which upset the moderates. Seale was in court without a lawyer and not allowed to defend himself, finally appearing in court bound and gagged.The Chicago 7 were Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) , Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins).The acting was remarkable, with Cohen and Strong bringing some humor to the situation, Langella perfect as the hateful and prejudiced judge.Mark Rylance who in my opinion can do no wrong gives an excellent performance as Kuntsler, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job as a torn federal prosecutor Richard Schultz. As Bobby Seale, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is fantasticThis is a horrible segment of American history, during times very similar to those of today. The Vietnam War, killing thousands of soldiers and civilians, had made activists out of young people, all of whom approached protesting in different ways - some with violence, others attempting non-violence, and both being thwarted by both Mayor Daley and the police, free with their billy clubs and tear gas.When former attorney general Ramsey Clark testifies, away from the jury, that under Johnson, there were no indictments because the police started the violence, the judge refuses to let the jury hear his testimony.In the end, the men (including the attorneys) had racked up hundreds of contempt citations and the defendants were found guilty not of conspiracy, but of inciting a riot. As Ramsey Clark left the courtroom, he advised Kuntsler to ""Get started on your appeal"" - and as expected, all convictions were reversed, and the judge's career was over.As for the seven, Tom Hayden became a seven-term Senator; Hoffman committed suicide some years later, Bobby Seale (actually the 8th defendant) is still going strong, as is Rennie Davis; Dellinger, a writer, was actually arrested again in 1996 for doing a sit-in with Abby Hoffman's son; Hoffman himself committed suicide in 1989; Froines taught at university; Rubin invested in Apple but was killed in a car accident in 1994; Wiener went on to work for B'nai B'rith and to this day wants to bring down capitalism.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an excellent watch, and also interesting to read about.The ending of the film, with Tom Hayden's statement and the reaction of the federal prosecutor Schultz - very powerful and to be missed."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 December 2020,,It is a gripping court room drama which evokes emotions in the viewers.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 November 2020,10/10,Pretty funny. I like the bit with the Molotov cocktail.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,7/10,"Sorry, but I didn't get the memo: I'd never heard of this trial and by the end of it I can't say I was actually that interested. A rather disparate collection of acting talent portray an equally imbalanced group of left-wing/hippie/civil rights protesters charged after violent confrontations with police in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic Convention. The accused consist of Eddie Redmayne (Tom Hayden) and Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman) amongst seven who are (save for Hoffman) represented by prominent civil rights lawyer William Kunstler (Sir Mark Rylance) whilst the case for the Government is led by Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has been especially chosen by the US Attorney General, ostensibly to make sure an example is made of these ""hooligans"". As the story develops, somewhat predictably, it turns out that the real star of the whole film is Frank Langella as the Judge - Julius Hoffman - who has, what I can only rather kindly describe as, competence issues - and in this role Langella shines; he is excellent and puts the others in this rather routine, seen it all before courtroom drama, to shame. I dare say that this trial - like so many we are reading about these days was a pivotal moment in the constantly fluid and evolving scenario of the US Government's heavy handed treatment of it's citizens, but after a while these stories lose potency and just fuel the increasing image that the so-called ""land of the free"" is anything but. The last twenty minutes include some inter-cut actuality of the protests that augments it no end - but largely, for me, it's OK - nothing better."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 May 2021,8/10,"In August 1968 thousands of anti-Vietnam war protesters descend on the Democratic Party convention in Chicago. The protests become a riot as police and protesters clash. In 1969, with a new Republican government in office, seven of the leaders of the protesters are put on trial on trumped-up charges. This is their story.Great film. Writer-director Aaron Sorkin manages to take a politically-charged event and make it entertaining and interesting regardless of viewers' political leanings. By concentrating on the trial, and the injustice and heavy-handedness displayed, rather than trying to make an ideological or political statement, the film becomes accessible for everyone.Sorkin also gives the main characters a great deal of depth, helping the engagement. The witty dialogue, a Sorkin trademark, certainly aids his cause, turning what could have been a fairly dry story into a very entertaining one.Sacha Baron Cohen is the main beneficiary of the witty dialogue and proves the perfect vehicle for its delivery. I never thought I'd see him get an acting Oscar nomination (not because he's a bad actor but because he doesn't seem to have the gravitas or tend to get the serious, method-acting sort of roles that get acting Oscar noms) but he is great here and the nomination was well deserved."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 January 2021,6/10,"Aaron Sorkin, the smart-as-a-whip screenwriter, battles it out with Aaron Sorkin, the I-went-to-the-Ron-Howard-school-of-directing director, and hamminess wins the day.I was actually incredibly entertained by this movie while watching it. It preaches to the liberal progressive choir, of which I'm a card-holding member, and it decides that such things as nuance, subtlety, or even slightly different points of view are unnecessary clap trap and offers us instead the admittedly cathartic experience of a two-hour shout of outrage at our messed up culture. But hoo boy, is this movie pretty ridiculous. Even while I was being entertained by it, I knew I was being shamelessly manipulated, which I could tolerate for a while, but the end of this film, which plays against one of those blaringly self-righteous movie scores, would make even Steven Spielberg cringe.This movie is as watchable as it is because of the actors, and though there are many fine performances in this ensemble cast, I have to single out Mark Rylance, as the defense attorney for the 7, who deserves an Oscar for trying to make a serious movie out of Sorkin's superficial pap.Grade: B- (This is one of those movies that feels like an ""A"" while you're watching it, but sinks lower and lower in your esteem the more you think back on it)."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 October 2020,7/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Tom Hayden, Alex Sharpe, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Bobby Seale, Lee Weiner, and John Froines. Those were the defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot at the 1968 National Democrat Convention in Chicago. So why were there 8, when they are known as the Chicago 7? Well, writer-director Aaron Sorkin (Oscar winner for THE SOCIAL NETWORK, 2010) not only answers that question, but also fills in many of the blanks for those of us who have known only the highlights of the story.This story has been told many times before in books, articles, and other movies, but it's never before had Sorkin's focus on the spoken word and the transcripts pulled from the 1969 trial. For those familiar with Sorkin's work, his penchant for absurdly rapid and a bit too on-the-nose chatter is renowned. Here, he has assembled a truly superb cast that revels not just in the words, but in the historical aspect and the modern day relevance. There are a lot of characters to get familiar with, and Sorkin doesn't delay in introducing each of them by name and affiliation.Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne, Oscar winner for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, 2014) and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp) represent Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and are focused on the lives being lost in the war. Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Rubin) are the leaders of the Youth International Party (the Yippies) and their goal is to disrupt the system through chaos. Actual Boy Scout leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) is a conscientious objector and part of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, aptly nicknamed ""The Mobe"". Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is the leader of the Black Panthers, while Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins) and John Froines (Danny Flaherty, ""The Americans"") were protesters, but can't understand why they are lumped in with the more recognizable group leaders.William Kunstler (Oscar winner, BRIDGE OF SPIES, 2015) and Leonard Weinglass (Ben Shenkman) are the attorneys for all except Bobby Seale, whose attorney was unable to attend due to a medical emergency. Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the hand-picked prosecutor for the Justice Department, while Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella) is the presiding judge. Other key players include Kelvin Harrison Jr as Fred Hampton, leader of the Chicago Black Panthers, and the always great Michael Keaton as former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Lewis.There is a lot going on here for a courtroom drama. The diverse personalities alone make this a must watch. Flashbacks to the violence and the interactions between police and protesters are mixed in between testimonies. We are also taken into the Conspiracy House, where conversations and debates between the accused get quit colorful. There are also glimpses of Abbie Hoffman's college campus speeches/performances which illuminate his thinking, and some of the best conflicts occur when Abbie and Hayden are going at each other in such contrasting manners. Langella's Judge Hoffman is a true lightning rod in the courtroom. Is he biased or incompetent ... or both? His behavior is what drives attorney Kunstler, the ultimate believer in the law, to finally understand what Abbie had said all along ... this was a political trial - a show of governmental power, and an attempt to quash anti-war activists. This trial occurred mere months after Nixon was elected, and though they never share a scene, the sword-fight between newly appointed Attorney General John Mitchell (John Doman) and outgoing AG Ramsey Lewis (Keaton) is a thing of beauty. Keaton especially shines in his two scenes.""The Whole World is Watching"" became a common protest chant as the government worked to shut down the movement to end the Vietnam War. Netflix and Sorkin have capitalized on the current political and social environment to demonstrate what happened 50 years ago ... the more things change, the more they stay the same. Abbie Hoffman states, ""I've never been on trial for my thoughts before"", and that ties in brilliantly with the desire for Cultural Revolution. Hayden's intellect in on display here, and Rylance is the real standout as Kunstler, though Langella (the Judge) and Abdul-Mateen (Bobby Seale) aren't far behind. The scene where Seale is bound and gagged in an American courtroom is one of the most uncomfortable moments I can recall. There may be some questionable directorial choices, but the story and performances make this one to watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 January 2021,7/10,"Ah, Aaron Sorkin, the king of U.S. coast progressives, always showing intelligent articulated people standing for what they believe in, in the face of insurmountable odds. Who would not love these heroes? Only it gets harder and harder to do that when all of these films kind of blend together. It's the same formula: the great cast on both sides of the argument, but all working to making just the liberal one appear sympathetic, the arrogant powerful fearful and mindless opposition, almost cartoonish in their villainy, with at least one member who would switch sides at one moment or another, the intellectual sarcastic humor delivered at high speed, the heroic musical moment at the end which shows good prevail. It's preaching to the choir, is what this is.There is one more element that is common to recent films about the great American historic past: they are all reinterpretations for dramatic purposes. Starting with celebrity biopics, going through the war hero movies and ending with the kind of political manifesto genre in which The Trial of the Chicago 7 belongs... they are all gross exaggerations, elements removed, added or rearranged to fit purpose. I mean, yeah, it makes me feel good, but it doesn't convince. This did not feel historical, but caricaturesque.So while I enjoyed the performance, it is nothing outside the realm of the expected. People who already believe in what the film has to say will watch and enjoy this, people who do not believe won't even watch it.And in this particular case this is even worse, because what the story actually says is that because of sheer incompetence, a politically motivated plot against advocates for change failed. It's just like those films where the hero is close to death at every moment of the film and still he prevails. He does it because he is the hero of a movie, statistically everybody else would have failed miserably! If this film makes you think, as I believe Sorkin wants it too, then it gets you incredibly depressed and paranoid about the American system, always on the brink of autocracy and becoming a police state.Bottom line: It makes us feel good to see how the Allies defeat the evil Nazis, who are presented as barely human, because of the stark contrast between us and them. How many of us stop to think that the same kind of logic lead to the Nazis in the first place? I wish films would be more about actual people and less about the one sided ideas they want to promote."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a remarkable dramatization of the trial outcome of the protest march at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. The leaders of the resistance became like rock stars for prompting the demonstrations against the Vietnam war and coincidentally police brutality: Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Bobbie Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the national chairman of the Black Panther Party, and David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp) are featured.The docudrama does a superlative job differentiating the combatants, given the number of them and their large personalities. Hayden is depicted as the most reasonable and Bobby Seale the most volatile while Hoffman is a witty provocateur. He trial is worth seeing itself for fine actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt as the level-headed prosecutor, Richard Schultz; Mark Rylance as inveterate interrupter defense lawyer, William Kunstler; and Frank Langella as the beleaguered judge, Julius Hoffman. The actors make you feel as if you are in the courtroom with the famous participants.The courtroom is the scene of the film's most tumultuous action (even more so than the original footage of the riots), for instance, when Seale is brought back into the courtroom bound and gagged.
Today's local rioting over police brutality is a cautionary reminder of those anarchic times in 1968.Less dramatic but just as poignant is the testimony of Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton), former attorney general, for the defense. As it turns out, the judge would not allow the jurors to hear his testimony. This is real-life drama almost too hard to believe.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is historical dramatization at its best-accurate history and relevance to our own times. As Dellinger ominously told his family before the demonstration, ""Mayor Daley is not going to let his city turn into a theater of war."" An apt description of what actually happened.""So your brother's bound and gagged
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to Chicago just to sing
In a land that's known as freedom, how can such a thing be fair
Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring""
Graham Nash, ""Chicago,"" 1971"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Most all of us know the history of the 1968 drama of the riots at the ""DNC"" convention in Chicago and no matter who's side you were on or if you thought it was right or wrong this well done informative tense film ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a must see no matter what your political or social stances are. The movie is mostly in the courtroom with occasional shots and flashbacks of news footage and riot clips of the police and protesters. The film is well made and written from Aaron Sorkin as you the viewer see just how crazy this trial really was.It's U.S. history(as for any history or political buff this film is a must see) after the drama unfolded now in 1969 activists Abbie Hoffman(the wild and blunt Sacha Baron Cohen) and Tom Hayden(the strong Eddie Redmayne) and others were charged with conspiracy after a Vietnam war protest that exploded into violence the year before in 1968. All of this came from different moderate groups like society students, and many felt the charges were politically motivated.As you see in many scenes the courtroom basically was wild and a circus all colorful and blunt brash statements from most of the 7 accused as seeing scenes of some of them even showing up in judges' robes really that just shows right out passion. Compelling and raw was watching wrongfully accused Black Panther member Bobby Seale get bound and gagged for trying to state his words of defense.Thru it all one sees how politics and a harsh judge influenced this trial as it was a soul searching journey just for fairness and freedom of expression as the cast was a strong all star ensemble of Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Sacha Baron Cohen, and even a small part from Michael Keaton as out going attorney general. Overall no matter with the themes of politics, fairness, justice, conspiracy the actual trial and now film showed just how passionate seven brave men were about life, society, and speaking out for what they felt was right in crazy times."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"""Encompassing a large, almost sausage-party-exclusive ensemble, the film is an embarrassment of riches relative to sterling performers, besides the aforementioned Abdul-Mateen and Langella, a bodacious Cohen might get many Oscar-voters' ballots for his uncharacteristic straight-acting that is not aimed to tickle our funny bone, though he gets snappy wisecracks once a while, his A. Hoffman (categorically no blood relation to the Judge J. Hoffman) is a stoned buffoon with enough lucidity and firm determination of his noble cause; whereas Redmayne's personage is more self-righteous (but de facto the whole blood-letting donnybrook can be partially imputed to his spur-of-the-moment outrage) and he is terrific when the clincher hits, but overall the actor's disarming and aw-shucks veneer is difficult to expunge.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 November 2020,8/10,"I didn't know much about the trial before seeing this and it's a fascinating bit of history; an trial more about slapping down the youth movement than about crime, ruled over by an incompetent and prejudiced judge.There are some excellent performances, most notably Frank Langella as the judge and Sasha Baron Cohen as the embodiment of Abbie Hoffman and the always terrific Mark Rylance as Kunstler.Aaron Sorkin offers his usual sharp dialogue, dramatic flair, and intelligent but somewhat shallow philosophy. The result is very entertaining and if it doesn't make you furious at the vagaries of the U.S. justice system then I don't know what to say to you.Check it out!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 November 2020,6/10,"I suppose I really should do that thing we all should in these days of fake news claims by fact-checking the real story of the Chicago 7 trial. It probably doesn't help that I knew very little about the case in advance and indeed haven't had much acquaintance with the work of writer - director Aaron Sorkin, although I'm aware of the acclaim he has received for his writing in films like ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and ""A Few Good Men"" as well as his most famous work for the hit TV series ""The West Wing"".I must admit I'm always slightly dubious of re-enactments of epochal moments in history as it's almost always impossible to ignore the ""Hollywood"" effect which inevitably sees the writer and / or director taking a side, using dramatic licence and inventing speeches, situations and scenes that never actually happened.So while I appreciated this particular slice of living memory American history, I do suspect that some liberties were taken in all the above categories. I would be deaf and blind if I couldn't see that the film had much more sympathy with the defendants and their cause. Characters when they're speaking seriously, do so with perpetual pith and if they're on the right side of the argument invariably have the last word. They also get the odd humorous situation or line to say which I recognise as a humanising device designed to attract a degree of sympathy to them.Right from the opening reel when various utterances of the main characters are sharply intercut together the intention is unintentionally more comic than revelatory of the characters. There's a courtroom scene (okay, there are lots of courtroom scenes) where you suddenly become aware of the swell of orchestral music in the background, which for me at once rendered what I was watching artificial and almost untrustworthy.I got the read-acrosses, intentional or not, to these present dog-days of latter-day America, especially in the receding shadow of Trump, with secret agency dirty tricks, a biased judiciary, Black Power militancy, undercover police officers and more. I got the film's right-on message but felt rather spoon-fed in the process.Competently acted by a large ensemble cast and slickly directed it didn't really ring true for me as super-educational or entertaining, indeed the most dramatic scenes were those showing library footage of the real clash in the park between the police and the protestors.As a film it certainly hit its marks but I'm just not sure it moved beyond them to make a really convincing case for its own credibility."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1968, at the height of the Civil Rights movement and as opposition to the Vietnam war grew, Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), leader of a group of student activists, announced a plan to lead a protest, that would culminate outside the Democratic National Convention, which led to the arrests of the 'Yippie' leaders Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) and their subsequent trial, on charges of conspiracy to incite violence. With assurances of a DA promotion, Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leads the prosecution, against his inner leanings, whilst a defense, mounted by communist advocate David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) and lawyer William Kuntsler (Mark Rylance), works their corner, as blatantly biased Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella) denies a lawyer to roped in Black Panther member Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.)The movie world of the last few years has been ripe with social justice dramas, seeking to juxtapose today's activism with significant milestones of the struggle from years gone past, such as this sprawling, all star yarn from writer/director Aaron Sorkin. With the flimsiest excuse of a charge, and hard won rights from years gone past blatantly denied to someone they couldn't even prove had anything to do with it, this seemed a blatant case of people in the stand for what they represent, rather than what they are alleged to have done, in a year which saw CRM leader Martin Luther King assassinated (and on this side of the pond, Conservative politician Enoch Powell deliver his 'Rivers of Blood' speech. )Sorkin has certainly gone all out, hiring a veritable who's who of cool modern talent, headlined by British heavyweight Redmayne, delivering an impassioned, committed performance, with a fine American accent, and in good company (though at ideological odds with in the film) fellow British actor Baron-Cohen, suitably in the closest thing the film has to comic relief as the wise-cracking Hoffman. Whilst not the most naturally dramatic actor, with this and his other Netflix offering from last year, The Spy, he's certainly developing his range well. There's more dynamic support from the likes of Gordon-Levitt as the ideologically conflicted prosecutor, and older heads like Carroll Lynch as the moralistic activist dedicated to pacifism, and even comeback kid Michael Keaton popping up in a significant minor role.While the pace does sag at times, and it can sometimes feel not quite as dynamic as it could be, it's still a riveting and highly rewarding dramatization of an event that marked a year marked in history as a massive cultural turning point. ****"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 April 2021,8/10,"Right from the get go, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" sets the tone and has you on the edge of your couch. A spellbinding montage of the various protagonists of the movie intersecting with archive footage plunges you in the mood of 1968. We've been on that territory before, for the unprivileged ones who weren't alive at that time, which means 95% of IMDb users, we've seen Oliver Stone's movies and we've seen ""Forrest Gump"", we know what the sixties were all about: a decade that started with the 50s establishment and American traditional values, then Kennedy shot, then the Vietnam war, then the Beatles, the Civil Rights movement, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, the sixties started slowly but on the scale of history, it had one hell of a climax.And that's where the film takes us: in the hurricane eye of an era where a Democratic Convention is interrupted by thousands of pacifist protestors, necessiting the intervention of the Police force, blood shedding, deaths, chaos... whatever happened during that convention is left for flashback purposes. The narrative is played like ""Reservoir Dogs"" with the exception that everyone is in a totally different starting point: there's young idealist Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) and John Carrol Lynch as David Dellinger who, according to himself, ""looks like a boyscout"". Then more adequate to our notions of hippie-looking rebels, there's Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman and Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin. Yahia Abdul-Mateen II is Black Panther member Bobby Seale.Now, we spot other faces but you can trust Aaron Sorkin that he doesn't use this as exposition devices -it would be rather difficult to remember more than three names after ten minutes- but to make one simple point: these guys didn't meet each other BEFORE the riot. That's it. The merit of the director is to plunge us in the raging sixties mood while making a plot point we might easily miss. Next thing we know, the trial starts and before we get to the court, we're introduced to the young new appointed prosecutor Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). His assignment is less a promotion than an attempt to have an easily influencable element, there's Mark Rylance as William Kunstler. Last in the name-dropping game is the judge Hoffman, played by Frank Langella, who's so confused by the names (Dellinger or Dirringer) and insistent that there's no affinity with the other Hoffman that you can tell Sorkin is echoing our own sentiment that there are too many names. The very opening of the trial reveals its density and how intricate the exercice of justice will be. It also allows Cohen to deliver his first quips against the judge, inaugurating one of many series of contempt to court.Then the show begins and it's a remarkable cascade of one-liners and exchanges with the verbal agility of Sorkin as the ringmaster: he who directed political movies such as ""American President"" or ""The West Wing"" series and a trial classic like ""A Few Good Men"" made his two talents implode in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", a movie that allows us to show the tricks going on inside and outside the trial, a real chess-game where the seven defendants defended different ideas but converging toward the same ideals: ending the Vietnam war. There are some riveting moments where they anticipate the opposition's move, some of pure poignancy when they realize that they're only pawns, and some shocks when it's the court that simply change the game, expressing contempt toward its very standards. The plot reveals an inconvenient truth: that the real conspiracy isn't the one we expect. Sorkin knows how to toy with the tricks of the genre, having Michael Keaton playing the star witness but then offering us the disappointment of not even allowing the jury to hear him.There's a feeling of anger-driven resignation from a trial that starts with the posture of respectability and allegiance to American ideals but evolves into a kangaroo court worthy of the darkest hours of the Soviet regime. But it becomes clear that it's not about winning or losing but making a stance and the film is often at the edge of falling into the trap of its own noble intentions but never does so for Sorkin, a veteran of the game doesn't commit the same mistake a new director would do, he doesn't preach but let the unfolding events sows the seeds of our own conclusion, he doesn't sanctify his defendants but shows them as vulnerable and guillible people, making honest mistakes, and sometimes not aware of the limits of their idealism while the opposite side puts the reason of the state in such a high pedestal that they almost lose their soul.""Trial"" is more than a court film, it's a political movie depicting the fragility of American ideals at a certain point of history and instead of treating like a tragedy, Sorkin with his flair for entertainment makes it a tragicomedy, showing that sometimes, the idealism isn't necessarily the better-incarnated side as far as fashion and amiability is concerned. On that level, Cohen steals the show as Abbie Hoffman, whom I finally recognized when he harbored his trademark flag-shirt. Abdul makes for a powerful performance as the entrapped in the procedure Seale. And Langella is just the kind of judge that make prosecutors rather useless, I've never see one as hostile since ""The Verdict"".So, the verdict is this: this is a great film that remind me of the good old 90s with its resemblance to ""A Few Good Men"" and ""JFK"", it offers an interest introspection about America's idealism and the film embraced the sixties' spirit: a slow start, a turbulent middle section and one hell of a climax."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,7/10,"'The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (2020)' dramatises a widely known court case concerning the organisers of a protest in late-60s Chicago, which began peacefully but quickly escalated into a skirmish with the police, who supposedly ""conspired to incite violence across state lines"" and, as such, can each be charged with up to ten years in prison. It was, essentially, a show trial meant to reduce the impact of the supposed cultural revolution, a biased affair meant to railroad the titular defendants - alongside an eighth who is consistently denied his right to counsel. The film is slick, straightforward and to-the-point, pairing its baffling and frustrating sham of a trial with flashbacks and recesses that explore the political reasoning behind its events. It's an engaging, enjoyable experience that does a great job of getting you on the same side as its anti-establishment main characters. Sorkin's smooth-as-butter dialogue is delivered by a bevy of famous faces who each turn in some of their best work. Some of them are sure to crop up in the Academy's list of nominees for best actor and best supporting actor. The only real flaw with the cast is its lack of female members; the few women who appear onscreen have very minor roles. Overall, this is a solid, consistently entertaining courtroom drama. It's rather timely, too. 7/10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Of course it's brilliant, funny and hugely entertaining; just what you would expect when you see the name Aaron Sorkin, who this time has also directed, as well as written, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" which may not have been 'the trial of the century' but was certainly one of the most important 'political' trials ever held in America. It was, for want of a better word, a show-trial ordered by Attorney General John Mitchell to discredit the organizers of the protests held during the 1968 Democratic Convention. The trial was presided over by one, Judge Julius Hoffman who, from the moment he put his ass on the bench, was clearly on the side of the prosecution, though in view of what he had to put up with from the likes of Abbie Hoffman and others, you might even say he was provoked.This is a classy production with an all-star cast that includes a couple of Oscar-winners. They are all outstanding with Frank Langella, (the judge), Mark Rylance, (the defense attorney), and, perhaps most surprising of all, Sacha Baron Cohen, (Abbie Hoffman) walking away with the picture and if Oscars are handed out this year surely Langella has to be a front-runner. If Sorkin portrays events in a crazy and seemingly haphazzard way then I think it's safe to assume that's exactly what they were. As for the trial itself, you couldn't make this stuff up. This is a brilliantly written, directed and acted tragi-comedy about a terrible time in recent American history, though watching it you might think you are seeing newsreel shot on the streets of America only a few days ago."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 December 2020,9/10,"Well I wanted to give it 8 but it's 2020 and there are no good movies at all so can't give it less than 9. It really surprised me in a good way, nice actors,well made movie,some history, everything blended and boom we have a masterpiece. I'm very glad that I had chance to watch this film and I'm totally recommend to watch it for everyone. So far it's second favorite movie for me of 2020."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 February 2021,8/10,"Aaron Sorkin's screenplays for feature films and television already cover much of the significant moments in U.S. history over the past 60 years, and deal with some of the most significant personalities of the period (Steve Jobs, Marck Zuckerman) or the main institutions of American democracy, including social media and the White House. As a director, Sorkin recently made his debut with 'Molly's Game', a film that did not impress me that much, and his return to 'the great politics' with 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' is, in my opinion, a qualitative leap. The format used this time is the courtroom docu-drama and the case presented is well known to American viewers, being probably quite well documented also for the youngest (many books have been written and no less than 11 fiction or documentary films have been made before this). In addition to the artistic and historical reconstruction qualities that I will mention below, the film also has a direct political message that it never tries to camouflage. The historical moment described in the film was complex and controversial in American history. Aaron Sorkin has done a lot of what can be done with a courtroom drama to catch that historical process, but he has reached, in my opinion, some of the limits that the genre imposes on reflecting the reality outside the courtroom.
The introduction combines news footage with fictional scenes to recreate the charged political atmosphere of 1968: the Vietnam War with lotteries deciding who would be recruited according to the birth date, protest movements against an unpopular war, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy, the hippie movement and the global protests. All roads led to Chicago, where the initially eight protagonists were to play an important role in the demonstrations that would end in violence. They represented different facets of the war protests from the Flower Power and Yippies movements, through veteran or younger pacifists to the Black Panthers whose goals were related to the rights of the Afro-Americans. The public trial intended to designate them as instigators of violence and thus justify the harshness of the police response that followed. In a country where freedom of speech is enshrined in the Constitution and where in theory there are no political trials, the case of the eight (who became the seven following the separation of Bobby Seale, leader of the Black Panthers) was a moment of convergence of the public interest and an opportunity of reflecting on the role of justice in the democratic process. Opinions, then divergent, have remained divided to this day, and the 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' movie is a continuation of these debates, one which has gained new and perhaps unexpected significance of the recent events in American actuality that have brought to focus the debate about the boundaries between freedom of expression and incitement to violence and revolt.
As a court drama, the film works very well. The scenes that take place in the courtroom are based on events that are well known in the United States, the process being documented in the press and by the other media. Skilled screenwriter Aaron Sorkin completed the picture with scenes and dialogues from the prosecution and defense team's trial preparations, and flashbacks recreating the events on the streets of Chicago in the days of the Democratic Party Convention, making again use of documentary sequences. Director Aaron Sorkin chose an excellent team of actors and directed them professionally. They all do an excellent job, but a few acting creations stand out. Frank Langella is impressive in the role of Judge Hoffman, whose leadership of the trial was criticised at the time and went down in history as a case example. After many years of second-hand casting, Joseph Gordon-Levitt receives a role up to his talent and creates the character of a prosecutor with a difficult task, in conflict with his own conscience. Mark Rylance plays the role of the lead defense lawyer and proves once again that he is one of the best actors of the moment, creating another unique role, which is unlike anything he has done before. Finally, Sacha Baron Cohen dominates the gallery of defendants as Abbie Hoffman, the protester who defies the rules of a society and a system he considers unfair. All these efforts are commendable, the result is a docu-drama and a good quality courtroom movie, but something seems to be missing. The film failed to involve me emotionally. Perhaps the problem is the too explicit sympathies of the filmmakers in connection with this case, perhaps this is about the limits of the genre of courtroom dramas. Memorable films of this kind involve the juries and introduce us to the dilemmas and the debates of the 12 persons in the jury room. In this film the jurors scarcely appear, and the moment of the verdict is not even presented on the screen. For two cinematographic hours we witness a trial in which everything we see on screen leads to one conclusion, but the jury decides differently. Why? We won't find the answer to this question in 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' and maybe that's what's missing from the film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 September 2021,8/10,"1968 was an absolutely hellish year in America, so I groaned when this film opened with snappy, completely tone-deaf music playing in the background while showing the assassinations and civil unrest in the attempt to set the context. I worried that this film was going to be a completely packaged, glossed over production, taking too many liberties with what actually happened - and to some extent, those fears were borne out. There are some ridiculous, completely unnecessary inventions in the script (just one example is the undercover agent who steals Jerry Rubin's heart), and countless examples of places where facts were altered, and in significant ways. Many of the characters were softened, ranging from Hoffman and Rubin to Richard Schultz, the prosecuting attorney. I hate Aaron Sorkin for doing all that.On the other hand, in terms of capturing the spirit of the antiwar movement, what happened at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and the vindictiveness of the establishment's response - on the ground with the police, at the top of government with U. S. Attorney General John Mitchell, and at trial with the outrageous conduct of judge Julius Hoffman - the film delivers the gist of it all, and I'm glad it was made. The back and forth dialogue between Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) felt overly expository, but it was effective in showing the inevitable schism between more radical and more moderate positions within the movement, and I felt the film was fair to both sides. I also loved how it highlighted the shameful, racist treatment of Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), as well as pointed out the origin of the law the group was accused of breaking. As for the production value, it is too packaged for my taste (the awful, soaring music played at the end comes to mind), but the acting is uniformly good, and the story was riveting. I'm also inspired by these men for the courage of their activism, and even if the story was dramatized, I'm glad Sorkin told it, particularly during these troubled times."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,5/10,"This is a timely movie politically, about the trial of protesters crossing state lines, police brutality, and resulting riots, as well as cultural and racial strife, and about the consequences of presidential elections on the direction of the Justice Department. Nominally, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a courtroom drama over the riots in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and while Aaron Sorkin, reportedly, wrote a draft of the screenplay as far back as 2007, there's no mistaking the contemporary relevance to 2020. Replace anti-war demonstrations with anti-racist ones and the listing of casualties from Vietnam with those from police killings or the pandemic, and it's essentially a commentary on 2020. Unfortunately, it's still very much a Sorkin picture, too, with all the tropes and particular manner of sanctimonious speechifying that comes with it.If Sorkin weren't such a prolific recycler, I wouldn't find his style as much of a problem, as his repartee can be flashy, but his TV shows and movies are so irritatingly, distinctly his and always the same. I'm not only talking about videos of Sorkinisms one can find on YouTube, either; besides, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" seems, to me upon an initial viewing, at least, to include less of that--maybe because the script has to contend with court and historical records, or maybe I just missed them or was persuaded by the distinction between a favored phrase such as ""I don't give a damn"" being replaced by ""I couldn't care less."" His legal dramas (this one, ""A Few Good Men"" (1992)) are treated as shouting matches, his Silicon Valley forays (""The Social Network"" (2010), ""Steve Jobs"" (2015)) as self-righteous ""Great Man"" narratives, the political ones are naively idealistic (""The American President"" (1995), ""The West Wing"" and ""The Newsroom"" series), and all of that is preferable to when he tackled in his directorial debut a subject I consider myself more knowledgeable of than his usual material, poker (""Molly's Game"" (2017)), the depiction of which was simply incompetent (enough of an indictment of such, but not the only case, is the scene where Tobey Maguire's stand-in supposedly bluffs an opponent into folding ""the nuts;"" I don't care how good a bluffer a player is, one only folds the best possible hand if they don't know what they're doing, but I digress).There are always characters lecturing other character and grand speechifying, including characters reciting obscure quotations (we get Jesus this time) and correcting grammar (those pesky possessive pronouns and vague noun modifiers) in the process, and the even more bombastic scoring. We always get eureka moments (aha, the former attorney general shall be the star witness), two characters on the same side battling over tactics (oddly, this time, it's two British actors arguing over American government, but, I suppose, at least it's not one of those screaming matches Sorkin seems to think make for good rom-com), and an opponent or two on the other side who have principles (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's only role here) while the rest of their side of strawmen are made into buffoons. The good guys, on the other hand, wind up being thin characterizations serving as little more than mouthpieces for Sorkin. The thing that especially bugs me, though, is the constant daddy issues.While Sorkin's usual psychobabble regarding fathers largely escapes the script this time, the one scene where it does emerge unfortunately converges with his slight treatment of the trial's eighth defendant and only African-American one, Bobby Seale (played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Before he disappears from the rest of the picture after the gross spectacle of him being bound and gagged in a courtroom, there's the thudding lecture delivered by him to Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) over the false equivalency of black men being lynched and white men rebelling against their fathers. ""The seven of you, you've all got the same father, right?"" I suppose that bit of dialogue is preferable to Kevin Costner playing a father and a shrink psychoanalyzing his daughter on a park bench, but. seriously, can we go one round without Sorkin psychologizing over abusive, disciplinarian, distant or otherwise imperfect dads. It's become trite. And, as an aside, I wonder whether Hayden really did tag along with his attorneys everywhere, whether or not one of them even did visit Seale in prison even though he wasn't representing him, or was it just poetic license to get Redmayne more screen time. Perhaps, it's like putting Mark Wahlberg in a fictional character to travel everywhere in a based-on-a-true-story so that we supposedly simple-minded spectators may readily follow these supposedly-complex plots.Nevertheless, turning courtrooms into theatre is par for the course for Hollywood, and it can be admittedly entertaining. There've been a few movies, including documentaries, about the trials, so one may view one of them, or read a book or search the web, for a potentially more historically-accurate presentation. By obliquely commenting and taking sides on current events through historical politics, including what I suspect may be a stronger indictment of police and promotion of protesters than may've appeared in earlier transcripts, the characteristically idealistic treatment, sometimes absurdly so, of Sorkin's rap sheet appears, whether one agrees with his views or not, more grounded in reality in this case."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 November 2020,,"Aaron Sorkin's sophomore directorial effort finds the esteemed screenwriter bringing the story of the infamous trial to screen in a consistently engaging manner but given the quality of writing on display, the themes it intends to explore, plus the strength of the ensemble cast involved, one can't help but wonder the cinematic gem it could've been under the helm of a more seasoned filmmaker.Written & directed by Aaron Sorkin, the film utilises his trademark rapid-fire interplay between its interesting set of characters to propel itself to a good start and only gets more riveting as court proceedings go on. Sorkin's direction is rather straightforward here, keeping the momentum in check but lacking the vision required to turn a good script that's full of potential & promise into a great example of cinematic storytelling.Still, for what it's worth, the film remains an entertaining ride from start to finish and a lot of credit for that can be attributed to its committed cast, all of whom bring their A-game to the table. Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance & Frank Langella impress the most but the rest of the cast is no slouch. And giving the film its topical quality & sense of urgency is the dynamic camerawork, energetic pace, fine editing & modern parallels to the depicted events.Overall, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a competently crafted & skilfully told historical legal drama that plays around with factual accounts in ways that best suit its crowd-pleasing obligations but is still able to deliver a final product of immediate relevance. It does however lack the imagination & creativity that turns a good film great, which is a real shame coz Sorkin's screenplay had the makings of an instant classic. And in the hands of a master storyteller, this film might have been one."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 August 2021,7/10,I didn't know anything about the events that actually happened. Good movie. The plot of the movie was great. I also like their acting. It was one of the best movies of the year.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 April 2021,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.I never heard about things that happen, therefore the whole story for me was fresh. And i glad i didn't before, because this movie kept me engaged in it for its whole running time 2 hours. This is a superbly written, acted and directed movie and tells a very true story. Music at the end was also superb. The cast is also amazing - not every day you will see so many great faces in one movie.Overall, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" (2020) is a superb movie from start till finish. Never was i bored nor not involved. Very good movie overall."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 April 2021,10/10,"Aaron Sorkin is a genius with what seems to be an intelligence level of at least 200, he deserves golden globe and more for his writing/directing work. The cast is magnificent throughout I love the way everyone plays out everything! I'll leave my strong opinions out I'll just say that I agree with the entire trials side, I don't think that's a spoiler at all. Such a well thought out brilliant piece of cinema that stays intriguing for a court room type."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,,"If I can set aside the gravity of the subject matter for a moment, let me say that what attracted me to this film is the ""dream team"" cast. But better still is the writing of Aaron Sorkin, under whose pen has emerged works such as ""The social network"", ""Steve Jobs"" as well as the superb TV series ""The Newsroom"". Just to listen to Sorkin's dialogue is sheer joy. To watch it delivered by such a distinguished ensemble doubles the pleasure.There must be mountains of public documents and academic work on this monumental page of modern American history and I'll confine myself to the briefest details. The cause-and-effect of the ""Trial"" goes back to drafting for the Vietnam War. If that is a little forgotten during the course of the mesmerizing narrative, it is driven home by the powerful concluding coda, like a sledge hammer hitting you on the chest.The year was 1968, the ""flower power"" era. The catastrophic event was the eruption of violence in a confrontation starting from a peaceful demonstration during a Democratic convention in Chicago. The ""7"" charged with conspiracy were in fact three separate ""units"", 3 pairs (one idealistic activists, one Yippies, one inconsequential), plus a fatherly pacifist. There was an eighth, singled out because he was not represented by the lawyer of the seven. During the course of the long trial, the seven and their lawyers meet regularly in what they defiantly called ""the conspiracy room"". Most of the drama, however, unfold in the courtroom.In an IMDb interview of the cast, one actor says ""One could think that the story took place just last year"" - protests, tear gas, petrol bombs, violence breeding violence... half a century later, these events are playing again, all over the place, nay, all over the world.Now to the cast, and I'll state upfront that there are omissions, due to my own inadequacy. For want of anything better way (and all performers are, without exception, superb), I'll go in alphabetical order of the last names.Sacha Baron Cohen needs no introduction to his inimitable style with comical characters. This is put to good use in his portrayal of Yippie Abbie Hoffman. Underneath the easy flippancy, however, is a clearly demonstrated sincerity, even urgency, that Cohen brings out with impeccable precision.Michael Keaton, playing Attorney General Ramsey Clark who has just been replaced by John Mitchell, has only two scenes, both of which he completely owns. The first is in his home when he hears pleads from two of the ""conspirator"", in the presence of two of Mitchell's men, for him to take the stand. The second is in the courtroom when he does take the stand. Vintage Keaton.Frank Langelia, among the proliferation of his screen work, may be well remembered in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008), for his uncannily convincing portrayal of Richard Nixon, not by physical resemblance but by sheer acting ability. In ""The trail of the Chicago 7"", he plays Judge Julian Hoffman, depicting incompetence in such a way that it is almost amusing, in a way only he can.Joseph Gordon Levitt, one of the best in this generation of actors, plays prosecution lawyer Richard Schultz, achieving the almost impossible of earning for his character respect and even sympathy under conditions that put him in unfavourable lights with the audience.Seasoned movie and TV series veteran John Carroll Lynch plays the fatherly pacifist David Dellinger with conviction.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who served notice in ""Aquaman"" (2018) and the immensely successful TV series ""Watchmen"" (2019) that he is up and coming, plays the pivotal role of Bobby Seale, the aforementioned ""eighth"" who insists on having his own separate lawyer, has some of the most explosive (figuratively speaking) scene which he delivers admirably, with dignity.Eddie Redmayne, arguably among the ""most wanted"" in Hollywood, plays Tom Hayden, the young, idealistic intellectual whose momentary loss of control singles him out as the obvious target of the prosecutors. One of the best scenes is the confrontation between Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman in the ""conspiracy room"", two people on the same side but torn apart by difference in approaches they respectively believe in.Mark Rylance won one of the most deserved best supporting actors Oscar with ""Bridge of spies"" in 2015. In ""The trail of the Chicago 7"", with hair neck-length, he portrays William Kunstler, the flamboyant defence lawyer whose exasperated scrimmages with Judge Hoffman leads to 24 cites of contempt by the end of the trail.Ben Shenkman does not appear to be in the same league as many of the abovementioned. I am really happy to see him, however, playing Kunstler's fellow counsel Leonard Weinglass. I have watched him in the two full seasons of ""For the people"", which unfortunately has been discontinued."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 April 2021,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a Drama - History movie in which we follow the trial of seven people charged for the uprising during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. We also watch how the uprising started, how it finished and what happened during the trial.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot that followed the story of the trial of the Chicago 7. It contained many interesting scenes not only during the trial but also during the uprisings. The direction which was made by Aaron Sorkin who is also the writer of it, it was very good and he kept in balance both the trial and the uprisings. Regarding the interpretations of Sacha Baron Cohen who played as Abbie Hoffman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who played as Bobby Seale and Frank Langella who played as Judge Julius Hoffman were simply all amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Eddie Redmayne's who played as Tom Hayden and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's who played as Richard Schultz. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because some things it must not be forgotten."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,9/10,4.5 out of 5 stars.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a really good historical drama film that follows several people who were trying to peacefully protest to end the war. It turns sideways when police brutality interferes and escalates further with leaving many protestors injured.The film spends majority of the screen time in a courtroom going back and forth with the group defending while the other trying to put them away. Such a powerful drama film. And if it was not for Aaron Sorkins fast moving script that keeps your attention glued with the subject such as police beatings. A person's constitutional rights. And racial prejudice. Also a movie that is relatable to what is going on now with the political stance.The cast ensemble is great. Every delivered with a powerful performance. Eddie Redmayne. Sasha Baron Cohen. Joseph Gordon Levitt. Mark Rylance. And so many others did a great job with there characters.The film does flash back to some brief events with the protesting that turned out brutal. Such as when protestors went charging up the hill towards the police. Or at a protesting event when a character witness another being beaten by the police.Aaron Sorkins sharp direction made this 2 hours and 10 mins drama went by quick with keeping you on the edge. Trying to see how it would all play out when the judge was already leaning away towards the group. Definitely worth checking out if your into realistic historical drama films.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,"After a disappointing first foray in the director's chair with 2017's mostly forgotten about Molly's Game, screenwriting legend and politics focused Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin finds himself back in form with Netflix's latest high profile release and potential awards player The Trial of the Chicago 7.Taking us back in the politically charged Vietnam era of America, this based on a true story tale of a group of seemingly peaceful anti-war protestors and movement leaders being targeted by the government system allows Sorkin to once more return to the courtroom setting that he made his name with in 1992's A Few Good Men and the results, while not quite as memorable or moving as that piece of work or other highpoints of Sorkin's career like A Social Network, suggest Sorkin has found his grove as a writer/director.At one stage touted as a potential Steven Spielberg vehicle (Spielberg's Dreamworks production company is still on board), Trial has a lot of ground to cover as it examines the extensive and drawn out court case of the various reported troublemakers and riot instigators, as well as offering glimpses into the actual events that lead to their very public case, so much so that character development and engagement isn't as strong as it perhaps could've been but with Sorkin's on fire script and a string of solid performances front and centre throughout, this is one Netflix awards baiter that does most things right.Without a typical lead as such, Trial manages to give sufficient airplay to its loaded cast that includes Eddie Redmayne as the softly spoken but wise beyond his years Tom Hayden, Sacha Baron Cohen (in one of his rare non-comedic roles) as hippie extraordinaire Abbie Hoffman, rising star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Panther leader Bobby Seale while Mark Rylance as lawyer William Kunstler and Frank Langella as the despicable judge of the case Julius Hoffman make their marks in numerous well-played out scenes.It's always a pleasure watching actors of the caliber that are assembled here getting to play with such well-rounded and sharply written scenes and while it is a shame we don't get more of an emotional connection to these men and their plights (something no doubt Spielberg would've aimed at with more intent), there's not much of Trial that doesn't engage you throughout, particularly with its strong sense of time and place and a feeling that this story of justice being sought is more relevant than ever in todays modern political climate.Final Say -It might not quite be a new Sorkin masterpiece but this wonderfully acted and engaging piece of true life courtroom drama is a fine film in its own right and one of the best bets Netflix has as it pushes towards this years award season.4 caught eggs out of 5"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,10/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) was written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. It's a recreation (with some actual footage) of the events at the DNC in August 1968, and the trial that resulted. (The trial lasted from September 1969 to February 1970.)Sorkin has chosen a strong ensemble cast: Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden,
Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman, Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin, John Carroll Lynch as David Dellinger, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale, and
Mark Rylance as attorney William Kunstler.The historical fact is that Judge Hoffman at the trial was so prejudiced against the Chicago 7 that this aspect of the film almost could be turned into a comedy. However, these men were being tried in federal court for serious offenses. It wasn't funny then, and it isn't funny now.I'm old enough to remember that ghastly Democratic National Convention of 1968, and the horrible (mis)trial that followed. It's really important for younger people to watch this film and learn from it. History repeats itself unless we do something to stop the repetition.Trial has a very strong IMDb rating of 7.9. I thought that it was even better than that, and rated it 10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,7/10,"The 129 min runtime felt like 3+ hours, and it wasn't due to slow pacing, but instead, bad editing combined with a low engaging and boring screenplay. Casting and performances were excellent, as was the cinematography. Directing was decent, and the score was on point. The story may not be forgotten, but this underwhelming film will be. A generous 7/10 from me."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 November 2020,7/10,"The Democratic National Convention met in Chicago in August 1968 to choose their presidential candidate in a tumultuous year that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Prague Spring, and growing protests in cities around the world against the escalation of the Vietnam War. Although some culture warriors came to Chicago to perform ""political theater,"" it was the anti-war sentiment that brought thousands of young people to Chicago where ""the whole world was watching."" Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (""Molly's Game""), The Trial of the Chicago 7 dramatizes the subsequent trial of eight defendants (Bobby Seale's case was later separated) charged by acting Attorney General John Mitchell (John Doman, ""You Were Never Really Here"") with crossing state lines to incite a riot, the so-called Rap Brown Law.Denied a permit to camp in Grant Park, the protests turned ugly after the brutal beating of anti-war activist Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp, ""The Hustle"") at the hands of the Chicago Police Department, a beating that landed him in the hospital with a concussion. When activist Tom Hayden and other demonstrators stood up for Davis, Mayor Richard Daley's massive assembly of police as well as the Illinois National Guard began indiscriminately beating up protestors. By the end of the week there were 668 arrests, 400 requiring first aid, and 110 were taken to a hospital. It was a scene that Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff memorably described on the floor of the convention as ""Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago.""Though some of the police presence was a reaction to the provocative threats of the Youth International Party (Yippies) led by Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"") and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong, ""The Big Short""), it was clear that Mayor Daley, one of the last of the big-city bosses, was determined to challenge any threats to his personal domain. The film jumps right into the trial without providing much background except for some pictures of the Vietnam draft, speeches by Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King and, in a more lighthearted vein, protest organizers discussing what boisterous fun they are planning in Chicago.While some of the incidents in the trial are rearranged for dramatic value and some are invented, Sorkin basically follows the court transcripts though there is enough deviation from actual events to make his script, as he described it, ""more like a painting than a photograph."" In addition to Hoffman and Rubin, the strong ensemble cast includes peace activists Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne, ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald""), Rennie Davis (Sharp), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch, ""The Founder""), John Froines (Daniel Flaherty , ""The Meyerowitz Stories""), and Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins, ""The Assistant"").Frank Langella (""Captain Fantastic"") portrays Judge Julius Hoffman, 33-year old lead prosecutor Richard Schultz is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Snowden""), and Mark Rylance (""Ready Player One"") is defense counsel William Kunstler. In a standout performance, Michael Keaton, (""Spiderman: Homecoming"") as former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, delivers a testimony for the defense which unfortunately was stricken from the record. Baron-Cohen's Hoffman is perhaps the most authentic of the characters, but the others are little more than caricatures with Seale, Hampton, and Rubin coming off the worst.In the trial, Sorkin tries to balance the outlandish behavior of Hoffman and Rubin (once dressed in judges robes), the drama of Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, ""Us"") being bound and gagged in the courtroom protesting the murder of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton (Kelvin Harrison Jr., ""Luce""), and the overbearing incompetence of the Judge who acts with malice towards the defendants, dismissing objections from the defense before they were made and arbitrarily excluding evidence, witnesses, and even jurors.Tom Hayden (who later became a California State Assemblyman) is shown as the responsible one in contrast with the Yippies. In a verbal skirmish, when Hoffman asks Hayden what his problem with him is, he replies, ""My problem is for the next 50 years, when people think of progressive politics, they're gonna think of you. They're gonna think of you and your idiot followers passing out daisies to soldiers and trying to levitate the Pentagon. They're not going to think of equality or justice. They're not going to think of education or poverty or progress. They're gonna think of a bunch of stoned, lost, disrespectful, foulmouthed, lawless losers, and so we'll lose elections.""While all the elements are present in The Trial of the Chicago 7 for an impactful experience: Dramatic events, snappy dialogue, comic relief, and some raw and powerful moments, the film often feels verbose and inorganic, perilously close to a TV movie of the week. While the debate between Hoffman and Hayden is illuminating and relevant, what the film misses is a feel for the culture of the sixties or an overriding understanding of what is at stake. We witness a group of young people shouting, running, and being beaten, but the film does not capture the reason that brought them to Chicago in the first place. We hear no arguments for or against a war that had dragged on for four years and had stained the soul and character of the nation.Sorkin further ignores the sense of desperation the demonstrators felt, knowing that the Democrats were about to nominate a candidate who, like Johnson, had rejected North Vietnam's overtures to come to the peace table in exchange for a bombing halt. The only time we get a sense of what it was all about is when Tom Hayden begins to read aloud in court the names of the thousands of soldiers who had died, many still in their teens. It is in the moment when we learn that those who died in the war had names that The Trial of the Chicago 7 finally comes alive and tells us what the peace movement stood for."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"The Chicago Seven were seven defendants charged by the US federal government with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968.
Bobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial severed during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven.
Bobby was at first bound, gagged n chained to a chair in the courtroom and then severed from the case for a later trial.The film is very gripping, entertaining n sad at times."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 November 2020,9/10,"To say that it is another excellent Netflix production is raining in the wet, a current and true theme portrayed in an intelligent, light way and with doses of humor and sarcasm, very good ... Passionate, how not to revolt with absurd racism, and if to be moved, admired by the struggle and courage of the few... Adorable ..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,"Trial of Chicago 7 was a very good court room drama that had a plenty of emotional and impactful moments that are trying to expose many truths and in some cases it fails but in some it wins in most unexpected ways.Cast was very talented here and i even think that some of them could even get some award nominations for this film but i honestly doubt that for some hidden reasons.The pats that most impressed me where some characters and some actors acting,buy that i mean Sacha Baron Cohen one and Yahya Abdul Mateen 2 one they were the highlight of a entire film and they give a great acts,rest of cast was also good.Trial of Chicago 7 was a very good courtroom drama"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 April 2021,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" (2020 release; 129 min.) brings the account of what happened when the ""gang of 7"" (or 8 or 10, depending on how you count) is put on trial for conspiracy and inciting a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. As the movie opens, we get archive footage of how violent thins were in 1968 in this country. We then go to ""5 Months After the Convention"", and federal prosecutor Richard Schultz meets with the brand new US Attorney General John Mitchell, and he is appointed lead prosecutor in the case. Not long thereafter, we go to ""Trial Day 1""... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Oscar-winning Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network""). Here he brings the infamous Chicago trial of the men who were accused by the new Nixon administration to have incited a riot at the 1968 DNC. The movie focuses on the trial itself, but also brings flashbacks of what actually happened at the DNC protests. To say that there were a lot of colorful figures in the gang of the accused would be the understatement of the year, but does that mean they are guilty? ""I am on trial for my thoughts"", declares Abbie Hoffman (played by Sasha Baron Cohen). As strong as the screenplay is (and it really is), the movie benefits tremendously from the all-star cast: besides Cohen, we get Eddie Redmayne (as Tom Hayden), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as the lead prosecutor), Michael Keaton (in a small but remarkable role as the AG during the Johnson administration) and last, but certainly not least, Frank Langella (as the corrupt and/or utterly incompetent presiding trial judge). Interestingly, there are several references and scenes involving Fred Hampton (leader of the Illinois Black Panther Party), and the subject of the recent film ""Judas and the Black Messiah"", equally worth seeking out. Bottom line: ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is political theater at its very best, with a soaring screenplay and a rousing all-star cast.""""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" was supposed to a wide theater release last September, but then a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. Eventually the film was acquired by Netflix, which allowed a very select theater run last Fall before it began streaming. Sadly, I missed the film in that brief theater release (and I don't have Netflix). But not all was lost. The film earned 6 Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), and now in the lead-up to the Oscars later this month, is getting another limited theater release. This time I didn't take a chance and the day it started showing at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, I went to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so: exactly 5 people including myself, That is on the low end for most movie screening I've seen in the last 7-8 months (typically around 5 to 10 people in the theater). All that aside, if you have any interest on what really happened at the 1968 DNC and the subsequent trial, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 April 2021,9/10,"It never ceases to amaze me how Aaron Sorkin can take a story that in reality probably isn't all that interesting, and somehow turn it into an epic and gripping movie. Well he's done it again with 'The Trial of the Chicago 7', proving what he does is no fluke, and this might just be his best work yet. The film is two hours and ten minutes and I was captivated for the entirety of it.I love that the movie doesn't mess around. It gets straight down to business almost immediately and then never lets the foot off the gas. The pacing of this movie - considering there is very little that could be in any way called an action sequence - is beyond belief. Also he made me care about characters who I would usually find detestable. Every character (and there are a lot of them requiring screentime, focus and their own arcs) is perfectly written and adds significantly to the story.Sacha Baron Cohen has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for his performance here. In an incredibly good cast, full of exceptionally written characters, he still manages to steal the show and stand out in every scene. He's the comedic relief of the film for sure, but he's also so much more. I would very much like for him to win the award. I think it would be well deserved. To be honest I'm surprised there weren't a couple more acting nominations from the film. The whole cast are incredible.This is possibly the closest I've ever gotten to giving a film a perfect 10/10 score without ultimately doing it. The only thing that held me back were some of the liberties the film took in altering the truth. I fully understand almost no movie tells the story exactly as it was, however just occasionally things were a little too over-dramatised for my liking (the final scene being an example of this - although I absolutely loved it in a thematic sense). This is a really good movie and you haven't already, take the time to see it. I think you'll be very pleased you did."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 May 2021,10/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) is a movie my fiancée and I watched on Netflix shortly after seeing Judas and the Black Messiah. We did not go into it knowing the storylines of Fred Hampton would tie so closely together but we are glad we saw it in the order we did (Judas first and the Trial of the Chicago 7 second). The storyline focuses on a group who developed a workaround process for a political activism rally in Chicago, the Democratic National Convention, when a riot ensues led by a police task force that used excessive violence against the participants of the rally. The case shows the prejudice and injustices of both the political, judicial and American society that has plagued this country since its inception. This movie is directed by Aaron Sorkin (Molly's Game) and stars Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception), Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables), Jeremy Strong (The Happening) and Michael Keaton (Beetlejuice). The storyline for this is so good and a great display of both white privilege, our corrupt judicial system, our challenges with police force, and the challenges we have with stereotypes getting in the way of perception and justice. Almost everything wrong with this country is caught in one picture. The acting in this is marvelous. They couldn't have cast a better cast for these roles. I loved this movie from beginning to end and strongly recommend watching this masterpiece. I'd score this a 10/10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 July 2021,9/10,"Abbie Hoffman is portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen to perfection with a perfect Boston accent. His fellow travellers, Jerry Rubin and Tom Hayden were on trial in Chicago in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention. Aaron Sorkin uses news footage in between riveting courtroom scenes to make this one of the ten best films of 2020. Cohen deserved the Oscar."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 December 2020,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" might be the best movie of 2020. It's not a masterpiece, but there are many things that make it worth watching, most notably the acting, and its great climactic scene.About that acting. Some of the most highly esteemed English actors around, Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne, both practically disappear into their roles. I didn't realise it was them. The legendary Frank Langella and soon-to-be legendary Michael Keaton both do good work here, especially Keaton, who isn't in the movie much but has one great scene.Of course, for most people the stand-out is going to be Sacha Baron Cohen, here doing a serious performance for perhaps the first time in his career. He is consistently entertaining and also has one great scene.The way the movie is scripted, in fact, gives pretty much all the actors a time to steal the show, and it is often a joy to watch.The movie is fast moving and densely packed, and one I'll probably revisit to see what I missed the first time."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 February 2021,8/10,"8/10 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 satisfied my love of courtroom dramas, but left me wanting a little more"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 March 2021,7/10,"I find Sorkin can be a little annoying. He has a smugness to a lot of his characters and dialog. Furthermore, he sometimes is a little preachy. I ultimately like this film but a far better version of it was a couple of edits away. If only someone else stepped in and told Sorkin no.Sorkin has a tendency to be cheeky and have characters quip about their situation; he is sometimes too clever. The example of this is Lee Weiner-one of the lesser important defendants-is written to be a comedic (Greek) chorus. I am struggling to recall a single line by him that wasn't a quip. Many of the observations were funny but they make the tone of the film less serious than the material deserves. Perhaps if I saw the movie prior to the Jan. 6th 2021 putsch (go ahead and down vote Trumpists) I would find this less off-putting but I think the final film is a misshapen mixture of grave matters and sarcasm.Likewise, Sorkin's need to defend American liberalism (as in The Biden wing of the Democratic party) results in some odd choices that soften what the Nixon administration attempted here. Richard Schultz-the lead prosecutor-is written and played with a few pangs on conscience. It is as if Shultz regretted being involved in the process. It is especially stark when Seale gets his mistrial. I have looked into this and I haven't been able to find any historical material supporting this. It feels like a Sorkin invention. As if Sorkin could not fully condemn the institutions and had to create a crisis of conscience for a representative of those institutions. It stands out because the story has a secondary theme of how dysfunctional the American left, or ""left,"" is and one suspects Sorkin's heart lies with Tom Hayden not Abbie Hoffman.That said the film is put together well. A lot of information is conveyed in efficient shorthand. The acting is uniformly excellent- even Eddie Redmayne does his eddie REDMAYNE thing less here. And if nothing else the film is entertaining."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,1/10,"This film start with a footage of the recruitment of army to Vietnam, and a bunch of people planning to demonstrate at the Democratic National Convention scene! As turnout, this film is about the trial of seven people, who incite the riot at the Democratic National Convention! Entire film quite long, slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the argument scene, overuse of the receiving phone call scene, and overuse of the flashbacks scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Rennie hit by a police on the head! At the end, Tom reading out the names of the fallen army at Vietnam, while performing his statement! Still have an article indicate each of the defendant sentence to five years in the federal prison for incite riot at the Democratic National Convention! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,6/10,"The film follows the outrageously flawed trial of 7 anti Vietnam protestors accused of inciting a riot.As with all Sorkin projects the script is all and as usual if you can overcome the idea that people don't speak like this where every discussion is a knock it out the ballpark speech, there is a lot of fun to be had here. The cast are terrific including Cohen and Redmayne performing against type, but the real fun is Langella as the appallingly blinkered judge and Rylance as the defence council with the hopeless task of getting his case across.Fun for anyone who likes quick witted courtroom shenanigans."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,7/10,"Dramatised account of the trial of protesters arrested during the time of the 1968 democratic convention in Chicago.This is a thrilling and intriguing historical drama with moments of anger and humour in the right places. The plot unfolds in a highly compelling way and the cinematography, editing and pacing all support the storytelling well.It contains some excellent performances from a great cast, all of whom play clearly defined characters and have excellent screen chemistry. Frank Langella and Mark Rylance for me give superb performances as I felt they did exceptionally well to stand out in a film with so many stars.One of the positives about a historical drama is that it (hopefully) should prompt people to research more about the subject matter and hopefully this movie has piqued an interest in many people unaware of the events to look back into history and find out more.Unfortunately, the other side of the coin it's that many people do not take the time to do the above and take what they see in a movie as the gospel truth. This one contains scenes created for dramatic licence which for me can diminish the credibility of something implied as non-fiction.Aaron Sorkin's script is as sharp and witty as ever, but at times it makes me feel like I am watching actors in a play reciting Sorkin-style dialogue rather than something that actually happened. Also, the the ending feels like it's laced with typical Hollywood dramatics designed to get emotion out of the audience.This is a very relevant movie in the current political climate. With scenes such as the one showing Bobby Seale bound and gagged in a US courtroom it should prompt plenty of discussion points, especially being released so close to an election."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,"I lived through these events and even met a few of the people on trial; I met Rubin and Hoffman in an informal, impromptu rally in Washington Square Park. The difference between the New York Police and the Chicago Police was rather stark. No one was hurt; no one was harrassed. It was a peaceful rally. I talked to both individuals and Rubin struck me as a shallow lech, while Hoffman struck me as a serious social protester. I was on leave for 30 days from the Army in 1969. I was against the war; these people were against the war; so I naturally gravitated to them. Neither individual trusted me because my hair was so short; they thought I was an undercover cop or something. Despite that, we all had a good time. This film was well-directed and produced. All of the actors did. a fine job; especially Cohen, who seems to be able to do drama as well as great comedy. I think the film correctly captured the personalities of Rubin and Hoffman and the role of Hayden was outstanding as well. I never met Hayden. However, Frank Langella almost steals the film as the judge; and gives a sterling performance. Highly recommended for those of us who have forgotten about the Vietnam war and it political effect on our individual lives. Most young people go through a political metamorphosis,; they are generally liberal as youths and become more conservative as they age. But not everyone. Some people stay either liberal or conservative their entire lives. Hoffman was one of those people."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"You know what isn't superb?
This was splendid! Although I don't know much about what's going around in U.S cause I'm from India, I felt it. I felt emotions from all over the place. The intensity was really high, the characters were so very well written with depth. The acting was really powerful and the casting... just marvellous choices there...Sacha baron Cohen, Joseph, Eddie redmayne and co. just wonderful, just wonderful.I think this film can be relatable for any country. This film captured the struggle of justice so well... the lines were so very well written! And the ending!!! So powerful!!Aaron Sorkin really is an absolute genius! He wrote this so well, such great dialogues, I absolutely love how his characters talk.The cinematography too was absolutely incredible! So fitting!Just brilliant, best film of 2020 for sure."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 March 2021,8/10,"Very well made, up until that ending anyway.It's not a bad conclusion, but man is it cringe-inducing. It seems they were going for an end to match 'A Few Good Men', which was also written by Aaron Sorkin of course. From the overly uplifting score, to the slow clap, to the freeze-frame. Per Esquire, the scene is not even how it went down IRL either. I'm all for 'Hollywood endings', just less of the cheese please.The rest of 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' is, though, very good. Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie) is the greatest performer, the role is mostly comedic - which he nails - but even in the more serious moments he is terrific. Jeremy Strong (Jerry) is notable alongside him, also. Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Frank Langella, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt merit props, too.I did enjoy how it portrays the (true) story, one that is very interesting no doubt. Overall, I had a pleasant time watching this - though I'd rate it a tad higher if not for that (not negative, just a bit lame) ending."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 November 2020,8/10,"This film was so interesting. It's a quite complex film with tons of cool tricks about sad and serious real events of the past. Surprisingly, it also has tons of jokes which work surprisingly well. It's well written, well directed film full of great performances. One of the better court dramas."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"My new fav film of 2020, so far. The factual subject matter couldn't be any more relevant to today when most American is once again experiencing a total disconnect with the government amd its actions. It teaches veluable lessons about our less than perfect system even though we might likr to believe otherwise. Great performances! Oscar bait for sure. I found myself profoundly moved at the end of the movie. It's great."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 January 2021,8/10,"Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin is back (on Netflix) w/his second writing/directing gig (following Molly's Game) which details the titular trial in which anti-war luminaries of the late 60's were put on trial after the Chicago riots between protesters & the police occurred while the Democratic National Convention was taking place. While spending a modicum of time to introduce all the political players of the era (Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale et al) all are arrested & brought before a judge, limned by Frank Langella, & endure a months on end trial which hopes to sink the efforts of the Left since it wants to derail the Vietnam War effort. On the prosecuting side, we have a young attorney, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who just goes w/the flow even though his conscience can be read on his face w/the great William Kunstler, played by Oscar winner Mark Rylance, heading up the defense who desperately tries to plead his clients' case even though the stalwart judge blocks every attempt he makes. Seale, played by the actor of the movement, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who was in the Chicago vicinity for 4 hours & had nothing to do w/his co-defendants was clearly a scapegoat to be prosecuted just because of his Black Panthers affiliation. Seemingly of its time but wholly of the movement (thank you Mr. outgoing president for keeping court cases in today's current blitzkrieg of media coverage) we're living in, this film speaks truth to power for the endless fight to have the freedom of speech we Americans sometimes take for granted. The cast is up to the task delivering Sorkin's trademark witty but pointed dialogue w/stand-outs like Sacha Baron Cohen excelling as Hoffman, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne as Hayden, John Carroll Lynch, Ben Shenkman & a late appearance from a certain Batman which is just icing on the cinematic cake."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 February 2021,8/10,"Sorkin.Now, if you're a movie buff, that's all you really need to know. To the more casual film goers though, let me explain. Aaron Sorkin has done something that few others have done with his career and I'm officially going to put him in the same vaunted halls of Spielberg and Tarantino and Hitchcock. Aaron Sorkin writes dialogue quite possibly better than anyone else in the business. He is so good in fact that his name has become synonymous for brilliant writing, for characters that are impossibly smart, clever, witty and yet somehow still human and empathetic. The Chicago 7 is a perfect example of him flexing his craft. It's a courtroom drama that has you gripping the edge of your seat whether you're laughing or sitting with baited breath.The cast is perfect. Everyone here embodies their roles and what's more, there's no battling for superiority or screening dominance. This is truly an ensemble piece that lets everyone shine. Cohen especially was a standout for me. Primarily because I always think of him as Borat and when I watched that way back when I hated it and this was never a huge fan of his but he is spectacular here.The only downside is weirdly not so much on the movie but the reality. The ""villain"" of this film is so absurd, so ridiculous that it feels like you're watching a cartoon sometimes. Imagine my shock to learn that the real man was likely even more insane than the shockingly toned down representation we are given. So it's not really the movies fault so much as my utter, horrified shock that Snively Whiplash was real!The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an external film. A relevant film. A brilliantly done film. It's the type of movie I expect I'll return to and find my appraisal of it only going up in value. I absolutely recommend this for anyone that... Nope, no qualifier. Just everyone. Everyone should watch it and since it's on Netflix it's hard to find a reason not to."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 February 2021,10/10,"At first glance, The Trial of the Chicago 7 may seem nothing more than another fast talking 'based on a true story' drama from the magnificently talented writer/director Aaron Sorkin. However, once we are able to delve deeper into the story, and therefore deeper into the film, characters, situations at hand, and ideas in general- The Trial of the Chicago 7 not only proves to be another great work from Sorkin, but a timely masterpiece which is never more relevant as it is today. Although it is largely Sorkin's film, there is many actors throughout the film that make it as strong as it is. Sacha Baron Cohen is the biggest standout actor of the film, portraying Abbie Hoffman. The role isn't just perfect for Cohen's usual take on ego-headed characters- but simply put, it allows him to take charge and act to a level we have never seen him do before, and with every risk taking moment, Cohen succeeds in this role. Some other standouts would include Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, and Michael Keaton- who may have only been in the film for a little while, but deserves attention for providing such a gripping performance for such a smaller role. The film is not only able to spearhead into ideas of equality and justice while also balancing its intense courtroom drama, but it feels ingeniously and timelessly crafted to perfection. My only problem with the film is that it can feel slow at times, and maybe even dull in terms of how it all looks, but certainly not how it feels. In the end, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a worthwhile contender in this years Oscar race, and a film that is not only recommended from me to watch, but urged as well.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 November 2020,9/10,"A very good film, with a great beginning, nice pace, well developped characters, excellent text and dialogs. Eddie Redmayne proves once more that he is the best actor of his generation and that he is able to portray the most varied characters one may conceive. Sadha Baron Cohen also surprises with a suberb performance which shows that, while having comic moments, he is also perfectly able to portray serious, deep and not stylized characters just like the usual ones. This is a dynamic but also deep movie, which is competent to show that electoral regimes are not aithomatically worthy to be labeled as democracies. Racism, narrow-minded shallow patriotism and right-wing extremism, common along all political history in the United States, are shown just like they are. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is my favourite movie from 2020 so far."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 November 2020,6/10,"That's right, we're not goin' to jail because of what we did, we're goin' to jail because of who we are!There was a good film desperately trying to break out in The Trial of the Chicago 7 but it never really succeeded.
There was just too much wrong with it for it ever to work properly.The film is based on the infamous 1969 trial of seven defendants charged by the federal government with conspiracy and more, arising from the countercultural protests in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.Who better to direct a political courtroom drama than Aaron Sorkin.
I love his past work and the super fast , extremely clever dialogue but not this time .
This time Sorkin seems to have bitten of more than he can chew.For a two hour film , it's amazing how little of the story we actually see and that's not surprising as the trial lasted over six months .
Because there is so much to tell , Sorkin misses out important sections including amazingly , the court verdict!There are some really good performances from the likes of Mark Rylance and Frank Langella but there are also some poor performances from especially Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne . Miscasting can probably be blamed for that.The final moments of the film , with the sickly music , is obviously meant to be emotional and thought provoking but for me it just felt flat and flat pretty much sums up the whole film , which is such a shame ."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"A compelling retelling of the trial of the Chicago 7 with brilliant acting by Eddie Redmayne, Salcha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Frank Langella."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an astonishingly gripping true story drama that's emotional, powerful and distressingly relevant to current world events. Sacha Baron Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt all give incredible performances. Michael Keaton, John Carroll Lynch, Alex Sharp, Ben Shenkman and Frank Langella are all great. Aaron Sorkin's direction is excellent with some of his best writing that's reliably smart and witty. It's also superbly edited, expertly paced and extremely well filmed. The music by Daniel Pemberton is fantastic."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 March 2021,7/10,"Aaron Sorkin has accomplished everything he wanted and more with The Trial of the Chicago 7. It's a piece of history that deserved to be retold, and through his impeccable dialogue and direction, Sorkin has made one of the best films of the year."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Manipulative but highly effective docudrama that plays with the facts a bit too much but still delivers its powerful message for our right to protest injustice most eloquently.JIM'S REVIEW: Since Crispus Attucks became America's first hero for American independence, the right to protest has long been woven into the blood-stained fabric of our nation. Wars, civil and gay rights, sexual harassment, women's liberation...you name it, people have been demonstrating against injustice for decades. Today, our polarized country still has the need to protest from both right and left sides, especially this election year. Such was the case back in 1968 when protests occurred during the Democratic Convention in Chicago and in that aftermath, a group of political activists were put on trial by the government as scapegoats for their actions under the guise of inciting a riot. The relevance of this drama resonates with today's headlines.Director/ Writer Aaron Sorkin uses actual court records, archival footage of the riots, and court testimony, along with his deft skill of wordplay, to chronicle a docudrama about those events entitled The Trial of the Chicago 7, a forgotten shameful chapter of our American history.The trial became a public spectacle highlighting the ineptitude of the court system and government bureaucracy. The accused were a varied lot and these defendants differed in their ways and means of revolution. On trial were: peace activists Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and two walking endorsement from the Yippie movement, Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) and Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen). Also standing trial was Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a militant member from the Black Panther Party who was never at the scene of the crime. These 8 protest leaders were strangers brought together by the Nixon administration with trumped-up conspiracy charges which amounted to a political vendetta. The stage was set for the drama to begin and it does in this highly watchable film.The theatrics of a world stage did not go unnoticed during the trial as presiding judge, Julius Hoffman (a scene stealing Frank Langella), watches on, unable to hide his repulsion for the accused and some of the defendants making a mockery of their plight with their courtroom hijinks could easily rival a Marx Brothers routine. On the side of the prosecution are Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Thomas Foran (J.C. MacKenzie) and assorted undercover police witnesses. For the defense, we have earnest attorney, William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and his able assistant counsel, Leonard Weinglass (Ben Shenkman). Mr. Sorkin chooses his actors wisely and their physical appearance recall their real life counterparts. The ensemble is terrific, especially, particularly Mr. Redmayne, Mr. Rylance, Mr. Cohen, and the aforementioned Mr. Langella.Through flashbacks and court scenes, Mr. Sorkin tells his tale very adroitly. The film is not historically accurate as the filmmaker takes too much artistic liberty with his material. In fact, the actual trial is stranger than the added fiction in this film. (Omitted from this movie are true moments in the trial that would have been perfectly suited for this film: Hoffman's repeatedly calling the judge, ""Julie"" and blowing kisses to the jury, the judge admonishing famous celebrity witnesses like Arlo Guthrie and Judy Collins from singing on the stand, the defendants draping a Viet Cong flag over the defense table, the absurdity of Hoffman getting jail time for laughing in court, etc.) Why Mr. Sorkin avoided these facts seems a misstep in his narrative.Still, the overall proceedings make for riveting if not accurate drama. (However, the late filmmaker Stanley Kramer would have given his seal of approval to Mr. Sorkin's liberal voice and vision. Both directors tend to proselytize their political leanings a bit too much in their movies but one can only admire their noble intents.) Mr. Sorkin's unquestionable skill for blending rich characters, clever dialog, and much literate speechifying about current social issues are his trademark talent and that is wholly evident in this film, even if he cannot rein in his melodramatic flourishes with an unrealistic climax and closing statement that strains credibility.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a very fine courtroom drama with a wonderful cast and many nicely scripted scenes. Even with its minor flaws, the film makes some powerful connections between then and now while celebrating our fundamental right to protest and condemning those who want to suppress it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 January 2021,8/10,The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is a really entertaining and investment if movie. Many of the the actors give Oscar-worthy performances.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 January 2021,7/10,A nicely made historical film. Quite shocking to see how the so called liberties and freedoms are not granted when it doesn't suit the corrupt establishment. Some solid performances from a great cast. I hope to see more of these films being made and distributed widely that expose and are transparent to all kinds of corruption and falsehoods that exist in our society. It should never be one rule for the elite and a different set of rules for the rest of us. This is not what the founding fathers hoped for and you ask yourself who are the real patriots.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 April 2021,7/10,"First of all, I would not suggest watching this after watching JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH, even though their timelines intersect at the death of Fred Hampton. The first is an exceptional historical drama, important in its scope, this one is more entertainment and frivolous in its tone, which might be why Sacha Baton Cohen's cavalier portrayal of his character garnered an Oscar nomination (people thought it was a comedy). The serious actors fought against the tide and grounded the film but, and maybe this is a hallmark of our times, it felt as if the subject matter was purposely lightened to hold an audience. I think it cheapened the subject. I give this film a 7 (cheap knockoff) out of 10. {Pop Drama}"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 December 2020,8/10,"This movie will keep you glued to your seat throughout, the writing, acting, editing, directing are all brilliant.The plot is based on the true story of a group of anti-vietnam war protesters who were placed on trial for conspiracy to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. The film is told as a courtroom drama with flashbacks to events leading up to the riots. These flashbacks allow us to learn not only about the case but also about the defendants, who were actually made up of members from three different organizations. What we seen outside of the courtroom provides context to why various people react in differing ways inside the courtroom. The likes of Tom Hayden is taking the case very seriously trying to respect procedure, while the likes of Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin are using it somewhat as a comedic showcase. They figured no matter how well they behaved they are always going to get screwed by the system anyway so why not have some fun.The screenplay infuses comedy into the frustratingly unjust situation, which makes it entertaining to audience, the pacing is spot-on and the dialogue throughout is both thought-provoking and humorous, the riot scenes are well staged, and intense. The score is a bit muted but complements the scenes well. The performances are terrific all around, most esp Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden, Sacha Baron Cohen as the hilarious Abbie Hoffman, Mark Rylance as the lawyer, and Frank Langella did a job portraying the outrage-inducing Judge Hoffman. Yahya Abdul-Mateen is also memorable as the Black Panther national chairman Bobby Seale, he portrayed a man who (no matter of his guilt or innocence) was being openly and casually discriminated against by Judge Hoffman because of the color of his skin.All in all, The trial of Chicago 7 is a fairly interesting and informative film, it's also technically impressive with terrific performances. it's definitely one of my favorite and also one of the best movies this year"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"... or guilty until proven innocent. Nothing like a good court room caper to ratchet up the blood pressure, especially with Frank Langella presiding as the ever so slightly biased beak, and doing it to absolute perfection. Packed full, just like the court room of top drawer performances, it leaves you aghast that these scenarios could ever exist in the first instance while thankful that three British thespians can fill the voids American actors seem unable to satisfy."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 April 2021,8/10,I knew next to nothing about this case and found this film to be a great entryway.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,Having lived through the 1960s I can assure you that this film was historically correct. my Recollection of events of This time periodWithslight exaggerations but basically this is the way it went down just as you see in this movie.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"Aaron Sorkin is a sort of genius, a word I almost never use when describing the products Hollywood delivers. The fact that he took a months-long show trial and spun it into probably the best film of 2020 is evidence of his talent as a writer and filmmaker.The greatest trademark of a great director is getting great performances from the actors, something this films delivers in every role.Most of them even looked like the people they were portraying.The events from back then are so completely analogous to our times. The left is a mess and has no direction, not knowing who the enemy really is and often doing more harm than good. What were they doing protesting the Democratic convention and not the Republicans? I never understood that ever since I was a child. It's just like the WTO riots in Seattle or the BLM crew today. Who are they fighting against? They just make it easier for the propaganda (something not fully in motion back during this trial) machine to demonize anyone left of fascism.The big differences between now and then is that the Right is more concentrated and sends out a laser beam of (mostly) lies directly into the brains of the nincompoops who vote completely against their own interests. Liberals today are a larger part of the public, but completely directionless, or so it seems. How else could you explain that Biden is the candidate in this election which could have been a total lay-up for any decent Democrat (under retirement age)? And forget about 2016 and Hilary."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 February 2021,,"TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 (2020) Resistance to authority has been in the air for the past several years, so it's not surprising that Writer-Director Aaron Sorkin would look back upon the prosecution of anti-Vietnam protesters The Chicago 7 in 1969 as a means of commenting on today's culture (it was made before the George Floyd protests this past summer).After a whirlwind prologue which too quickly tries to set up the main story (lots of hot filmmaking, little light) the movie gets to its prime focus - the title trial. The participants are rapidly sketched out, but the main players in this telling are the accused Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), the Prosecutor Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the chief defense attorney William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella). The defendants were all in Chicago protesting the Democratic Convention the prior year.When it adheres to the court transcripts, the movie is effective. The bedlam in the courtroom is dutifully laid out. The accused never truly speak as one and the judge is confused and belligerent - often at the same time. Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who was barely in Chicago for the Convention loudly protests and is bound and gagged by the judge for his outbursts.Not content to keep the drama inside the courtroom, Sorkin cuts away to budget conscious re-enactments of the Protests, some contemporaneous performance art by Abbie Hoffman and actual news footage (shown, as sadly per usual these days, in the wrong aspect ratio). Unfortunately, despite some fine acting one never feels that TRIAL is of its era. It seems distant. Removed. The events happened ""back then"". There is no sense of the time and place. As good an ensemble as Sorkin and his casting people have gathered, they never congeal. It's as if we are witnessing an acting workshop where each actor gets to do their bit and then sit down as the next thespian does theirs. Rylance is a particularly fine here, as is most of the cast including Cohen (on a technical level) - his accent however, resembles a space alien mangling Boston and New York accents.Being a Sorkin script, one knows going in that there won't be a strict faithfulness to the facts. Defendant and actual Boy Scout leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) didn't punch out a bailiff and there was no female Mata Hari style FBI agent (Caitlin FitzGerald) who wooed Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong). Of course, nobody expects to get just the facts from a Hollywood movie, but, Sorkin goes a step further than most acclaimed writers - even when the true story is often more interesting than his contrived version. Where this bites Sorkin in this project is the climax. It's not just that the reading of the Vietnam casualties didn't happen as portrayed here, but, that the movie hasn't set up the moment. So concerned with telling ""a good yarn"" that he fails to humanize the anti-war movement beyond some petty arguments between the participants. Even more damning, the very soldiers whose lives were endangered and, even lost, are so far in the background that the big emotional wrap-up feels hollow.I know these critiques seem strong, but, it's only because the story of the Chicago 7 is still a fascinating tale. And, the movie does do a decent enough job of presenting the basics. The acting is good. If its holding it to a higher standard, so be it. THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is a worthwhile production, but it clearly falls short of its own lofty goals."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,7/10,"I've always been a fan of Aaron Sorkin's writing, even if his first directorial effort didn't wow me. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a decent film, but I still get the sense that Sorkin should stick to the writing and leave the directing to someone else. (More on that later.) This particular film is about a court trial that I had not heard about prior to watching the film, where a group of men are put on trial for instigating a riot in 1968. Any time a story like this is focused so heavily on a group of innocent men fighting against injustice, it's hard not to get swept up into the emotion of it all. The level of mistreatment that these men endured is highly compelling, and there are many elements that you find yourself doubting simply because you don't want to believe our judicial system could be that broken. But upon further research you'll find that many of the facts are accurate and this was a horrible ""kangaroo court"" situation that made a mockery of justice. If nothing else, I think this film is important to show the flaws in our system, and to remind us of the mistakes in our past.My biggest problem with The Trial of the Chicago 7 was in the structure of the film. It seems like Sorkin simply can't wait to get to the court proceedings so there's very little build to the opening and we are dumped into the trial before we are even fully aware what the alleged crimes include. Later on things are fleshed out more, particularly with some flashbacks, but I always felt like the movie was missing a little something. Frankly, it feels like it would have been an easy fix, if it was all edited better. I'll also say that Sorkin, as usual, can't separate his own political leanings from his writing. I don't think that was a detriment to this story, since it's fairly obvious who was in the right and who was in the wrong in this situation, but he loves any chance to grandstand for the liberals and villainize the conservatives. That being said, I am a sucker for courtroom dramas, and I also loved how The Trial of the Chicago 7 embraced some of the ridiculousness of the situation and allowed for some laughter. It's not the greatest Sorkin writing, but it's still worth watching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,7/10,"Ridiculous ensemble cast, and Sorkin's slick lines to support. Plus i LOVE a courtroom drama. This is liberal stuff with a capital L.Hoffman and his fellow defendants face off against a Government prosecution and a brazenly unsympathetic judge, Sorkin's screenplay works its magic through the sheer spectacle of the courtroom proceedings. Through testimonies and circumstantial evidence, it becomes clear that the accusations of a conspiracy are baseless, most obvious in the case of Bobby Seale (fiercely portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who is charged along with the Chicago 7 without any reasonable evidence of collusion.The confrontations between Hoffman and Tom Hayden (a steady, confident Eddie Redmayne) resonate as they explore the tensions between achieving progress through traditional, ""respectable"" means, versus disrupting the status quo by overturning a failing system.This movie would have already been a must-see film for its captivating ensemble, Sorkin script and rousing story. But its sincere plea for a more free and fair democracy makes it all the more essential in a pivotal election year for the US."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 August 2021,7/10,"Based on true events in 1969: protest leaders and anti-war activists of the uprising against the 1968 Democratic National Convention are on trial for the riots that took place during that event.The film does well in recalling an era and mindset that are long gone but continue to resonate: for some with sentiment; for others, with disdain. The court case itself was shocking in the antics of an unworthy judge who tried to pull every trick possible (including great cruelty to restrain a black defendant) and would have made an interesting story in any other place, time, or situation. But let's face it: the volatility and radical changes of the 1960s and 1970s make the time period a great background to any story even the most mundane.While the courtroom trial provides the main story, there is an unofficial trial among the defendants outside the courtroom. While they came from different backgrounds and had different reasons and perspectives for protesting the convention, their conflicts among themselves make for intriguing dialogue and provide viewers with the mindsets of the time. Kudos to writer/director Aaron Sorkin for this. The internal battles seem to turn mostly against Tom Hayden (played by Eddie Redmayne) who would later become a California state politician. The editing regarding time shifts is also well done. The beginning shows the setup of the trial with flashbacks of the gatherings before the convention. The riot scenes are reserved for later with a perfect build-up.The climactic final scene is moving but Sorkin overplays it with unnecessary manipulative, sentimental orchestral music; it's like telling the audience which side to take when subtlety would have been more effective. But the film wins overall not only as a historical record but one which shows relevance to current U. S. history and the concern that recent protests (from the radical left as well as the radical right) can lead to dangerous consequences.Footnote: at the end of the film, the future fates were mentioned of the main characters. One of the defendants was Jerry Rubin (played by Jeremy Strong), a radical hippy at the time. By the end of the 1970s, he had become a businessman/millionaire i.e. A product of the ""establishment"" he used to despise. His life story would make another fascinating film. - dbamateurcritic."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,10/10,"What a little gem of a movie! Terrific cast, superb acting, hilarious yet poignant script and solid direction.All the way through this movie you can't help but view it in the context of the current state of America. I would guess that was the intent and it delivered in spades.This is a MUST SEE!!ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 February 2021,10/10,"For decades, Aaron Sorkin has written some of the best films ever created. Classics like A Few Good Men (1992) still stand up, and modern masterpieces like The Social Network (2010) and Moneyball (2011) are starting to become timeless as well. And while he's mostly been the writer of these films, The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) is his sophomore effort as a director. Somehow, the ability to accurately translate his words into the actors' performances created-in my opinion-the best film of 2020.It's clear Sorkin cut his teeth long ago with courtroom dramas, but this movie is by far the most intricately-crafted exposé of the corruption of the American justice system I've ever seen. The fact that the parallels to 50-years later are shockingly similar actually makes me sick, but that's perhaps why this film works so well right now. It doesn't give me hope that these systems will ever be broken or fixed any time soon. While this is a depressing thought, it's what makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 so impactful. If this doesn't open your eyes to the reality of injustice, then I don't know what will.With an all-star cast including Sacha Baron Cohen (in perhaps his best performance ever), Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the thing that makes this movie really work is how the details of the riot are gradually revealed-including a shocking twist that is both thrilling and heartbreaking. I'd consider this movie right up there with some of the best films of all time, like To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and 12 Angry Men (1957); it's that good.Aaron Sorkin's masterpiece and a grave reminder of the American injustice system, I give The Trial of the Chicago 7 5.0 stars out of 5."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 March 2021,9/10,"The good thing about my yearly exercise to check out all of the Oscar Nominated films in the ""Major"" Categories is that it forces me to watch films that are ""one my list"" but I just haven't gotten to them. THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is one of those types of films - an Aaron Sorkin Written and Directed project with a stellar cast about an important moment in United States History.And...I'm glad I ""forced myself"" to watch this, for TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 just might end up being my favorite film of 2020. It tells the tale of the trial of 8 (not 7 - they explain that difference in the film) leaders of revolutionary groups in the turbulent times that were the late 1960's in the United States and this film grasps the stakes that both sides are faced with in this historic time.It all starts, of course, with the Writing and Directing of Aaron Sorkin (TV's THE WEST WING, A FEW GOOD MEN, MOLLY'S GAME) and it is some of his best work. Sorkin's writing style lends itself to this type of multi-player, multi-storyline story that all culminates into one story at the end. The words coming out of his character's mouths are insightful and true (if a bit over-blown for these characters) and they make you understand these characters - and their motivations - very well (whether the character is considered a ""good"" guy or a ""bad"" guy in this film).The pedigree of Sorkin draws some wonderful actors to his works and THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is no different. Eddie Redmayne (Oscar Winner for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), Mark Rylance (Oscar Winner for BRIDGE OF SPIES), Ben Shenkman (Angels in America) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (INCEPTION) all are at the top of their (considerably strong) games and Director/Writer Sorkin lets them all shine.These 4 are good - but the next 6 are even better (yes...there is that many good to great performances in this film). Let's start with Jeremy Strong's (THE BIG SHORT) Jerry Rubin and Sacha Baron Cohen (BORAT) in his Oscar Nominated role of Abbie Hoffman. The embody the hippie culture of the '60's and bring gravitas and humor to the proceedings. Cohen earns his Oscar nomination by his ""showey"" role, but I would have been happy with just about any of the main Actor's being nominated.Yahya Adbul-Mateen II (AQUAMAN) is powerful as Bobby Seale - the Black Panther Leader who is railroaded into this trial. He is supported by his friend, Fred Hampton - who I was glad to have learned more about in another Oscar nominated film this year, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH.Special notice needs to be made of a few veteran performers in this film - John Carrol Lynch (FARGO) has become a ""mark of excellence"" for me in films. Whenever he shows up in a project, I know that it will be worth my while for no other reason than his performance, and this film is no exception and Frank Langella EXCELS in the role of the Judge in the case, Julius Hoffman, and he is - beyond a doubt - the ""bad guy"" in this film, but he brings a humanity to his character and I ""loved to hate"" him. This performance stuck with me and I think that Langella deserved an Oscar nomination.Finally...there is an extended cameo from a well known Hollywood performer (who I will not name, for I do not wish to spoil his appearance) as former Attorney General Ramsey Clark. This character was built up prior to his appearance as a powerhouse, and this actor did not disappoint.This is a fantastic ensemble film that really transported me back to the '60's and the message at the heart of this film are as relevant today as back then. As I stated above, this is currently my favorite film of 2020, and it will only be replaced at the top by something very, very special
TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is currently streaming on Netflix and I highly recommend that you check it out.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,10/10,"So, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is one which I was unfortunately unable to catch on its short ""Oscar-nom"" cinema release, but is now on Netflix. And boy, for older viewers who prefer historical drama over wham-bam action, this is definitely worth the watch.I know a decent bit of 20th century history, but this is a story I knew nothing about. At the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, anti-Vietnam protests resulted in a violent and brutal confrontation with the police. Eight of the ring-leaders were rounded up and charged with inciting the violence. What happens in the court with the eight convicted men, in front of an old and partisan judge (the wonderful Frank Langella), is simply amazing.There's a nice wiki article on the history you can look up. But its worth watching the movie blind, since it's a great rollercoaster ride.If you read my blog regularly, you'll know that one of my favourite of the awards in award season is the ""Ensemble Cast"" award from the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG). I think a good measure of which movies might be good candidates for this award is when you find it difficult to single out particular actors for an individual award when they all work so well together. For this is a cast to die for:Sacha Baron Cohen, as Abbie Hoffman: an intelligent 'straight' role, poles apart from Borat and Bruno, that he delivers on 100%;Jeremy Strong as Hoffman's buddy Jerry Rubin, doing an enormously entertaining turn;Eddie Redmayne as the apparently 'sensible one' Tom Hayden. A bit similar to his role in ""Les Miserables"", but diving off in a different direction at a key point;John Carroll Lynch as the genuine 'boy scout' David Dellinger, so good in ""The Founder"" and here as the only family man under the judgmental stare of his wife and son;Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Panther member Bobby Seale - the ""minus 1"" from the title - in an astonishingly powerful performance;Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the prosecutor Richard Schultz - always quietly dependable;And the fantastic Mark Rylance as the defense attorney William Kunstler. I appreciate I am having a tendency to gush in this review, but Rylance expresses such a range of frustration and disgust here that his performance is nothing short of electrifying.There's also a cracking cameo from Michael Keaton playing the former US Attorney General, Ramsey Clark.I would think that any of these performances might be Oscar-worthy (somewhere in the Actor/Supporting Actor categories) but my personal choices would be Rylance for Best Actor and Baron Cohen and Langella for Best Supporting Actor nods.One of my issues with the scripts of Aaron Sorkin is that they tend to be overly dense and wordy. In epic TV like ""The West Wing"" he could spread the dialogue over a whole series, but in a feature film it can become very dense and verbose. I found that in both of his last two films - ""Molly's Game"" and ""Steve Jobs"".Here, in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", even though there's a lot of speechifying, to me it never felt over the top. Although an epic courtroom drama (akin to his debut script ""A Few Good Men"") the characters are given time to breath between the lines. And many of those lines are real zingers, particularly out of the mouth of stand-up anarchist Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen).Aside from the script being a zinger, the direction here from Aaron Sorkin is also top-notch. If you thought a courtroom drama was going to be static and boring, think again. The camera never rests, and inserted flashbacks (excellent film editing from Alan Baumgarten) maintain the momentum of the story.Overall, this is a movie tour-de-force from Sorkin, and a fantastic watch. Could this be a writing/directing double Oscar nom for Sorkin?(For the full graphical review, check out the bob the movie man review on the web of One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 December 2020,,Hard to follow and downright incomprehensible at times. What accent was Sacha Baron-Cohen trying to do? There's no emotional engagement and it feels very dry and academic for the most part. Definitely not worth your 2 hours. Sorkin has done so much better elsewhere.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 March 2021,8/10,"A great semi-historical account of the Trial of the Chicago 7 or should that be 8. Shocking events in the film make it 7!Basically the film is set in 1969. The U.S. is at war in Vietnam, controversially. Thousands of U.S. troops die in Vietnam and men are drafted for service by what looks like a lottery draw machine.The year before in Chicago groups of radical left leaning groups incite protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention with scenes of violence from and against the Chicago Police Department.There is a transition of power in the U.S. The incoming Republican administration lead by Richard Nixon clamps down on these protests and so a trial is held against the leaders of these protest groups.Hence the State v The Chicago 8. You have Yippies (Youth International Party), Black Panther Party and other organizations on trial in a courtroom drama with scintillating dialogue from director Aaron Sorkin who is famous for writing and dialogue in other films.As an example it was Sorkin who wrote the famous line ""You can't handle the truth!"" quipped by Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men (1992). Another courtroom drama.The casting is superb. An all-star cast including the likes of Eddie Redmanyne, Mark Rylance, Michael Keaton, Sacha Baron Cohen and Frank Langella.The film admittedly being a courtroom drama is set in pretty much one place aside from a few scenes showing the lead up to the Convention and the police/demonstrators animosity so cinematography. music etc. is not really a major part of this film.The courtroom scenes do have some legal discrepancies or do they? The trial seems more political and corrupt. Perhaps that is the point that Sorkin is trying to make, highlighting racial issues and riots with the U.S. Government?The film is streaming on a well known medium and has had limited theatrical exhibition because of COVID-19 so whether or not this will effect people viewing this film I do not know?I didn't expect much from the film prior to viewing but it does keep you gripped for its entire run time and is an important historical lesson as well as a motion picture."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 February 2021,6/10,"The scene inside the pub in which one character asks ""hey, am I the only one who sees what's going on out there?"" as well as the overdone music and the cheap pathos at the end shows why this indeed is rather fluffy, but fairly slight Hollywood treatment of source material which was more boldly dealt with in the flawed. I found the first half of the film somewhat confusing due to the sheer number of characters involved. This movie missed every point ever made on this subject. Very, VERY poor. I appreciated the insertion of some actual news footage, although it was very hard to view. Does this movie break new ground or highlight new facts concerning this case, probably not."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Whether you're talking about The Social Network, Moneyball, or Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin has written some of my very favourite films over the last decade. For that reason alone I was obviously excited for whatever his next effort would be. After working on the screenplay with the assistance of Steven Spielberg, loosely over the last 14 years or so, The Trial of the Chicago 7 has finally seen the light of day. In a year that has had its best releases go straight to streaming, we now have another, and not just that, but it's also the must-see movie of the year now, at least in my opinion. Here's why, when awards season kicks in next year, I believe you'll be hearing a lot about this one.Truthfully, I didn't have a lot of knowledge of this true story prior to watching the film, so the cultural relevance was quite a shock to me. In the year of 1968, seven people stand trial for various reasons, all surrounding the riots that took place in Chigaco. With many allegories that relate to today's day, there are moments in this film that will have you scratching your head as to why we haven't exactly come further as a society since these events. More than anything, the mission of this film is both to make an exciting film, while also giving as much insight and information about this trial as possible. In that way, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a modern-day masterpiece when you're talking about courtroom dramas.Now, this may be the one area that I'm a little biased in, so maybe take this portion with a grain of salt, but I have to admit that the true star of this film is Aaron Sorkin. As both writer and director this time, his endless, quippy and clever dialogue never misses a beat here. Just when you think something about the story is going to lose your interest, the dialogue speeds up, catches your attention once again and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This screenplay takes all the tropes you've come to know about courtroom dramas and puts a very energetic spin on it. With the addition of very fluid editing by Alan Baumgarten, there wasn't a single boring moment.From Eddie Redmayne to Frank Langella, this cast is absolutely stacked. Joseph Gordon-Levitt steals the show on multiple occasions, due to his very committed line delivery, and the addition of Sacha Baron Cohen and Michael Keaton made the film that much better as well. It really came down to the stellar performance by Mark Rylance for me though. His persona is pretty much everyone watching the film itself. He's the voice of reason on many occasions, even though he too has some outbursts. This performance, along with nearly everyone else, is absolutely Oscar-worthy. This film is simply littered with talent across the board, on and off-screen.Overall, watch The Trial of the Chicago 7 was an enormous breath of fresh air for 2020 in terms of cinema. Sure, theatres aren't exactly how they used to be right now, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate the pieces of entertainment that we're still getting in other ways. This is easily one of the very best films of 2020 and probably would've still been with or without many other films being delayed. The screenplay is the true star of this film, but the subject matter is also incredibly timely and Sorkin has made his best director effort yet. I was glued to the screen from start to finish and I simply can't recommend this one enough. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a fantastic piece of cinema through and through."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,10/10,"My Review - The Trial of the Chicago 7 . Streaming on NetflixMy Rating 10/10
I have to give this fine movie the highest score as the Actors are superb, the Script by Aaron Sorkin is excellent . Aaron Sorkin also Directed this movie and its too good a movie not to have a wide Cinema release surely it must be a contender for many Academy Awards next year.
The story was new to me and is a true account of the 7 men on trial facing various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.
What was intended to be a peaceful protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention turned into a violent clash with police and the National Guard. The organizers of the protest including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Bobby Seale were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot and the trial that followed was one of the most notorious in history.
The release of this film at this time in America's history can't be an accident with the protests and violence resulting from The Black Lives Matter movement and the general turmoil we see on every news coverage in every State Republican or Democrat in the U.S.A.
Aaron Sorkin 's script has frightening parallels today with the historical events depicted in this film that took place over 50 years ago.
In fact as regards to the film's timely subject matter in 2020, Aaron Sorkin described the film as being more about modern day than the 1960's. He explained that, ""The script didn't change to mirror the times. The times changed to mirror the script.""
Whatever the result of the next American Presidential Election it's obvious that anger in a country that uses its Second Amendment Constitutional right to carry guns which was ratified in 1791 is lethal and dangerous. In the current Political climate where even talk of possible Civil War is included in conversations a law passed 230 years ago can't be appropriate in today's world of terrorism and violence.
The fact that neither Presidential Candidate has mentioned repealing or addressing the gun laws issue for fear of voter backlash is reprehensible.
No spoilers from me about the outcome of this story except to praise the actors starting with Eddie Redmayne giving the finest performance I've seen him in since his Academy Award winning role in The Theory of Everything 2014 and The Danish Girl 2015 I was beginning to think he'd lost his acting mojo with his recent films ,especially Fantastic Beasts which I disliked .
In this film he plays political activist Tom Hayden all I knew about Tom Hayden was that he was once was married to Jane Fonda and became a Senator but that happened after the trial.
Eddie Redmayne perfected a perfect American accent for this role and his body language and appearance belies his 38 years ,he looks 20 years younger.
There are many other great performance in this film including veteran Frank Langella as the inept and prejudiced Judge Julius Hoffman . I saw Frank Langella on stage in London cast as President Richard Nixon in Frost Nixon and he was mesmerising.
Nixon had just been elected President at the time of this story which and the judicial system in America never ceases to amaze me it's as odd as their voting system.
The other stand out acting performance in this movie is from Sacha Baron Cohen as off beat hippy political protester on trial with Hayden .He has some of the best scenes in the movie . Mark Rylance as William Kunstler the defence attorney of the 7 is also impressive as are the rest of this fine ensemble cast.
I read that Steven Spielberg was originally attached to direct, he was planning on meeting with Heath Ledger to discuss the role of Tom Hayden. Ledger passed away the day before he was scheduled to meet with Spielberg. Spielberg also wanted Will Smith to play Bobby Seale.
The Production was difficult to finance Amblin Partners initially shut the film down during pre-production due to budget concerns, but Paramount Pictures joined the project with Cross Creek to co-produce & co-finance the film.
It's rare today for me to find every aspect of a movie exceptional but it's a great pleasure when it happens in my opinion The Trial of the Chicago Seven joins a small group of films that successfully exposes injustice and corruption some others are Frost Nixon, Spotlight The Manchurian Candidate ,Vice, The Normal Heart, Apocalypse Now and the list goes on and no doubt more will be made about our time in history today.
I think this is a very important film and can't recommend it highly enough."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 March 2021,6/10,"The characters are a little too much. there is very little nuance for a good/bad person. It's very blunt in the portail of the characters. But sure, good storytelling and good acting. But maybe a little too easy for me6/10: good"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 October 2020,9/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Aaron Sorkin has been around for quite some time. A Few Good Men, Moneyball, Steve Jobs, and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade, The Social Network, all have one thing in common: Sorkin as a screenwriter, but not as the director. Molly's Game was Sorkin's directorial debut, which makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 only his second time in the director's chair. I've either loved or liked every film from him, so obviously, my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence. However, with the announcement of such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project...Expectations fulfilled. This is, in fact, one of 2020's very best films, without the shadow of a doubt. Based on real events, the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action: the trial. Only twenty minutes in, the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously. Sorkin's employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll. The actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline, which would reduce the trial's value. It's the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event.I couldn't take my eyes off-screen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues. Every conversation, every argument, every objection, overrule, or ""motion denied"" is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner. It's one of those movies where the ""action"" belongs to words instead of fists. I felt tremendously invested in the trial. It never loses a gram of interest, it's full-on exciting all the time. I desperately wanted to find out the result of the case (I didn't possess knowledge of the real story, but I'll address this further down). I really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions. I strongly desired to see the end of the situation.As soon as the film ends, I felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story. I spent close to forty-five minutes reading many articles about the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the riots, the presidential nominees... everything. This is one of the most important criteria I have to define how successful a historical flick truly is: how much does it compel me to research everything about it. The Trial of the Chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact. From what I've read, Sorkin changes a few details timeline-wise (something pretty common in this type of movie), but overall, it's a pretty accurate, realistic adaptation.Technically, every component is remarkable, as expected from a Netflix-Sorkin partnership. However, the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations, leaving me at the edge of my couch, biting my nails. It's a fantastic achievement from Daniel Pemberton, who also scored Birds of Prey and Enola Holmes this year. Additionally, this might not be a one-location film, but Sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants.Besides Sorkin's screenplay, the cast obviously plays a massive role. Just like I mentioned above, this is a movie where the ""action"" is played out through words. Inside the courtroom, there are constant arguments, countless contempts of court, a voir dire (it doesn't hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film), and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence. Every actor is absolutely outstanding, I was able to feel everything during that trial, but I do have four standouts.Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman) shares the laugh spotlight with Jeremy Strong (Jerry Rubin), but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief. His delivery and timing are pure gold. I can't deny that I was surprised by his performance since I've only seen him in Borat. He's extremely funny, but don't be mistaken by my words: Abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial, offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose. Eddie Redmayne brings his Oscar-winner face to the game by interpreting Tom Hayden. A vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty, they're not all exactly innocent as well. Hayden's final speech is one of Redmayne's best scenes of his career.Mark Rylance plays the role of the public, portraying the defendants' lawyer, William Kunstler. He shares the viewer's frustration with the judge's decisions but never gives up, trying to bring justice to the case. If I had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year, it would be Rylance due to his powerful display. My last standout is Frank Langella as the judge Julius Hoffman. I believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love, but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates. Langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair, racist, unqualified judge. His performance is simply extraordinary.These are my four standouts, but the entire cast is phenomenal. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't get to see more from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Bobby Seale), but after researching Bobby's involvement in this story, I understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative. He plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial, transmitting a message that humanity's behavior may have evolved regarding racism, but there's still a long way to go. A final shoutout to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is also excellent as Richard Schultz.I only have one issue. In terms of entertainment, the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move. However, the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that I could only understand who's who and their purpose during the trial. Sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are, what they did, and where the narrative is driving towards, skipping through dozens of details that (mostly) non-American audiences will struggle to understand in time. Sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially, offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations.All in all, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, probably the best at the date of this review. Aaron Sorkin's narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well. Sorkin's screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure. Maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story. Inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues, never losing steam until the very end. It's also a lot funnier than I expected. Regarding the cast, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, and Frank Langella are my standouts, but every actor delivers outstanding performances. Daniel Pemberton's score shines in an overall very well-produced film. The first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom, but it's so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyone's names and purposes. Assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move, especially for non-Americans. Nevertheless, this minor issue doesn't affect an otherwise flawless movie. Obviously, I strongly recommend it! Maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing, but don't read too much due to the usual spoilers.Rating: A"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,8/10,"I fully loved that, I was hooked from the first minute. The judge played his role well because I hated him so much, he was so annoying. I can't believe people let the judge get away with it. I wasn't familiar with the story before the film but I did some research after and it seemed to be more or less dead on. I was very happy and pleased with the acting in The film, wasn't a single bad actor in the entire film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 deals with complex and timely topics with enough nuance and wit to make what could've been an overly overwhelming movie (which at times it is) into a moving and inspiring piece of courtroom cinema with incredible performances from its excellent ensemble cast.( Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Sacha Baron Cohen anyone? )Sorkin's direction can be a bit flat, but he still more than makes up for it with his electrifying dialogue and amazingly stylish editing (also, I'm just biased towards court dramas)."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,7/10,"This is really Sacha Baron Cohen and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's movie. Their performances stood out most, along with a usually solid Mark Rylance. It was Sacha and Yahya's delivery which actually motivated me to research more into who they were portraying afterwards.This was a solid movie, but at the end of the day it's a 2+ hour court room drama and crash course in 1960s American politics. Court room dramas have been done better. As a non-American who lives over 15,000km from the US, American politics start to just become white noise to me these days. This film probably wasn't the best choice of escapism from 2020.That said, it's still a well-written film, which has come to be expected from Sorkin. I think his directing skills haven't quite caught up to match his writing ability though. Just felt it was missing something.It certainly succeeds in making the viewer frustrated - that judge! Just wish the whole film had matched the phenomenal intro."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,8/10,"A very good courtroom drama. One of the best of its kind we had in the last years. And the relevance of this 50 year old story is really scary. it really seems not much has changed across the pond or mistakes are done again and again. But no, I dont want this review to become political. I want it to be the great aritistic merrits. The cast is outstanding. Not only are the actors wisely chosen, they all give fantastic performances. Great performances Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne. Sacha Baron Cohen was absolutely fantastic in one of his rare serious roles. Frank Langella's character was so unbelievable (yet its true) and it was probably hard t play such a foolish role with the seriousness it needed. Therefor kudos for Langella to achieve that. Michael Keaton was also outstanding in his short role. Jeremy Strong was absolutely memorable and watch out of Yahya Abdul-Manteen who onces again gives a stand out performance and steals the screen everytime he appears on it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was also solid.
The score was great. The screenplay magnifically. I found it bit anticlimatic (in a way) but still a very good direction.
One of the most memorable films of the year so far."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 November 2020,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a legal drama written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men, The Social Network) based on the true story of the titular anti-Vietnam War protesters. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, and Frank Langella, it brings to light an interesting and overlooked moment during a tumultuous time in American history.In 1968, the Democratic National Convention is set to take place in Chicago while the highly unpopular Vietnam War rages with thousands of American soldiers already killed in the conflict. In protest, several activists set out to demonstrate their outrage over these deaths, including Youth International Party members Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Students for a Democratic Society members Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), National Mobilisation Committee to End the War in Vietnam leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins), John Froines (Daniel Flaherty), and Black Panther Party chairman Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). After all of them are arrested five months later, the group are put on trial for attempting to incite riots, with the court presided over by the biased Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella and not related to Abbie).Aaron Sorkin is a name that will often come up when discussing how to write successful dialogue between characters while they are going about their daily lives. He is well known for conveying to the audience a sense of realism that even the most casual of viewer can relate to no matter their social class. Here in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", Sorkin shows us the account of a surprisingly neglected group of Americans from different walks of life that all share one belief - that the bloodshed in Vietnam needs to end. Not being American myself, the story of these individuals was initially unfamiliar to me and I wasn't sure who any of these people were, although Abbie Hoffman's name did ring a bell. With that in mind, I think the film does a fine job emphasising how much this group of people were in it together through such a lengthy trial and how their important core values united them in the face of adversity, especially when they were at such a strong disadvantage. It is this technique that makes a film like this so engrossing, as it constantly seems as though things could go either way, assuming you are unaware of how the actual trial played out in real life.In addition to writing the screenplay, Sorkin also directed the film, having previously made his debut with 2017's ""Molly's Game"", and he again proves that he is more than worthy of helming this position. Sorkin wears his dialogue trademarks on his sleeve, frequently showing the main characters bouncing off one another with hard-hitting questions related to what this whole trial is really about and if there are constitutional guidelines not being followed, all while several people dying in the war in Vietnam. This draws some thought-provoking parallels to many of the protests that are currently happening in the US today, as the anger of injustice still reverberates even after more than fifty years. Of course, I couldn't help but feel as though some of these dramatisations were clearly exaggerated or played up for entertainment reasons, but then again, a film's primary purpose is to entertain, so I suppose in that regard it succeeds greatly.Being an ensemble cast, it is kind of difficult for me to single out just one of the actor's performances as the winning one. It's always nice to see Sacha Baron Cohen showing his dramatic side, playing activist Abbie Hoffman, perhaps the best known of the titular Chicago 7, and using his skilled mimicry of foreign accents to his advantage to show a politically motivated man wanting peace for his country. I also enjoyed Eddie Redmayne and Alex Sharp as Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, respectively, a pair of students whose youthfulness makes their involvement in this trial a sad reflection of that turbulent era of Vietnam War protests. Mark Rylance also has a memorable part as William Kunstler, the group's lawyer who himself faces discrimination from his superiors. However, Frank Langella is also worth mentioning as Judge Hoffman, an unfair and often prejudiced authority figure who refuses to see things from the perspective of the defendants. All of these roles made the film so much more intriguing, not only because of the actors, but also due to Sorkin's dialogue.In conclusion, much like Spike Lee, it feels as though Aaron Sorkin is somebody who knows that no matter how many years go by, human nature will remain the same. The aforementioned parallels this film has to what is presently happening in the US only serves as proof that filmmakers like them should definitely be acknowledged in this day and age. With so many liberties now at risk in the ""land of the free"", things don't seem like they're getting any better. But at least we have films like this to remind us of what is at stake.I rate it 8/10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 December 2020,5/10,I thought this film felt like a stage play full of character's but it had no clear central protagonist and so it was kind of hard to find anyone to really cares about. It sorta felt like what happened in 2020 in a really not that interesting sort of way? The performances weren't anything special. The dialogue was sorta on the nose. I get that it was Sorkin but I still don't think it was a great film. It wasn't awful or anything. It was just ok. Ali G was kinda annoying. Was he supposed to be playing a 20 ish year old person?
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 February 2021,8/10,"It's a bit insane that these events took place only 50 years ago. This is a powerful story about injustice and is told in an engaging way without being overly one-sided. Sorkin's rapid, witty dialogue keeps the film churning at a good pace and the humor adds some good levity to the story, making for a more enjoyable watch. Sorkin gets a little too heavy-handed and Hollywood at the end, but everything before it is strong. The cast is excellent with standout performances from Cohen, Strong, and Rylance. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a solid film that the Academy will likely award several times on Oscar night."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 March 2021,7/10,"The plot is intense and dramatic; also, the actors are excellent; I highly recommend it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,7/10,"Sorkin has many flaws, but very few writers can pull off a historical courtroom drama that is mostly people talking. The premise of structuring a story around a blatantly unfair trial and a bunch of flashbacks sounds mind numbingly boring, but not in his hands. Not only does he pull it off, but he makes the whole thing super watchable. I mean, this is the guy who gave us ""You can't handle the truth"" and ""You have part of my attention - you have the minimum amount."" Is it perfect? Hell, no. And neither is he. (I found myself thinking the more interesting movie here would have focused on Hampton and Seale...but I would want another writer and director for that film.) Still, this time around Sorkin seemed willing to explore the less inspirational side of politics, the blatant corruption instead of the poetic compromise. Plus, his cast is exceptional, and they help his dialogue cook. This is not the best courtroom drama ever. It is not even Sorkin's best courtroom drama ever. But it is still worth watching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,7/10,"After Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin is back in the director's chair with The Trial of the Chicago 7 and he managed to make a great courtroom drama.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is based on the infamous 1968 trial where eight people were believed to have incited riots at the Democratic National Convention in protest of the Vietnam war.This is a film I was eagerly anticipating due to the ensemble cast and the talent that is Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin brings us an intense and fascinating courtroom drama that is well written and well acted. The opening scene wastes no time in revealing the main characters and their motivations and the fast pacing along with Sorkin's trademark dialogue grabbed my attention from the get go. It's a well edited sequence that hooks you onto the story and the rest of the film is just as entertaining. I'm a sucker for courtroom dramas and Sorkin managed to make each court scene compelling. I think he stepped up in terms of direction from Molly's Game as he brought the right amount of tension and ferocity during those court scenes and fantastic performances from each actor. There is quite a bit of humour thrown around which I personally didn't find that funny and at times the film can get fairly cheesy.Each and every cast member brought their A game here and elevated the atmosphere of each scene. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong's characters are more comedic than the rest and they pulled it off well. I'm not the biggest fan of Eddie Redmayne but he did a fantastic job as Tom Hayden. It's great to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt acting again and he was great. Mark Rylance was incredible as William Kunstler and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was absolutely amazing. A standout was Frank Langella as Judge Hoffman. His character is so unlikeable and Langella did a great job portraying that. I seriously hope some of these actors get Oscar nominations.A major complaint I have is the ending. It may seem powerful but at the same time I thought it was very cheesy and didn't quite fit in with rest of the film. Apart from that, Aaron Sorkin gives us an intriguing courtroom drama with The Trial of the Chicago 7 and I think it's worth your time."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 October 2020,9/10,The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a superb movie. But I knew that even before it's release. This is a surefire Oscar hit. All the things were perfect in this movie. I didn't like Aaron Sorkin's debut movie Molly's Game much but this was really good. Waiting for his next.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 March 2021,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is one of the best movies I have seen that are nominated for this year's Academy Awards. It is serious in a amazing way, but also pretty humorous and easy to watch. It is the kind of movies that deserve a well written script and here enters Aaron Sorkin. For those who are not familiar with him, he's only one of the best screenwriters out there, he mostly wrote ""The Social Network"", ""Moneyball"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War"".This time he is both the director and screenwriter, he does both things in a most dramatic and perfect way.The story focuses on the trial of 7 people who face various charges surrounding the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Mostly protests against The Vietnam War. Around this time the freedom of speech and liberty were at stake, many people came from different parties but they all had one common goal: The SDS, The Yippies, The Mobe and The Black Panthers all joined together against the war.With an ensemble cast of amazing actors and a well script, this movie has no flaws and is recommended to watch for the upcoming Academy Awards. Eddie Redmayne is amazing, Sacha Baron Cohen in another perfect and serious role after his last performance in ""The Spy"". Joseph Gordon Levitt is good in every movie he performs, same goes for Mark Rylance and Michael Keaton. Yahya Abdul Mateen II has an exceptional role and acts too good.Overall this is one of my favorite movies to win the Academy Awards this year."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,7/10,"After watching every Sorkin movie in anticipation for Trial, I am not at all disappointed but also don't think it's on par with his best films. Trial is a rock solid courtroom drama with a fantastic ensemble cast pulling great performances out of actors I have loved in many past performances. Movies about true stories are often easy to enjoy because of their relevance and precedent they set for what has happened since, and Trial does nail the essence of what happened in this case. It's not a groundbreaking cinematic picture and doesn't tell us anything too revelatory thematically, but the central message (that political protest and freedom of speech is essential to democracy, and that the legal system is frequently unjust) is entirely worthwhile. I enjoyed many of the performances, but Cohen was the scene stealer for me, deftly managing the balance of comedic relief early and showing his thoughtful side later on. Redmayne was the other performance I really enjoyed, as well as Abdul-Mateen, but there isn't a bad performance in the film. The biggest area where the film could have done more is in engaging the audience with the reasons for their protest rather than the execution of it. It is interesting and important to understand the interactions between protesters, police, and the legal system, but it rings a bit more hollow when we're given nothing more than allusions to the reasons they are protesting at all. The troops who died at Vietnam are brought up a couple times, but outside of the list of names we don't get nearly enough of a sense of what brought them all to Chicago, what was so important to them to risk all of this. Without that fundamental investment in their journey, it was less exciting to follow the trial. We still know that they were protesting the Democratic convention due to continuing war in Vietnam, but given that it's the entire reason for the movie's events, I wanted to delve much deeper into their views on it. Maybe that's just me, and if you want to just follow a real, unjust, politically steeped trial of historical importance then Trial is the perfect movie for you."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,6/10,"All the rave reviews from people here puzzle me, they can't all be fake. I'm guessing that most of them are impressed with a decent movie in such a terrible year and that anything that's even remotely decent is applauded.
It's a good movie with a few compelling scenes but it not in any way moving or emotional. The court room scenes are bland and predictable and there is nothing revealing or heart warming throughout the whole movie. The ending is kinda lame.
There are far too many stories of police violence or social justice warriors that haven't been told to choose from if the director wanted to truly try to make a difference. This film feels like a safe and uncontroversial film to make without causing too much of a fuss from the government in power.
There are plenty of stories more intense, hopefully we can get more directors with a spine to come forward and risk something for a change."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 October 2020,8/10,"""This is the Academy Awards of protests and as far as I'm concerned it's an honor just to be nominated.""Let's get one thing straight. Whether it's writing or directing, it might just be impossible for Aaron Sorkin to make anything but a good movie. And The Trial of the Chicago 7 is no exception. The story follows seven people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. And since I'm in Chicago right now, everyone is freaking out about this movie. Since I'm at film school, this is all my professors are talking about whether they loved it or hated it. Personally, I can't see how anyone could really hate this movie. It's well made and such a crowd please. The way I would describe it is Green Book, just without all the controversy. The reception and reviews are very similar. Probably the only controversy is that it is not 100% historically correct. But that isn't what the movie is going for. Aaron Sorkin has been accused of this a few times, especially with The Social Network. However, the dialogue and storytelling is where the movie shines. The dialogue is very clever in the way it creates emotion. The story only enhances from that. I wanted to yell at the screen so many times from frustration. What made it worse-or rather better-is how relevant it is to the world today. It couldn't have been released at a better time. Coincidentally, the situation is similar with Da 5 Bloods in how it was released around the time of the George Floyd events. What helps in the favor of The Trial of the Chicago 7 is it doesn't take sides politically in the story. At least not in the sense that it chooses a political party.This is the ensemble of the year. The cast is stacked so high it couldn't get any better. Like this year's One Night in Miami, you can't pick a best actor. They all do well equally. Since they all have about the same amount of screen time with their own stories, you can connect with each and every one, the protagonists that is. Come awards season, the problem will be where to nominate them. I can tell you now there is a small chance anyone will be put in a lead category. The supporting category is probably the only place anyone will go. And the thing is it may only be one person getting nominated. The odds, and my personal pick, are in the favor of Mark Rylance. He plays the attorney. As an attorney you already know he's going to have some great argumentative dialogue. Plus he's the only one that you can't really get mad at at any point in my opinion. But Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Strong, and Frank Langella all do just as amazing. I won't break down every character because I'd rather you go watch the movie on Netflix yourself to see.As I mentioned before, this is an absolute crowd pleaser. Aaron Sorkin's writing is the shining jewel of it all. It's his directing that might be the cause of problem for this. I really liked his direction, but sometimes he goes for the classic route of making everyone happy. The movie follows certain beats that aren't necessarily bad, but it's a way to manipulate viewers in how they should feel regardless of their opinions. Another source of that is Daniel Pemberton's score. The score has been the main source of everyone's problem it seems. I wouldn't consider it bad but it's there to tell you how you should feel. There isn't much range to feel anything different than you're told. I don't think I would have felt much different if the direction or score were different. But those aspects don't make this any less of a great movie than it is. I would urge anyone to watch this. It showcases good cinema and will engage anyone who watches."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 April 2021,8/10,"Another classic true story based film, I love a good ole movie based on a true story. Enjoyed this alot I'd definitely recommend it, this film made me laugh so much. Especially considering Sacha Baron Cohen was in it whom I find very funny at the best of times.A great representation of the famous trial that happened for the Chicago 7 peaceful riots gone violent, I won't say too much as you'll find out.Hope you enjoy the film as I did! Catch it on (Netflix)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 January 2021,9/10,"For those unfamiliar with the story of the Chicago 7 (like I was), prepare for one hell of a ride with this screenplay. It is an astonishingly painful and embarrassing story for the USA, and is executed superbly well in the film.The Trial of the Chicago 7 benefits from a fantastic cast, who really sell their performances and just all click into place perfectly. The highlights were Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong for me, who really stood out. Mark Rylance and Frank Langella were extraordinary too. The court room was brought to life vividly and powerfully by the cast. The dialogue was spot on too, injecting so much gravity and meaning in the court proceedings.I also really appreciated the non-linear story telling. As somebody unfamiliar with the events in Chicago, it injected a lot of tension into the film, and was a genius storytelling move. The scenes from Chicago were supplemented with actual footage of the events, which were often graphic but also highly necessary in serving as a reminder that what we are watching was real. This really punched home the message of the film and gave it a lot of impact.I always highly rate films that leave me with a strong emotion afterward, and this film left me furious. We essentially witness a kangaroo court, something that most Americans would more likely associate with the USSR than their own country. The way that Aaron Sorkin presents this hypocrisy and shines a light on the flaws of the American justice system (a system that works perfectly well when it suits the powers that be) is genius and food for thought.Stunning and shocking in equal measure. A must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 March 2021,7/10,"As a person who did not know about this trial, the movie provides good layout of the whole event: anti-war movement, legal process, and social atmosphere in 1968. However, researching about the real life event is way more interesting than the movie which is supposed to be dramatic, interesting, entertaining, and captivating. It's like a chef acquires invaluable and rare ingredients and makes them into average meal. Chicago 7 trial is such an interesting topic and still relatable to injustice prevailing today's society. There could be much more connection and analogy. I'm not saying that the whole trial should be embellished and exaggerated. There are so many movies staying true to the actual history and providing calm, lean, and brief narrative but still absorbing the audience. 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' fails to achieve that goal. Each trial in different day seems disconnected and far from one another and the flashback to the riot is awkward in timing and in manner. However, I want to praise Sacha Baron Cohen's acting in the middle of poor screenwriting. Abbie is funny and light-hearted but shows passion, intellect, and earnestness when he needs to without losing his cheerfulness."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 December 2020,7/10,"If there's one thing that Aaron Sorkin can do - though in fairness it should be noted that he can do much more than one thing - it's to make you interested in and informed about a subject about which you know little or nothing. This is no exception - the first 10 minutes or so give a typically Sorkin-paced introduction to the context, and then we're into a courtroom drama that really is almost entirely set in the courtroom. The charges the accused face, and the events themselves, are only gradually revealed, a move which keeps the novice like me intrigued, but also a little frustrated. It seems as if Sorkin doesn't quite trust himself to keep as interested in a straight-line narrative, so he's forced to mix it up. And at times this does sag a little, a little bogged down in another scene of men shouting in rooms - but then, this is Sorkin, and once again he does little to counter the often-repeated accusation that he too often relegates women to the background. Once again the women are mostly 'supporting' the heroic men, answering phones, taking notes, making arrangements. The finale of the film also falls into another classic Sorkin flaw - sentimental grandstanding, by way of Dead Poets Society; it would have far more moving if underplayed. But also because it's Sorkin, it's another of those films you come away from a little more informed, a little more provoked and a little more reflective. The performances all work well, and we're left with the unerring feeling that if Sorkin had let a director other than himself put his words on the screen, this would have been even better."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 January 2021,7/10,"An exciting topic, well written. Above all, the strong focus on the plot in the court process, reminiscent of the final scene from JFK with Kevon Costner. Unfortunately, despite the great cast, the film is a little boring in its structure and pulls itself out very strongly - the great realization remains."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 November 2020,9/10,"It's a dialogue-heavy courtroom drama with all the humour, high-stakes intensity, and fiery one-liners (""What's your price?"" ""My life"") of an action film. The script and editing masterfully ramp up the pre-, during-, and post-protest tension simultaneously (adding in Abbie's stand-up was a cool touch) and the cast is excellent (Rylance and Cohen are standouts). The prominence then disappearance of Seale's poignant sub-plot is the only real misstep here (the ending is schmaltzy but effective).
8.5/10 (Amazing)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 June 2021,6/10,"This film is ""based on"" the trial of high profile protest leaders following the police riots in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic convention in which Hubert Humphrey was nominated for president after the assassination of Robert Kennedy. Humphrey then lost to Richard Nixon.It was fascinating to see how Sorkin portrayed the main characters, including defendants Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden. Two more minor defendants were Lee Weiner and John Froines. The early part of the trial included Bobby Seale, the leader of the Black Panthers. The other stars in that trial were defense lawyers William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass. The prosecutor is Richard Schultz. And of course, there was the judge, 74-year-old Julius Hoffman.Sometimes I think filmmakers take too many liberties with the historical facts. It is difficult to compress a many-month trial into two hours. For example, the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton by the Chicago police is given a significant role in the film, though Hampton's death took place after Seale's trial had been separated from the others. Sorkin makes Abbie Hoffman the intellectual leader of the defendants which strikes me as bizarre, but the movie belongs to him perhaps because he was colorful. Tom Hayden, leader of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), is shown almost as a preppie leftist, even though he had been a Freedom Rider in the early 1960s. Hayden was more of a policy wonk, but I thought the movie unfair to him. Rennie Davis comes across as a bit of a pipsqueak trying to hide his SDS leadership from his girlfriend's parents.William Kunstler (played by Mark Rylance) does an excellent, though maybe understated, job. Julius Hoffman (played by Frank Langella) is not caricatured as much as I thought he might be, though his obvious bias is fully portrayed."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 November 2020,10/10,So relevant in today's times. An Ensemble cast that performs brilliantly together. Great lines written beautifully and delivered with panache. Superb execution of real history in the most realistic manner. I felt the right emotions for the defendants and it is a part of the American history that all other countries need to learn from. A special mention for Sacha Boren Cohen. He deserves great praise for hitting it out of the park. His first dramatic performance and he does so well.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 March 2021,5/10,"On paper, best picture nominee 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' has a lot of things going for it. A proven director and writer in Aaron Sorkin. A plot that revolves around a dramatic period from a tumultuous time in our nation's history. And an above average cast (well, for the most part).Despite these promising elements, the verdict is that 'Chicago' does not rise to its high expectations. The film suffers from a sense of precociousness that comes with the territory in any Sorkin drama, whether on the big or small screen. None of the characters are all that likeable, but that's probably not the intention of the film. Still, it's hard to even root for the seven leaders of the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, who are supposed to be the underdogs here.Perhaps the best performances here are from Michael Keaton, as the vindictive former attorney general Ramsey Clark, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays the lone black man charged with inciting the riots. They bring a sense of authenticity to their roles, which is more than the others can say. There is also some great editing work through 'Chicago,' threading dialogue and the patchwork-like scenes together smoothly. But that's pretty much it.'The Trial of the Chicago 7' is a valiant effort, but it unfortunately is not as good as it thinks it is."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Extremely relevant, brilliantly executed and powerful; Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"" is
one of the best films of the year and could not have been released at a more perfect time.In this courtroom drama, the Chicago Seven, a group of anti-Vietnam war protestors are charged with conspiracy, rioting and crossing state lines all surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Based on the true story.Sorkin always has a way with conversations between actors. That's the beauty of his screenwriting; you just can't wait to hear what the character says next. In ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"", writer/director Aaron Sorkin grippingly dramatizes this true story with class, facts and always staying grounded. The cast is sensational and probably the best ensemble you will see this year. Having to showcase your talent in front of all these great names with a script from Sorkin must be a field day. Special mentions go out to Sacha Baron Cohen who's brilliant portrayal of Abbie Hoffman steals the show (I smell awards). I'd also like single out Jeremy Strong's incredible and wholesome performance and that of Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who embodies Bobby Seale and is terrific. There is no doubt that this film will be a top contender during awards season, and in all honesty it should be. ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"" is moving, eye-opening and funny at times but what it really is, is the movie everyone needs to see and the one we all need right now.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"There are a few memorable courthouse dramas, a Few Good Men and 12 Angry Men to name only two of which. And when they are well made, much like a winning verdict they are met with thunderous applause. That much can be said for Academy Award winning writer-director Aaron Sorkin's blistering true story of the Chicago Seven, a trial which went on for nearly a year in the late 60s. And at first when Netflix's latest drama starts it hits with immediate historical speeches, and it's a slow burner. But from the moment it starts to the final credits, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a real corker. First there's the cast, and they come in high from Oscar winning Brits to American legends, the real standout is Sacha Baron-Cohen and Eddie Redmayne who are beat for beat our their performances, Eddie probably may win another Oscar for this. And Cohen thankfully gives a career best performance and you can tell he'll want to add another gold to his trophy cabinet. Second is the writing, now courthouse dramas are smart anyway, with a lot of long words, some very fast speaking and a lot of shouting especially in a filled courtroom, and thankfully Sorkin who is known for his smart writing after The Social Network and Steve Jobs, adds to the intellect in wonderful contrast. And happily his directing adds to that too, every angle, every shot and every take are as compelling as they are stylish their is no error to his directing here, it might be a slow burner but it never drags. Every aspect of this thunderous courthouse drama delivers in spades and with the epic soundtrack it's almost as if it was made by well Sorkin there's no other way to describe that, and that is the highest compliment. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is powerful, it's smart and it looks like Netflix will be heading to the Oscars with this one. And whatever it gets its well deserved. Justice is good. 4/5. A must see."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 November 2020,7/10,"When I first approached this movie, I had no idea what happened in 1968 in Chicago. I knew that there were some protests against the war in Vietnam, but I had no idea who was involved and what happened precisely. However, the movie manages to introduce events and players that took part to riots perfectly with no need of prior knowledge (but a quick visit to the Wikipedia page wouldn't hurt). It highlights flaws on both protesters and law enforcement sides. The movie, exactly like a trial, is impartial, or at least tries to be.The editing is amazing, it has a really good rhythm and kept me glued to the screen for the entire length. The movie most of the time shows the trial but sometimes comes back in time, with short but really effective flashbacks that explains what happened during the riot days. The tension buildup is amazing and everything is how is suppose to be: the music, the acting and the photography. The cast is top notch, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Cohen and Mark Rylance stole the scene: their performances were memorable. Other big names were involved such as Carroll Lynch and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that this time had a secondary role therefore not much screen time. I did not like at all the portrayal of the judge that was painted like a stupid guy that did not understand anything about the law. This is for sure the main flaw of the film, at least for me.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is engaging, I never felt bored, even if topics treated are not really easy to process, creators did their best to keep this movie simple and very entertaining."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,8/10,It is a really good movie about true events of a trial in USA. I can´t believe that a judge like this could exists. Outstanding performance of Sacha Baron Cohen also really good performance of Eddie Redmayne.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,8/10,Great Job on the Intention and Obstacle. I have been doing Mr Sorkin's MasterClass online. He is Good Teacher ! I enjoyed the Film but bit tired of hearing about all the Lies they got away with back then and the Strong Arm tactics. Love Court Room scenes in General and Frank Langella is probably the most accomplished Actor in Cast but feel the GAVEL belongs in right hand not left. I wonder if Judge Hoffman was really Left Handed ? Very Much liked this Film more after a second viewing and bit of research.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 April 2021,5/10,"I have seen so many biopics that are similar to The Trial of the Chicago 7, and after watching The Trial of the Chicago 7, I can say that this movie isn't all that special. I don't know why, but everybody thinks that biopics are always amazing, even when that biopic strives for nothing groundbreaking. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is just an average biopic. It plays all of the cards that are always being played by biopics.I think the only thing that offers any real potential in a biopic is the acting. Unfortunately, the acting here is just bland. There are no breakout performances; every actor did a fine job with what they got. I just keep on seeing people praise the acting, when it was just fine.I also found the movie to be quite boring at times. I really couldn't care less about the characters and when they were exchanging dialogue. The characters were just one-dimensional, and I get that this is a movie with a dozen plus characters, but the only personality the characters had were their politics. The film shines the most when there's exposition given about the trial. The riots were entertaining and intense, but those were the only times the movie was entertaining or intense.It's trendy to make biopics about social injustice and whatnot, but all of them are just so similar. Usually having good production quality with great actors and a story that attempts to get you emotional all because it happened at some point in time. This film is just Oscar bait to me; I wouldn't be surprised to see this film win several Oscars. And I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it's an average biopic, and that's all."

Director: Andy Sorkin
Starring: Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Alex Sharp, Jeremy Strong, John Carol Lynch, Yahya Abdul Mateen, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank langella etcOverall rating 94/100The trial of the Chicago 7 is about seven different people all on trial with various charges linked to the uprising at the 1968 democratic nation convention in Chicago. Wow what a truly powerful and cleverly directed movie this was, there is a lot of great stuff to say about the trial of the Chicago seven so lets get started.My first few positives would be the themes, balancing of different views, script and how informative it was about the process of court trials. The movies themes on the the political divide in America was shocking but fascinating to watch, the movie did an excellent job at highlighting multiple issues that are still happening to this day within America based on political bias or a poorer member of society being unable to afford good lawyers. The movie also did a brilliant job at balancing both political opinions throughout the movie. For the most part the movie found a common ground at making you understand and stand with the people on trial, but also understand where the court and opposition were coming from with how they were all behaving. I also appreciated how informative the movie was about the court process, learning just how long it can take for a court case to end and the amount of people that are seen was really interesting to me made me understand how complicated and often heart-breaking different cases can be and this one was no different. The script was also phenomenal, Aaron Sorkin wrote one of the best script I have heard here, he managed to make something as simple as one court case a brilliantly put together movie, with fantastic characters, fantastic insights into the political world of this time period and some truly clever and moving dialogue that always kept you interested.My next few positives would be the likeable characters, performances, humour, and conflict between the characters. The performances here were absolutely fantastic from everyone, but in particular Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. Eddie Redmayne's performance was powerful and passionate, and his character came across as the most authentic character in the film, Sacha Baron Cohen was brilliant, his comedic timing and the dialogue he was given was absolutely fantastic he was just infectious to watch. All of the characters in general were extremely likeable and mad the movie work due to the large focus on them and what they stood for. I also really liked the conflict between all of the characters, the movie didn't simply have seven characters who were the same and agreed on everything, they often had different point of views on how to handle different situations throughout the movie, this was excellent and raised the stakes for the characters well.My only slight nit-pick for the movie would be the lack of character depth to the characters. The characters never really to me felt like actual peoples, there was never any depth to any of their characters, they represented different groups of people and overall purpose for stopping the war instead of seven individual people which effected the characters connect ability slightly but the focus on the main themes and messages of the film were still handled well due to even more attention being put on them.My final few positives would be the rising of the stakes and build of tension, the plot twists and the powerful ending. The movie did a fantastic job at raising the stakes for all the characters, The movie was crafted so well that I genuinely didn't know what the result of the court battle was going to be, as more details were revealed the tension was built well with the aggravation of the characters. The plot twists were also excellently executed, there was some genuine twists with the character decisions that I didn't see coming, the movie raised awareness of racism and racial bias very well and the plot twists involving the Black panther gang was shocking. But added more importance to the outcome of the final act, which was absolutely powerful and very moving.Overall, The trial of the Chicago seven may use it's characters for the desired message instead of developing them, but this doesn't stop the movie from being masterfully directed, brilliantly crafted and powerful with fantastic performances and a clear contender for the awards season."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 May 2021,9/10,"Written and directed by the criminally underrated Aaron Sorkin we have a trial centred around 7 protestors that took their agenda to stop the Vietnam war to Chicago when the big men were at a convention. A strong cast including Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Frank Langella, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Michael Keaton portraying the various characters from defendents, witnesses and the judge made the piece far more engaging but the brilliant writing from Aaron Sorkin made it thrilling from start to finish and turns into one of the better Netflix movies i've seen in some time."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"A spectacular drama based on true events.
It is about the trial carried out against 7 men who were involved in riots against the police in Chicago.
Quality.
Safety pin.
Entertaining.
A wonderful all-star cast with quality performances.
The time spectacularly recreated.
Powerful.
It shows the harshness of justice for those who do not go with the ideals of the government, the power mafia, impunity, authoritarianism, lack of democracy, censorship.
How much repression can a few simple ideas provoke?
Smart and spectacular script.
And although it is a period film, it is so current and relevant to our contexts.
If you like movies with political themes, this one is going to enchant you.
A movie that Netflix took for its platform."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 November 2020,9/10,"The infamous trial of Chicago 7 was captured brilliantly. Though, it starts as a 'political trial', with the conclusion already known, the screenplay and editing were too good and brilliant. One of the finest court room drama, that did not get boring at any point. Well made!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 January 2021,7/10,"Good Film, Would add to the list of things to watch on netflix, but I don't have such a list."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 February 2021,6/10,"I don't know what to say about the movie; It started to get intriguing when the trial began, but the problem for me was that it wasn't that entertaining which isn't a surprise considering it's about a court trial. I didn't know about the real life events that this movie was based on, so I was intrigued until the end to find out what happened. I've given this movie a 6 because although I was intrigued with the plot, it wasn't that entertaining to watch and it's not one of those movies I would like to watch again."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 April 2021,6/10,"Aaron Sorkin can be ponderous, full of left-wing self-importance by way of an anti-neoliberal globalism. Sadly, that is the tonic set onto this overall monotonous, dramatically disfunctional and somewhat misconceived re-creation of the Chicago 7 trial, which Sorkin pens & directs. This movie is just a footnote to a time when preposterous debates over authoritarianism, protests, and the urge for radicalism are convulsing America, the EU, Brazil and other sites. While many will draw parallels between scenes involving civil unrest and the events of 2020, the philosophical differences between Maoist cultural revolution and conservative Universal Scrutiny, or the bi-party electoral processing, won't be sufficiently & clearly associated with the debates that rage within the ¨progressive¨ leftist politics today."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,6/10,Didn't quite live up to the hype for me! It was a dark comedy and I didn't really find myself caring about any of the characters apart from one. They didn't really show any background into these people it was mainly all courtroom drama. Sasha Baron Cohen did a great job.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,5/10,"Despite adequately solid production and performances, there are a few major flaws in Aaron Sorkin's film. It never feels cinematic -- instead presenting itself like a television reenactment of a fifty year old trial. It also takes obvious liberties with the actual events in order to shoehorn in cheesy clichés. Perhaps most egregious is the force-fed message that harkens present day unrest. While I happen to agree with that message, it induces overt and repeated eye-rolling."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 December 2020,6/10,"I'm a bit late to this one but recently I've been hearing a lot of good things about Aaron Sorkin, unfortunately I thought the direction and screenplay were quite weak.There was a lot that I liked about it, but most was due to pre-existing people and events. I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen's performance and character Abbie Hoffman. I relate to Abbie Hoffman in quite a lot of ways, take that however you like. All the other performances we're pretty decent except for Eddie Redmayne, I don't think he has a single good performance and that hasn't changed.The biggest problem I have with this film is the presentation. The way most everything was presented was really cheesy and felt disrespectful sometimes. The flashback style scenes we're the biggest victims of poor presentation, these are the scenes that felt disrespectful. These flashback sequences also felt a bit unnecessary at times, the safe ideas and emotions could have been conveyed just as well though dialogue and it could have shaved a hefty chunk of time off as well. I don't have a problem with flashbacks if they feel justified and/or if they are presented well, these flashbacks we're neither of these. The CGI during one of the flashbacks was awful as well.My favourite thing about the trial of the Chicago 7 we're the courtroom scenes and dynamic between all of the defendant's. My least favourite element is the complete lack of subtlety about the message being sent. This is a preference thing but I hate being hit on the head with the same thing over and over just to hammer a message I already agree with home. This brings me to my next point, this film didn't challenge me. It already aligns with my political beliefs so just confirming what I already agree with isn't the kind of experience I look for in a film. If you are politically right (right wing) then you will probably feel challenged by this film as it's very clear who you are supposed to agree with and like, and again the message is really hammered home almost devoid of subtlety.Technically this is bland. The music is awful and manipulative, the cinematography is bland, the editing is fine just like almost everything else about this movie. It's fine, the good elements outweigh the bad but there's absolutely nothing special about it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 December 2020,6/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a courtroom film as a result, it is hard to estimate Sorkin is aptitude at directing. He only directed two films, Trial of the Chicago 7 and Molly's Game, the latter is also a courtroom film. I think that in the bad sense of the term, Sorkin directed this film like a play. That is understandable because Sorkin's roots are in Broadway.Also, the characters are bland, they serve the film's political message but are never as detailed emotionally as real people. It is disappointing coming from a film that relies upon its characters.Perhaps what really shines in Trial of the Chicago 7 and makes it a watchable film is the optimistic message."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 April 2021,7/10,"I don't think anyone would deny that Aaron Sorkin is a much better writer than he is a director, which is pretty much where the bulk of my problems with this one lie. It's not all that well directed, the shot composition is pretty stale, and god is the ending cheesy.That said, I think people are being a little too harsh on this. It's been a while since I've seen a film that made me actually feel genuinely angry (if you don't count Judas And The Black Messiah), but this definitely managed that in quite a few scenes. In fact, it's a decent companion piece to that film in some ways.The injustice of the whole situation is brought across really well even if it could have used a better director, the performances are all fantastic, and I think the editing deserves a special mention here. It's not often I'll actually be rooting for something to win Best Editing, because usually the old adage of ""good editing is editing you don't notice"" is true, but there's a good amount of scenes that wouldn't have been nearly as effective with a worse editor working on them, so you're getting a shoutout, Alan Baumgarten. You did a great job.And it tells an interesting story, even if not all of it is true, and even if Aaron Sorkin isn't as good at directing as he is at writing, he can still really bloody write, so basically you should all leave this film alone and stop bullying it. I mean...you don't want to be the judge in it, do you?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 January 2021,9/10,"This is the sometimes shocking true story about some Vietnam war activists who ended up unfairly tried as starting violent riots. If your like me and like shouty courtroom dramas you'll love it.Not only is the story good here. But the cast is first rate. As soon as I saw the line up for this I had to watch it, and everyone is good. But Eddie Redmayne is really the standout performance in the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen is good too, but mostly adds humour.It could of gone into a bit more detail and the ending is cheesy so it's not perfect. but otherwise, a really good movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 March 2021,7/10,"ExtractoEl juicio de los 7 de Chicago es el tipo de película ""basada en hechos reales"" y de ""denuncia política"" que les gusta a los electores de los Oscars, un drama tribunalicio-político con la guerra de Vietnam como telón de fondo, bien montado, bien actuado (destacan Frank Langella y Joseph Gordon-Levitt), con buenos diálogos, pocas sorpresas pero que dista bastante de ser un gran film.ReseñaEl juicio de los 7 de Chicago relata el juicio llevado adelante en esa ciudad en 1969 en el que se acusó de conspiración a siete activistas y dirigentes que habían concurrido a la Convención Demócrata para manifestarse contra el envío de tropas a Vietnam, protesta que derivó en violentos incidentes con la policía.Como es habitual en estas películas ""basadas en hechos reales"", su introducción expone una abrumadora cantidad de información, presentando a los actores del drama antes de los incidentes que eran líderes o dirigentes de diversas agrupaciones estudiantiles, políticas y civiles: Estudiantes por una Sociedad Democrática (SDS), hippies del Youth International Party (Yippies), Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe) y un presidente de los Panteras Negras, entre otros.Luego Aaron Sorkin (director y guionista) procede a una acertada elipsis que nos ubica directamente en el juicio. El desarrollo es el de un típico drama tribunalicio y son los flashbacks, a veces en montaje paralelo con las declaraciones testimoniales, los que van reconstruyendo los hechos y su cronología. El lenguaje no es altisonante y aparecen inesperados rasgos de humor durante las audiencias, pero lamentablemente, como película estadounidense no puede privarse de algún momento culminante efectista. También se abordan las disidencias (a veces profundas) entre los acusados en función de sus grupos de pertenencia.Sólo hay dos situaciones de verdadera e inesperada tensión (una de ellas muy dura) durante un juicio que fue planteado desde el vamos como un montaje aleccionador y donde se manifiesta también el racismo de siempre.A pesar de su longitud, no decaen ni el ritmo ni el interés, sobresaliendo las actuaciones de Frank Langella como un imponente y por momentos iracundo juez y la de Joseph Gordon-Levitt como el solvente y contenido fiscal que cumple instrucciones pero no carece de consciencia.En suma, el juicio de los 7 de Chicago es el tipo de película ""basada en hechos reales"" y de ""denuncia política"" que les gusta a los electores de los Oscars pero que dista bastante de ser un gran film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 March 2021,8/10,"This was good rivetting film with some great acting especially from Mark Rylance and Frank Langella.But while we are left with a sympathetic view of the protesters, what is totally left out is the bigger picture...Richard Nixon became president in a close election on a law and order ticket after the Democratic convention was ruined by the riot and Humphey humiliated."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"An interesting essay about some brave individuals whom decided war was worth speaking up against, and the corrupted and vested system that tried to chew them up for dong so.In this film, rotten police, self interested government departments and a half senile judge star as the villains. The brave anti-war protagonists are flawed, but the system they run against even more so.It's interesting to see that the kind of rampant and unwarranted police violence we observe in the film has made a bit of a come back in recent times.Will we ever evolve into a better civilisation?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 February 2021,8/10,"An excellent film that about events that took place in 1968 that also seems to me to in some ways reflect our current absurd political scene. There are some things that are not quite what occurred, but for the most part it is accurate. Sorkin is one of our finest writers, though this does not top his The Social Network, and he has proven in his second film to be a fine director as well. I have not at this point seen his first, Molly's Game and look forward to his next, Lucy and Desi. The film has a huge and well known cast and they are all fine. Cohen, much to my surprise, is probably the standout in the showiest role though I really liked the small and sharp performance by Keaton and wish he had more to do. This is a very entertaining film that most likely will be beloved by liberals and despised by conservatives as it does not paint them in a good light, but that's kind of their fault as this is the way they behaved and these are the things they did. Some things don't change."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,9/10,"Wasn't expecting that, at all. This movie start to somewhere you never expect to be that intense.Great great performance, genius storytelling. All i can say that last hoffman scene was the reason it deserve 9 not 8 rating."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 January 2021,8/10,"O Scripts with Aaron Sorkin attached garner serious attention, and him turning his hand to directing was always going to be something worth seeing. This dramatization of a lesser-known civil rights event is less a focus of the incidents themselves, but how the characters interweave with one another. The team of Sacha Baron Cohen, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Redmayne and the superb Mark Rylance plays brilliantly on the screen, proving each of their acting credentials, whilst still compelling the story. Comedy is used well throughout to lighten the film, but does not detract from the gravity of what was being protested. Sorkin's script is typically sharp, and Chicago's hippie renaissance is effectively captured with the generous finances Netflix budgeted. All in all, The Trial of the Chicago Seven is clever, sharp, and well worth the watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,7/10,"I had no expectations at all for this film other than it to be somewhat of a dialogue heavy history lesson from Aaron Sorkin. To be fair a lot of the film is like that with majority of the scenes taking place within the court room, however this film is extremely easy to watch due to the cast and the pacing.As soon as this film starts it pretty much doesn't stop and has a nice flow to it going forwards and backwards in time without getting, us the audience, confused. That for one definitely helps in the enjoyment of the film, lets be honest the idea of a 2 hour court room dialogue heavy drama doesn't sound exciting, thrilling or emotional on the surface. However under the surface of this film is actually a real roller coaster of a ride for your emotions and is actually very entertaining. That is also made possible due to the great cast that was assembled for this film.I will only mention a few names because there are too many to list. For me the best performance is Eddie Redmayne for the reason being I don't usually like him in films. This is the first performance for me where I now realise why people like this guy and think he is a good actor. Although an understated performance at times, I feel majority of the most important scenes and parts of dialogue run through his character. The next for me is a surprise and that is Sacha Baron Cohen. Now its a surprise to me because initially I thought he was going to stick out like a swore thumb and be incredibly annoying. However he turned out to be the exact opposite and actually someone who was very important to the story and brought great levity to the film when needed. Its not to the same level of acclaim but gives me the same feeling watching Adam Sandler in ""Uncut Gems"", a shockingly good performance from an actor you didn't know could do it. The other mentions I'll give are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mark Rylance and Frank Langella. All of whom bring their A game to the table and are brilliant to watch in some of the most heated debates during the trial.My last points I want to make are about Aaron Sorkin because to me this is the least Aaron Sorkin like script or film. He is notoriously known for being dialogue heavy and extremely detailed and although this film is, I wouldn't have known he'd written this or directed it if I didn't have prior knowledge. That sounds like a negative but to me that is actually a positive shows his flexibility and range as a storyteller and filmmaker.Overall I really enjoyed it 75% out 100 or 7.5 out 10 I would definitely recommend it to someone who hasn't heard of the story before like me. Was an interesting history lesson that unfortunately feels all to familiar in 2020. Great cast, good pace, interesting story, great writing and good directing. Yet another good film from Netflix.....Oscar worthy maybe ????"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,8/10,"The case of 7 individuals accused of various crimes in 1968, after the riots during the National Democratic Convention in Chicago, USA.The format isn't new, it can be called a 'court film', where practically all the action takes place in the courtroom, but thanks to the scenes of flashbacks and backstage conversations between the defendants Aaron Sorkin manages to skip the boring moments, and delivers 2 hours of a real cinematic show.Although it is about an American event, it is perfectly identifiable with anyone in the world who has his sense of justice awake.The cast is great, all very consistent in their roles, but Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne stand out from the rest, for different reasons.One of the best releases of 2020."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,8/10,"Movie of the year so far, for me. The is no greater master of political debate and courtroom drama than scriptwriter-turned-auteur Aaron Sorkin.
From A Few Good Men to the West Wing to the Newsroom, Sorkin's writing has captured the imagination and he absolutely knocks it out of the park with this one.Based on the true story of 7 protesters arrested as part of the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations at the1968 Democratic Convention, Sorkin has given depth and intrigue to this chilling tale of governmental overreach and revenge politics.While we have come to expect the captivating performances of Eddy Redmayne, it is Sacha Baron Cohen as the misunderstood hippie/protestor Abbie Hoffman who moves you the most.Oscar-winner Mark Rylance is terrific as the beleaguered defence lawyer while Micheal Keaton oozes gravitas in a short guest role.Must watch, especially if you are a Sorkin fan. Highly recommended"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 January 2021,8/10,"I thought this was a really well done film. Important subject but it also felt snappy and well paced. It didnt feel like it followed the usual paint by numbers biopic model and I was engaged the whole time and felt sympathetic to the characters. I thought the acting was well done. Out of the mains, I would say maybe Eddie was the weakest only because his accent felt like a little forced, I do think Sacha Baron Cohen is the standout...but to be fair I do think he has the more ""showy"" role.Overall, worth a watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 November 2020,10/10,"I highly recommend The Trial of the Chicago 7 on Netflix. It's a tightly written and intense legal drama with infectious performances to tie it together. Typically I'm against fragmented storytelling, but I think the disjointed style works to the film's benefit of livening investment. It's got such a rich vibe to it, similar to The Social Network. It was written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, after all.Emotionally-driven and powerfully acted, the film poetically mirrors much of this year's racial and political unrest without straying from hard-hitting truths of the iconic 1969 trial and its preceding events. I haven't seen many films this year because of COVID-19, but this is definitely among the best. It may not be a fact-based documentary, but it's still a relevant and captivating watch, raising intriguing questions about the integrity of law and protest."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,3/10,"Was it right to protest against the involvement of America in the Vietnam war?
Was it right to make life unbearable for the politicians who supported it ?
Yes it was !Undeniably so , absolutely go after those scumbags, run them out of office and put them in jail, even execute some of them if we had the power to do it.But did we need the burning of the buildings and the destruction of bystander businesses? I don't think so!There's got to be a better way to protest, a better way than we're seeing today with the same innocent businesses being destroyed by idiots.And let's face it, a lot of the protesters involved in those protests were just dumb, out of control idiots. They were just the sort of material the likes of Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden like to cash in their beliefs on.Sometimes though, that's the only thing that will get the powers that be to listen so fot the wuck do I know?I just have to hang on to the thought that there's got to be a better way. I mean, even if they're on your side there still has to be some kind of punishment to stop them going lunatic on us. There has to be some sort of responsibility placed on the organizers to keep control of their followers... why should the general public have to pay for it?As for the movie's portrayal of the main combatants, I have to say that I was disappointed in the majority of the performances... What's 'is face Cohen in particular was cringingly lousy as Abbie Hoffman, with the guy who played Rubin coming in a close second.
After seeing Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall you have to say that he was hopelessly miscast for this one. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is like a flat tire.No , this movie is typical Netflix fare, a swimming pool with no deep end, a project completed without any nuance or substructure.And yet... Netflix continues to grow, so I'm very obviously out of synch with the world."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 March 2021,7/10,"I believe the the story of the Chicago 8 (later 7) the trial part, and not just the DNC convention or the riot's on the street's needed to made a movie for some time now.So did Spielburg, as apparantly he was set to make this movie in the 00's and dropped out for -whatever- reason. This movie does a great job of showing the farsical, opitical nature of the trial and depict's the defendant's, their real life ambition's and position's quite fairly, and also, *gasp^ depicts both side's and where they're coming from quite well.All of the elements of great movie are here. The casting, the performances and the dramatization of the event's seems accurate enough to tell the story, tell it well (and truthfully) while still making a good movie. I can't recommend it enough for anyone interested in that turbulant era (which is still too close for comfort), and iconic performances from many of the big actor's from my childhood, with some new blood in there as well, makes for an excellent watch.I hope Sascha Baron takes the Oscar for his role as Abbie Hoffman but if not, this movies up against some worthy competition. I'll end with saying this movie came out at a relevent time during another of America's most turbulent years and I hope that the families and surviving people depicted in this movie feel well repersented for it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 December 2020,9/10,"This one surprised me. Really enjoyed it. Inspiring in many ways and quite balanced in its approach to a sensitive subject. Showed that both sides, police and protesters were not perfect in many ways attitudes of both led to the incident. Great storytelling, great performances, laugh out loud moments. Was going to give it a ten but I marked it down one as it still had the feel of a made for tv type movie, rather than something you would watch at the cinema."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 February 2021,9/10,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FLThe ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------YES!... Before there was Donald J. Trump... There was Richard ""Tricky Dick"" Nixon... In a roundabout and subtle way, TRIAL makes the similarities painfully obvious. Sadly, those who ignore history...are doomed to repeat it. Events from 1968, ´69 & '70 are depicted faithfully in this film. I cannot pinpoint exactly WHY.... But TRIAL caused me to tear up. In January 1968, I turned 20 years old. This movie provided a nostalgic perspective that only 50+ years can give you!But whether you are 9 or 109... TRIAL is one Cinematic history lesson that everyone will find deliciously entertaining. The 7 defendants mentioned in the TITLE, were in reality 8, including Bobby Seale, most convincingly portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Manteen II... All 8 certainly at the very top of NIXON´s Enemies LIST! As Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) insisted non-stop...This is a POLITICAL trial! The U. S. goverment spent millions trying to scapegoat them, but, in the end, obtained absolutely nothing!TRIAL highlights the multiple fault lines dividing American society at the time. Race, Counter-culture, Cannabis use, refusing to follow unwritten ""Normal"" dress-codes. .. And more than anything else, opposition to the war in Vietnam! Obviously, some issues provoked a more intense reaction from certain groups, but Vietnam was THE hot-button issue that truly incensed and united almost everyone.During the past Pandemic year... I have spent more time watching movies and series than previous years... and I must point out that TRIAL is one of the highest quality and most entertaining productions I have watched... BTW... Phenomenal ensemble cast! Wholeheartedly recommended to all of You!9********* ....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 December 2020,9/10,"So I watched the Trial of the Chicago 7 on Netflix. This has honestly been one of my most anticipated films of 2020. Aaron Sorkin's has always been an incredible screenwriter but I've also been impressed with his recent stent directing. Plus, what a fantastic cast. I'm pleased to say this has been one of my favorite films so far from 2020.Anyone familiar with the trial of the Chicago 8 and then 7 will know the story quite well. The story follows the real life trial and the political and social events leading up to the 1968 counter protests and trial through a series of flashbacks. This is one of those situations where the facts greatly trumps fiction as this is a courtroom drama sure not to bore despite a few historical changes for the sake of entertainment.The film as a whole does a fantastic job taking a historical event and making it relevant with a number of parallels with modern protest and abuses of power. Ultimately the film was quite successful in illustrating the power of collective action and protest in the face of government intervention. It's a powerful film that manages to still be incredibly entertaining and often funny despite its lofty themes. The film also did a really good job setting the context for the historical struggle and defining the setting as whole. It certainly isn't one of those historical dramas simply made for history majors.Speaking of script as a whole I was absolutely impressed. Aaron Sorkin knows his way around a political drama and it really shows with this film. He managed to take a traditional courtroom drama and somehow make it incredibly funny and smart while socially relevant. The dialogue was sharp and biting and all the characters were incredibly well written. Of course this was no surprise as witty dialogue has always been Aaron Sorkin's trademark. Sure some of the lines were ridiculous and over-the-top but they were still quite well done.For only a second film directing under his belt this film was truly impressive. I really enjoyed his directorial debut in Molly's Game but The Trial of Chicago 7 really shines. The choice of timed flashbacks worked incredibly well as a storytelling device. It never felt forced at all and really helped to keep the pacing fresh. Speaking of pacing despite its length I never boerd or that the content was rushed. It's honestly rare to find a screenwriter that can transition seamlessly to directing but Sorkin's seems to fit that bill.Of course this film's success also came from the incredible ensemble cast. The writing was certainly well done but there wasn't a bad performance in the entire film. I will point out this Sacha Baron Cohen was a standout. He was incredibly funny but at the same time perfectly fit the character in every way. Mark Rylance was also fantastic. I've had my eye on him since Bridge of Spies and he certainly didn't disappoint. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my fan favorites and he definitely didn't disappoint. Of course there wasn't an actor that disappointed in this film.As far as negatives the film could be a bit heavy-handed at times. Clearly Aaron Sorkin tried heavily to tie this event to modern day social conflicts. Coming from such a blatant political perspective could certainly be a turn-off for some. Coming from a historical angle the film also made a few changes for obvious storytelling reasons. Clearly Sorkin's made these changes to tell his story but I understand why it's a valid criticism.As a whole the Trial of the Chicago 7 was one of my favorite films of 2020. I love sharp dialogue and entertaining characters and this film delivers in spades. Sorkin's has really shown that he is more than a capable writer but has also grown into a director in his own right. It certainly helped that the acting was all across the board fantastic. This is one of the first films of 2020 that I would certainly recommend to almost anyone. A 9.25 out 10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 May 2021,1/10,"We begin with the Boring subject matter: the backdrop of the Vietnam War and the city of Chicago in he early 1970's. The film is based upon the trial of 7 Leftist Dissidents in Chicago for their partaking in the disruption of the 1968 Democrat National Convention. Wow! Today the Feds would pin medals on them! Anyway, I'm not sure if Abbey Hoffman or Jerry Rubin would give their seal of approval to this film, but suffice it to say that it's just another one of Hollywood's formulaic court trial reenactments. It tries real hard to be accurate. But if you've ever sat in on a Real Trial, you would know how boring they are. And trying to make one look entertaining is, essentially, an insult to my intelligence. That said, the acting and directing wasn't terrible, but it was not good enough to make me willingly sit through this entire snooze fest. Conclusion: Stunning & Brave telling of American HIS-Story, soon to be altered or deleted by Leftists. And, judging by how many people found this review helpful, I'd say a good majority of the readers here are social activists with an agenda and not aficionados of good film making."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 November 2020,7/10,"I was highly sceptical about this film thinking it would be just another court drama about some Vietnam protests in America and to be frank, it was just that. What was different in this case was that the entire focus was shifted to the concept of protesting and thanks to Aaron Sorkin's solid writing it turned out to be a surprisingly interesting film. Oh, and of course the absolutely stacked cast managed to skillfully compliment each other without hogging the spotlight.As insinuated by it's title, the film is a long trial with flashbacks of what has caused the protesters to clash with the police. You might think, who cares about some little nameless riot 50 years ago that I should be watching a 2 hour courtroom drama about it? Personally, I felt the same but I was intrigued by all these star actors and I sort of challenged Sorkin to make me genuinely interested and I got to admit that he pulled it off.The film is a balanced blend of real life events on the streets of Chicago and the courtroom blabbering. However, here the blabbering turned out to be lively, engaging and even humorous. The cast did an outstanding job as each person played their respective part in keeping the story engaging with Mark Rylance, Sacha Baron and Frank Langelle being my favorites.While most of the story feels neat and connected, the film fails to stir up any kind of genuine emotion or an afterthought mainly because of the source material. Still, I would recommend this movie because of the sheer enjoyment of watching great actors put on a show in every scene which is a rarity in 2020.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 October 2020,9/10,"This is a terrific film about a story that not many people know about. It is about a group of people that were protesting the Vietnam War and headed to Chicago to do that in front of the 1968 Democratic convention. The film mostly takes place in the courtroom, with some flashbacks to the rioting and precursors to the violence. For a start I found out about this story when I watched a documentary on 1968 happenings on t.v last year. As far as the film goes I think the performances all around are terrific. Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman was one of the leaders of protesters and he was a real standout funny, heartbreaking and fierce. The film is very dialogue heavy and includes a lot of courtroom scenes but if you love that stuff you will love this movie. I feel the film is very timely as far as division with protestors and police and I just can't say really how great this film was than just to see it as soon as you can. Either watch it in a theatre or if you can't watch it as soon as it hits Netflix I think it is the best film of the year and could win best picture."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,8/10,"""The whole world is watching!""Those words have just as much relevance today as they did back in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention. It isn't a coincidence that the problems we dealt with more than sixty years ago are still the same problems that we wrestle with today. It's also not a coincidence that Aaron Sorkin and Netflix have released their new politically charged film, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", just weeks before one of the most important elections in our nation's history.Based on a true story, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" opens like a rocket with rapid pace intercutting between all the major parties involved at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.The first of these parties is Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis as part of the Students for a Democratic Society. Next is the hippies of Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin who lead the Youth International Party. There's also David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines. These seven make up the ragtag group of the Chicago 7. Also (unfairly) part of their trial is Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale.These eight activists are on trial for their roles in the anti-Vietnam War protests in 1968 Chicago that led to a series of brawls between protestors and police. The bigwigs in the White House believe that the protestors were the ones that started the riots and want to make an example of the seven. The demonstrators (correctly) claim that it was the people dressed in blue that instigated the violence. From here the battle begins between two opposing sides with the potential nation defining verdict hanging in the balance.Director Aaron Sorkin follows up his 2017 debut feature ""Molly's Game"" with another director's showcase.Mainly set within a single courtroom, the film is ripe with technical wizardry from all facets of the production. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael incorporates a wide array of long takes and many angled shots that tell just as much of the story as the script does. Editor Alan Baumgarten doesn't allow for a single dull moment as he keeps this train moving at full speed from beginning to end.This isn't to say Sorkin is a perfect director, far from that actually. Sorkin still misses his mark in a few key areas, most notably in the final moments of the film where the attempt at a stirring finale comes off as cheesy and dated.A writer before taking over the director's chair, Sorkin has delivered some of the greatest scripts of this millennium with his work on ""The Social Network"" (which won him an Oscar), ""Steve Jobs"", and ""Moneyball"".""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" delivers yet another Oscar-worthy script from Sorkin and the exact one you would want for a courtroom drama. Sorkin instills his trademarked rapid back-and-forth dialogue during the trial proceedings as witnesses testify and lawyers verbally spar. Several lines throughout elicit a strong provocative reaction that connects the film to today's cultural climate.Like all Sorkin scripts, everything does feel a bit too clean and artificial. Every character speaks on a near-genius level as they always say the exact right thing at the exact right moments. This style of perfect dialogue is more in line with characters such as Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs instead of the ones found within this film. But, when the dialogue is this good all the time, that problem doesn't matter all that much.Sorkin has also assembled an all-star cast to relish in his whip-smart script. There isn't a single weak-link among them as they will crowd Oscar ballots with their powerhouse performances.Veteran stage and screen actor Mark Rylance, here on the opposite side of the law than his performance in ""Bridge of Spies"", leads the pack with his spectacular turn as the defense lawyer for the Chicago 7.Also a stage and screen veteran is the great Frank Langella who plays the dangerously maniacal judge who oversees the case. Langella's grumpy performance parallels closely to a certain political figure who currently occupies the Oval Office.Jeremy Strong is almost unrecognizable from his uptight role in ""Succession"" as he expertly plays the relaxed Jerry Rubin. Sacha Baron Cohen is more in line with his previous roles as the clownish Abbie Hoffman.Yahya Abdul Mateen II is great in his both intentional and unintentional small role as George Seale. His role incites the most sympathy and relates to our current situation of race and policing.Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a nostalgic old-school courtroom drama bolstered by strong modern filmmaking and terrific performances from its cast. The timeliness and importance of its message make it a must-see as the whole world will be watching during this tumultuous election season."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 February 2021,7/10,"I don't really think there is a whole lot to say about this film, it was perfectly good.Is it the best thing Iv even seen? No. But it was good.I think the editing was pretty good. It was cohesive even though scenes were not always chronological. And it also clipped along pretty well. It was surprisingly tight considering it was 2 hours long. It didn't feel like it.The script was good too. I think so parts were sharp and especially in the beginning it was really kinetic and bouncy and run to watch. It also has lots of comedic beats that shocked me. Some land great mostly Sacha Baron Cohen's lines. I think he was fantastic. Others kind of fall flat and feel out of place in this ""drama"". They kind of dampen the serious tone when they are coming at you a mile a minute.I didn't know much about this trial so it was interesting to learn. As with all movies like this however I think there were some liberties taken. I do however think the ending was really well done and really fitting.I would say definitely watch it. It is worth your time."

3) The film definitely doesn't pull any punches; it was a lot darker than I expectedNEGATIVES:1) There were times where I felt the film was being far too on the nose with the injustice against the Chicago 7. The judge was outrageous and the police were all portrayed as awful people

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,5/10,"Every time I watch one of these cartoons, I wonder just how dumb can america go. If you really want to know about the chicago 7 (actually 8) I highly recommend the documentary to start with, not this shiny plastic piece of hyperbolic fluff. This is the cartoon version and the timing is not coincidental. I won't argue with the facts in the movie but the whole production reminds me of the tv afternoon special movies that came out in the late 70s and early 80s. For those not old enough to know, before cable, before streaming, before vcrs, before video games, most of us only had a handful of viewing choices, and one of those choices was the 'afternoon special'. The good people at ABC (aka OTA broadcast tv network) came out with afternoon movies designed to pass on a morality message while babysitting us until the folks got off work. These movies were heavy on message; light on very good film making. Maybe this is the voice of the new american propaganda but I can't figure out what the message is here because it's not about vietnam, or anti-war. If you want to do a film about that, then you can't omit the irony of the war is that vietnam economically today is one of the leaders in southeast asia. Heck, they even have an amusement park now outside danang that's framed around a 17th century french village. Google it, if you don't believe me. And it's not about racism because bobby seale only plays a small part of the movie and a stereotype for the 60s at that. The justice system? Geez, there's a reason why most courts, in most states, for most cases, are closed off from the public. Our legal system is far more nutty than portrayed in this movie. If it's supposed to be about the 60s and 70s, it's about as authentic as psychedelic. The closest equivalent I can think of is the way hollywood introduced and portrayed hippies, at that time, in mainstream tv as anyone who wore wide collars, beads, hip boots, bell bottoms in neon colors and said 'cool' and 'groovy' all the time. Or something on par with 'wild in the streets', which unfortunately, some people, even then and now, think as authentic real life. I mean, hollywood then had about as much understanding of the 60s culture as the plods who produced this cartoon. If you want to know more about the anti-war movement, or that period in general there's a lot of good documentaries, some on netflix dvd and youtube with actual stories and interviews with those who were there and involved. Unfortunately, this trial wasn't just about these 8 people but it was a trial of a whole generation and the irony is that the generation of chicago 7 (8) later went on to endorse 3 major wars in the middle east, and the longest war in history, and produced a baby who later went on to make this nonsense."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 October 2020,8/10,"Legal historians and courtroom drama fans will have a field day with this Aaron Sorkin film which depicts the trial of eight radical protesters who made a name for themselves in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A disparate array of left-wing activists who took it upon themselves to demand an end to the Vietnam War instead became involved in the ghastly legal aftermath of the riots and thus faced criminal charges for allegedly instigating the violence. This film portrays the sham trial that took place.Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, who has not been in anything good for a long time, is solid as the lead federal prosecutor who reluctantly takes on the assignment of trying to put the radical protesters behind bars. Mark Rylance's modest, down-to-earth demeanor makes him a rather peculiar fit to portray defense attorney William Kuntsler, the famous defense attorney well-known for his outspoken courtroom oratory and publicity hound antics. Frank Langella is flawless as Julius Hoffman, the judge who presided over this trial and whose combustible temper and tenuous mental faculties made him a ready target for ridicule from many, including those involved in the case. Edie Redmayne is excellent as Tom Hayden, the more pragmatic but equally passionate protester and defendant. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are both stellar as defendants Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, respectively. Finally, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is eloquent as Bobby Seale, a Black Panther Party co-founder and the lone African-American defendant in the case.There are discreet details about the trial I was hoping the film would cover. There is no mention of Bobby Seale's many colorful nicknames he assigned to the judge. It mentions the poet Alan Ginsberg only as a fellow protester, when in fact he was also called as one of several celebrity witnesses. So was the musician Judy Collins who began singing an anti-war song during her testimony. These, however, are minor oversights because the fundamental essence of this circus of a trial is effectively captured in the film. Unlike much of Sorkin's earlier work, the dialogue in this film is less grandiose and more straightforward. There are less pyrotechnics and more re-creation here. I mean that as a compliment. It's the perfect portrayal of a trial which turned out to be a low point in the history of American jurisprudence. It also expertly captures the schism within the American left and how the idealists and pragmatists often locked horns even back in the 1960s. Gripping, frightening and instructive in today's world, it is not to be missed. Highly recommended to all."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,7/10,"The Trial of The Chicago 7 oddly feels dated, like it could've released a decade ago. Coming from Aaron Sorkin, I think many expected more and better, which in some ways it's this movie's biggest downfall. Not to say that this is a badly made film at all, it's well made in every aspect, an impressive sophomore directorial debut by Sorkin, but it lacks just that touch to make it feel something more than just ""good."" All of the performances are good, but there's none I would consider to be truly great. One of the only performances that really stands out is Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman and even he feels like he's holding back. What truly deserves praise is the structure given to the story as it cuts from the court room to flashbacks making what's mostly a slow court trial quite engaging. However, what is left is a competently made Hollywood historical piece, with an important, but shallowly presented message. The movie barely takes any time to actually delve into these characters and show us what they're dealing with. 2 of the Chicago 7, Lee Weiner and John Froines, barely get any screen time since they're mostly pointless to the story, but it could've been interesting to see more of their perspective on essentially getting used by the court. The other performance that stands out is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. I thought that section of the movie was one of the more compelling, and should've been focused on more instead of forgetting it after he leaves the trial. The antagonists are just portrayed as dumb bad guys when they could've been far more developed to give a deeper analysis of the system and government. The message is definitely important, but all this movie ends up saying is ""Government bad, system flawed."" Ultimately, I would still consider this to be a good movie, I mean there's nothing I could really point out and call bad, but it had the potential to be a powerful examination of the government, system, court, etc. This just ends up feeling like the yearly Hollywood crowd pleasing historical piece that paints a nice picture of the events from afar, but lacks the fine details once you take a step closer to examine it.(7/10)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,4/10,"I was looking forward to this movie, but after 1 hour i had to turn it off... Its well made and and its high quality, but very slow and not entertaining"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,9/10,"The Trial Of The Chicago 7 was a film I wasn't planning on watching. I saw one day it just popped up on Netflix and I thought I had to watch it and I must say it really surprised me.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is about a group of seven people who have been charged with starting a riot at the democratic rally in 1968. The seven people Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and Lee Wiener (Noah Robbins) are put to trial to see if they really did start a riot. There lawyers William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and Leonard Winglass (Ben Shenkman) are arguing against Richard Shultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and possibly the Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella) as well.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is a movie I wasn't planning on watching at all. I new a little about because Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it and he is one of my favorite actors but bedsides that I didn't know much about the film. I heard this film was getting good reviews from many people and after I saw the film I must agree with those people. This movie did many things really well. First of all, the story and dialogue was obviously going to be really well done. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed this film. He was written The West Wing, Moneyball, and The Social Network. He has also directed Molly's Game. This was only his second film he directed and it didn't show at all. He looks like a natural. The only problem I had with the writing in this film was Lee Wiener and John Froines were almost non existent in this film. They showed up at the trials and that was it. They didn't really have much dialogue in this film and you couldn't really relate with them as a character. All the other characters were really well written and you almost felt like you knew them.The acting was one of the best things in the film. All of the guys who played one of the Chicago 7 did amazing. They were spot on. Also the person who did the casting did a fantastic job with getting actors who looked like the characters that they were playing. Yahya Abdul-Mateen ll played the character of Bobby Seale who wasn't one the the seven but was a key part to the story because he was a black man who was accused of homicide in Connecticut and was rumored to have talked with members of the seven. He was brilliantly played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen ll. Mark Rylance and Rob Shenkman were tasked with paying the two lawyers who had to defend the seven. They played their roles marvelously. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lawyer trying to put the men away also played his role spectacularly. In my mind, he is one of the best actors out there. He has been pretty good in the last two decades in his films like Inception, 500 Days Of Summer, and I think this should be added to one of his best acted films. He played a very strict lawyer who would do nothing or allow anything that would break the law. He nailed that aspect of the character with a little help from Aaron Sorkin.Something that I didn't think would be as good as it was is the editing. Specifically the start to film was put together really well and gave you a good idea what has been happing ten years prior to when this film took place. There were also many scenes that would explain the riots that happened in Chicago and they were honestly incredibly intense. They were intense enough to make your palms sweat. If they only focused on the riots and didn't mix in some other things like Abbie's stand-up and the witnesses explaining what was going on, I bet the riot scenes would have been stripped of their intensity. Those scenes were the highlights of the movie for me.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 was a film that was beautifully edited and the acting was top notch but some of the characters didn't feel like they did much of anything which took away from experience."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,"This movie is about REVOLUTION. We need all kinds of people to fight the REVOLUTION.

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 April 2021,8/10,"This is a legal drama based on the real life titular trial that occurred starting in September 1969 that was itself the result of the infamous clash between protesters and the Chicago police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The film has a stellar cast including Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon-Levitt among others but the two most noticeable in their roles are Frank Langella and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen received a best supporting actor Academy Award nomination for the role of famous social activist Abbie Hoffman. The film was originally meant as a Paramount theatrical release, but was sold to Netflix due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It garnered critical praise and scored 6 Academy Award nominations in total including Best Picture. It landed on many critics' best lists at the close of 2020 and rightfully so.'Trial of the Chicago 7' fits into that good area of historical drama where I was semi aware of the events surrounding it and some of the people, but I had never heard or investigated the story to any level that I knew all the ins and outs of what happened. Basically I knew of Abby Hoffman and Bobby Seale and I knew the trial swirled around the violence during the protests, but beyond that I didn't really know the players or the outcome of the trial therefore it was quite interesting to see it play out on screen and learn a bit more about some U. S. history that I probably should have already known.Very simply a bunch of anti war protesters converged on Chicago for the Democratic Convention in 1968. The police force confronted them and violence ensued. Nixon's Attorney General rounded up eight of the various high level organizers and charged them with conspiracy and an archaic law about going across state lines for the purpose to incite violence. The 8 included members of five separate organizations who all had some role, more or less, in the protests and riots. The reason the film is titled 7 and not 8 is because included in their number was Bobby Seale, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. He had just flown to Chicago briefly to give a speech and then left, but the powers that be seemed like this was a convenient excuse to collar the national chairman of the Black Panthers. While Aaron Sorkin's direction may leave a bit to be desired his script is whip smart and on point, but then Sorkin has always excelled at screenwriting. This trial, from start to finish, however you actually feel about the protesters personally, was a travesty of justice. The Nixon administration wanted the various heads of the anti war movement raked over the coals as both scapegoats and apparently as a middle finger to the previous administration, as well as removing Bobby Seale from society as another thorn in the administration's side. Through the various happenings it is not hard to draw parallels to our country's current civil rights affairs and what was occurring during that trial. Frank Langella is wonderfully heinous as Judge Hoffman who erratic and fiendish in the abuse of his power from the bench. From start to finish the defendants were jaw droppingly railroaded, however, it seemed like a no-brainer that an appeal would quickly reveal the trial as the sham that it was which turned out to be how it all played out.This film brought back to mind the harsh division in our society both by race and class that the Vietnam war dredged up. It was still the heart of the civil rights era. It illustrates the inordinate power wielded by the government and judges. In some ways if feels so long ago, but in many ways it feels like we are stuck in the exact same place except we don't have young draftees dying by the truckload to inflame the situation. This film is an amazing true story and despite taking primarily a courtroom drama approach is no less interesting, tense or riveting for it. The film never lagged and was filled with one ""I can't believe it moment"" after another. Most of the praise should be reserved for the script by the great Sorkin and the amazing cast that delivered it. This certainly deserves to be lumped in with the best that 2020 has to offer.Eric's Grade: B+"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 December 2020,9/10,"This could have been a much more powerful delivery to the viewers if the viewer had been given more insight/info about the accused; it should have been a 3-4 hour length film to do this.
Its no surprise that the events, that are presented in this important film, occurred during the administrations of 2 of America's most corrupt Presidents of the United States ever, 36th President Lyndon Baines Johnson and 37th President Richard Milhous Nixon (...there have been many more unscrupulous US Presidents but that's a story for another time and place).I would advise everyone to see this film if for nothing else that maybe it will finally get it through to some of you, preferably more of you, that the powerful wealthy (and those others in the shadows who think they are elite because they have lots of money and control) politicians in every country in the world see the rest of us as flotsam nobody's. They will do to the Upper class non influential/connected, the Middle class and the Working classes whatever they want to retain and dictate their power, grip and status.What I found to be really sad (and yet the same is still relevant today with the general public) is that the Jurors and the public did nothing to protest the flagrant disregard for constitutional or human rights that was being instigated by the residing Judge and also the prosecuting team (although one of the latter was clearly against what was being subjected to the accused).Watch or don't watch but if you choose the latter you will miss out on a very important insight into just how Politics/Politicians really is/are in everyday reality life!I gave it a 9 only because it needed to be longer in order to explain and inform of much more about the accused.PS. The violent police actions of that era are still as relevant today as they were back in 1968."

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,7/10,"This feels like a Spielberg film with a really good script. I don't mean that in a negative way, I mean that there is some Spielberg influence with an outstanding script. If you didn't know, Steven Spielberg was originally supposed to direct this film but dropped out and Writer/Director Aaron Sorkin took over. The writing and directing here are excellent. Sorkin knows how to keep your attention with simple scenes by having long monologues with unique camerawork and interesting framing. The performances here are great too especially Sacha Baren Cohen and Eddie Redmayne. I would say this is probably a career best for Redmayne and one of my favorite Cohen performances but his performance in Borat still has this film beat. The story is engaging and interesting which is weird because a lot of this is court room drama but I was invested for 95% of the time. The riot scenes are sprinkled throughout the film and those scenes are excellent. My issue with the film is its historical accuracy and certain dramatic moments. Like I said in the beginning, this feels like a Spielberg film and sometimes Spielberg tends to overdramatize events and there's a little bit of that here and ties into historical accuracy. They had to take some creative liberties here and there and I really wish they hadn't because this is a fascinating court case that will be looked back on for years to come. If you're a fan of Sorkin's writing style or want a riveting drama, then definitely check this film out."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 May 2021,6/10,"When I saw this film was written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, I knew 3 things: 1) It would be well-written with snappy dialogue; 2) It would be completely slanted to a Liberal perspective; 3) It would be intellectually dishonest. Mr. Sorkin did not disappoint. But I wanted to see the film anyway because it starred 3 actors for whom I have great respect: Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Now, here is the dishonesty of Mr. Sorkin. Everything that occurred in Chicago in 1968, at the DEMOCRAT Convention happened under DEMOCRATS. Vietnam was DEMOCRAT President LBJ's war. Johnson did not ""inherit an unpopular war,"" as Mr. Sorkin claims, he escalated an advisory role into an unmitigated disaster. Nixon, the newly elected Republican president, ended the Vietnam War. The Chicago police actions were under the auspices of the long-time Chicago DEMOCRAT machine of Mayor Richard Daley. It was his cops who cracked the heads. But what Sorkin dishonestly tries to do is to blur that distinction. Nixon's new DOJ, under John Mitchell, did indeed decide to prosecute and the film clearly demonstrates Tom Hayden incited a riot. But, the travesty of justice occurred at the hands of the Chicago police, and DEMOCRAT Judge Julius Hoffman, terrifically played by Frank Langella.The pace of the film is quite slow, up until the final 30 minutes, when the screenplay and the actors, get a chance to heat up."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,6/10,"There's great acting here and some of the courtroom scenes are terrific. But Sorkin plays with the facts and lays it on so thick. Not bad, but not very good, either."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 April 2021,10/10,"I grew up knowing of these men, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale. I knew of what happened to them and the trial. As I watched this movie my anger spilled over as if I was living it real-time. Although, Sorkin played around with some of the details about the event, the message was still the same. We need to understand history to stop it from happening again. We just finished off 4 years of overstepping that period."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,7/10,Maybe because it was late night and had to watch it during a couple of sessions but I was unable to focus on the pIot the way it was developed. I read very good comments about the film that made me put it first on my watchlist and I feel quite disappointed.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 December 2020,8/10,"What a courtroom drama if there ever was one! I do highly recommend for almost anyone to watch. What stood out the most was the acting, especially for Judge Hoffman."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 November 2020,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin is practically a guarantee, a safe home, a unique experience and a timeless idea made flesh and blood, so withouth knowing, he made The Trial of the Chicago 7 one of the best films ever written and directed. A house is built with solid foundations and that's why an exceptional and unrivaled cast is chosen, where a glorious Eddie Redmayne and an intriguing Sasha Baron Cohen stand out, not to mention the perfect Mark Rylance. Simplistic direction, but with an effect that goes far beyond the main intention; the choice of studied, but not demanding shots, which tell the story even if the film were silent, as if it were a big book of photos. The film touches on one of the most important processes in history with delicacy, respect and spreading loudly a message before and beyond these facts; therefore not only the film succeed in its intent and in the cinematographic field, but it manages to travel beyond the mere vision and meaning of the film itself."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"They say History is the best teacher. Indeed.
This film tells the story of seven (eight) revolutionaries whose name has been etched into the books of History forever. For some they are miscreants and for others much needed leaders.The cast has given award winning performances. For sure there will be multiple nominations.A must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 December 2020,8/10,"Truth be told, I'm a sucker for courtroom dramas and this film is a courtroom drama on steroids so I pretty much swallowed all of it delightfully. It is truly an ensemble piece so none of the actors really stand out, but Sacha Baron Cohen can live at 70s as a hippie with no problem and Mark Rylance shows again that he can act. I think Aaron Sorkin penned a great script and his directing is accurate and servicable though nothing ground-breaking. I didn't know anything about the Chicago riots before seeing this but didn't have any problems following the subject throughout the film. The film is your typical hollywood courtroom drama with familiar techniques and ideas but I enjoyed it a lot nevertheless."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 March 2021,8/10,"I always consider Aaron Sorkin a master storyteller and I'm always excited to see whatever he might involve himself in. And The Trial of the Chicago 7 most certainly lives up to his standards. One should look no further than the opening scene of this movie itself to be convinced of Sorkin's storytelling prowess.A movie like this could stand the test of time... because from a thematic perspective, it deals with power. Power, the corruption that comes from it, the casualties it affects, the minds it poisons... these are all aspects with which one could resonate at any given point in time; whether past, present or future... That's just the way human nature is. And this topic of power is communicated to us in the most Sorkin fashion; precise and loaded, and through the eyes of the various characters who are their own individuals and not just lines of descriptions or dialogues in Sorkin's book.The actors deserve a lot of credit... especially both Sacha Baron Cohen who does a fantastic job encapsulating the charm and rage behind the script with as much nuance as possible. Two very particular scenes that stood out as testament to his acting prowess were his final stand up routine and his courtroom testimony; where in both, we see Abbie Hoffman in all his conviction and anger. It was truly a masterful performance and he deserve much praise for it.And even technically too, the movie holds strong. The camerawork was steady and to point, the editing was smooth (well, except a particular ""dip-to-black"" near the end which felt a little odd) and the score was fitting.It was a well-done movie overall."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,8/10,"Loved it, tears at the end.
Terrible judge, at least justice is served at the end.
It shows how corrupt the US Government was even in the 1960s.
Not that that was when it begin, you would have to look at least 50 years prior when Woodrow Wilson sold the USA to the Fed and bankrupted the USA in only 20 years."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 September 2021,6/10,"Sorkin's writing is effective, but the pandering to the left is visible. Impactful historical footage interlaced.Screenplay...................................... 8 / 10 Acting............................................... 8 Cinematography................................ 5 Sound...................................................... 4 Editing................................................ 5 Score...................................................... 3 Timeless Utility................................... 6 Total.................................................... 39 / 70 ~= 5.6 (rounded to 6) Verdict.................................................

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 November 2020,9/10,"This has to be the most important movie released this year. It is also my favourite (at least so far).
Sometimes, a movie like The Trial of the Chigaco 7 comes along. These movies end up being much more than just movies. They teach us and remind us of something that we have forgotten, or something that we might have never seen or even heard of. And this film, well, it does exactly that. And it does so at a time when it's more important than ever.As someone who was born and has lived his whole life outside of the U.S, I had never heard of the trial of the Chicago Seven. I don't know if these events are common knowledge in the U.S, but I hope they are. For me, perhaps the scariest and most shocking thing about his film was how little anything seems to have changed. Reading the news depicts the U.S.A as a country where these kinds of events are commonplace. But it's also important to remember, that it's not just the U.S. We see stories like this from around the world, and this movie, I hope, will remind us of how unfair these institutions and systems can be when controlled by people who are looking to look after themselves.As a movie, I really enjoyed The Trial of the Chicago 7. Then again, I really like these types of films. Be it The Social Network, or Spotlight, or All the President's Men. I also like Aaron Sorkin as a writer. In addition, the cast is simply spectacular. Filled with some of the finest actors of today, all giving excellent performances. As such, I probably did enjoy this one more than most will. But, that shouldn't make this movie and its message any less important.Even if you don't enjoy movies like the ones I named above, watch this one just for its message. And if you do like those types of films, I think you will really enjoy this one.
So, please find a way to see this film. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an extremely important film, especially now."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a courtroom drama about the 7 people who were accused of inciting riots back in 1968 in Chicago.Staged in the backdrop of social unrest caused by the Vietnam war, the film shows how this diverse group of activists face trial for their role in bringing about confrontations between protesters in police around the Democratic National Convention.We get to watch the escalation of the protests that ultimately turned into a riot via a series of flashbacks, making the movie into a powerful drama that doesn't end in the courtroom - although Sorkin is a master at writing for that setting.This film has one of the strongest ensembles I've seen recently.From Succession's Jeremy Strong role as co-Yuppie leader Jerry Rubin to the more palatable activist Tom Hayden played by Eddie Redmayne, all the way to the brilliantly ironic Abbie Hoffman character of Sacha Baron Cohen or Frank Langella's delusional judge, it's very hard to single out a performance.That's part of the beauty of the film.There are actors as well-known as Michael Keaton with a 5-minute screentime. Or others, like The GetDown's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who are incredibly poignant despite appearing for only half of the movie.Mark Rylance's role as the defence attorney, for example, seems to embody the audience's reaction, as he gets more and more frustrated by the developments in the trials as the movie progresses.I could be here all day. But what makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 so enjoyable is how all of these characters feed on one another.Also, in spite of years writing and producing WestWing, he only took upon the director's chair for the first time in 2017's Molly's Game, which didn't exactly wow-ed audiences.Yet, in The Trial of The Chicago 7, Sorkin translates his boldness in writing very well into the structure of the film.The film couldn't have been better constructed, as at the same time the tension rises within the courtroom, the audience also gets to see in sequence the events that led to the riots in Chicago, shown by very timely flashbacks.
Lastly, It's hard to think of a better time to watch a film about a true story of political activists who stand trial for their role in social unrest.As the divide in the United States grows deeper and the presidential election date os closer by the day, The Trial of the Chicago 7 makes for a perfect watch.All in all, this movie works so well because it is a very lively courtroom drama with ever-rising tension, that still manages to slip a few comedy moments into the cracks.Also thanks to an incredible cast - can't stress this enough - who becomes even better when put together.Sorkin pulled off a very entertaining movie, perfectly constructed which is sure to make audiences want to dive further in the social upheaval of the 60's.I would be surprised if The Trial of the Chicago 7 is not in this year's award discussion. It's certainly one of the best I've seen in 2020""The whole world is watching!"""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 November 2021,7/10,"I felt this movie was missing a spark or real connection to get audiences hooked. There is a lot of cultural relevance to this case, especially today, but I didn't feel much of that portrayed in the film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"The biggest achievement of this film is not its stunning screenplay, crisp editing, terrific dialogue or the ensemble cast but Aaron Sorkin has made Eddie Redmayne look likable for the first time ever. After watching his cringeworthy Oscar bait performance of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything I had decided to skip all his movies but I had to watch this because of Sorkin and he really achieve the most difficult task.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a perfect follow up to Molly's Game in a way that it tells us about an interesting topic that we don't talk enough about but he gives a typical liberal status quo point of view of the trial. First and foremost we have to understand that institutions like court and police aren't bad because of its personnel alone, they are bad and unfair because its set up to that way. Justice Hoffman played by veteran Frank Langela is not a bad apple but he is the literal representation of judges in real life. In a way the film reminds of the sorry state of courts in my home country India, where the judges read out verdicts like its written by the fascist far right Hindu fundamentalist ruling party.Despite the only flaw, this film delivers what we expect from a Sorkin film is bound to strike a chord in this current political climate. Some of the scenes where made for the cinemas and to get loud cheers from the audience it was quite evident so its limiting when its a direct OTT release. Daniel Pemberton's score is absolutely pleasant and he has proven to be one of the most consistent composers working today. The Awards jury would absolutely adore this film and its destined to receive quite a nominations and possibly winning some."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 November 2021,7/10,"I must confess I didn't know much about the events depicted in this movie however it seems like a relatively fair depiction given that the protesters weren't glorified nor the authorities vilified. With the exception of David Dellinger all those standing trail were revolutionaries intent on the destruction of the USA, which implies their stated cause of demonstrating against the war in Vietnam was just a cover. You don't have to be a student of history to know you'd be better off in USA than USSR in 1969. It's the same today, the left are children of the lie, it's never about what they say it's about and this movie makes that point well."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 January 2021,8/10,"For some reason I kept procrastinating on this movie even though I was told time and again this was an important one. I regret doing that and nope it's not better late than never, not in this case. This came out in backdrop of the BLM protests which had rage and passion flowing in the blood which this movie would have added hope to.This truly is a powerhouse of a movie, from writing to performance, from photography to sound design, from sets to background score, from editing to dialogues this movie has proven to be a grade A which we are fortunate to watch on Netflix.Watch this with children, watch it with your elders. This movie is for everyone."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 May 2021,1/10,"If you can even stomach the trailer for this, you might be able to endure the entire movie, but the trailer is probably enough to turn people off...who wants to watch a movie about victimized hippies? They brought it all on their own heads with their pot-addled antics. And it's just so typical of lefties even today to waddle in streets and chant silly slogans over things which barely concern them at all. Why are we all pretending that they're accomplishing anything worthwhile? These are lazy bums who lack the skill set to do anything actually constructive.Of course liberals like to preach about how protesting is such a noble end in and of itself, but see what happens when their own mentality turns against them. (Case in point, a certain protest that took place in the Capital building on January 6th 2021. It was no different from the kind of crap hippies like to pull and look how it is depicted in the media).The takeaway from this rant is that pro-hippie propaganda doesn't work as entertainment or as a convincing argument. Just look at how the movie is forced to lean into cliched social justice schtick."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 January 2021,10/10,"Two words define this movie: Intense and agonizing. We can feel every single emotion of the trial,and be indignant along with the characters. The film is engaging and the acting is phenomenal. I definitely recommend it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 March 2021,7/10,"Courtroom dramas are normally very riveting to watch and this film is no exception. Set in USA in 1968 during the Vietnam war it deals with the situation when groups of rebellious and agitated student activists started marching towards the Democratic convention center in Chicago to focus on the futility and deaths in the Vietnam War. Violent clashes between students and police follow and an investigation is ordered to find out which group started the clash. In the courtroom arguments and counter arguments increase the tension and temperature. It doesn't help that the judge is not exactly neutral, and things go out of control a number of times. The seated students say "" overruled "" a few times in order to hear witnesses.
Director Aaron Sorkin no doubt has a tight screenplay and extracts excellent performances from all actors. The film is engrossing , and the interesting dialogue keeps one hooked.
Is the film at the Oscar award level ? I have my doubts."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 February 2021,9/10,"Overall, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a brilliant made film with barely any faults. I loved every performance from an outstanding ensemble cast, however Eddie Redmayne, JGL and Mark Rylance's performances were personal favourites for me. As well as those, the writing by director Aaron Sorkin was flawless and it very much enhanced each characters depth and aided an outstanding story. I really enjoyed this, I was gripped, it was intense but this was also a valuable history lesson about a very important time, not just in American politics, but World politics too. The ending was so powerful and concluded this film perfectly. I would without doubt recommend this film to anyone, it has to be seen, it's a great film. Please go treat yourself.Quote- 'This is the Academy Awards of protests and as far as I'm concerned it's an honour just to be nominated.' - Lee WeinerRating - 4.5/5"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"To be very clear, going in, I had very less expectations and zero knowledge about the trial, because I live nowhere near America or was born before 2000. But, I instantly was made known how remarkable this movie really is. I don't like online released movies or watching ""new"" movies at home because you have the liberty to be distracted and pause the movie, but for this one, I actually enjoyed the pauses. I researched about the movie's topic and also used the pauses to gasp at the utter brilliance.The script was so tight and interesting and the performances really complimented it. Every actor worked beautifully in the limited setting of a courthouse drama. You felt for each character and you felt the rage and adrenaline as well. I have to say, I normally don't like movies produced by Netflix but this was an exception. Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant director and even a more brilliant writer. I know he tried to recreate this controversial time of the 60s the best he could. I wasn't too keen on Eddie's American accent and don't know why he particularly was chosen for the role, but the lead actor here was still the courtroom. None of the 7 in the trial were given unnecessary limelight and thus premise remained crisp.The problem here, although may not be experienced in today's time but it is still too close to home. Discrimination, police brutality, criminality of legal system and the political agendas. We still see these things just they are now spread out. Apart from the standpoint of the case described in the movie, it can also be taken as the base for many other problems countries like America are facing every day. Not getting more political now.I couldn't give this movie a perfect 10 score because as I said, I don't know how much the movie was true and honest, although I read it is mostly taken verbatim from court transcripts. It is based on a true story of a time I was not born in so giving a perfect score wouldn't be justified.Cheers."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"It is life changing to realize that our country is little changed from the late 60's. In 1968 I was a sophomore in high school. Both my parents (up in Ohio) were Republicans My small town was white upper middle class. So what did I know about protesting? Black Panthers? Yippies? Anti war? SDS. Nothing. My views were formed by my background and social norms in my town, the Presbyterian church and a Marine father. So pretty much what I thought about the Chicago Seven was formed by superficial understanding. I never questioned anything. All of this was framed in threatening terms.
Then came college, and my mind started absorbing ideas more and understanding them in terms of civil rights, anti war sentiments etc. And my conservative views gradually changed.
This movie is fantastic. I don't know if all the details are correct. It doesn't matter. I do know that this is wonderful history for me, putting a hodge podge of old memories into modern context. We still struggle with women's rights, civil rights, respect for groups that are not WASP. Scary to think the past 3 years puts us back to, what Abbie Hoffman calls, the 50's."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,8/10,"It's so interesting from the begining to the end,
The direction and the performance is excellent, actually I want to watch it again"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 April 2021,7/10,Am I supposed to feel sympathy for this liberal trash who never accomplished anything but attack the country? Because I don't. So parallel to current events. The loudest people are the people who have never accomplished anything or add any value to society.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 April 2021,8/10,"A mixture of emotions!; okay who started the violence? ,I think the real question should be; Dose it even matter who had been started? What about saying that both sides blood were human bloods, I wanna say that the protesters want to take a stand against something but legally they can't make their voice reach the ears of the decisions' makers; what should they do? The whole politician trials mechanism and the whole system of law of protesting should be reconsidered fixing, the whole movie was good, the adapting of the real story is so attractive, I have the feeling that the movie could be longer with more of great details about the story which are a lot; but totally the movie worth watching indeed."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,Highly watchable depiction of a 1969 court case whilst the Vietnam war is taking place. The acting is brilliant and the story is told very well. Glad that I watched it right through to the emotional end. I sincerely hope that judges like this do not exist anymore as this one is shameful.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 December 2020,10/10,Superbly played and portrayed in every aspect.Important and convincing.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 March 2021,9/10,"A more detailed look at the trial of an era, that ultimately turned the American People and the entire world against the Vietnam War. The injustices perpetrated at will by authority figures against anyone viewed as ""different"", particularly African Americans, homosexuals and ""hippies"" was clearly recognized, yet routinely ignored by onlookers. The courtroom scenes show in the expressions of the audience, that the procedures were recognized as politically motivated ""railroading"" of the accused. The judge (brilliantly played by Frank Longella) could not have been more biased, yet appeared to have respect for the former Attorney General (very effectively portrayed by Michael Keen), at one point begging him not to ""make me hold you in contempt"". --
Screenplay, performances and direction deservedly received critical acclaim. This is a timely history lesson, even if it has been given the Hollywood touch. A spellbinding 2 hours+ of viewing, with a most satisfying climax. The course of history may have been altered by these 7 defendants, but most of all by the fact that...the whole world was watching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 November 2020,8/10,A well paced movie from start to finish. Mixing the action from the protests to the courtroom drama. It was A Sorkin but he's dailed down the Unrealistic dialogue spoken at 200mph.Brilliant performances from everyone and you feel the frustration every step of the way. Makes me angry yet again at the abuses of power we witness on a daily basis.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 January 2021,7/10,"As a Law & Order baby in my teenage years (yes I realise now it was slight copaganda but hell it was fun tv show) I have a soft spot for procedurals, especially those involving court cases. This doesn't really touch Mangrove in terms of it's power but it's still an enjoyable little flick."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 April 2021,9/10,"This film isn't truly accurate from head to toe, but it's still a marvellous dramatization of the story behind it. Sorkin's choice of storytelling resources keeps it interesting, funny and easy to watch, even though he chooses to reduce the actual people to more condensed personalities to fit the 2-hour film - it should've been a limited series IMO. Overall, it's pretty good and might make you look up activists and important historical figures you didn't know, so this is more than just valid entertainment, and told from a perspective that is worth your time."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,5/10,"I found it boring! I am not an American and I am not very political interested in the Vietnam war. It was slow, a lot of boring dialogue and just not much to keep me interested, to be honest. Thank God I didn't have to sit in a seat in the theatre for over 2 hours. At least the pandemic is good for something. (A little joke there)Good actors, the judge was funny. Other than that it was a waste of my time, even now that we have so much time at home.I'll give it 5/10 because I know it is important and fun for some."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,4/10,I studied the Chicago 10 (8) and now 7 in college because I was obsessed with Abbie Hoffman for many years. While Richard Linklaters animated film is vastly superior because it uses the actual court transcripts and doesnt dramatize it... I never liked Sorkins writing either because the dialogue is way too unrealistic and biting. It seems like he doesnt know how to write rubin and hoffman either (and put more focus on Hayden (even though Hayden is not a good dude)) Also the focus on the lawyer was not really needed... The whole trial was based on the defendents and not him... Too many liberties for one of the most important trials after the 1950s. And honestly after social network... I kind of gave up on Sorkin. How can anyone react that fast? It's too literal.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,4/10,"It's well acted and a good recount not those events but with the movie industry, like the press, is so leftist can we trust that it's an accurate depiction? Aside from that I detest the constant blasphemy of the name of Jesus Christ so prevalent in films today."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,9/10,"This was an excellent courtroom drama. It angered me and inspired me at the same time. I dread seeing the corruption and evil perpetuated by our own system and authorities and to see that something from the late 60's is still prevalent now is very disheartening.
I am inspired though. I would like to continue learning more about politics and reading and becoming an activist. I really want to make a positive change in the world. As of now, this one is sitting at my number 1 movie of the year.I think it's excellent but the only fault I would say it has is that it slightly comes off as Oscar bait or as a typical historical drama, almost commercialized and pushed out. But, the story is an excellent and relevant one that kept me interested the whole time and really showed how excellent writing is. Also, I adore movies that combine unlikely and different groups or types of people and put them in one room together. I also love when movies cover social issues like racial injustice or political activism.11/12This was an excellent courtroom drama. It angered me and inspired me at the same time.

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 November 2020,10/10,This movie blew me away. The cast was excellent. If you have ever watched a Sorkin project before you can see fingerprints all over this one. Beautifully written and executed like all of his other work. I could watch Sorkin projects all day.I know some of these issues continue to be relevant today. My only complaint with this project and others like it is the exaggerated representation of police officers. It seems like a desperate attempt to pander to certain groups.Overall this movie is incredible. And it will definitely take home some awards.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 December 2020,8/10,"Aaron Sorkin created two of my top 10 series, 'West Wing' and 'Newsroom'. They were dialogue rich for the intelligent viewer. The long gap left by their departure has never been filled in the same way but today is full of treats.After 13 years, the cast of 'West Wing' returned for a one hour special to encourage people to vote in this USA election. Although it was claimed that previous elections were the most important to participate in, this time it's true. The special is shot in a theatre. Despite occasional advertising interruptions from people like Bill Clinton, I was hooked by the 'President Martin Sheen' as he played chess with his wonderful staff. I literally had tears in my eyes when I heard the theme music which underlines how important a soundtrack is. and the impact 'West Wing' had on me. It was far more than fiction. This would be a good time for them to announce an 8th season. C'mon, make me happier and wiser.That Sorkin released a biopic the same week almost makes me believe in birthdays.'The Trial of the Chicago 7' immediately introduces itself as Sorkin with rapid firing dialogue as its intro to the soon-to-be charged activists against the Vietnam War.Verbally rich throughout, razored with humour. A lot of actors I didn't know but all good, their characters well developed. Loved it. One of the year's best but I fear that it won't be as powerful in hindsight."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,9/10,"Based on true events, this movie tells the story of a gross miscarriage of justice when 8 men are put on trial for inciting a riot in Chicago during a Democratic convention in the city. It is a shamelessly politically motivated affair, appallingly mishandled by an unashamedly partisan judge, and so obviously due to be overturned on appeal that none of the defendants ever seem to be seriously concerned at the possibility of 10 years in jail. Hell, one of the defendants (the only black man among them) is denied legal counsel throughout. Much like BlacKkKlansman, it is disturbing that dramas based on historical events like these can still seem so relevant in America in 2020."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,"This was a brilliant film, Sorkin captures the rebellious mood of the era perfectly. There is not a false step anywhere, there is even some humour.But just one thing, and this is important: it took six more years to end the war in Vietnam."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 May 2021,9/10,"The writing, the editing, the acting was all perfect. This is an important story told so very well. I was not expecting such a brilliant film. Bravo."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 April 2021,9/10,"Don't get me wrong from the title on top.. this movie is damn it was good written and directed by Aaron Sorkin in his second movie after Molly's Game 2017 which I kinda finds it to be long winded should have cut it to 2 hours instead of another 20 minutesLet's get back to this one definitely you can see an improvement from his previous work regarding story and all the cast were brilliant especially Frank Langella which should at least get an Oscar nods for supporting roles, Sasha on the other hand is the comic relief which I enjoyed too but Frank really pulled it off, not to mention ed Keaton's Cameo which is just stunning.What amazed me is most of the things you saw in the courtroom 80% of it is real and only 20% is fictionalised is what I admire Sorkin forAs for oscars I think this movie deserves more than just a few categories which is so underrated. This movie in my opinion will not win any oscars at all which they truly deserved, the movie ending is touching the courtroom drama is intense, the flashback was surreal,I'm glad that the movie won SAG best ensemble cast. I hope there will be a sequel to this
Oscars should really nominate franks for supporting roleI will be looking forward for Aaron Sorkin next movie.My rating is 9/10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 December 2020,7/10,It is a good film but not fantastic and should not have a high rating. It is boring; the whole movie is inside the courtroom. Performances are not extraordinary. Not sure why the high marks. It certainly did not work for me.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 starts its act with a pure dramatic atmosphere with the key actors' performance gets perfectly blend with it. The film progresses quite smoothly throughout the first arc but gets hit by a few bumps which are caused by not so good screenplay. The gripping action of the movie is strong enough to keep you on your seat and to keep you thinking about the next outcome. Character interaction played a really good role in pushing the film upwards. Overall the movie renders a splendid presentation on the screen throughout its entire run along with few bumps but in the end, it manages to close the act without any error. Not just for once it's a movie you can enjoy more than once."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"During the trial, I watched correspondent John Lawrence every evening on CBS for his report on the events of that day in court. This was before cameras were allowed in courtrooms, but CBS had excellent artists renderings. The Nixonites, at the beginning of persecuting their many ""enemies"" (real or imagined) , even included John Froines and Lee Weiner as defendants, representing ""Left Wing Academia"". Both were found not guilty on all charges. My friends and I always called the real Judge Julius Hoffman ""Magoo"" because he looked liked the Mr. Magoo character in cartoons -- his physical appearance was not as intimidating as Frank Langella's is on screen, but he was just as reprehensible. One thing this film does so well is using flashbacks from when events took place to give more context to what was taking place in the courtroom. The cast performances are uniformly excellent, but Mark Rylance stands out, once again proving that he is one of the very best actors in film. Sasha Barron Cohen is also particularly convincing as Abby Hoffman."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"I love ""Based on true events"" movies and in addition, this one is just so well made. I'm going to be watching this movie over and over. Now, this comment might make interfere with your immersion but you should know that actors performance is incredible. So much so that you will hate this one character that if you were to see this actor in real life, you'd want to punch him in the head. Hahahahaha. Just kidding, anyway, this is a really good movie. WOW!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 July 2021,7/10,"What a wonderful movie, I really like court dramas, to name few. My Cousin Vinny, Bridge of Spies, Marshall etc.I really hated Judge Julius Hoffman and brilliant effort from Frank Langella as judge ""Julius Hoffman""."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,,"I know this film has a complicated history, but I am a huge Aaron Sorkin fan so let's face it, I was made to love this movie, and I did.The pace is fast, the dialog (Sorkin being Sorkin) is challenging and the viewer needs to pay attention.I can't judge this on historical accuracy, but the story is fascinating and at the same time frightening. We all pretty much know how it will end for the defendants, but what I didn't know was the level to which the government went to screw them.This is primarily a court-room drama, but there's a lot of context and the story is riveting. As mentioned, I wasn't aware of the conspiracy and corruption angles and how the government manipulated the proceedings to a horrifying extent. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering it was Nixon and his stooges, along with the Daly machine, but it is ultimately extremely disturbing, and as I write this (in the fall of 2020, with the election looming), it is another lesson in how we need to be ever watchful of our government.Sorkin and the actors did a fabulous job.There are some amazing quotes that make this film so relevant to today. ""The Whole World is Watching"" is one of them. This is not Sorkin's line but from the protest movement of the 60's. Another line, which I can't quote verbatim, was delivered by Abbie Hoffman and related to people still stuck in the 50's. They didn't grasp what was happening in the country. A third was Clark pointing out that the President is not the client of the Attorney General. See? Pay attention.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is about as perfect as can be."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,9/10,"When 2020 seemed lost, The Trial of the Chicago 7 comes to the rescue... Finally Netflix does it again for movies, with some much ""spam"" coming in these days we needed this movie..A story based on true events that took place in Chicago in 1968, where a group of individuals spoke up and protested again the Vietnam War during the Democratic National Convention.These supposed pacific protests took a dark turn and several police aggressions painted this violent scenario, as in so many other historical occasions.
The movie takes most if its time depicting the ""circus"" (for lack of a better word to describe it) that the 5 month trial of the major 7 figures of this riot was, and the situations that were dealt by them while being defended - from a biased judge, to a cheating prosecution, and of course a not so easy to control set of defendants.
We witness once more the dark side and the hipocrisy of what was once claimed the country of opportunities and freedom, we see oppression and false sense of morality taking over and as it always happens, lives simply vanishing in the name of pointless wars.
The movie is simply fantastic, from a direction standpoint its dynamic, you feel energized throughout the entire film and it keeps you engaged to the story, mostly because of the charisma of the characters, and of course another big factor that contributes to this is the actual cast, from the fantastic Sacha Baron Cohen, to Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II basically an A-list cast that drove this movie to the high quality standards it deserves.
While it is a drama, it has a lot of comedic aspects added to it that kind of ease the tention and the serioussness of the topics discussed, but don't be fooled, I'm not an American national so discussing these topics can always be a sensitive subject, however the message is clear as history repeats itself, people fighting for basic rights of freedom and against a rotten and flawed system are marked as anti-americans while the representatives of the self procclaimed free country are themselves the oppressors and the responsibles for thousands of casualties of their own nationals.
But politics gives room to a major discussion, so not to deviate the attention of the movies, here's wy it's one of the best for this year: it's bold, gets you familiarized with an important event in American history, reminds you that fights against injustice started a long time ago, it's very well acted and written and for sure a source of pure entertainment which might be hard to find these days in movies!
I suspect we are starting to enter the award season and this might be an Academy Award front runner, with all that is been going on in the world, I do hope we will still be able to celebrate movies and specially the ones that impact us positevely and make us think about important subjects that we prefer to ignore."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 February 2021,4/10,"They show the baddies of the piece to be the baddies of the piece so kudos there
crooked politicians police etc etcas regards the acting: Sasha is not American does not sound or look American and is 49 years old playing the part of a 32-year old THIS simply DOES NOT WORK ...only sterling performance is Michael Keaton as the former United States Attorney General during the riots Ramsey Clark (he has a VERY different stance on what happened and speaks his mind) ... just to remind one what a character with substance not a clumsy sketch looks like ; YES this is it all the others in that film are going through the motions as if their hearts are not into it and they are waiting for dinnerHim ""playing"" Abbie Hoffman and the actor playing Jerry Rubin look like a pair of circus hippie clowns .... total lack of respect to who these 2 men were and meant to a generation.This is a joke movie; a pastiche of an important episode in recent HistoryIts function it seems is to lessen the importance of those times and eventsand yet going back to my first utterance : ""they show the baddies of the piece to be the baddies of the piece so kudos there
crooked politicians police etc etc""so for that reason we will give that a 4 otherwise it would be a one or a zero as you cannot rate negatively"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 February 2021,10/10,"Who said a person can only be brought to court in a civil or criminal case??!!! This movie shows how often we also face political cases in the courtroom throughout the World. Most of them motivated by corrupted governments.
Congratulations to the entire ensemble cast of this movie, just perfect!!! It's a delight to watch strong performances for an amazing script. The performance of Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is worthy of any 2020 awards.
This is a must-see movie especially during the political turmoil we are experiencing lately."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 November 2020,7/10,"Trial of the Chicago 7 has the best cast of the year, a script from Aaron Sorkin, and lot of elements that are extremely timely. It's impossible to not at least be absorbed in this film, and I was absorbed from the the very beginning to the end. With that being said, I don't think Aaron Sorkin is as good of a director as he is a writer and that brings this film down in some ways, but this is still an old fashioned crowd pleaser that everyone can get something out of."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 March 2021,9/10,Watching this movie you wish it was made up but to know this movie is based on a true story makes it really suck! The amount of the hate for ppl who were standing up to racism a un popular war were it was only the men of color and the poor being sent to another country to kill someone they have no problem with just crazy!! Buts great to see this movie was shot well and showed alot of the problems the Left or democrats were up against sadly we are still fighting this fight great movie must watch shows there are always 2 sides and its not always just right and wrong good and evil were are ppl who have feelings and it gets very very complex fast
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"I was curious about The Trial of the Chicago 7 due to the cast and trailer. Paramount was going to release it theatrically but Netflix purchased it due to COVID. Chicago 7 is good as expected.The acting was good including Michael Keaton who was barely in it. People feel Sacha Baron Cohen stole the show but I feel Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stole the show. I think the characters have enough depth.I wasn't famaliar with the Chicago 7 but I was invested from the first frame due to the great writing and directing. Aaron Sorkin easily lets the audience know why the protesters are protesting the Vietnam War. The film is briskly paced mainly the first half in fact a few plot elements are rushed.Chicago 7 is a good legal drama but it's not for everyone since it's rated R. If you have Netflix, you might as well watch it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,"Great performances from everyone especially from Mark Rylance, I do wish there was more Yahya Abdul Mateen II and Michael Keaton. The editing and pacing isn't as sharp as it could be but the aforementioned acting and writing demonstrates Aaron Sorkin's ability to captivate audiences effectively."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 June 2021,8/10,"I am both things, but I can also recognize that, even if this movie were fiction, it would still be a great watch.It really is a fantastic movie. Cohen struggles to hide his accent, at times he sounds kind of silly because you can hear both his English accent and the Massachusetts accent of the character he plays, haha, but that is the only flaw in the film, and it's a very minor one. There is enough comedic relief to keep it from being ultra dramatic. From what I've read, Cohen's charachter, Abbie Hoffman, was legitimately cheeky and very intelligent, and many of the funny things he said in the film were actually said by him.It's a great film and it is very inspiring. Please watch it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"The American dream is just that, or possibly just a nightmare for many. Although this film is quite a sanitised view of the turmoil and optimism that engulfed America in the late 60's, the injustice is very real. As it is today, still.The main characters are charming, if a bit shallow and two dimensional. The story of blatant injustice is compelling, the time flew for me. It's certainly as good as the film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, although Gregory Peck has a lot more depth than Mark Rylance, but that's obviously down to the script. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are a pastiche of Cheech and Chong, just with bigger words and play it for laughs, most of the time, and they are funny. Eddy Redmayne is the privileged college kid with a conscience, who will obviously become another well paid cog in the machine he despises. Overall the acting is solid, just not that deep. Although Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's blatant mistreatment is conveyed by a real sense of anger, I could feel it.What did I get from this film? Confirmation that nothing has changed, that the US is still a police state, that racism and classism has always been and still is institutional. It may even be worse today with a White House so blatantly crooked and incompetent; who's last option is to stoke up division and let the federal agencies run amuck and trample basic human rights. If anything it's now unpatriotic not to support war, any war, because it's 'un American'. So in one sense the nation has regressed to the basest of attitudes.If I were a teacher I'd show this film to my class and encourage a debate about what it is to be an American. But I know there'd be a ton of parents complaining that it's un patriotic to do so.With poverty, homelessness, lack of health care and a myriad of other issues blighting this once great country and the right to 'the pursuit of happiness' being no more than a foot note and almost forgotten entirely. We now have the blatantly political rigging of the Supreme Court, the highest in the land, Judge Hoffman would fit right in.A must watch film, but it's probably too late now to fix such a broken system."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 April 2021,4/10,"This is the quintessential Oscar-Movie. Everything about this feels like you're watching a ""movie"". Sorkin is constantly reminding the audience that we are not supposed to mistake this for a documentary about events and characters that took place and defined a generation of protestors and activists. Rather, this is the ""entertaining"" version, the corporate-netflix-coca-cola version for people who are not interested in politics, tailor-made for a wide audience, as to not overbear them with true, ""radical"" leftism. Sure, you can do that, Sorkin, you can deliver your ""and everyone claps at the end"" narrative, or you could make a film that is actually as radical and fresh and progressive as the people you are depicting. This film is on a purely formal ground as riveting as the state-official names that get mentioned every once in a while. I've seen it all before, in the exact same cinematographic manner.I liked some of the performances, there is no standout for me though. I liked some of the quippy writing even though it trivialized the dramatic force. I actually really liked some of the editing which more often than not broke the visual blandness. But I can't say that I think this film will be remembered in the grand scheme of things. Not for me at least."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 January 2021,8/10,"For those who love films about history or historical drama, then this film is defiantly for you, If not you might be a little bored while watching it but in the end it's worth a watch.Aaron Sorkin is an amazing screenwriter. He wrote the screenplay of The Social Network (2010) for which he received an Oscar for. He also wrote the screenplay of Moneyball (2011) and Molly's Game (2017) in which he received an Oscar nomination for both. This time he brings us an amazing screenplay that is very well written. Although the film has so many events because it's based on a true story, and there are so many characters and names, I didn't feel lost at all and I feel like it's because of how well written this film is. In some scenes during a specific conversation about a specific event that occurred in the past, the film jumps and shifts to that old event as if we are in it instead of just hearing the talk of people explaining it exactly. That transition or shift was so smooth and very well made that it won't cause any confusion to the audience which is a very hard thing to achieve in a film that's based on a true story and has so many characters and events. I Really think Sorkin would get nominated for ""Best Screenplay"" in the Oscars of 2021.Each acting performance was perfect. Couldn't find anything wrong with anyone's performance. Sacha Baron Cohen proves that he could put on a great performance and not just portrait these crazy/silly characters like Borat and Aladeen in The Dictator. Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, Mark Rylance, Yahya Abdul-Mateen were all great as well.The hair & make-up were very well done. Each character looks so similar to those in real life. Believe me when I say that I couldn't recognize Jeremy Strong AT ALL and that's because he really looks different with that hair & beard.The music and soundtrack weren't that good or unique but they did fit every scene perfectly and that's what I liked about it. Each music score was a perfect choice.The Trail of the Chicago 7 is a heavy and solid film that is not for everyone. Wouldn't call it one of the greatest films ever. But for a year like 2020 that was ""poor"" of movies then this film is one of the best films in 2020 for sure.My rating is 8/10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,5/10,"The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is not a bad movie but it has in my view a few problems of balance which impacts its overall ability to deliver a cohesive message.
The first problem of balance regards its narrative style, so much swinging
from farcical to self-important to make you wander if you are watching a drama or a comedy.In the same way, some characters - lime the hippy couple Hoffmann/Rubin - swing from almost clownish roles to too serious and self-righteous ones to be fully believable.
The second problem of balance is about the focus of the story; in real life, the most prominent figure in the trial was Bobby Seal, here relegated to a secondary and at times almost caricatural role in favour of the more folkloristic hippies."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"This is an amazing court room drama, every actor is Top notch every scene is compelling and requires your full attention.This movie shows a clear and deliberate plan to jail 8 activists who were against the Vietnam war, the court room drama shows how the government of the land of the free and the home of the brave fix a court case against these individuals allowing them no room to prove the innocence and therefore are ultimately jailed.This is a great movie that once again demonstrates that the USA politics is filthy."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,1/10,"I am from Worcester Ma, home of Abby Hoffman. The accent of Sacha Cohen was a ridiculous Bostn exageration. It was a conspriacy trial, and the diffrent groups talked before the convention about what they should be doing so they all knew each other. I lived through the trial so I know it more pesonally. These days it was similar to Antifa. They hated the America government."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 April 2021,8/10,"Casting for this movie was, simply, brilliant, especially Judge Hoffman. Trials can be boring, but this movie was anything but. I saw the live broadcasts of the protests and police riots, but only got bits and pieces of the trial, which was a travesty."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 February 2021,9/10,"Phenomenal cast, great acting, experienced directing, what else could you want?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 March 2021,10/10,"This reminds me why I like cinema. Why I'm a fan of this field since day one. A perfect movie in all aspects. Let's talk about story, if this a true one the I believe it was one the best real stories that where turned to movies, the editing was so good, Chronological and beautiful,Editing was an art in this movie. Finally, definitely Sasha will win the Oscar."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,8/10,"The movie is good. Sharp dialogue, great performances. But I read some comments comparing the Chicago 7 with Antifa. That's the most uninformed opinion if there ever was. Main differences? Let's start with the most obvious: the Chi 7 were fighting for freedom of speech, Antifa is well known for silencing speech that they disagree with. Another one? (For the most part) the protest were very peaceful during the 60s, very intelectual, they were protesting the Vietnam War. Antifa is extremely violent and his members were masks, boots and handmade weapons. The last one? The Chi 7 were proud americans, left leaning, progressive, open minded americans, Antifa is known to burn flags and chant anti-american slogans. So get your fact straight."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,5/10,"I know that elections are behind the corner so democrats try to highlight progressive youth... Movie is nothing special but if you like Jeremy Strong Or Eddie Redmayne,, those two guys are PHENOMENAL here in rather slow movie with bad flow and badly crafted flashbacks...
Baron Cohen is playing de facto himself.. Movie isnt surely bad, its not boring but its nothing special. My low rating isnt down to anything bad, its just normal movie with nice ending."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is intense, shocking, and EXTREMELY relevant. Aaron Sorkin's new court room drama is a very fiery portrayal of a trial that exposed a system failing its country, and proves that as always, history repeats itself. It was a very long and theatrical case, and of course, it was politically motivated. This may not be Sorkin's best script for how over the top it can be, but the film is just bursting with energy and charisma, it's hard not to like. The performances are just wonderful in particular Mark Rylance as the defenders attorney William Kunstler, who I would personally pick for a nomination this year as he was just SO GOOD. This is a film that even if it feels on the nose, still makes a great point about the issues we're still dealing with today. Corrupt politicians, police brutality, and a country that's in pain from the people it has lost, and continues to lose. This isn't a film with new ideas, or new messages, but just really excellent delivery from its performers, it's filmmakers, all in the service of a very powerful story. While I can't say it's perfect, I still REALLY enjoyed it, and I highly recommend you give it a watch. Despite it being a dramatization of the story with some Hollywood-isms and Oscar Bait tactics, it's a truthful reflection of our current reality. Which is why I'm gonna say, it's one of my favorites so far this year. 9/10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,Fantastic from start to finish! Everyone does such an incredible job in this movie! One of the best g to things I've seen in a while!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 December 2020,10/10,"The plot is based on the actual political controversy during those days, it does deliver an inside prospective of what true democracy stood up versus political monopoly.
Hands off this movie, because it is going to make sense and even more to make you thinking.
The cast is awesome and the characters along with the script... Well done.
It's a must see movie for the way it was done and for what it represents.
Bravo"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,2 hours and 10 minutes yet not a single moment of being bored . Bravo . Amazing acting from each member of the cast . This movie needs to be seen ! And the ending gives me GOOSEBUMPS all over me . Definitely the best movie of 2020
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"I had been looking forward to watching this for the best part of a week after seeing the trailer on Netflix and I can for sure say that I was not disappointed.I usually don't really like crime/courtroom dramas due to the way they can often feel stretched-out and boring, but this film just blew me away. It was so beautifully told, the the cinematography was amazing and really showed the tension of the situation, and the storyline was beautifully executed, showing all its depth and complexity, all the while being clear to understand and remains pretty faithful to the original events. Yeah, it wasn't 100% accurate, but let's be honest: have there really been any perfectly accurate historical movies?I think that the shocking tension of the protests surrounding the Vietnam War were perfectly portrayed. This is the first Aaron Sorkin-penned movie I have seen, but the amazingly fast-paced dialogue and witty scenes ensure I will watch more. Additionally, it's incredible that this is only his second film that he has directed. On top of this you get an A-list cast supporting the story with amazing, well-realised characters, with top-notch acting from all parties - especially Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen.The only thing I have to say is that this film is a little intense at times and can be quite uncomfortable, and sometimes the slightly abrupt editing can make the storyline a touch confusing, but that also purposefully adds to the overall effect.Highly recommend to anyone and everyone, particularly fans of movies like Argo.I will be genuinely surprised if this film doesn't win an Oscar.Edit: I would very much like to sue the Academy for nominating it 6 TIMES without a single win.-Sasha."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 November 2020,7/10,"This is a good, entertaining courtroom drama, but was a little too long. I don't think it quite deserves all the accolades it has been getting."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 April 2021,8/10,"Writer-director Aaron Sorkin's The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a powerpacked film. The intensity with which his characters speak and deliver high voltage dialogues give a Bollywoodish feel. And while this might seem unnatural in life, in a courtroom, it makes perfect sense. This is why The Trial of the Chicago 7 is so damn powerful. The film is based on a real-life political drama in the 60s, in which prominent political radicals were accused of conspiring to cause the riots that had broken out at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Sorkin gives us an electrifying dramatization, which speaks directly to the world we live in. The culture wars, polarization, and oppressive establishment are still very much in place. This is thrilling moviemaking. You can see it on Netflix toh Telegram aur Torrents se refrain kare because the movie is idealistic at least let's start some small revolution to end piracy.The story of 7 people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.It follows the trial of the infamous Chicago Seven, a group of anti-Vietnam War protesters who were charged with the conspiracy to incite riots in Chicago after their peaceful protest turned violent following a clash with the police. The film stars Sacha Baron Cohen and unlike his fictional satirical characters this time he plays one of Chicago's 7. Sacha is a revolutionary in film and real life too. In June 2020, Baron Cohen crashed the right-wing ""March for Our Rights 3"" protest in Olympia, Washington, a counter-protest to the March for Our Lives demonstration as a result of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Baron Cohen sang a song telling listeners to attack liberals, CNN, the World Health Organization, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates and ""mask-wearers"". The crowd, which initially sang along, realized they were being pranked when counter-protestors recognized Baron Cohen and began laughing. Baron Cohen's security stopped the organizers from taking him off stage and turning off the power, and Baron Cohen was forced to flee in a private ambulance from the now-violent crowd. In 2020 his Borat Subsequent Movie film was also a great watch. The film also stars Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Daniel Flaherty, Noah Robbins, Carrol Lynch, Mark Rylance, Jeremy Strong, and Alex Sharp.At one point in the movie, Abbie says ""It's revolution time, we may have to hurt somebody's feelings"""" I have never been on trial for my thoughts""It shows parts of Left Wing,Radicals, Revolutionaries,Early Political Parties, and harrasment by the courts and negligence of police.Director Aaron Sorkin's historic legal drama has earned itself six nominations at the Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Sacha Baron Cohen, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Song, and Best Film Editing.This year in Oscar's best picture category out of 8 movies we have 2 movies based in Chicago, 2 based on Musicians, and 2 having Vietnam war references.Best sound mixing and best sound editing category has been merged in Oscars 2021.Ramsey Clark lived in Greenwich Village in New York City, where he died recently on April 9, 2021, at age 93. Huge Respects!Most magical moment was when at the end of the trial, despite Judge Hoffman's instructions and objections, Hayden uses his closing remarks to name the 4,752 soldiers who were killed in the Vietnam War since the trial began. This act prompts many in the court to stand and cheer. It will certainly make you cry.Oscars 2021 ka toh pata nahi but this one really wins hearts and minds while making a great attempt at what to respect.For more such reviews and trivia do find me as Mayur Panchamia on Radio One , Erica you can countinue what you were saying.."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 December 2020,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin is definitely an incredible writer and story-teller. I was afraid that the political element would be too heavy to digest and slow down the pace of the movie. Boy was I wrong. It never gets boring, and is probably the best trial movie I've seen in years. A must see."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 December 2020,10/10,"Another fantastic interpretation of this English actor: Eddie Redmayne who is gradually establishing himself as a participant in the English actors' Hall of Fame, in which Richard Burton and so many others appear who, for the sake of space, I fail to mention!
Sasha Cohen, in my opinion follows behind the interpretation, punctuating, and taken by the director Aaron Sorkin, lets the whole revolt / idealism / almost taken to the extreme by the impossibility of changing the status quo, of a system that he believes not to be ideal not just for your country of birth, like any country in the world.
And why not mention Frank Langella yet? Perfect in the role of Judge Julius Hoffman!
Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, superb in the role of the prisoner, and who does not remain silent before an authority that is just there, as if he were a delegate from an old western town in the 1800s, where the law that really prevailed was this one delegate!
The film has a didactic aspect: it is worth seeing because many of the young people do not know what really happened in the USA between 1960/1970, unlike the one who writes these words, which I followed in detail in the Brazilian newspapers the Vietnam War!
Film with direction, cinematography, cast, beyond my expectations!
On a scale of 1 to 10, my vote is 10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"There is not so many movies that will keep you interested,with hardly no violence,sex scenes & disturbing behaviour.This does ,Great film actually probably the best film, I have seen all year. RESPECT!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 November 2021,,Unless you were alive in the 60's you really wouldn't understand the mood in 1968. I totally agree that this movie was only telling one side of the story. The protestors were told not to go to Chicago and they went anyway. The protestors and the police both were to blame. It is called taking responsibility for your own actions which some people refuse to do today.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 October 2020,9/10,"A near perfect, and an incredibly emotional re-telling of one of the most important trials in history"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 March 2021,10/10,"How do you summarize a trial that lasted over six months? How do you display the political spirit of times as different from the present day as day is to night? How do you portray historical characters, many of which are not among us today and those who are alive are so much different from 1969? How do you summarize events spanning one year in 130 minutes? To paraphrase the line Gary Oldman said in his recent movie, Mank, it is impossible to tell the story of a person's life accurately; the best you can do is give ""an impression."" This is what The Trial of the Chicago Seven does. It gives an impression, but a good impression, of the political spirit, as near as accurate as possible.Speaking as one active in the times portrayed in this movie, I was energized watching this movie. As I looked at the events of this movie, all those memories of those turbulent times came rushing back, in a big way. Both while watching this film and after the credits rolled at the end, I concluded, thinking to myself, ""Yeah, that's what it was like.""Is the depiction stone cold accurate? No. William Kunstler was much more bombastic in court and outside the courtroom when making statements to the press than that portrayed by Mark Rylance. Abbie Hoffman was WAY more outrageous in life, both in the courtroom and out, than Sasha Baron Cohen's portrayal. Julius Hoffman, believe it or not, was more unpredictable, frivolous, and incredulous during the court proceedings than Frank Langella's Hoffman.This is as good as movies of historical events go. Movies are judged on their entertainment value. The standard is different for historical movies. The historical facts must be tweaked to not provoke boredom or tedium in the audience. In very rare cases the entertainment value of these movies will be equal to or surpass what you learn about the events portrayed. Believe it or not, folks, there was a time and place called Chicago, 1969. Dead accurate? No, but this movie accurately captures the spirit and drama of the times. And that is good enough."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"This is a great film. Quite possibly the best film of 2020 or at least the best I've seen. It is riveting, engrossing, engaging, relevant and just plain film making at its best. Yes it is depicting a real event and I am sure there are many parts where legal historians, and others will find places to nit pick and say that's not accurate or why did they leave this out. It's a depiction not a documentary. The cast was excellent from an unexpected turn by Joseph Gordon Levitt as the prosecutor to the always good Mark Rylance as the modest defense attorney, to Sacha Baron Cohen in a great turn as Abbie Hoffman. Eddie Redmayne was fine as Tom Hayden but standing out for good parts were Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin, Alex Sharp as Rennie Davis and John Carol Lynch as David Dellinger. But the two best were Yahya Abdul Mateen as Bobby Seale and Frank Langella as Judge Julius Hoffman. Langella was so powerful as the sleazy joke of a judge I wanted to hand him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He just seemed to dominate in every scene he was in. Mateen also put on a powerful performance. Others were also excellent in supporting roles and Michael Keaton came on in a brief turn as former Attorney General Ramsey Clarke. This was if nothing else an actors film. But the film went beyond that and spoke to today's deeply divided America right down to the police removing badges before attacking the protestors. This was an excellent film in many ways to the writing and direction in particular with a controversial topic. It should be seen by all."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 April 2021,9/10,"The actors, the direction, soundtrack and many of these elements have been uplifted through an amazing editing process and ultimately we have a racey political drama which clearly demarcates what movies stand for and what they can achieve in 2 hours which a tv series can't.Eventhough I can't corroborate the facts nor any favouritism towards actual events and characters depicted, it was a 100% enjoyable watch :)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,The scprit and the directing is just wow! This is a must-watch indeed.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"This is another well-written and produced history piece by Aaron Sorkin and DreamWorks. The recalled events of 50+ years ago on the streets of Chicago seemed eerily familiar with recent events in Portland, Kenosha, Jacksonville, and a host of other cities. Award winning performances were turned in by Sasha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmane, and Frank Langella. Put this on your ""must-see"" Netflix list!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2021,8/10,"I'm here to tell you that you should bump this movie up to the top of your list. It's not only worth watching, but could even make for some great interactive learning material at law schools. Cue the ethics debates.I start with that because I feel like this movie didn't get the publicity that it deserved. It feels like it snuck under the radar, got nominated for some Oscars, and then disappeared again.Powerful and still timely despite its place in history, the plot (mostly) sticks to historical facts and the pacing does well to cram a half-year trial into 130 minutes. Aaron Sorkin proves to be a script-writing sorcerer once again. He dazzles us with legal and political jargon while also building an unbelievable amount of frustration, helping viewers to empathize with the main characters.Don't think twice, this is a must-watch.Verdict: Watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 November 2020,5/10,"Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" has political relevance and messages that are also relevant today. I am a big fan of Sorkin's work, as 'The Social Network' is probably my favorite movie. However, I don't think he is that great of a director. This movie has many flaws.Starting with the fact that this movie is about 7 characters, it's already too many people to focus on or worry about. It's hard to learn about all 7, and then more side characters when there is already so much going on. Eddie Redmayne has a weird accent and a pretty stiff performance. Sacha Baron Cohen also has a strange performance, his accent is weird and he feels a little awkward. The biggest miscast of this movie is Joseph Gordon Levitt, who I really like. He does not play the Republican Lawyer very well, as he also is blocked awkwardly.This movie also has pacing issues. It can be really slow, the beginning was promising, but in the courtroom stuff, it could go really quickly but also really slowly. It also felt repetitive. The scenes that had the best direction were the violent interactions between the police and protestors. Those were pretty good.In the end, this movie also felt pretty flawed and cheesy. It's trying to be too much. Aaron Sorkin is a great writer, and he actually did not do a great job with this one. However, his style is always consistent with his writing, snappy dialogue. The main problem here is his direction. The courtroom scenes should be quicker and fast-paced, they aren't. I'm pretty disappointed in this movie, it will probably get some awards, though."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 April 2021,7/10,"The film was what one expects of Aaron Sorkin, a mostly overly dramatic political drama. Hopefully, it will inspire people to learn more about the actual history and not Sorkin's version of it.It felt a bit long for a film that does not show a lot of character development, except for Eddie Redmayne's character Tom Hayden. The acting was mostly excellent. 7.5/10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 April 2021,7/10,There are many good actors in this movie but honestly I don't think they was the best choice for their role. Specially Michael Keaton and Mark Rylance. They are great actors but in this movie I didn't like them at all.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 March 2021,10/10,"I find it hard to believe this is only rated 7.8. The only reason I can think of is most viewers didn't experience growing up in the 60s. I was at University then & this was a wonderful expression of those times! The sad thing is, human evolution is tectonic in the US. Still the same attitudes."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,I always thought protesters were irresponsible and uneducated attention seekers. But it turns out they aren't. This movie changed my vision. I don't like hippies or yippies but this movie made me realize some of them are really smart intellectual people and in Chicago they were trying to save 18 year olds from killing babies and getting themselves killed. 5-star performances by a stellar-cast. 5 star script and Sorkin's directorial skills totally are improved(4-star)
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 November 2020,8/10,"If you liked:
Vice

To Kill a MockingbirdThis is a 2020 political, true story film, written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, who is best known for writing the enormous Oscar-winning script for ""The Social Network"". It was written by Sorkin way back in 2007, and was supposed to be directed by Steven Spielberg, but due to some complications (2007 Writers Guild of America strike) it came out only 13 years later.
It tells the story of seven (originally eight) political anti-Vietnam War activists, charged by the US federal government with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to countercultural and anti-war protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois, on the occasion of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. This trial was a dramatic historical event that spanned over the course of more than six months, during which the grand jury met 30 times and heard some 200 witnesses.
At first the film seemed very staged and overdramatized for me; and I do understand that any historical movie has to be like that unless it's a documentary; but this one specifically seemed a little over the top, almost approximating a circus. I just couldn't believe that some of the things in court could have happened as they are portrayed in the film, but I was astonished to find out how much of it (I'd say about 90%): government conspiracies, racism, police riots, fraud, a crazy judge, a ""political"" trial, offensive remarks in court; was actually true. So, with time, the film has completely rehabilitated itself in my eyes.
Despite the fact that the script was written 13 years ago, it seems like it was made specifically for our current time. Aaron Sorkin himself explains: ""The script didn't change to mirror the times. The times changed to mirror the script."" A timely picture, which will educate you as well as (weirdly enough) entertain you. Also, Eddie Redmayne is in it, and that's always a treat."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 December 2020,8/10,"""The Trial Of The Chicago 7"" revives the bygone courtroom drama movie genre, but rather than reaffirm the conventional message of law and order, it recounts a real event with all of the unpleasant grittiness it deserves. In 1968, eight men were arrested for conspiracy to start an anti-Vietnam War riot in Chicago during the Democratic National Convention. While seven of these men did play a part in the riot's origins, they were not as connected as the Department of Justice would've liked to believe. The eighth man, Bobby Seal (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), was actually just a member of the Black Panther party; he was not there for the riot and had no relation to the other defendants whatsoever.The film tells the story of these eight men's trial, and the discrimination that they faced trying to protest an unjust war. It is a movie that enlights, inspires, and disturbs. The titular Chicago Seven is a motley crew, filled with different examples of progressive minded people in the late sixties, from Eddie Redmayne and John Carroll Lynch's diplomatic Tom Hayden and David Dellinger, to Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong's long-haired dope-smoking Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. It paints an image of Americans that is still relevant today, as diverse people with idyllic prospects for the country continue debating the means to attain them.If the film is truthful to what actually happened, then the trial makes ""The People v.s. O.J. Simpson"" look like an everyday case. Between Bobby Seal being denied a lawyer, Hoffman and Rubin's theatrical interruptions, and Judge Julias Hoffman's (Frank Langella) blatant biases, it is frustrating to witness the lack of justice occurring in the courtroom. This comes to a boiling point when the unrepresented Seal lawfully tries speaking for himself, and Judge Hoffman sentences him to be disciplined in the most violent and inhumane manner. It demonstrates how the court system was far from blind in this chapter of American history, and we truly feel the defendants' anger at the situation.Given that ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7"" came out in 2020, when America is rife with racial reckonings, national protests, and political turmoil, the film feels timely. Unfortunately, much of the discrimination depicted on screen is still occurring in a de facto manner. Politics are far from impartial and many would still deem the American judicial system bias. On that same token, though, I cannot help but watch ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7"" with a bit of optimism. In 1968, these progressives were the counterculture, but now, thinking critically about and wanting more out of American democracy is something widely encouraged. There is still work to be done for sure, but at least more people are conscientious towards the real issues and voting accordingly. In a way, the film is thus a call to action - without being preachy or propagandistic, ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7"" ultimately leaves viewers wanting to do some good in the world.Steven Speilberg allegedly planned to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts put it in the more than capable hands of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. Ultimately, this was a blessing, as Speilberg's approach to the story might have been too conservative, tonally emulating 2015's ""Bridge Of Spies."" While ""Bridge Of Spies'' is a masterful film and Speilberg is undoubtedly one of the greatest directors working today, Sorkin's taste for intense political realism is a perfect match for ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7."" Part of that intensity is also due to Alan Baumgarten's A+ editing, which can blend humor, violence, and suspense within a single sequence to create an emotional tour de force.Additional praise goes out to Michael Keaton for his small, but mighty role as Ramsey Clark, Alex Sharp's Rennie Davis, and Joseph Gordon Levitt's comeback as the morally layered prosecuting attorney, Richard Schultz. I also applaud the casting department for picking such appropriate actors for these unsung historical figures.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, streaming sites have been the home for many movies throughout 2020. Netflix distributed ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7,"" and I would say that it is second to Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods"" for the site's best movie of the year, and is certainly a contender for best picture overall."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 November 2021,1/10,"This movie is offensive as it trivializes rioting and looting and romanticizes violence. 10,000+ demonstrators threw bottles, bricks, rocks, bags of urine and feces, and numerous other objects, including spiked golf balls (a golf ball with nails sticking out of it). Officers who were there described the scene as ""chaos."" They also tell of glass ashtrays that were dropped on them from hotel windows high above. Bricks were thrown at police cars and the windows of patrol cars were smashed. Nail-spiked rubber balls were left under their car tires."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,7/10,"This has a lot of the hallmarks of an Aaron Sorkin work - good, rapid fire dialogue which will draw you in. It's pretty good but feels about 20 mins too long. Mark Rylance and Frank Langella are excellent. However in my opinion Baron Cohen, Strong, and Redmayne are badly cast. Strong and Baron Cohen are not good actors and it they drag the film down; their wigs also look like something from a school play. I've liked Redmayne in other things but he seems out of his depth here. Redmayne and Baron Cohen's accents are also all over the place. Worth watching if you've nothing else to do but it's not Sorkin's best."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 December 2020,9/10,"Such a powerful film. I had no idea that this was a piece of american history and it honestly moved me to tears. It's written very much like Social Network, which I also loved, so if you like his style of storytelling, this one is for you. Oscar noms will be inevitable!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,"Energised and impactful, THE TRAIL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is a must-see for its superb cast, pitch perfect pacing and it's captivating, clever script. A powerful and relevant historic legal drama. Bravo Netflix!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 November 2020,9/10,Sorkin hits it out of the park with this film. The writing and performances are outstanding. The pace of the movie is excellent as it bounces between court room and the inciting incident. Cohen and Redmayne carry the emotional weight of the movie. A high recommendation for this movie
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 October 2020,10/10,"It is difficult making a period piece from the 1960s time period without making the characters look silly which is rather unavoidable because looking ridiculous is what made the counter-culture counter!Fifty years later, I so respect what the 7 were trying to do. Vietnam was a terrible war and they were trying to stop it to save lives.The police and Mayor Daly had other ideas. Footage from the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968 was harrowing. Seeing the cops brutalize those protesters, not caring if it was male or female head cracking. It was horrible at the time and televised. Seeing real footage from the police brutality is nauseating.I do remember William Kunsler as their brilliant defense lawyer. Kunsler was fearless as the judge was bananas, much like the judge in the Woburn, Massachusetts case ""A Civil Action"" case. So glad they made this Chicago 7 film, it is worth watching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this film that wasn't intentionally designed to illicit a negative response. Particularly the frustrating scenes involving the judge. The time period was so tumultuous so I guess it doesn't surprise me that much that this film wasn't made earlier but I'm glad that it was. I hadn't heard anything about this movie prior to getting an email this morning from Netflix announcing its availability and watching it made my day.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 April 2021,1/10,"Notice the prosecutions side was never presented . Making the film a fraud to begin with. It was never disclosed who funded the Chicago 7 as none of them were gainfully employed. Just another Left Wing film maker bashing America. By the way it was LBJ's Attorney General who indicted them, not Nixon's, another lie ."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"I watched this with no real expectation, although the inclusion of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did intrigue me. That all changed when I watched the movie as I found it terrific. It is a story that shamefully I was unaware of, and which displays yet again what a dysfunctional political and justice system is alive a kicking in the US..... definitely worth a watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,7/10,"Most of the movie is great, with compelling performances by an all-star cast, (especially the judge, who legitimately chilled me at one point!)
But sadly it comes apart a bit in the final scene. To put it mildly, the ending is absurd and it undercut the gravity of everything that came before (I nearly yakked in my mouth when the PROSECUTOR stood at attention).
As he has in the past (The Newsroom) Aaron Sorkin gave in to sentimentality, and by doing so he lost credibility.
7/10. The actors gave it their all, but the writer should have let the true story speak for itself."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,6/10,"I thought about giving it a thorough review, seeing that nf is trying to do some heavyweight stuff. But decided that I'd only give praise for cinematography, acting, crew efforts. Can't praise the content. It's okay, but it is way too biased to be seen as anything other than pure entertainment cinema fiction, albeit with terrific ensemble cast. 6/10. Great toupee."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 July 2021,3/10,"Sorkin should've had Cohen play Abby Hoffman as Borat. That would've at least given this film some realism and actual humor. Instead, we're left watching long, drawn out monologues that were super dull. Sorkin's not a bad writer, he's just a bland one. But he does score points for getting to sleep in Ric Ocasek's bed with his best friend's girl."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 April 2021,10/10,"If any of you know that sorkin wrote the screenplay to a few good men back in 1992, you'd probably know that he used a courtroom for that film to take on colonel Nathan jessup. Move forward about 29 years later he's back in the court house with a historical drama about the trials of Fred Hampton and the hundreds of people in the Illinois black panther party, It's 1968 and boy the riots in chicago are escalating. What do we do about it? We sat there and watch it happen in the movie.Langella as judge Julius Hoffman is holding his courtroom in contempt. The ensemble cast in this film includes Sacha Baron Cohen, yaheem bareem-jar, mark rylance and Joseph Gordon levitt and as mentioned before the great frank Langella, here's a movie where the courtroom is the center where justice prevails."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,7/10,"Other than Strong, which as usual was weakest link almost everyone did a great job.
Cohen was outstanding, Gordon Levitt was so goooood as always. Rylance was great.
Very well made. Working did awesome job."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 March 2021,8/10,"This was a nice movie, alert, a lot of history in it, a bunch of good actors, doing a great job, like Mike Rylance and Frank Langella. A little bit dissapointed about Sascha Baron Cohen's acting. He can do a lot more on that (see The Spy), but on this one, he was not good at all."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 May 2021,8/10,"Set amongst the Vietnamese War and during the Democrats Covention in 1968. Seven men from three separate entities are heading to Chicago for a peaceful rally. Unbeknownst to them they are set for a trial under the Rap Brown Law insinuating these men caused riots on the streets of Chicago.It's unfortunate that trials like this were real and it's a real emotional experience as Aaron Sorkin takes us on a dramatic journey setting the scene as if we were there.It certainly helps when your cast are on song Mark Rylance, Frank Pangella and Eddie Redmayne are all fantastic in their roles. The mention has to go Abbie Hoffman played by Sacha Baron Cohen, whom gave his character depth and understanding.It has been a light on year for cinema however Chicago 7 is a standout that needs to be seen."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 April 2021,10/10,"Most people believe that films which get nominated for awards are just boring cinema which the film geeks only watch. I would like throw these kind of flicks at their face and say ""think thrice before you say something"". You heard me right?, This kind of cinema can satisfy both award juries and mass audiences. It keeps you thrilled even though it's a drama film, you will be thrilled even though the entire film was not mainly focused on thriller elements. It has everything which a good movie need like good actors, good script, good direction etc. Everything in this film is so good that it never ever fails to keep the viewers engaged.The story is about a riot which happens near a huge programme. This film is beautifully written and well directed. In terms of the screenplay, I was not able to find one scene which was unnecessary, all dialogues contributes to progress the storyline. Apart from that I would like to appreciate the production designer and art director for the good composition. The cinematography is all good but in the first thirty minutes of the film I was able to find an out of focus composition in some frames, this slight error is negligible. This film is a masterpiece. Well-worthy of the Best Picture Award.Recommending with heavy consideration. It's nothing but a must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 November 2020,5/10,"Between 196..ish and today, government behavior, action and reactions did not change too much. WHAT change is MEDIA, and not in a good way, this movie is an example, take a look at PBS ""Vietnam War"", the way networks did their reporting back then and today.
In the past let say 20 years, did we see any trial like this ? Think about whistle-blowers that got convicted on a 1917 law for showing how Reuters journalists got killed; think about some that are on run for exposing government illegal activities, or maybe for journalists jailed or fined for refusing to identify confidential sources. And take a look on how media (left, right or of ""neutral"" orientation) reacted and reported."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"It is no coincidence that this movie has come out right before the US elections.
It is obviously aimed at democracy lovers but also to all who hold that idea dear.
As a movie, it's a almost a classic: an unpredictable courtroom struggle between good, bad and the grey between with outstanding performances of its cast, most notably Frank Langella and Mark Rylance. 8/10"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,10/10,"This is a truly excellent, powerfully entertaining dramatisation of a dark moment in American history. The only people who were criminal, corrupt and unconstitutional were the judge, the police and the federal authorities, along with the local ones in Chicago. They should have been left to peacefully protest without being battered by police for the 'crime' of climbing a flagpole, in one memorable and crucial moment that I won't spoil the film by elaborating on, nor should they have been trapped, beaten and arrested by the cops in an action that would be called 'kettling' today.The courtroom scenes were a shocking and sad endorsement of the legal establishment, the corrupt judge falsely found people in contempt, denied them counsel, had then subject to the cruel and unusual punishment of being shackled and gagged, and was biased in terms of what testimony he allowed the jury to hear. Also a defendant was framed for a murder and someone else got assassinated. There literally are and were some banana republics where the 'justice' system would be more just.The trial was clearly a political trial, in the mould of ones against the Birmingham 6 and Julian Assange in the U.K., conducted by people who have nothing but contempt for the people's right of free speech, thought and assembly but hypocritically and unrealistically expect respect themselves.A must-see film!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,What an amazing film. Brilliantly acted by all. Wow wow wow speechless
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 December 2020,10/10,"Fantastic direction and casting. A very engaging watch. The present- day implications of the film all over the world are frightening. It could connect really well with recent developments in India.
The film not only manages to capture the dysfunctional nature of the justice system but also successfully depicts the schisms within the left. At times, the circus in the name of court trial appears to be an enactment of Kafka's 'The Trial'. A must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 May 2021,7/10,Solid courtroom drama that makes you mad Informative and revealing The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a 7/10 but with great dialogue and excellent performances.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 February 2021,9/10,Had very low expectations for this but it turned out to be really good.Found myself googling what happened to the judge - and wasn't happy with the result!!A must see for sure!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,The title says it all..The title says it all.The title says it all.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,6/10,"When you have to add this many fake scenes to a movie because the real event was so boring, it's better to make superhero movies. Hopefully these movies at least make some people look up the real stories"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 February 2021,9/10,"The trial of the Chicago 7 is one of the most important films in the last 10 years.. i really can't describe how i loved the scenario, the acting, the director and the court scenes
Everything about this movie is perfect"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,8/10,"Very well executed and great acting! I basically knew nothing about this trial and its background, being Dutch and born in '81, but the story baffled me! I can't believe a judge that was so politically biased and mentally incompetent was actually allowed to stay on this trial! In my country a judge can be challenged into stepping down when there's even just a suspicion of political motives or partiality. I'm sure that was already the case back in the late 60's. How could this trial continue with this judge?? Also this story seems to be even more relevant in present-day America!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,7/10,"A great film based off some harrowing facts and realities and sees Aaron better himself in his second courtroom drama film although this time he's directing too.His script is perfectly sound and perfectly paced to make a 2hr 10 film feel a perfect length although every now and then keeping up with his characters can be hard in some scenes.The cast is vast, featuring all great performers even if Eddie has a slightly meandering accent. However the two stars and stand out performers of the film aren't Eddie, who one could probably perceive as the main character although the argument could be made for our friend Mr Cohen that he is in fact the lead performer since he gets to narrate the film as it goes along and as such gets great amounts of screen time, in fact the films best performers by far are Mark Rylance and Ali G himself. Sucha Baron Cohen performs brilliantly amongst the presence of actors who are more used to a typical dramatic film experience being both funny, devoted and loud whilst we the audience have to suffer like Mark Rylance's character in becoming more and more and more frustrated with the State - the state in this film being expressed the the also great performance of Frank Mangello. Yabdul Manteen II and Jospeh Gordon Levitt also give good performances, being memorable despite having less screen time, especially Manteen.The Mis en Scene, score and camera work aren't outstanding in the film however they do not need to be, ensuring that only the flow of Sorkin's script and the performers get to take centre stage within the good uses of editing which aid the story along in increasing pace with a constant use of overlapping scene dialogue."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 February 2021,10/10,"Enough said. The following is set of instructions & information for relevant set of people, especially for Non-Americans, & not really a review, so please bear with me or move on. Thank you.The only pet peeve I have with this movie is that it's unnecessarily sped a little, & therefore can be confusing. If you're anything like me & want to absorb the movie well, without having to watch it 2-3 times; then you better download the movie & watch it on a local player that allows you to maneuver the playback speed, such as on MX player. Decrease the speed by 5-7 percent, & you're good to go. And because it's intentionally sped, the playback is not distorted upon doing this, & it looks & sounds more normal & natural, not to mention easier to understand what's going on, & therefore automatically more impressive.It's an important movie everybody needs to watch, that's presented pressing issues that're not just a part of US anymore than many other countries around the world, just over a backdrop of a case of war in Vietnam, & it does the job with sophistication & without over dramatizing.
People will get this message.But if you're also looking for the context/subject of what the the movie based on, then please do some research through reading or watching about historical timeline/outline, especially if you weren't born in US/Vietnam or never heard about the subject mentioned anywhere before through movies or whatever else. And don't give unjust ratings without understanding this. The sheer amount of parallels happening today, doesn't mean this movie was designed for propganda by rewriting entire history. Harder though it may be to believe things have always been this way, it has been this way. This happens with every generation. We just changed the ways we consume news & believe reality, so older things look like brand new problems. But the truth is humans have always been humans at the core, & everybody is same/different based on circumstance, position or experience."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,1/10,"What a timely piece of propaganda using a widely criticized war. Nice blend of truths and half truths to cloud the reality; open, violent protest against a government that was not responsible for the deaths of MLK or RFK. I guess this is supposed to excuse the looting and riots going on today under the guise of solidarity with the anti-Vietnam War movement?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 December 2020,6/10,"This is not one of the best movies of the year, is the BlackKklansman of this year, its really Overrated"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 December 2020,9/10,"I forgot what a great writer and director Aaron Sorkin is. Stayed up way too late but I couldn't shut it off. All I can say is it's a must see, an absolute must see."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 November 2020,8/10,"It's team effort which made it brilliant including the judge of-course , some scenes were very itense making it a perfect 8."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 May 2021,9/10,"# My Expectation
I had already heard so much about the movie in the news in relation to the Black Lives Matter Protests, on Netflix, in the Academy Awards that by the time I got to watching it, I already knew it was going to be something great. Something worth raving about. What I was afraid of however, was the movie to get too political and a courtroom drama scene about the US Politics, to which I'm mostly an outsider (although I do try to keep my fair share of knowledge). But as Oscar winning movies usually are, serious, dramatic and slow, I was worried this would be similar and I would end up with something too complicated. But it turned out to be the complete opposite, in a good way.# Themes
The main theme of the movie was the 1968 Democratic National Convention Protests and the trial of the Chicago 7 obviously. But besides this I think the movie was also trying to convey a couple of other important things like the Corruption in the US Judicial System, The Failure of Democracy, the Systematic Injustices Induced Upon Black People and the power Of The People. All of these combined in a fast moving film which induce emotions in the audience is what made this movie particularly special.# Most Striking Details
1. Aaron Sorkin particularly plays with your emotions in the emotions by hitting the trigger points that presently haunt our society. Take the example of Fred Hampton who was shot by the police. The scene with its glimpses of shooting in black and white remind the audience of the injustice we still face in the present day society about Police Brutality Against the Blacks. Or the particularly agitating scene where Bobby Seale is bound and gagged to be presented in front of the court. We can see the tense faces of all the people present in the room and the disgrace or humiliation of a white man sitting there. It angered and humiliated and ignited feelings of revenge from me, a brown guy sitting thousands of miles across in India, so I can't even imagine what the colored people in America felt seeing that scene. It was a brutal reminder that the America they live in isn't really free for everyone.2. Characters: We saw only a short instance in the characters lives, a particularly small moment that was big at that time. But still a spec in their entire life spectrum. We didn't know anything about their backgrounds, or their personalities, but as the movie developed, in just 120 minutes, the director was able to stand out each of the character individually, and give the audience their motive, their personality and the political values very easily, without using exposition, which was remarkably done.3. Acting: The acting by the actors is commendable. Sacha Baron Cohen expressed his lack of confidence playing Abbie Hoffman because Hoffman had a strict Massachusetts accent. But at the end the role he portrayed was so relevant and true to his character. There were many British actors who acted out American characters very well, like Eddie Redmayne who played Tom Hayden etc. Bobby seal's role by Yahya Abdul was done impeccably. The rage, the irritation and the disappointment in a system and country designed to favor White Privilege is exhibited clearly though his acting and expressions throughout the movie.4. Screenplay: The dialogues in the movie never get boring, but instead with Abbie Hoffman's humor actually make it more interesting. You'd expect a lot of political jargon in the movie which a layman couldn't get a grip on, but the Sorkin wrote the script so easy and flowing with breezy characters and funny punchlines that have a deeper meaning to them that make the movie interesting while having it hit the spot inside us too.5. Soundtrack: The background music by Pemberton was excellent and completely apt to theme. Starting the song, ""Hear My Dream"" that tugs on your heart strings to the patriotic emotional number ""Stand Up(The Chicago 7)"", the movie's soundtrack plays a big role in igniting the feelings among the audiences. Without it, the movie is a dish without any spice or flavour...just bland.# What The Movie Lacked?Some people may account that the movie isn't accurate to the real events, and after researching online I agree, it isn't. But i don't hold it against the film or the director really. Some things need to be edited out in a commercial film, especially one that is being made for ALL audiences across the world. It is a dramatised movie of the events, NOT a documentary. The director has the right and will need to modify some things to get the message and the emotions across, which i felt was done aptly.# Verdict
Overall, what I thought might be a slow, political watch turned out to be something worth watching again. The movie ignites raw emotions, completely apt with the times we are living in and touches a deep spot. It is very well made, the dialogues and the screenplay is one of the most brilliant pieces. The acting is true to the characters.The movie is a must watch for everyone as it will trigger our emotions and make us revolt and get angry at the system no matter where we are from and will make us get ideas that might not be appreciated by all.""William Kunstler: Do you know why you're on trial here?Abbie Hoffman: We carried certain ideas across state lines. Not machine guns or drugs or little girls. Ideas. When we crossed from New York to New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Illinois, we had certain ideas. And for that, we were gassed, beaten, arrested, and put on trial."""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"This is easily one of the best movies of the year. It's well-acted, well-shot, and well-written. It's funny, smart, and even difficult to watch at times. It has humour, heart, and a message more relevant than ever. The Oscars might be light this year with the lack of movies, but I wouldn't be surprised if this racks up a few nominations. The only thing I have issues with is some characters getting pushed off to the side or not really having much to do. But besides that, this was an eye-opening, electrifying, well-made courtroom drama that I recommend to everyone.Score: 9 out of 10
Overall: AmazingRecommended for: Fans of courtroom dramas, fans of fighting for what's right, or fans of an Avengers-like team-up fighting for what's right."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,"1968. The genesis of USA 2020 is so clearly demonstrated in this movie. Feeling entitled to bend and even break the law to keep the existing power structures in place, so well demonstrated here. I would have watched this movie a few years ago and thought ... yeah, corruption in the US, we've heard this story before. But now, even though this is 50 years ago, it seems contemporary. Because these are the issues we are seeing as they rise to the top in 2020.Great cast, gripping narrative, amazing story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 March 2021,2/10,"This movie is just CRINGE! It's so bad, soap opera level directing and just terrible acting even from actors who are usually good. Who are the people giving this a good rating? Do they watch anything but Lifetime movies? I'm baffled. Just ridiculously bad."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,OK. As someone who lived through the events and protested an unjust war. I enjoyed this slice of History. It was a fine film that contained great dialog and performances. But it was so one sided to the Left that I think it hurt the finished product. IT also did not have enough time to develop so many complicated characters. It was a topic that begged for a mini series. That said I enjoyed every minute and wanted more. It is a must watch. Many reviews are talking about this being so relevant today. I disagree strongly. Sorry I do not see the current BLM protests on the same level as the anti war protests of the sixties. Everyone should follow it up with some other works. Rich
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,9/10,"Watch this movie, get a stimulation of sense of justice so that you keep quiet for another decade."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"Very well made film, despite the fact I've never heard about this it was an amazing story to watch, cast were incredible!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,6/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is the typical Hollywood film. Sorkin plays it too safe. Much like last year's Ford v Ferrari, this film falls on the monotony of that tedious and overdone Hollywood movie formula.We're talking Aaron Sorkin here, so let's talk about the script. As you should expect, Sorkin did a fine job, but I'm not impressed, and I think that this is not Sorkin at its finest. The writing is a bit too self-indulgent. Sorkin is in an urge to display his razor-sharp lines of dialogue, but those lines are all over the place, and they don't feel to come naturally and organically. Also, what I noticed is that those sharp lines can come from everybody. Everyone here is witty, and that I'm afraid, that does not speak well for Sorkin. Because he ""arms"" everyone with these sharp lines, but to do so, he must have deviated a bit from doing justice to the characters. Here Sorkin seems not to care much about preserving the authenticity of his characters, as long as his witty lines get to take place. And I get it, everybody likes to let loose, but man, you got to read the room.The acting also is not something I would point out as done very well, and I don't blame the actors for the most part. I think that Sorkin didn't do a good enough job of directing them. Jeremy Strong did better when compared to the rest of the cast, but again, I think that no matter how good the actors would have been, it's Sorkin that doesn't get the better of them. Sorkin's direction lacks focus and dynamic. For the most part, he did a good job here, but I think - this being his second effort from the director's chair - that he should be better at staying in the shoes of the screenwriter.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a very redundant film. It adds nothing new to the game. Things being as they are this year, with the whole pandemic situation that has made a lot of movies to be postponed, this film might get some Oscar nomination in the technical categories. But I don't think that the movie has what it takes to create a legacy like some of the other Sorkin's works have."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,8/10,"Their is a nice and upbeat pace throughout this film. As the viewer, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with energy of these characters, passionate about their cause to fight perceived injustice of their time - the 1960's. The film involves government corruption, attempts to silence protesters, an engrained racism... Some similarities in the scenes of the movie to what we see today on the news. The characters who make up the Chicago 7, the lawyers and judges, the politicians are all very different from each other and this makes things interesting and volatile. The actors are selected well. Though I love Sacha Baron Cohen, I'm not sure he got the New York accent exactly right here. The writing is great. The editing is great. Very solid film that I think most people would enjoy."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 January 2021,10/10,"I'm repulsed, moved and sorrowful about how little things have changed in terms of the division by class and colour all around the world. The tussle for power has only worsened with time, with the bourgeoisie getting defeated severely than before, and how!Anyway, enough political and social commentary, this film is perfect in every sense - from how the script pans out and unfolds, to how it keeps the viewer invested in each indicted person. A perfect film in every sense after a long while. Special mention to the cinematography, the color grading, and the song that plays at the credits roll by."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 February 2021,7/10,"The trial of Chicago 7 is a movie directed by Aaron Sorkin and it has its casting very famous actors Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph-Gordon lewitt and more. The movie is based on a true story movie however, we don't how much the movie is accurate it has some realistic depictions. The story is basically 7 different leader figures' trial process because of the uprising at the democratic National Convention. Although, I am not very fond of dialogue based movies, I enjoyed the movie because some depictions in protesting areas were realistic and it is a good example to show how different kinds of persons come together to achieve something bigger than themselves. on the other hand, there is always a red line and it mustn't be ignored if it is to be ignored, then some bad things can happen. I must mention that powerful casting contributed the movies' quality, if unknown actors/ actresses would have become protagonists then it could have decreased the quality of the movie. On the other hand, I found this movie so much overhyped and I know it a decent movie but it doesn't mean it is the best movie of the year. Definitely it can be in the top 10 or top 20 movies of the year 2020.I think every person who likes to watch based on true story movies, should watch the movie because the movie was a good example for based on true story movies"

THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"I only put this on to pass the time... Within the first 5 minutes I said to my wife ""I'm going to like this""... This is probably the first film since wolf of Wall Street that I've said wow after it ended and wanted the experience it for the first time again...It has the perfect blend of protest and truth without being patronising...Also watch the credits... The song is beautiful...First 10/10 in 2020..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 March 2021,3/10,"I'm not sure what happened during the trail in real life, but the movie gave off bad vibes. Sometimes it's very funny and clever, but it's so melodramatic and smug that I can't help but think that the movie is very inaccurate.It was like watching someone else's fantasy.The ending in particular was very bizarre. For a split second I thought I was watching a comedy sketch.And almost every character is a wisecracking hotshot.Again, some of the scenes were very good, but I wouldn't watch it again."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 February 2021,8/10,"Many historical events tend to set an influence on what society has become. Most of the revolutions have proven to produce a more remarkable impact when reflected on their impact on society, especially on present time. However, there many important events, in which are not provided a certain spotlight, and relevance as it should.The movie, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" remembers us the key actions of seven (7) activists in order to stop the Vietnam War. The most interesting thing about it, is that the director wisely centers the political system and the trial, itself, as the main setting of conflict, evoking a sense of how the negligence of certain aspects in the system affects the movements.As a result of portraying historical events, the film uses some shots, as glances of events that happened at the time. This brought a more involved experience to the plot.The acting is incredible. Sasha Baron and Mark Rylance, had an amazing job performing the historical characters and delivered amazingly. Eddie Redman also presented a great performance.The plot itself has its problems, and considering the proposal of portraying a historic event, it had some ""wholes"" in the screen play. Consequently, it has an unique approach towards the emotional appeal on the importance of the trial towards the development of humanitarian concepts considering war and civil rights."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 April 2021,6/10,"The movie itself is entertaining and probably deserves a 7.5 rating. But for a true story about police violence, they took way too much liberties and distorted reality for the benefit of making a dramatic movie appealing to today's audience. If that's the case they should simply call it a fiction..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 April 2021,8/10,"This movie was compelling from beginning to end. I didn't even think about how much time had passed at any point in the movie. The writing, dialogue, and imagery captivate the audience throughout. Sachs Baden Cohen is hilarious. This movie is infuriating because a lot of the same stuff is happening today."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,""" We're not going to jail because of what we did, we're going to jail because of what we are.""
Aaron Sorkin's latest directorial (his 2nd) offering 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' resuscitates the art of courtroom drama. The film was based on trial of the Chicago seven, who are wrongfully charged by the Federal Govt. with conspiracy and violent encounters, arising from the counter-cultural revolution at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
Sorkin dramatizes(perfectly) the trial but it was itself one of the most dramatic events in American history, characterized by the judge's uncloaked hatred of the defendants; star testimony from some of the era's cultural icons, including Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Jesse Jackson, and Judy Collins; and disturbing visuals, like the only Black defendant being shackled and gagged in court.
Now we all know about Sorkin that he is one of the greatest screenwriters working today..and with his 2nd film as a director he proves his worth in directing also. Sorkin is always famous for his fast paced screenplays and cutting dialogues, suited perfectly with the characters. Really have to appreciate about the cast specially Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen did a great job, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Yahya Abdul Mateen-II also acted very well...probably best ensemble cast of this year ( oh yeah we got a cameo from Michael Keaton).
What can I say, this is classic Sorkin, one of the most engaging and entertaining courtroom drama I've seen in many years,he really outperformed himself...this one is far better than his previous work on courtroom film 'A Few Good Men'.
Sorkin's film values properly the sacrifice these young men made and applauds their willingness to stand up for what's right as the world crumbled around them..and (little spoiler alert) ofc. the ending scene when Tom Hayden (Redmayne) when read the name of the American soldiers who lost their life during the Vietnam War, that was really very emotional.
A compelling recreation of the notorious trial of 1968..a film about a certain moment in history that feels relevant and timely. - ""There are great films, and there are movies 'of their moment.' Aaron Sorkin's film is a bit of both."""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"This film is more than just a movie. It tells the story of some of America's forgotten hero's that helped shape the culture revolution and helped shine light on the iron rule of the U.S. Government. In a time when all voices were expected to speak the same language these men the ""Chicago 7"" spoke loudly against the ways of the Government and the Vietnam War. They did this by getting people to vote and have their voices heard! And boy were they heard....and they are still heard.
I'm glad this movie came out when it did and there's no coincidence of it's timing and arrival. These men have seemingly been forgotten in history and this movie retells their story of strength under restraint and principle over policy.Such a great ensemble and the acting is incredible especially Sacha Baron Cohen playing Abbie Hoffman. I highly recommend this movie and would be surprised if it isn't up for an award."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 November 2020,8/10,"""The Trial of Chicago 7"" showcases a very mighty true-to-life events, delivering a strong and important relevance to the present. Diector Aaron Sorkin managed to engaged viewers to the drama and intrigue-filled courtroom where every cast splendidly gave their exceptional performances, from Mark Rylance's to Sacha Baron Cohen's. While the script gave an adequate justice to the story in Sorkin's way of order, the riot scenes seemingly needed a better attachment of spectacle and intensity to tone with the potential the courtroom scenes presented. To sum up, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a must-see film and easily one of the best of 2020, paving its way to Academy Awards stage in 2021."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 January 2021,8/10,"There's so many great things in this film. SO MANY. I love Sacha Baron Cohen's character. The surprising inclusion of Michael Keaton was a fantastic moment.The non-linear storytelling is perfect to tell this story. There's a few scenes that could easily go in a ""Top Scenes of 2020 Films"" list. And of course, the writing from Sorkin is as great as you'd expect.My issue is that there's a lot of time in the film set inside the courtroom.This wouldn't be an issue, if the direction had been as engaging as the writing. At times, it was great. They'd intercut parts of the event with the trial with snappy editing and I'd be engrossed in it. Unfortunately though, most of it was just uninteresting shots of the court room, without any kind of real substance.This is definitely a good film and I'm sure it'll get some Oscar buzz, but it could've been great and that's kind of a bummer.P.S. Why does the judge look like a male version of Maya Rudolph?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who has ever been part of a peaceful, honest protest against social or political abuse/injustice, turned into mayhem by the very institutions which should uphold the state of law, will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who has ever witnessed the abuse of justice in a court of law, by the very representatives of it, will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who still believes in the eternal values of mankind- justice, empathy, honesty, love will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. This time I leave it to others to perform a critical approach. The film spoke to me on so many real levels that theory seems/is futile."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,6/10,"I give it 6 stars. Why? I'll explain.I became a fan of Sacha after watching Ali G and Borat. Not because he is funny but he is very intelligent and try to send important message on social issues. Every movie he has done has been informative, this one is not excused.It has a great plot, characters, direction and environment looked like it was from that era. I enjoyed this as a movie but not really informative.What I didnt like was how Judge character was portrayed as obnoxious. It ruined it for me. I know sitting on Judge position can make you feel like you are the king but seriously? If he behaved like that in real world he would lose his position quickly. I very highly doubt real judge was anything like that."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,,"What is this movie trying to do? to me it seems to be quite a forced leftist view, probably some pseudo critique on our times and days, but its far from factual history. add to that some of the most annoying actors or characters you can imagine, very slow tempo and overlength and you get this stuff here. of course the optic is good but thats about it, there is no 60s flair, no songs that let you connect or remember certain scenes and overall i found it very boring. hyped for nothing."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"I wonder how many powerful actors and they performances will ruin the story or sideline others, but each of them stands with heartfelt performances, bringing all the characters together makes it worth to watch,"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 August 2021,9/10,"I love Mr. Sorkin's writing and rigorous research and what about this genius casting director?This is nothing less than an impecable film with a fantastic script and serius actors, who are brilliant in leading roles and excellent as an ensemble cast.Watch this. You won't regret it!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 November 2020,10/10,"This is a great film, surpassing my expectations. The writer/director avoided the Sorkinisms that have bound other recent scripts to certain stylistic cliches which have reduced the effectiveness and power of his stories Molly's Game and Steve Jobs.Sorkin astonished me with a selfless script of power and imagination, his most brilliant and mature script to date. He assembled many of the greatest actors of our time, each role cast impeccably. His direction too was masterful and worthy of award.This story would have been easy to mess up in lesser hands.Hats off to Aaron Sorkin and The Trial Of The Chicago Seven!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"This film is realeased on Netflix today and I watched it asap because I am a fan of Sorkin. As a non American viewer, 2 things are ahead of the rest for me:1 - It gives a perspective of the American left historically;
2 - The movie puts the upcoming / ongoing American elections in context;As the movie develops, the conflict between free thinkers like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the Judge Julius Hoffman and other state administrators unfold as well. But there are intances where law abiding characters like Tom Hayden and prosecutor Richard Schultz have internal conflicts as well. What path will they choose?? Will they follow the known path and stay within the ""system"" (as Judge Hoffman calls it at the end of the movie) or will they do what is right?So this dicothomy unrevels during the rest of the movie. There is a close distinction between ""those that wear a uniform"" and those that do not. State employees are puppets who have sold their mind and soul to the ""system"" and others are free thinkers who look at things intellectually and make free choices or they dare to be unconventional.Even though this is a 2000 year old pattern, regardless of the fact that Alan Sorkin is Jewish himself (i dont know if he describes himself so), there is also the visible pattern of Jewish identity in the courtroom. Abbie Hoffman,Jerry Rubin, Lee Weiner are Jewish members of the Chicago 7. Judge Hoffman is Jewish, defense lawyers William Kunstler and Leopold Weinglass are Jewish and prosecuter Richard Shultz is Jewish as well. Once a Rabbi at a Frankfurt Synagague in Germany has talked about controversial thinking history in the Jewish Religion. It reminded me of that. And the left though and Jewish intellectuals who contributed to that.I did not know Tom Hayden was Jane Fonda's ex husband.All in all, I enjoyed the movie so much. I hope Americans vote for the progressive intellectual politicians in the upcoming elections. And they burry the clown in the office to the ground."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"I think Sorkin exercised more discipline than usual in putting this film together. The script was clear, literate, and gave the right tone to each role. The editing also was excellent in bringing in flashback events at the right time during the trial, which kept the pace going forward while providing key background details. He kept the drama high, even though the history and conclusion is well known, by leaving out some of the intermediate details. He trusted his audience at just the right times without compromising the story.Can't say enough about the entire cast. Brilliant job from the seasoned veterans down to relative newbies. SBC was beyond great as Abbie Hoffman, but the entire cast worked magic together.Must see; this is one for the ages."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 April 2021,9/10,It was very light to the kind of story it was telling and had a great screenplay and that´s it.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,2/10,"2 stars for the great cast they wasted on this film. It started out like a goofy comedy, but quickly became dull and boring. This movie never became entertaining, and I'm very easily entertained trust me. I binge stuff like this quite often! This one I had to turn off. So dumb I couldn't finish it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 March 2021,7/10,"This is a very overrated movie,it is a standard courtroom drama with a political twist.
The script is very shallow and tries way too hard to be edgy."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"I can see this one being taught in classrooms much as ""Twelve Angry Men"" has been. Bravo to everyone involved."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 April 2021,,"It's not very hard to find an era or an event in U. S history that, much to the chagrin of others, mirrors what is going on in the present. The power of ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" comes from its characters who come from different backgrounds with different ideas, whether they oppose the government, want a revolution, or are fighting for equality, they're all shown as an important part of this movie. And I do believe that the story of the Chicago Seven is correctly handled by someone who may know a thing or two about the government, that being Aaron Sorkin. Once again, Sorkin comes through in retelling the story of significant characters in our nations' history. This movie proves that not only is he a great writer with a gift for dialogue that clearly understands the source material, but also that he's a great cinematic storyteller. I can't think of too many people that make movies today about dull subjects like business corporations and government that are enjoyable to watch. I am hopefully one of the many audience members who went into this movie not knowing anything about the Chicago 7 and left knowing more- or better yet- wanting to learn more. As much praise as I would love to give Aaron Sorkin, I could not forget the talented actors who did an amazing job of recreating one of the most infamous trials ever. Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Frank Langella, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, and my personal favorite was Mark Rylance as one of the lawyers because he reminded me a bit of Saul Goodman from ""Breaking Bad"". This movie is just full of shocking moments in the court, during riots, or even when characters are just having conversations. I can't honestly remember the last newly released film that caught my interest quite like this one. I look forward to seeing What Aaron Sorkin has planed for his next project, because if it's like this, then he has quite a future ahead of him."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"History begins here, at least for myself. I recently visited Southeast Asia simply to look at the last chapter of the Novel about the war in Vietnam 52 years after the Chicago Convention. Judge for yourself, no hypotheticals allowed, about the wast of this war. This movie is as right today as the trial was then.
Want another jolt from the past see Best of Enemies: Buckley v. Vidal. (2015). This time its to see the root of todays word warrior television format that passes for journalism. Peace."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"Right now, the film of the year. The actors are incredible, but Mark Rylance is the best. He deserves the Oscar. And the film right now deserves the Oscar too. The film of the year."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,9/10,"What a brilliant gem this turned out to be. Aaron Sorkin has created a masterpiece that is not only a great piece of cinematic work but also a glaring testament to the struggles peaceful protestors continue to have with the State and its machinery to this day, in every part of the world. Inspirational movie! Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Frank Langella give stand out performances. Highly recommend this to everyone who gives a damn about their country and the world as a whole."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,4/10,"Not a bad film altho the performances of Redmayne, Cohen and Rylance make you squirm at times as their American accents flip between states - the vision of the 60s isn't caught well in the film, just throw in some people with long hair or dyed bandanas....that'll do. Overall wasn't awful but I was hoping it would be more impactful, rather than a quick skip through the trial with a comedically geriatric judge as the only interesting character"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,7/10,"I was a middle school student when this trial was going on. At the time, I was very interested in law and government, and ultimately became an attorney. After the case concluded, I read a number of books about the trial, including many by members of the 7/8. I had the chance to see William Kunstler speak when I was in college in the mid 1970's, just a few years after the case.
I would first refer anyone to the Facebook posts of Rennie Davis and Michele Dellinger (David's daughter) regarding the film itself. As I understood them, Sorkin did not contact any of the surviving members of the 7 or their families. This concerned them, though Rennie Davis was still positive overall.
I would compare the movie to an abridged version of the case. Some dramatic license was taken, but the message was still communicated. I would recommend it to someone who wasn't around when it happened, as a starting point to learn more. The LBJ footage near the beginning refreshed my memory and made it clear the man was evil, pure and simple.
I did have some concerns. Jerry Rubin was portrayed as a fragile, passive soul in need of a relationship. In reality, he was anything but. The writing and acting performance did not do him justice whatsoever. (I have since read the ""Daphne"" agent was not real--making it stupid and unnecessary.) Weiner and Froines were less involved, but not as UNinvolved as portrayed. I have been a fan of Frank Langella, and appreciate his performance, given the cinematic license necessary in bringing a story this complicated to the screen. That having been said, he gave Julius Hoffman more dignity than Hoffman ever had. As one who followed the trial, I can say he actually made him look BETTER than the IRL ""Judge."" Foran had political ambitions and threw racist comments around during his failed campaign. He was not a potted plant who sat there and watched wheels go round and round.
In the interest of space, the other members of the 7/8 and the attorneys ranged from adequate to great.
If you watch it, enjoy it (I really did), and use it as a beginning to learn more. If you don't you'll never know the real, and complete, story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,"I loved this movie!I was 12-years old during the trial -- albeit in a political family -- so was only vaguely aware of the players, or the outcome. My impression until now was that the seven were somehow wrong, if not technically guilty of crimes. And I knew that Judge Hoffman was irascible. And that the Chicago PD / Mayor Daley were somehow complicit in the riots. But that was it. The media at the time, and my somewhat conservative family, must have colored the events -- e.g. nasty, messy hippies up to no good. I certainly did not know the AG John Mitchell, Nixon or Ramsay Clark background. The use of the DOJ as a political tool.Also surprising: the fractiousness of he left. The Black Panthers, the SDS, and the Yippies all at odds.As for the movie itself: great performances by Eddie Redmayne and Sasha Baron Cohen (who I did not even recognize) and the rest of the cast. The story moved along quickly. Good use of archival footage from the TV networks. Great dialog, though could be a little too ""perfect"" at times, always with the brilliant comeback or quip. But no matter. Kept me glued to the screen.And above all, so, so very relevant given today's trend toward right-wing authoritarianism. It has motivated me to delve into the Port Huron statement and leftist politics of the 1960s. And what we can do to get back on track today."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 November 2020,8/10,Sharp writing as usual from Aaron Sorkin. Entertaining and gripping from the moment it starts.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"I had never heard of this film before watching it, we had clicked on play something and this started. Within 2
Mins we knew we were watching the film.Well acted and directed; Sacha Cohen Baron shone in this film and was the highlight. JGL was also good.This film was one of those where you watch and laugh because of the comedy of the situation but know that there were real peoples lives ruined by this circuit court."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 October 2020,10/10,"I find that court related films, especially those based on actual events, carry the great risk of either ending up extremely intense or excruciatingly monotonous. This however, is one of the very few that pulls it off with ease in all aspects, to which also provides some unexpected humour (yes; mainly from Sacha Baron Cohen).Another part of the story I definitely didn't expect going in was how character driven it was, propelled by an absolutely extraordinary cast; who some should at least get some award recognition this coming season for when the time arrives.So far, this is probably my current favourite film to have released this year, despite the lack of competition."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 January 2021,,"This was better than anticipated, but it could have excelled even more.I did like the pacing of some scenes. There were standout performances from Langella, Cohen (his Mass accent was overwrought and distracting), and Abdul-Mateen II. Redmayne tried his hardest, but his delivery felt pushed. I think he was miscast.The rest of the cast did well, but there was one blatant misstep in the film: the female characters were minimized. It seems like writers would know better by now...Unlike most viewers, I have challenges with Sorkin's writing, and I think I've figured out why I can't get into the flow: it seems like he has a need to be clever, humorous, and entertaining.... this comes across in the text and the tone. Because of his approach, I feel like the potential gravitas of his work is compromised, and the results are too glossy.And so I wonder: what would happened if Clint Eastwood had written and directed a film based on these events? If Paul Thomas Anderson had taken on this subject, I'm certain his interpretation would have been deeply intriguing."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2020,10/10,"I honestly don't know where to start describing how much I loved this movie. This is To Kill The Mockingbird of the 21st century, a true masterpiece.If I can give it 100 stars, I would."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,10/10,A very well film that should win a lot of awards. Fills a void in the current status of cinematic thirst by taking you on a time machine ride to an event that is relevant today
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 February 2021,10/10,Film was brilliantly acted and depicting the trial of that era. It will keep you engaged totally. Also the similarity to what is happening in this world today. Cudos to the writer and director. Excellent.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 February 2021,8/10,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 tells an important story in American history. If you don't know about what happened during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, this film is worth your time. Not the best work from Aaron Sorkin, but a story that needed telling, nonetheless."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 March 2021,8/10,"The last scene - Tom Hayden's statement - is absolutely perfect, and I was truly moved by it. Besides, I am very interested in the history of the United States, thus I was watching that movie with a great pleasure; also because of the acting, the overall atmosphere and the realistic form of the film itself."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"I saw Sorkin's Broadway adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird in June of 2019. That brilliance appears again in The Trial Of The Chicago 7. If you're trying to decide whether to watch this movie or not, your politics will answer the question for you. It's a great watch of the fight for justice and truth 50 years ago. And it's a commentary of how those evil forces are still grasping for our freedoms."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 March 2021,8/10,"For me this film just take you back to the 1960's and make you live it.
Great acting ensemble and amazing directing and I really liked the intersection between the real event clips & the movie.A solid (8/10)"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 February 2021,7/10,"...Once upon a time when the fringes of political norms actually believed in being antiwar, and knew a deep state government that was both corrupt and self-serving.In the modern era, now that that political power has been seized, global war is not of concern, and corruption does not appear to matter when you are the ones corrupting for political agenda. This period piece has modern references transposed into it's core, such as the term ""Far Left"", or the clenched fist commonly associated with ANTIFA or BLM (the 1968 DNC was actually held a couple months prior to the famed 1968 Summer Olympics podium moment).As a film it is better than anticipated, as a history piece, it's a grim reminder the light was lost a long time ago and poorly attempts to correlate wrongs of today with innocence of yesteryears."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 April 2021,8/10,"I had no expectations from this movie despite its superstars cast as my experience with Netflix movies hadn't been well so far. I finally decided to watch it since I wanted to watch some of the best picture nominees. And it is - surprisingly - really good! Acting is superb; the actor playing the judge is so amazing that I wanted to punch him every time he appeared on screen, the seven plus one defendants, lawyers, everybody acts so well. Storytelling is really good, the whole movie flew smoothly although I had no idea about how the US courts work."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 March 2021,10/10,"Very well made, great cast and tells an important story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 January 2021,10/10,"I did not expect ,when I put this on at like 8 in the morning, to have my cinematic socks blown right off and to feel everything I am feeling and still trying to process.
What's advertised as being a simple retelling of the 1968 Trial of the Chicago Seven (organisers of what was meant to be a peaceful demonstration protesting for the end of the Vietnam war) actually turns out to be a deep, thought-provoking, high octane drama that although presents something that happened years ago, feels incredibly relevant to now.
Politically rooted films or films that's main focus point is that of politics in some form do not tend to be flashy or bold in anyway, they just tell the story plain and simple (JFK is my main reference point), probably so as to not be accused of bias or glamourising what shouldn't be glamourised. However, this film feels like a spectacle in its theatricality and how the information is weaved into the plot of a gripping piece of cinema. The way this film is shot feels reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven with the way music and the camera is used, it's slick and sharp and stylish. Sorkin however blends style and substance with his brilliant writing that makes every character shown to us fully fleshed and most of all human (shout out to every single performance in this film because they were all so damn amazing). Every scene makes you feel something in one way or another because Sorkin doesn't hold back in the way most directors would if they took on this project. You go through the whole spectrum of emotions and that is something I didn't expect to experience when I put this film on which makes what's put out resonate even more. The riot scene against the police in the park is genuinely one of the most impressive and subtly immersive scenes I've ever seen, from the way your senses feel invaded to seeing the characters react in different ways and just witnessing unfiltered brutality and injustice it's just actual genius the way that scene was crafted.
We know Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant writer and he is obviously just as skilled a director as this film really just is a piece of cinema in the hands of someone who is brilliant at their craft. It's an interesting subject matter for a story anyway however there's a possibility of it becoming boring but luckily we had Sorkin who told the story in the perfect way so that action was constantly happening and you were constantly pulled into the world of the film. Also as someone passionate about justice and power to the people who need it, this film really struck a core. This film made me feel passionate about our basic human rights that everybody deserves and it made me want to fight more. It's a film that makes you feel and a film that makes you feel an emotion as strong as passion is a fucking outstanding film in my eyes, I can name probably less than 10 films that have made me feel that strongly and if that's not a testament to how great this film is I don't know what is. Not only that but I genuinely learnt quite a few things: I learnt about the events leading to this trial and of the level of injustice the United States Government have the captivity of imparting (no surprise) which made me angry but I also saw how people come together despite all that to make a change and that made me very happy (I may have shed a tear in that final trial scene) and about some really amazing people who gave everything to a cause they cared for. I'm going to get the actual Abbie Hoffman's book ""Steal This Book"" because I do just think that man is brilliant in every way."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 April 2021,8/10,"I do not know the real history. Now I am going to go learn it. This was brilliantly acted and We could not take our eyes off the screen. Seriously, the acting in this is phenomenal!!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Every time I am reminded of some of the worst examples of the so called justice system
What pigs and what a great example of what the world really must rid itself of"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 April 2021,9/10,A great ensemble working at their peak with a superb script and direction from Sorkin.This film manages to be both funny and entertaining whilst delivering its disturbing message.A timely warning of the need for the citizenry's vigilance over government and an insistence that the institutions of government adhere to fundamental principles of freedom and justice.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,7/10,"What keeps this movie from being great in my opinion is the organization of how the story is told. It does that thing where a movie will start in the middle of a story and reveal the beginning of the story somewhere near the end of the movie. In this movie telling the story in this order is completely unnecessary and makes the film confusing at times. I also would've like to see a little more of yahya abdul mateen II and the black panthers. Other than that this movie wasn't bad at all, but it could've been next level, especially considering the times we're in."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,10/10,I didn't know what it was about so I didn't have any expectations. Great cast. Everyone played their role perfectly. All the ingredients came together beautifully
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Very powerful movie, I really hated the judge (because of a great performance by Frank Langella), Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his best. Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen are perfect. Perfect screenplay."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 March 2021,,"Good. But short of being great. Generally speaking, I'm a sucker for a courtroom drama. This one has an important story to tell, but the message gets a little lost due to confusing direction and only average writing. It is not Aaron Sorkin's most compelling work (I am a Sorkin fan, generally) It is still a well-acted, compelling film, and it hits the sweet spot when you need to be inspired by ordinary folks doing extraordinary things. I can't help but think this film would have actually benefitted from a more ""linear"" script (Think, A Few Good Men). The movie jumps back and forth in time as the court case drags on month after month. I don't think this style necessarily serves the storytelling - we end up waiting and waiting to find out a complete picture of what actually happened at the park- what is the major evidence cast against ""The Seven""? All the while, we are tugged back and forth by the opposing legal teams and the ire of a particularly unreasonable judge. It is obvious we should be sympathetic to ""The Seven"", and agree that their cause is just - but without really knowing what they stand accused of, without knowing how the events played out, it's hard to know what we are rooting for, exactly."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,10/10,"Congrats to Sorkin, Dreamworks, and everybody who had anything to do with the production of this virtuoso piece of work. All I'm gonna say is, watch this flick for an in-depth snapshot (yes, an oxymoron -- live with it) of our nation's history forming."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,9/10,"What a great, great cast. Great writing, great editing and of course great dialogue being Aaron Sorkin.I should also point out how FUNNY it is in the first half, with some classic Sorkin sarcastic dialogue and jokes happening. It's almost more of a comedy.But then things get more real as it goes deeper into the material and it's still just as great. The editing is fantastic in this movie.Also, lots of great cameos in this which I won't spoil.A most pleasant surprise. I though it would a pretty dry docu-drama--but not at all."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 November 2020,7/10,"Always fond of historic movies, this is one of the better ones of late. This movie uses some real footage of those days to get that 'true story' feeling right from the start, and it's used a couple of times throughout. The era is that of the Vietnam protests, the American youth tired of a foreign war that was far away, and a government that couldn't afford to lose/end it. Since I've been watching US-movies for over 4 decades, I found a lot of scenes and decors recognizable and fairly genuine. What I did however learn over the years is that a viewer has to realize that, even though based on true events, it is still a scripted drama to keep things interesting and viewers happy. It might be interesting to read the actual courtroom papers.What Hoffman for instance says in the trial was very noteworthy, but was it actually said?
Richard Schultz: 'So how do you overthrow or dismember, as you say, your government peacefully?'
Hoffman: 'In this country, we do it every four years.He, and many others protested for change and peace, but Nixon was elected and the war went on for another 6 years."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"If it was released pro-COVID in theaters with a huge audience, there would have been a standing ovation at the end of this movie. BRAVO! this movie is fabulous
in every aspect of it acting, screenplay, direction and all of it.
it came as a total surprise, a tale which was never told and hardly knew, story revolves around a peaceful protest gone haywire due to the conflict between protesters and Chicago PD, leads to the most dramatic and historical courtroom drama ever seen.
Ensemble starring Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, John Carroll Lynch, Mark Rylance,Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more has done a great job and makes mark rylance a definite contendar for this yer's oscars.
True on it's sense with the story line, screenplay written by Oscars winner Aaron sorkin keeps you engaged through out this highly tensed 2 hour drama. At some point, you are so engaged in that courtroom that you start feeling that you are at that place.
This hard to believe, eye opening movie currently Streaming on Netflix is one of the most surprising movie of this year. in 2019, netflix came up with ""isishman"", this year they have ""The trial of the Chicago 7"". Best of this year"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 January 2021,8/10,'The Trial of the Chicago 7' contains all of the elements that make for a good courtroom drama. What elevated it for me was the writing of Aaron Sorkin and that it actually happened. The film also deftly captures both the zeitgeist and Owellian tactics of the Nixon administration to exploit and suppress the anti-war movement of the late 60's.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 February 2021,8/10,"As rightfully stated here by some already the ridiculous glorification of left wing extremism and not unexpected pandering to the liberal mob is painfully obvious and I totally understand how this could ruin the movie for many out there. But let's not kid ourselves... what else did you expect from a movie on this issues in times like ours?!
Nevertheless the movie was very entertaining and an unexpected treat amidst all the 'new normal' streaming mediocrities that are being pump out lately. Great writing and a very well performing cast make it one of the better productions in recent years and a really solid modern 'Hollywood movie' in the best possible meaning of that term."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 September 2020,8/10,"It's scary (and almost funny) how many patella there are between the 1960s depicted in this film and our modern political/social climate, and Sorkin captures the era well. The film is frustrating much like the trial itself, but we really only learn about Abdul-Mateen and Gordon-Levitt as characters. Cohen is great, too. Wish I got more out of this, but it's a quality watch in a meh year."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"Some very good acting of Joseph Levitt, Eddie redmane, sasha baron cohen and michael keaton. The story is set a very interesting way. You really begin to know the main characters when the story develops... "" i have never been on trial for my thoughts before"" ... wow..
And the end... so strong.. and it shows what is all about...."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 March 2021,7/10,"This movie succeeds in what it sets out to do, which is to make you mad at how the powers that be conspired to tip the scales of justice against these protestors. I was a little concerned at first that Aaron Sorkin's script would get too cute, with the way it was introducing the protestors. But as Sorkin movies goes, it turns out pretty well. For a movie that's set almost exclusively in a courtroom, it's never boring. I especially liked Sasha Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance here. It's a solid if not spectacular movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 March 2021,2/10,"The fact that this movie is getting award shine is proof that voters don't watch the movies.Let me preface this by saying my politics COMPLETELY align with this film (I have ""Steal This Book"" on my bookshelf and, yeah, didn't pay for it), but this movie is basically someone shouting at you for 2 hours and expecting you to applaud.Just the opening sequence lets you know there's nothing to figure out, nothing to learn, you're just gonna be spoon fed the entire film, which is a huge disservice to the actual story.I know Sorkin is a celebrated writer, but narrative development through quip-y dialogue is obnoxious and self-centered. Lecturing is NOT story-telling. If it was, you might as well have the characters just look at the camera and read their lines, which is how this film feels.The only way this movie could be any more heavy-handed is if the Earth's mass increased. Which is good, cuz it respects the viewer as much as a brick to the head."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 April 2021,10/10,"I can't believe that this movie didn't win any Academy award as this is the best movie of the year and Aaron Sorkin wasn't even nominated for the best director.What else Academy wants?This movie has everything. Great cast,great story,great acting,great dialogues and great direction.It actually deserved an OSCAR for the best original screenplay but academy gave the award to an undeserving movie.Don't know why but academy snubs good ones every year and this year this movie got snubbed.Trust me this movie deserves more recognition than it got."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 March 2021,8/10,"Decent flick that tells the story of how stupidity, power and ignorance form a lethal cocktail that keeps society in a prison of it's own design. It especially illustrates this with the last scene by naming some of the children who because of their lack of power and natural physical superiority are sacrificed on the altar of the degenerate machine. Go see this!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 November 2020,10/10,"Good story line.
Good cast.It is so relevant to what happen in the world. Racism and war issues.And how justice can be so wrong because of the stubborness.That dang judge has made my nerves in entire movie.I hope he get his karma for being a bad racist judge."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Not everything in the movie was true, but much of it was. Some of the shocking events really happened. Some funny things happened in real life that were left out of the movie. Definitely worth the time."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,Aaron Sorkin has yet another time produced the best movie of this year with profound cast and admonible screenplay.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,8/10,"Making a trial film in 2020 has
become one of the most difficult things recently , due to the large number of trial films throughout the history of cinema and the shrinkage of its ideas and creative solutions.
I will start by talking about the most amazing thing in the film, which is the dialogue and the text, Aaron Sorkin is known for his wonderful writing and script and he wrote many wonderful films, but this time he excelled as he wrote a wonderful dialogue that has the double meaning of sentences and comics in the text, using The black comedy in the movie made it its own splendor, as the events are tragic and make you angry and want to cry, but you laugh at the same time, writing the judge's text was special and added a lot. The end of the film was one of the things that surprised me, also the introduction of black rights and the rights of those who died in the Vietnam War were creative, wonderful, and unexpected.As for acting, I see that Eddie redmayne has a great talent for creating new expressions and adapting new characters from his imagination. As for the actor Mark Rylance, he excelled unspeakably in his neurotic scenes and the reaction of him was truly amazing. So is the actor sacha baron Cohen. As for the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his performance was so good that he was only faulted when he didn't creat new expressions for him and that his character was the most usual and imitated.The only thing annoyed me is the dark and dark colouring of the movie, also didn't get any vibes from the filmography."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 February 2021,8/10,"I loved this film.
But I must admit I'm not sure whether that's because it was a good movie or because I'm really interested in the historical event.
I found it gripping and involving with some superb performances. Sacha Baron Cohen's voice as Abbie Hoffman especially I felt was a triumph. (Trouble is Cohen will always be a lot cooler than Hoffman ever was.)
Frank Langella is superb as the partisan judge. I always feel that if an actor can make a character seem especially dislikable, then they've done a good job.
There are inevitably some short cuts and omissions from the screenplay in comparison to the real world. But as a snap shot of a period when the US appeared to be at war with itself, I found it fascinating and I was left wondering if anything had changed given recent events"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 November 2020,8/10,The movie was really good and acting great ! I wasn't born in 1968 and knew only little information about this Trial but the movie was really informative and I started looking for more documentation on Internet. Good to remind yourself where we come from and what history is made of.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,7/10,"With multiple oscar winners the cast delivers an impeccable performance. The movie successfully creates an emotion of extreme hate for one of the characters.
Probably the best court room drama of all time not featuring mathew mcohney."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 December 2020,8/10,"So many interesting and important parts to this well-made historical drama. What would we do without movies like this? Do we expect everyone to read their history books - are stories like this taught in regular US history courses. And what if you happened to be a descendant of judge Hoffman? Superb cast, troubling dangers, but the value of a democracy remains intact. For now and hopefully for a long future for the free world. Frightening demonstration of political power, a warning around the perils of true justice and the power to make things right."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 November 2020,10/10,"This great movie has one profound message for the people in USA, but also for the people outside of the USA - especially those who see USA as a boogieman nation: The USA had been in a constant state of stall since the 60's, and proof to that is everything that had been the pinnacle of news coming from USA in the previous two years. The people, the ordinary humans just like you and me, were so suppressed and enslaved by the domestic moguls of all kinds, be it political, economical or other, that they needed over 50 years and the explosive advancement in technology, internet and social media to get back from zero to the moment in history where people who wanted to peacefully show their numbers gathered over ideas of equality, peace and value of human life - were painted as demons of violence, sin and malice by the same ones who profited of war, death, division, racism and inequality by the tools that invest power to maim, gas, beat up and imprison anyone thinking otherwise or proposing that religion, skin color, nation, origin or beliefs are freedom of choice and not a scratch on a scale of one's value of life or level of allowed freedom to pursue happiness.This movie was released in the right time, condensing and interpreting real-life events that are horribly similar to what people, humans, are going trough now in the USA... I stand corrected - what people in the USA, and worldwide, are going trough for more than half a century in reverse, and are just now having recuperated strength and having ways to again ask for freedom and be allowed the value of life.I am not optimistic that we, as a human species, can move forward before couple of more cycles like these and more suffering and failing to see each other as equal human beings, but it gives hope. The idea of society of equality is far from dead, it is only dormant at times, but while it is sleeping under a boot - it never dies."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,"I would watch this alone for the performances of Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne.To catch that balance of humour and seriousness in so many scenes by Sacha is incredible. It's such a fine line, I just couldn't believe how well he pulled it off.Eddie and Sacha both were incredible. I would be surprised if one of them didn't at least get a nomination for the Oscars.The story is brilliant and there are a few shocking scenes where you are just horrified at what you are seeing."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,8/10,"I was lucky enough to have gotten in to see a day of this trial in 1969. I was just entering High School in Chicago and a friend's aunt was a courtroom artist for WBBM-TV CBS Channel 2.I can say the entire film was fun to watch and brought back memories of a crazy time during the worst days of the Vietnam War. The Chicago police were brutal and Chicago Mayor Daley's famous malaprop ""The police aren't there to create disorder, they are there to preserve disorder"" came during the riots.Sasha Baron Cohen did a good job with Abbey Hoffman. Judge Julius Hoffman was much smaller and more maniacal in person. So, I highly recommend this film. Sometimes the dialog seemed forced and melodramatic, but there was a lot of info to get out and this is an Aaron Sorkin script!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"A fantastic film that is in my opinion is not only the best film of 2020 so far but the best Netflix original movie ever. Amazing story, amazing direction and amazing acting by the entire cast. I expect several Oscar nominations. A must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 March 2021,9/10,"Completely American movie.
Style and pasta.Sorkin spent 11 million on the cast.
Money well spent.
Great performacers from all cast.Photofraphically beautiful and enjoyable.
The only exception is the too American style which I personally like but others may not be.A true story taken from an American and translated into pure American spectacle, ironizing even some traits that he personally found cute."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,And in turkey when we follow and read court statements we see this kind of jugdes all the time.such a luck for us.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Timely and relevant, it really captures your immediate attention from the first scene. I love a well paced movie from the get go and this is another great effort from Aaron Sorkin. I wasn't expecting to be as engrossed as I was in this.
A true piece of history that really gives you something to take away.I can guarantee you wont hate on a judge in a movie more than you will on this one. Shame he is based on a real life man.."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Utterly compelling and absorbing depiction of the real life events in Chicago in 1968 of the trial of 7 protesters against the Vietnam war. Impressive, intelligent, sometimes funny, emotional and thought provoking dialogue and some very impressive character acting by the cast. A movie relevant to our times - the importance of bravely standing up for our principles, equalities, freedom of thought and speech, liberties and rights to question authority and to peacefully protest. A must watch movie which I will watch again when the government next lock us down again!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 May 2021,8/10,"One of the best courtroom movie ever, this movie has everything drama, comedy & emotional. Its a very intense story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"If you're against progressive politics you'll likely not find much uplifting or entertaining about this movie.But for everyone else this film is a shockingly gripping 2 hours of political and personal drama that superbly showcases the foolishness of some, the intellect of others, and the general complexity of war, politics, race, and humanity.Highly recommended if you want to watch a movie that also gives you an excuse do go down the Wikipedia rabbit hole."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,10/10,"Documenting America entertainingly, for this and future generations , because someone has to.
Respect."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 November 2021,8/10,"Abbie Hoffman is portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen to perfection with a perfect Boston accent. His fellow travellers, Jerry Rubin and Tom Hayden were on trial in Chicago in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention. Aaron Sorkin uses news footage in between riveting courtroom scenes to make this one of the ten best films of last year."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,10/10,"Rylance, Redmayne and Ali G on top form :)Made even better knowing that its based on a true story.Intense movie with some great dark humour and superb acting.I found the Judge's behavior incredibly hard to believe - if it was based on fiction I would have said it was way over the top - but discovering it is fact based makes it incredible. The sheer frustration and helplessness of the defendants and lawyers portrayed perfectly.I loved Ali G's american accent and likewise Mark Rylance's.
Redmayne performance is also top notch.The riot scenes really seem to portray the brutality and violence well.I was never a fan of Ali G nor the Borat movies because of the crass humour, but with this film and some more of his recent serious roles, I will be keeping an eye out for Sacha Baron Cohen.
2hrs well spent!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,1/10,"This is the type of movie where the director/ writer, in this case Aaron Sorkin, thinks one of his stars Sacha Baron Cohen as Abby Hoffman is going to win awards and therefore unintentionally goes out and ruins his performance by giving him close-ups constantly and a million speeches to deliver-all with an annoying actorish Boston accent. Then he puts him on the witness stand and has him deliver even more annoying platitudes.I can't think of another movie in which so many actors of good repute give such horrible hammy performances. Eddie Redmayne has Tom Hayden's pizza face. That's about the extent of his performance. Worst of all is Mark Rylance (a rather short man) playing the rather tall and charismatic William Kunstler. But the way that Rylance plays him, he couldn't convince you that Jesus was innocent.Surprisingly the best performance in the movie and the only one that has any professional force is Frank Langella's nasty Judge Hoffman. Considering how over the top the direction is that's no small accomplishment.if you ever want to learn anything about the '60s you'd be much better off watching a fictional movie like Coming Home. What that movie was able to do and what this movie cannot is convey a sense of the free-floating anxiety that pervaded that era. What you get with the Trial of the Chicago 7 is a preachy, arrogant, pompous, speechy mess."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,10/10,"Great movie , horrible to think what one corrupt and mentally insane judge can do to peoples life's"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 April 2021,6/10,"It's very confusing because it's too fast the pace of the film, also it didn't manage to get delve into any character of the film, so It's difficult for us as spectators get emotional."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Great writing, great story, great cast, and great acting. It is a crowd-pleaser for sure, and it is extremely relevant in 2020. A couple downsides to this movie is that there is nothing extraordinary about the cinematography and it also feels a little biased/propogandaish at some times. However, I do think it poses some great questions for the audience to think about and makes some great points in the issue of police violence. I can definitely see this movie being a Best Pic nominee, and I think it's a great addition to Sorkin's resume."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"The whole world should be watching this. This is still happening, the unfairness of the system hasn't gone away, and we need to recognize this as the important political masterpiece that it is! The whole world is watching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,7/10,"The film is quite simple, it is a typical representative of court films, when during the narration we are told the details of the case. Sorkin, as a master of his craft, skillfully interests the viewer and does not give out all the trumps at once, revealing them in the course of the film, and does not let interest cool down throughout the tape. Let the genre of court dramas with an admixture of documentary is quite specific, because there is no action in the direct sense, but if you like disputes and debates between the characters, here it is in bulk."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 March 2021,10/10,"When I watched this movie i was ready for disappointment. I didn't get it. This movie had amazing history and acting. This movie even had some pretty funny parts. ""You don't know what to do with the egg now do you?"""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 July 2021,8/10,"It has an incredible plot and nice interpretations, dialogues are followed by the roles and the story is amazing. I don't give it 10 stars because you can get a bit bored, the film has a lot of dialogue and conversations.Remember to pay attention and enjoy the story, which is nice."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 November 2020,8/10,"A film based on a surreal yet true story set in a context that reflects many of the issues of today.Whilst the plot can be complicated and surprisingly fast paced at times which can make it difficult to keep up, the overall storytelling and thematic evolution provides more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.Touching upon racial tension, police brutality, political activism, and abuse of power, the film is furthermore stimulating and contemporary, yet remains accessible, comedic at times and crowd pleasing."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"An all-star cast does full justice to Aaron Sorkin's script in this quintessentially 60's protest flick end courtroom drama. In addition to star turns by Redmayne, Baron Cohen, Langhella, Rylance, and Gordon Levitt, I loved the cameo from Michael Keaton."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 January 2021,6/10,"An exciting start and an uplifting end. Fully realised performances from the ensemble that will surely warm your heart towards even the smallest of characters. A great job by writer/director Sorkin!
BUT the middle section of the film is bloated and arduous, spending too little time on the characters we came to see, and too much on the legal minutae in the courtroom."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 January 2021,8/10,"Your going to be impressed by the actors you know of bc you've seen them do great works in a million other movies but I was actually rather impressed by this kid Alex Sharp because I've legitimately never heard of him before watching this and haven't seen him in anything since watching this. I'm NOT saying he does the best acting in the movie (that would either be Redmayne, Baron Cohen, or Keaton) but since I've never heard of the kid before, I was expecting rather a beginner's level of acting but I really think he kept up with the heavyweights he was acting alongside."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 October 2020,8/10,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7""... beautiful movie.It shows how the American nation had been against wars since the Vietnam war and how the U.S. government kept going against the wishes of its people onto an episode after an episode of mayhem and carnage. It also shows how corrupt the justice system can be of a super power of a country. And it also shows how power rots from within if not exercised wisely.Beautiful movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"Just when you think this true story can't get any worse, it does. No wonder people lose faith in the judicial system. Unbelievable. A must watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 March 2021,8/10,"In the competition for the Oscars in 2021, among the films that could all together be described in the mildest and most benevolent way simply as a god-da*n boring, an interesting achievement by screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin stands out, about the event that was initially known as the trial of eight, but after the dismissal of charges against Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale, became the trial of seven protest organizers in Chicago in 1968.Aside from all the disagreements with historical facts, simplification, polishing and the usual falsification of elements of the story, ostensibly for artistic freedom and greater dramatic effects, the movie managed to convey the spirit and mood of American citizens towards the establishment from the described period, remaining dynamic and interesting for watching to the end, something in which e.g. Failed a film that is describing the same time period, ""Judas and Black Messiah"".For great casting and flawless acting, I have no comments. Unfortunately, there was enough time in the movie for irritating individual lines and retellings of jokes that do not belong to the plot or events that are described, and which are the so-called ""seal"" of the director. Some characters were invented without any real reason, such as a girl who plays an inserted FBI agent and then witnesses in the court, even though the first female agent in the FBI was employed only a decade later.Is it a big movie? Sadly, no. Is it better than the other candidates for the Academy Award? Yes, for a length of two spears. Only, as someone has already noticed, the film did not bring us as close to the events of 5 decades ago as modern events and democracy have returned to the past for so much. When not well learned, history tends to repeat itself. For local occasions, we in Serbia now already know that very well."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"Few famous trials provide more raw material for drama than the trial of the Chicago 7. Sorkin captures the outrage and anarchy of the times as well as the stylistic and ideological tensions among the leaders of the anti-war movement. This movie also shows the vendetta that the Nixon administration AG John Mitchell had against his predecessor Ramsey Clark that motivated the trial and the shocking behavior of Judge Julius Hoffman.Sasha Baron Cohen was an inspired choice to play the anarchic Abbie Hoffman despite his mangled Massachusetts accent . (Worcester native Hoffman had the same accent that my Massachusetts born and bred mother had, and Cohen's is not even close. Jimmy Fallon's Boston accent as Sully on SNL was 100 times better.)The portrayal of the seven defendants, Bobby Seale, defense attorney William Kuntsler, and the prosecutors is dimensional and fascinating. Hoffman and Rubin in particular could have been cartoons, but they are not.Sorkin dramatically reminds us that the freedom,, peace, and justice that we fought for in the '60s are more urgently needed now."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 November 2020,9/10,Absolutely good. One of the best film in last two years ever seen.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 March 2021,9/10,"When the System is stripped, it's ugly. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a powerful depiction of the naked king. Strongly recommended."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 April 2021,6/10,"Eh, I went into this film with the mindset that it would be somewhat funny cus Sacha Cohen was in it. Maybe I should have looked closer at the Cover. This is a courtroom film with some interesting flashback of memories outside of the court. I myself who self identify as a stoned hippie, felt my inner tribal being being dragged in chanting excitement as fellow hippies attacked the scumbag popo's. There was also some well acting symbiosis moment that i enjoyed, especially between Potter 2 and Cohen.The Courtroom scenes I mostly found boring tho, I think there were too many people in the room to get a good vibe or something, I could kinda feel the script and the passing of lines as it became too big to the momentary dialogue in context."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"The best movie in 2020 until now
A lot of Oscar nominations buzzers:
Best movie
Best directing for aaron sorkin
Best adapted screenplay for aaron sorkin ( winner )
Best supporting actor for mark raylnce"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 December 2020,8/10,A contemporary historical drama reinterpreted in a fresh and cool directorial key. High-level acting performances.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,1/10,"Another Netflix movie with crap lighting. Court rooms, meeting rooms and offices are not that dark. People don't work in darkness. Enough with the fake side lighting from obviously fake windows. Light doesn't behave like that. Turn some damn lights on."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Great writing, wonderful Directing. A truly quality and very important film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 March 2021,9/10,"Couldn't stop watching. An amazing way to tell this story. Learned a lot from this and it's still relevant to this day. Amazing writing, acting, and overall intense film. I hope it wins an Oscar!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"Great writing great story totally brilliant ensemble cast.
So good to watch a wonderful story which was unknown to me written so well. Set in the 60's but (sadly) could easily be set in 2020.
Very relevant and a great watch."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2020,9/10,I watched this first because it's Sorkin. But the cast made it must see. It's a moving portrayal of 60s American madness that we seem to be reliving with another madman in chief. History sadly rhymes. The C7 reminds us not to sit idly by.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,7/10,This is a great and compelling story but the film looses its momentum at times which is frustrating. Despite that it's one to watch.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 December 2020,10/10,Not one for writing much but this is a brilliant engrossing film.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,6/10,"Give me a moment would you friend, I've never been this disappointed by an Aaron Sorkin-scripted film before. The Trial of the Chicago 7 may contain the razor-sharp, fast-paced, melodic Sorkin dialogue that I adore, but the quips and banter here often feel misjudged for the film's serious subject matter. Perhaps if Spielberg (even a later-day Spielberg) had directed, as was the original intent, the film would have better balanced its crowd-pleasing sensibilities and societal critiques. Instead, despite earnest performances from the entire cast (especially Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman), Sorkin's edit is a mess - the direction is dull, the tone is inconsistent, and the score frequently undercuts the action on-screen. The script might only need a slight touch-up, but the film itself needs a whole new draft."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 February 2021,9/10,This movie could radicalize. Very powerful performances on both sides of the case. Andy Sorkin has done it again with an accessible but genius script that tells the story we have heard in America too many times.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 May 2021,8/10,"There are no standout actors in this film despite a superb cast because EVERYONE is simply amazing, articulate and intricate.Emotions should flow when watching this film, in the age of activism this movie shows the struggles of such activism almost 40 years ago. This movie could not be more relevant in 2021 in the age of racism and police brutality.My favourite actors in the film are Mark Rylance as William Kunstler and Frank Langella as Julius Hoffman. Langella's role was absolutely enraging and he played the part beautifully.Despite the 0 Oscars, this is arguably the best film of the year. Far better film and more enjoyable than Nomadland.This is story telling done right."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,6/10,"Amazing screenplay, stunning direction, great score, absolutely brilliant performances. It keeps you interested from beggining to end, and because of the sharp and fast dialogue you are invested in the story every second the movie is on your screen. It's totally rewatchable, a very interesting social commentary and has hilarious moments. Like I said, the performances are amazing. Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance are particularly great, I think they totally transmit everything they intend to. Amazing movie, is captivating and moving. Congrats Sorkin, you did it again."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 November 2020,7/10,"While I am partial to the amazing character dynamics of The Social Network, the same capfivating dynamics are found here. Dynamic use of dialouge bouncing from one location to another allows us to understand the habitats of the characters without constant direct explanation.
Overall, as expected this film delivers on what we lock about Aaron Sorkin's work, alongside great performances from this star studded cast."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 March 2021,6/10,"I was a kid living here when this went down and remember well storm it created. The general tone and feeling is good but don't dare dig into the true historical details or it will seem daft.Worse than that is seeing Sasha Baron Cohen, at 6' 3"" playing Abbie Hoffman (5' 7"") and nearly twenty years too old for the part. These were students and young activists not nearly 50-somethings! I love Sasha BC as D' Ali G and Borat but here he is out of his depth and looks like some weird old man wearing a halloween wig. His American accent is terrible and I found it a great distraction."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,"Well done, all the way around. His script really captured the conflicts of the time. Great acting and superb scenes. Hats off! Looking forward to watching it again."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 February 2021,6/10,The story is good enough without stupid Hollywood making it a Disney movie with irrelevant dramatic made up scenes. But people eat that sht up so give it an Oscar because 2020 sucked for movies anyway. If I want fiction I'll watch top gun. Can't wait for that sequel to come out.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"Full marks on every front!! Sacha baron cohen is outstanding , as usual!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"I've been Aaron Sorkin's fan ever since ""The Social Network"". And he didn't disappoint this time around either! The story is carried across in a very dynamic and captivating way so much so that you'd be surprised realising that you reached the end of the movie. I wouldn't call this a courtroom drama, since it's much more than that. Sorkin has managed to take us back to the events of Chicago protests in 1968 through the trial's aftermath of it and that shows how great storyteller he had become. It is astonishing to find out how much Nixon's era resembles Trump's era.
Highly recommended!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"To begin with I have to say that I did not know about this trial before watching the movie. So at first I felt a bit lost with all these characters and their introduction into the story which didn't take much time. Instead they rushed it till the actual trial take place.But from this moment on I knew the characters standpoints and I could easily follow the story. Well 'easy' seems like the wrong term, because I felt so much anger and frustration. Every actor did an outstanding perfomance, especially Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, so that I could feel their emotions that they are going through. It was really moving!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 December 2020,8/10,Such a marvellous drama and true stories always are the hits. A must watch for everyone. Fantastic movie it is...
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,"The combination of comedy with drama was done in a good away picking moments of unexpected jokes in the court room.The movie clearly shows how a judge with few powerful people and politician can cause a miscarriage of justice in a court room.The movie also shows the history of US becoming an Army nation and how some US citizens didn't agree wars that US was taking part in, one of them was Muhammad Ali who is not part of the movie but it shows other unknown heroes who are trailed in this movie that time.The movie is also released in a significant time of the year, close to US voting and the events going in the country shows how citizens can have a right form of democracy,"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 July 2021,9/10,"The movie's actor ensemble caught my attention and I'm glad that I picked it. The pacing of the movie was phenomenal. There was never a dull moment, even during down times.Dialogue delivery was powerful and strategic. It really highlighted the characters and their depth.I actually laughed quite a few times during this movie. Subtle and satirical humour.In the end it made me sad. History just repeats itself. I don't think I learned too much about the Chicago riot (?) and seeing how the events are so similar to what has been happening now is gut-wrenching."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,10/10,"And an All Star cast, how do you get all this talent in one place."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 July 2021,3/10,"I know that every one has his own taste of a movie ,, but what I just watched ?!? It should have been a play in the theater with the overdone acting by almost everyone + the unnesecery jokes from Sacha ..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"Amazing writing, acting, and intens moment. Definition of ""Democracy"" at it best today. At the end of the day, L'Histoire se Répète."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY AARON SORKIN
In 1969, American Activist Fred Hampton was shot and killed in his own apartment by the Chicago Police Department. This tragic event was followed by Black Panther Party leader Bobby Seale being bound and gagged in the courtroom for taking back to Judge Julius Hoffman. What happens 51 years later? In March of 2020, a 26-year-old African-American Woman by the name of Breonna Taylor was shot and killed in her own apartment by the Louisville Police Department. This tragic event was followed by another tragic event of a 46-year-old African-American Gentleman by the name of George Floyd being restrained and eventually murdered by the Minneapolis Police Officers. What distinguishes these tragic events that are 51 years apart from each other? Has history been used to create a better future? Or has it been used to mirror the future? These are the pivotal questions that Aaron Sorkin posses with his masterful drama about the trial of seven anti-Vietnam war activists being put on trial by the federal government for conspiracy and for crossing state lines in order to incite a riot. Aaron Sorkin's masterful storytelling blurs the lines between the events that occurred in 1968 and the events that have occurred these past four months.
The film is a classic Sorkin drama. It has all the exciting ingredients that make Aaron Sorkin the most respected and loved screenwriter working today. Rapid fire, quick-witted dialogue, non-linear storytelling, repetition - all the delicious tropes that craft a compelling Sorkin drama are embodied in this film. After making an impressive debut as a director in the exciting 2017 film Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin returns as the captain of the ship and the individual behind the camera. There were moments where Sorkin's direction stood out more than the dialogue. Take the scene towards the beginning when the first day of the trial is about to begin; in a single shot, the camera fluidly moves across the front of the courtroom showcasing every member of the trial preparing themselves for the notorious events that are about to unfold in front of them. It almost felt like a moment from a play, expect rather than just solely relying on the staging and blocking of the actors, the movement and vocabulary of the camera accentuated the feeling of immersing the viewer in the rapid sensation of anticipation.
Or take the scene when Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is just terrific) gets gagged in the courtroom; there is pure silence except for the haunting sound of Seale's handcuffs and footsteps. Aaron Sorkin has truly grown as a filmmaker; his sense of staging and blocking a scene in order to be in harmony with the words he has written on the page are evolving into, just like his writing style, a rhythmic and musical style of filmmaking.
And boy does the dialogue get even more exciting as the film progresses. Lines such as, ""You can do anything to anything by taking it out of context."", reminded me of a steroidal version of ""You can't handle the truth!"". Or the line, ""If our blood is going to flow, let it flow all over the city."", is a classic representation of how, sadly, anything can be taken out of context.
The cast is tremendous. Each actor has given a remarkable performance. The standouts being Sacha Baron Coen as Abbie Hoffman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale, Mark Rylance as William Kunstler, Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden, and Frank Langella as Judge Julius Hoffman. Everyone beautifully brought life to Sorkin's stylistic writing. Each one of them brought a humanity to their character which felt authentic. Especially towards the rousing climax, which would empower any individual to consistently commit the act of respect.
The editing by Alan Baumgarten complements Sorkin's non-linear screenplay. The editing adds a wholesome feeling to the entire rhythm of the movie. The running time is sharp and clean, not a moment affects the pacing of the film.
The Trial of The Chicago 7 is a moving and haunting portrait of the frightening parallels that run between the 1960s' and 2020. It is the perfect story to be told in times like these. Aaron Sorkin's watertight screenplay and direction, the terrific performances from an incredible ensemble cast, the fast-paced and rhythmic editing, and the terrifying relevance and parallels between the events portrayed in the film and the events that have occurred in the past four months culminate to make The Trial of the Chicago 7 the most pertinent reflection of the times we are living in. The film asserts that acts of violence, corruption, discrimination, brutality, racism, and every other traumatic incident will be worked towards being prevented by the citizens of a society who believe in civility, empathy, and compassion, because the fact of the matter is - THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 April 2021,1/10,"Leave it to Sorkin to take a gritty and vibrant chapter of American history and coat it with a Hollywood veneer. The clean and brightly clothed protestors bore no resemblance to the ragged, enraged demonstrators who fought the well-equipped Chicago police. The main actors turned in solid performances through I don't know why we needed 2 British actors (Redmayne & Baron Cohen) to play historic Americans. Not one American could play Tom Hayden? But the biggest malfeasance was the corruption of American history. I understand that filmmakers may make a few changes to tighten the story but why give characters words that contradict their own history? Why invent the female FBI agent? The real story was interesting enough. It didn't need false narratives."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,The message is very apt for today's America. The sheer fight against a corrupt administration and law is possibly closest now to the Nixon era. Except impeachment no longer happens
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,What a way to capture that period of history and flawless performances from all.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,7/10,"Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" takes to a story from the 1960's and brings us a sure bet for Best Ensemble during Award Season.
Tom Hayden played by Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne brings a droll but nuanced performance to this well scripted movie. Based on the real life story, the script brings the feeling of the era to this move. However, the final product feels less like a 60's film of the era and more like a polished dialogue heavy play. This is not to say the film doesn't have its brilliant components. Because it does. The directing is strong and the performances are captivating. This is a surefire bet for a Best Screenplay nomination at the Oscars. Overall, it feels very relevant today and it hits its a nerve throughout. Sorkin delivers again and Frank Langella shines as Julius Hoffman, the judge grow to hate from the first time we meet him. His performance brings a strong response from the audience to fully engage into this story. I can't wait to see this as a play."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 March 2021,8/10,"This was a brilliant movie and I loved it even though I had not heard of the trial before. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is probably the best part of the film: the dialogue is great, the characters are written very in-depth and the story is compelling. Another great part of the movie was the acting. All actors delivered great performances, which were certainly expected by an ensemble cast of 2 Oscar winners and many nominees. The performances that impressed me the most were the ones by Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance. To sum up, it was definitely one of the best films of the year and a big Oscar player."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 March 2021,9/10,"Great performances from the cast. Particularly Cohen, Rylance & Redmayne. Would be a 10 but it's somewhat historically inaccurate."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 April 2021,10/10,The movie did a great job of having me sympathize with the 7 on trial and be extremely disgusted by the judge. I was very engaged and found the sequence of scenes and events that were shown to be optionally planned.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,10/10,"This movie is riveting. I was young at this time so I didn't know a lot about the riots at the Democratic convention. I got a history lesson from this movie that on several occasions brought tears to my eyes. I know quite a few people who were in Vietnam, a war that should never have happened and a draft that should never have happened. So many young people died for nothing."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,9/10,"Everybody who is concerned for our country and wants a little hope, watch this movie. The writing by Sorkin was amazing, and the acting was so passionate that I could not help but clap after the movie ended (and I have never been one to do that). OSCAR WORTHY. INCREDIBLE. THE LIGHT OF 2020."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,8/10,"I'm not an expert on American history so I can't talk about the movie's historical accuracy, but apart from that I think it was amazing. Great direction and storytelling. The flow was smooth throughout and without any slow moments. There were some great standout moments, especially the climax. There isn't one actor I felt I could complain about. All the Oscar buzz is well deserved and I won't be surprised if they won for Screenplay or Acting."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 July 2021,9/10,"One of the best films of 2020. This time awards season got it right. Fascinating, important historical topic with smart, entertaining dialogue. Just watch it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 January 2021,8/10,"One of the rare good things that happened in 2020.I usually find the Netflix movies dull and not worth watching, but this one really got to me.Intense, tragic and funny at the same time. A great movie.The actors are fabulous and the screenplay is great. If only Netflix could make more of this..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 November 2020,9/10,"Such a fascinating part of American history, doesn't show much change in the way the two political sides still present themselves today. Great acting, script is superb as you would expect from Sorkin........."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"I had no prior knowledge of this film - hadn't heard of it before but thought it looked interesting when searching for something to watch and it popped up on Netflix. Absolutely fantastic! Both my husband, and I (along with my son) all thought it was an excellently made film - with a star cast (did keep having to check it was Eddie Redmayne with an American accent - it was him with very good accent!)). Thoroughly recommended if you are interested in either true stories and/or 60s American history."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 April 2021,10/10,Thanks to Netflix for making such good movies and am proud of being Netflix subscriber for last 4 years! This is best movie I watched in 2020.I particularly liked acting of Cohen a lot and full credits to director and screenplay for adopting this much significant true story in best way to engage and make easy to understand for all audience!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 November 2021,5/10,"For a story that has quite a spotlight in American history, Sorkin's interpretation of this case and the story around it doesn't leave me astounded or really satisfied. The script doesn't have anything memorable, punctual, or thought provoking unlike other courtroom dramas like A Few Good Men or 12 Angry Men. It doesn't really demonstrate any type of nuances surrounding this case and very much panders to a certain audience and/or side (given this came out in 2020, an extremely politically polarizing year). It's comes off as very portentous and it's quite obvious that it was fishing for Oscars as well, given that it received six nominations but no wins. Besides only a few of the cast members giving good performances (primarily Cohen, Rylance, and Abdul-Manteen II), there aren't really any outstanding performances in this film. Many of the performances are very flat which is disappointing given that the cast is talented and I've seen them carry out great performances in other works. I think it ultimately comes down to the writing as these characters were not developed very well. I think this story could've benefited if it were in a mini-series format. The cinematography and score are nothing that special nor does it make it distinct from other historical/bio-pic films. Besides only a handful of moments, I'm left bored and unamused. I think audiences would be better off watching a documentary surrounding this infamous case."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,Just watch it for yourself and I think you will see what everyone is talking about. A famous trail that most had never heard about but yet a important one for history.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 December 2020,10/10,"I loved it! Absolutely stunning movie. Its so gripping & heavy on words & politics. There are so many aspects of law, justice, order, human nature, personalities, characters & politics which are put forward with such ease.
You cant watch it once & be satisfied with this movie. It demands a rewatch. Its actually a bit exhausting.
I maybe a bit partial but Sasha Baron Cohen was absolutely amazing, he stole the movie for me.
Love it! Must Watcj!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,9/10,Eddie is amazing actor. Guys you shuld see the movie. Its best movie in 2020. Thanks Netflix for amazing movie.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 October 2020,8/10,"Strong acting performances that give life to an old story, as relevant in 1968 as it is now in 2020. The movie has High intensity and I wouldn't be suprised if it is awarded any prizes."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 February 2021,6/10,"Starts off very dull and boring. Near the end things picked up and became more interesting, as well as timely. Some good performances but, overall, the film felt uneven."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 April 2021,9/10,"Phenomenal movie. Aaron Sorkin truly upped his directing game, and his perfect dialogue has not disappeared one bit. Sacha Baron Cohen was incredible, along with Frank Langella and Mark Rylance. The rest of the cast was solid. Even Eddie Redmayne, I don't know why a lot of people are hating on him I thought he was fine. The movie ends on a really really really weird note though. Besides that, can't complain."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 August 2021,9/10,"I love courtroom dramas. My fav goes back to Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case. Had I know that's what this was I would have watched it way sooner.I thought this was a stunning watch most because the story of the protestors was so passionate but also because the tinge of comedy or lightness from Abbey and his friend helped make legal things tolerable.Great film. No complaints except for Sasha's accent in the beg but later on it was perfect. In a way he performed well from start to finish. I've moved around a lot and I have a strange accent too. It's confusing even for me!! Because Sasha isa comedian it's easy to get over the accent confusion quickly and it just works for his character, Abbey."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 March 2021,2/10,If you ever want proof that social media is rigged here it is. No film gets this many 10/10 and 9/10 votes. It is so far out of any statistical norm that anyone can see these are PR paid voted.The film is OK ish gets lost between comedy and farce. But if you want to what it's like watch it because a decision made on reviews here is wasted.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 December 2020,10/10,"Great film, fantastic cast, amazing script, great editing"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 December 2020,6/10,"It's good if you haven't seen a court movie before. Otherwise the typical goosebump hunting, high five in the end movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 April 2021,8/10,One of my favorite movies of 2020 it's a part of history and shows the injustice in court. Sacha's act was amazing definitely deserves the Oscar win.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 October 2020,1/10,"Hollywood does a great job in romanticisng these movements and events, while completely rewriting history. I bet in 30 years from now, all ridiculous ""peaceful protest"" will be shown as fluffy flowery times by Hollywood. Soviet Union was efficient at these tactics too, so nothing new."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"Emotional, controversial, unjust, to sum it up the '60s in the Us.
For me, the best movie of 2020.
Please, watch it!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,9/10,"Exciting, humorous, an excellent cast that keeps your eyes on the screen - this is what a great movie should be about. The kind of movie which you rewind not for it's special effects, but because of it's dramaturgy, tension and interactions. Not to mention, it tells much about the historical aspects of a country which cannot be well undertood without all these historical/sociological references. Absolutely brilliant, a surprisingly well made quality movie. More like this, please!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,5/10,"While the film is well paced, tightly scripted and well acted, it strikes me as funny that a film that seems to be made in the light of the events of 2020, has no actual substance in terms of social injustice. Bobby Seale disappears after his friend is killed by police. Never to be seen again, simply a plot device for the seven white men on trial. by the way, the real version of Sacha Baron Cohen's character was in his early thirties during this trial. Cohen is close to fifty and you can tell the whole time. anyway, continuing, every single woman in the film was either a useless body there to pad the scene (Dellingers wife), a victim of men, or a manipulative consort. the film has a scene where the secretary gets a call and a guy is harassing her, the tone of which being ""oh even she's a target because she's a woman, oh the other side is so evil"" and then the only time she's mentioned again is when Mark Ryland's turns around and gives her an order. so, yes, it's a fine movie and will probably be nominated for Oscars because this is the kind of oatmeal movie they want you to watch. but it's pretty goddamn hamfisted, probably the worst possible version of a Sorkin movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"I hope judge Hoffman, if the real one was anything like this one in the movie, died a painfull and horrible death."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 February 2021,5/10,"Rewriting the trial and it's left wing characters into some sort of liberal propaganda film, including the cowardly option of using (deceased) Abbie Hoffman to spout Sorkin's centrist worldviews (literally speeches he never gave) in direct contrast to Hoffman's actual real world far left, anti-state/anarchist leanings - is an ethical disgrace. Despite its shocking rewriting of history, i have to give the movie 5 - it is super well made propaganda. Consider it fiction, and enjoy it more."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 October 2020,10/10,"An must watch before you die. The content is good the acting everything in this movie is worth watching, nice acting by Eddie Redmayne and sacha baron Cohen"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 November 2020,9/10,"Great acting, writing and directing. Highly recommend."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 April 2021,10/10,"I just don't have words to congrate enough all the production off this film! They clearly worked very hard to make it happen that way. Loved it! That's one of the reasons why I wanna graduate
in law."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 March 2021,8/10,"So tough to tell a true story and such a truly sad one.
A very real snapshot of American culture."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 August 2021,10/10,What an exciting and great movie! Must watch! It deserves at least 9 points of 10!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 October 2020,7/10,"Throughly enjoyably as someone from a different country, I'd like to say different time, but I'm not so sure. Jeremy Strong as Rubin actually stole the show for me, he needs to be given better roles, nice to see Sacha Baron Cohen showing his acting in a serious role as well"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,7/10,"Aaron Sorkin's #TheTrialOfTheChicago7 is very solid, but doesn't reach the creative heights of some of his earlier scripts like 'The Social Network'. That said, the performances by Sacha Baron Cohen & Jeremy Strong make the film well worth a look."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 October 2020,8/10,Aaron Sorkin's second feature gives us a spectacular film that is bound to be up for numerous awards. The movie starts slows but as it gains momentum the drama becomes more intriguing and exciting. Before going into a Sorkin movie you expect great dialogue but that does not make it any less impressive. The movie really shines when the trial is cut together with scenes from the streets of Chicago. The entire ensemble cast shines as more of their character is revealed as the story goes on. Overall the film packs the punch with political messaging needed in the divisive time of today. It is another great achievement for the esteemed writer.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 January 2021,7/10,"As a film, on its own, I'd say no better than a 7.5. I think this is largely due to the fact that it's a lot to fit into a movie. But having historically fact checked this movie, it's a mess!So much was made up or twisted, and it is also completely one sided against the police. Which is weird because it is entirely unnecessary. The movie would've been fine if they just stuck to the actual real life sensational story.I don't know why Hollywood always does this, it is truly annoying and misleading. So I dropped this film to a 5 (was honestly debating a 4, but just taking it as it is, it is still entertaining and interesting)."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,6/10,"1-Tom Hayden said he avoided the draft because of a high number. The draft lottery was in dec 1969 when Hayden was 30 and well beyond draft eligible age.
2-not one leftie was wearing wire rim glasses which was ""de rigueur"" for lefties in 1969.
3-scenes inside the ""conspiracy room"" should have been clouded by the putrid haze of cigarette smoke..again ""de rigueur "" for 1969
4-all photos of John Froines at the trial show him with a gentlemen's coiffure and 'satche, not the GEICO caveman look."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,I really enjoyed The Trial of the Chicago 7 but people are telling me I'm a bit simple for doing so... Many people think it's too 'light' but for me that lightness of tone makes it even more tragic. To think this is a real story and a lot of it happened exactly as portrayed and some of what happened was even worse. Personally I would have enjoyed it much less if it had been totally serious/heavy in tone. The whole trial was a farce and it was rightly depicted as one
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,8/10,Didn't know what to expect when I started this movie. Glad I didn't skip it. Captured my attention and it was very well done.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,10/10,"This is an extremely watchable courtroom, period drama with a jaw dropping back story attached.A stonkingly good cast. Wonderful character actors are: John Carroll Lynch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Michael Keaton.Splendid is Mark Rylance once again. In this, he plays defense lawyer, William Kunstler. See Rylance's acting brain going Tick. Tick. Tick., showing his character coming to terms and staying ahead of the rising challenges and irritations which materialised during the court proceedings. Rylance can do no wrong in reviewer's mind.Eddie Redmayne is Tom Hayden and he reveals, very well, a person at odds with himself. What is more important? The public persona? Or his compassion for people and social justice? Through Redmayne's performance we come to understand the man.We see a lively and a lesson in characterisation worn lightly once again by Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman), his is a great pairing with the eccentric and day dreaming, Jerry Ruben played by actor, Jeremy Strong.Reviewer could go on singing everyone's praises. No negatives, this Aaron Sorkin's film is just brilliant!for full review visit Not Compulsory blog"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 February 2021,9/10,This movie was absolutely fabulous! It inspired me to want to learn more about the politics during the the Vietnam war and the war itself. The acting was excellent. It was refreshing to see a movie of this caliber that wasn't so packed full of award winning actors. I would give this movie a 9.5 rating.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,,"This movies proves that the USA is one of the most disgusting places to live on the planet! If you think anything has changed with that garbage country since this happened, you're seriously delusional!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 January 2021,9/10,"I really loved the balance between the individual characters' levity, sense of self, and sense of humor, combined with the weight and danger of a very real threat to American democracy. Obviously echoes of today, I thought it cleverly shot and well-written."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 March 2021,8/10,Sacha Baron Cohen does a superb job encapsulating the subtle nuances of Abbie Hoffman. He was the perfect choice for this role. I have seen the other Chicago 7 films and this is by far the best one. I guess that's why it's getting all the awards. A must see!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,My criticism for this movie is that it's too short. I could easily have watched another hour of it but I guess I'm just gonna go and read all I can about the real events and learn more.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 November 2020,10/10,Baron Cohen is fantastic. This was very well done. A must watch.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,I feel like every beat of this movie was doing work. A fine film that will leave you wondering how our courts and justice system have become such circuses in so many instances.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 January 2021,9/10,"I have very little knowledge of American history but I am so pleased this film introduced me to the amazing Chicago 7. I literally was punching my fist in the air on a number of occasions. The film has inspired me to take part in the next uprising and rightly made me blood boil on a number of occasions.Fantastic story telling, a wonderful cast and I loved the used of archival footage.I expected that that the film wouldn't be 100% factually correct but I am disappointed that the ending was changed when the real ending sounded way better!!! What is that about? Hence I knocked off one star."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 March 2021,9/10,"Having no prior knowledge of this story I was not initially drawn to watching it when it first appeared on Netflix, but am so glad I decided to get stuck in. Of course it was great, just look at the pedigree of the cast. Top drawer writing and performances with a compelling and timely story. Terrific."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Thanks to Mr.Sorkin & Mr.Spielberg for bringing this story to the screen.I lived through this period of our history. Watching the nightly news for any mention of the trial/defendants. Reading the NYT & WAPO.The film brings back the raw emotions I felt as the trial unfolded. The outrage as Bobby Seale was bound and gagged , denied his right to counsel.Performances were exceptional. Frank Langella captured Mr.Magoo (Judge Hoffman) as I interpreted him at the time.Sasha Cohn brought Abby to life revealing him not as the comical lout I considered him at the time, but a genuine , thoughtful purposeful hero I never considered him to be.The ending has Mr. Sorkins signature stamp upon it. Like many ""West Wing"" moments I cried at the end."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 November 2020,9/10,Powerful and entertaining - a great watch and well above the usual Netflix film quality.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,10/10,This movie is a must see . When looking at the trailer for it I tried not to get too hyped up about it because Netflix has yet to have a decent original film . Normally their trailers make the film look amazing but when it comes to watching them they have all just seemed to fall flat in their face. But along came trial of the 7 and it was great from start to finish
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 April 2021,3/10,Couldn't finish this. Felt nothing for the defendants or the prosecution. Overall it was boring with little to Mai rain interest. Bored. Next.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 February 2021,10/10,"Fight the power.
Sorkin does it again. Watch. Learn"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,3/10,"A long winded tedious film that frankly would have been better if it wasn't so verbose, hard to follow, and poorly directed. It assumes that every viewer knows the background to the Chicago7(8)."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 February 2021,9/10,"I didn't know what to expect when I put this on. However, it was a brilliant depiction of the true story. Eddie redmayne and Sacha Baron-Cohen were amazing. Short review for a quality film. Watch it!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 March 2021,4/10,This movie is so boring it's more like a documentary they should have made a documentary instead of this boring nonesense.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 November 2020,10/10,"This film is amazing, it's the 60's, and truly reflects today. Im proud to say i worked with Lee Weiner, at the Anti Defamation League. He was unassuming and brilliant, what a pleasure. This film honestly shows you what the 60's were like,and also shows us all we haven't changed all that much. Certainly not the police, who are still mercilessly cutting a swath through society with no remorse."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 December 2020,10/10,"Beautifully told story of the Chicago 7 which should have been the Chicago 8. Great movie that shows the deep problems of racism and police brutality in the city of Chicago in the 1960's and in the US in general. The storyline keeps you engaged and makes you wonder how it's possible that this could have happened. And makes you question how it is that in this current time, of 2020, we are reliving some of the same injustices back then in 1968 and currently in 2020. The two events caused by political means and a clear disregard of the law and violation of people's constitution rights and also violations of their civil liberties. As a police officer for more than 20 years, I can tell you this storyline is well written and I find the story very moving and inspiring. I hope more movies of this type are made."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"Great storytelling that doesn't make you feel tired throughout the 2 hours. It talks about politics, but not in a very political way. It's funny, interesting and engaging. You won't regret watching it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,9/10,This is the real movie they show us what was going in usa please see this i think chicago is the best movie of 2020And reymond is greeeeeeeeaaaat
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 December 2020,9/10,"Never thought too much about Sasha Baron Cohen. But seen him in a new light after this film.
Highly recommended.
If it helps, I rarely write a review..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"A great movie that takes you back to the '60s of Chicago, where the attitude for people who are standing against the government is so terrible while the courts are treating black people like animals. The movie presents us with a trial of 8 people who protested against the war of Vietnam. The defendants of the trial were trying to terminate the US involvement in the war, while the country's representatives don't like that. The acting is very stunning and reliable. A movie worth watching altogether!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 January 2021,8/10,Good movie with fantastic actors... the ending had me bawling
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 January 2021,10/10,"I was already wating for great perfomances but I was surprised by a very interesting take on power and society. The trial of the Chicago 7 should make you rethink how you treat individuals that think differently than you, if it doesn't , watch it again. 2020 was definitely saved by this incredible story and directing. A must see movie for the audicence that loved OJ Simpson Vs. The People- American Crime Story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 March 2021,1/10,That was a very bad not even movie more like propaganda .well that side did win very true aka forfeiting ele ction . enjoy the living hell you made into ...
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 February 2021,8/10,"I hadn't heard of this story before. Solid movie, very entertaining."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 May 2021,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin's new Netflix movie 'The Trial of Chicago 7' is both written and directed by him which stars Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron-Cohen , Yahaya abdul mateen, Jeremy Strong, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Mark Strong in lead roles along with a special appearance of Michael Keaton. It tells the true story of the longest running trial during the 1970's when the Students Democratic Society and Black Panther party's members were being hold for trial because of their violent attack on the Chicago police in protest of the US martyrs of the Vietnam War. Aaron Sorkin has an interesting style of telling stories as his dialogues are so fast paced and articulate that it makes a topic which may not gravitate a lot of attention towards it but on seeing it makes the audience hooked to their seats till the very last end. If you like Aaron Sorkin's writing from 'The Social Network' and 'A Few Good Men' then this film is a treat to watch. Performances of the cast is incredible especially Eddie, Mark and Levitt steals the show. Go check it out on Netflix."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 August 2021,7/10,"I didn't know much about the trials or the events (being a foreign) but the movie delivered well to present the context briefly at the beginning and then jump straight into the trials. The main characters pulled a very neat performance and fun to watch. The narrative of the story remained consistent and even though the ending came abruptly, it still gave a good closure."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,8/10,"Entertaining, albeit in the typical relentlessly quippy Aron Sorkin fashion, the occasional light touches doesn't hinder from the movie delivering on the stakes and importance of the subject matter.Sacha Baron Cohen's accent can be jarring at first, but it takes a minute to get used to. The rest of the cast do an admirable job with Yahya Abdul Mateen being the standout (even in a somewhat limited role by design). The strong cameo performance near the tail end also boosts the performance pedigree.While surely the parallels and the timing of the release of this movie is not coincidental, it is a piece of art that does what good art often do, and that is to remind us of truths. In this case, the truth is, those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,Once again Aaron Sorkin blows it out of the park. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Great storytelling. Captivating. I'll definitely be watching it again.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,7/10,"I won't base my review on political beliefs. Despite it being overly left-leaning, I was entertained and Mark Rylance was fantastic. It's not historically accurate (but that won't stop most viewers from taking it as factual). I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle. It's worth a watch!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,9/10,Best movie this year by far! Great actiuni and a great history lesson.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,14 November 2020,10/10,"'Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains'. A compelling visual reality of power abuse and the struggle of 7 to undress it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 March 2021,6/10,"Even though the two hours went by quickly, I would have almost rather it been 6 hours to learn a bit more about the characters. I guess it is technically a made for tv movie, and it definately looked it. It was definately interesting and we'll acted for the most part. However, even though I love Sacha Baron Cohen, his accent was a little hard to understand, I know he was probably trying to go full Chicago accent, but the rest of the cast wasn't so it just sounded off to me. The ending was a little Hollywood cheese with the judge yelling ""order, order, order"" and losing it on the courtroom as the credits roll. Worth the watch nonetheless."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 January 2021,9/10,"I never heard about the trail, this is my first time.. the film are brilliant.. and must watch.."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 December 2020,10/10,"Sensational Film. Absolutely immersive.
Freaking loved it - The Wonderful acting of the ensemble and Top Tier Writing and Directing. God-fucking-damn, this is good."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,Base on true story. Educating young generation about American history. It is one of the movie that reveals the important story of the time.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 October 2020,6/10,"Keep in mind , who wrote and directed this movie, Aaron Sorkin. While a very good writer, his political leanings are extremely far left.So this is his interpretation of the events that happened during the trial.He tends to showcase those characters that share his feelings, as the hero.Take the meaning of this movie with a grain of salt."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,Razorblade dialogues and great acting form an intense but intimate setting for this brilliant movie. sidenote: its interesting to google each of the seven's individual stories after having seen the movie (not before foe obvious reasons). keep it coming Andy!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 October 2020,10/10,"Greatly enjoyed this movie! Start to finish! I dont have any criticism at all! This movie brought it all, even a wide array of emtions! Wow, would watch again!I dont post good reviews... dont normally need to. I do post bad ones often. Im not impressed by recent films often, in fact hardly ever. Yet, here we are..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 September 2021,10/10,Thank you for such an exquisite portrayal of my hero and role model.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 June 2021,9/10,I was pulled into this from start to finish. The extreme believability of this group of A listers made me feel as though I was there. One of the best films I've seen.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,8 November 2020,8/10,"What an amazing movie. Great acting and a great script. The ending of this movie is phenomenal! Just amazingly well crafted. The only small problem I have is that it was often a bit boring, but my age (14) could be the reason for that."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin presents probably the best courtroom drama of our time with a brilliant cast and fierce acting. Brilliantly executed, a perfect balance of comedy, excitement, drama, and content makes it one of the most wonderful movies of this year. I condemn the filmmakers for their ability to make a courtroom trial so exciting to watch and having so much relevance today. Sacha Baron Cohen, keep surprising us with your performances."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 October 2020,9/10,"I love this film and special actors
Eddy and sasha and yahya and mickel and josef is fucking good"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 May 2021,9/10,"As with all court based movies, one has to ask what is really being put on trial. This film is brilliant acted and written without being too contrived - as it based pretty closely on a true story. It really highlights the challenge of recent history - that change is often not welcome and yet so many (on both sides) want and need it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 June 2021,8/10,Interesting story and great acting. Moves quickly and keeps you interested.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 November 2020,9/10,"Going into this film pretty blind as to the events i can't confirm the accuarcy of the timeline of events as some people are faulting it for, it's a fantastic piece of cinemas. The pacing is just brilliant with the way it cuts back and forth. It's not a stretch of the imagination despite your political leanings to really believe the mistreatment the defendants suffered and can easily be applied to modern day situations. Both my partner and I had tears in our eyes by the end of it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 January 2021,8/10,"Sorkin writes and directs a riveting courtroom drama, deftly combining a deeply serious moment in history with wit, righteousness, and humor. Many viewers will be familiar with the unrest in Chicago in 1968 and the resulting trial, but I wasn't - so I was pretty much hanging on every twist and turn. Even if you do know the case, it is exciting to see it unfold. Everything is so stacked against the protagonists! They are underdogs being crushed in the vise of politics by those who care much more about power than they do about people. And given the disgraceful behavior of the judge (an excellent Langella), you can never be sure what will happen next. The biggest surprise for me was Jeremy Strong - he is outstanding as Kendall on HBO's ""Succession"" but I did not even recognize him as Jerry Rubin! He was so committed to the character - funny, sweet, and impassioned. All the performances were top notch (to be expected with such a stellar cast - including Rylance, Cohen, Gordon-Levitt, Redmayne, Keaton, and many more) I ended up wanting to know more about the historical figures portrayed in the movie - particularly Bobby Seale (a powerful Abdul-Mateen) who makes a great entrance in the story. Watching his struggle just to be treated with even the smallest amount of fairness makes your blood boil. But that's what Sorkin must have set out to do - make us feel the injustice. And he succeeds."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,3/10,"Sorry but this failed to engage me in most ways. It failed to excite, it fails to be dramatic. It is just a bunch of scenes playing out after each other. A lot of scenes border on comedy without being funny, I actually had to look up if it was meant to be a serious movie or not."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 January 2021,10/10,"Great casts, great story, cinema needs more of these kind of stories. Hopefully the movie wins Oscar for their great work"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 February 2021,8/10,"Good storytelling, great cast and acting. I wasn't bored for a minute. Bravo! One of the good ones at Netflix."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 February 2021,9/10,"This review is short and sweet:
Aaron Sorkin is the best at what he does, specifically the ability to write a script with such intimate dialogical ethos that without knowing who wrote a film, you would instantly be able to identify Sorkin as the writer. This generational talent, mixed with his honed directing skills and a superb cast make for one of the best movies of 2020 and I wouldn't be surprised to see many gold statues handed out for this one."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin does it again. A gripping, moving and brutal account of the trial of the Chicago seven. Some fantastic performances be Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Sacha Baron Cohen and Frank Langella. This movie deserved a cinema release."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,I did not know the material of this film and must say this movie was superb in its portrayal and what I understand to be it's accuracy
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 April 2021,9/10,The was a piece of political history that needed to be told. And it is SO relevant today. The actors we're excellent and the story was told with a maximum dose of reality. Very well done.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"I had never heard of the Chicago 7 trial before, but this was a brilliant movie, gripping and superb performances from all actors involved."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 March 2021,10/10,An absolute tour de force by the whole cast. Sorkin delivering via the script and behind the camera too. Even better than I could hoped. Thoroughly recommended.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,5/10,"It feels like this movie is trying to get across the idea of the of the American spirit being triumphant over injustice but in these times which seem worse than those times, it just depressing. Like American is doing worse than just treading water over the last 50 years."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,You can tell from the first few shots that this movie is incredibly made. The dialogue is fantastic! It takes time to make you understand the entire cast of defendants yet also leaves time to develop them each in important ways.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 May 2021,8/10,"What a great film, showing a groups fight against a huge miscarriage of justice in a courtroom where the outcome is politically driven by crooked politicians looking for anyone to blame but the guilty, specifically just those who fit their crooked narrative. It brings home just how important the right to protest is (Kill the Bill) reminded me of so many awful scenes of innocent protesters being attacked by shields and truncheons in protests around the world in the past year or so.This film may be a telling of a story from an era gone by but so many of the battles are still so relevant today from wasted life of fake wars to the racism & other prejudices of the court and prison system, the politics of protest and the repercussions of fighting for truth in a broken system.Perfect cast, serious and involving yet laugh out loud in several parts, my 3 loudest laughs in ages we're all in this one movie - I thought I'd enjoy it but didn't realise quite how much - a well crafted, dramatic, funny and very entertaining movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,"In a time of pushed fake political films and utterly unentertaining movies , this is a gold."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,10/10,"Being a Brit in my 30's, I wasn't aware of this U.S. trial from the late 60's and how big it was at the time - so the movie premise intrigued me from the start.The pacing and cinematography was perfect, the acting fantastic (particularly from SBC and Mark Rylance) and I was incredibly moved.I can't comment on it's accuracy to how events really went down, but it's still a must see movie for its powerful narrative. I'll certainly be going away and learning more about this important period of history."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 February 2021,10/10,"A great movie, very good writing, brilliant acting especially from Sacha, the movie was fast paced the story transitioned between different plot points very smoothly, and the story was told beautifully."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 July 2021,8/10,Highly rated courtroom drama. The whole movie is great but the last 10 mins of the movie are really awesome. As soon as Tom Hayden start reading the war heros list.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 November 2020,5/10,"Some great elements but had to switch it off halfway through. None of the conversations showed authenticity to me. Every line should have meaning in a film, but they don't all have to be oneliners and have such weight. Nobody talks like that and it's exhausting to watch. Loved Eddie Redmayne's performance. The ending...cringe. Haven't we seen this scene already in so many films? The crowd starts clapping, the prosecution stands up, music starts playing...Overall, glad they highlighted this story, but expectations were higher."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 October 2020,7/10,"An enjoyable and very timely treatment of the sequence of events, from the '68 Chicago convention protests through to the completion of the main trial, with the deft touch of Aaron Sorkin providing appropriate gravitas and depth. First-class performances, although at least two of the characters who I personally met in meetings decades ago, Ramsey Clark (I spent several days with him when he was a controversial trouble-shooting NYC international attorney in 1990) and Jerry Rubin (in a small informal campus discussion group, as a protest leader in 1970), in no way resembled the actors who play them in the film, Michael Keaton and Jeremy Strong respectively. It's quite a switch seeing Strong, well-deserved Emmy winner as the emotionally unstable media executive Kendall Roy in Succession, playing a Yippie leader, but hey Jerry Rubin became a successful stockbroker later on in life which makes the link between the roles credible!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 April 2021,9/10,"I was not aware of this Chicago trial incident. I am not an American. I am from India. Yet I found this film right from the beginning till the end, very gripping. The back ground score is the real soul of this film. The closing scene is just mind blowing.All the credits go to the Director."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,9/10,"...that it is an absolutely amazing, incredible, fantastic movie with a touching and hopefull story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,There is no movie that deserves the academy award this year than The Trial Of The Chicago 7.2020 has been a dry slump for movies and the Chicago 7 has been a positive ray of hope.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"God bless their souls, a lot of people believe, demonstrated, fought, and changed!
Thank you for the great movie with the such sad, mind blowing facts about our history! But unfortunately corruption, manipulating and accusing still till this day!
God bless the United States of America ""We the people"""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"Now the only reason I first started watching this film was because of Keaton, and there really was nothing else to watch. But thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered this masterpiece.The writing for this film is superb, adapting the true story perfectly whilst also adding an element of fiction to the mix. All characters are also memorable and enjoyable to watch all thanks to the writing.All actors also give a great performance these include Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Michael Keaton and many, many more.Other good additions to this film are its cinematography, editing, pacing, solid tone and music.Finally I must compliment how fresh and unique the vision of Aaron Sorkin was while directing this movie, you can feel his passion and desire for the project and it's easily shown in the final product, and hopefully The Trial of the Chicago 7 can snatch a few awards because of how relevant and well made it is."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,10/10,Incredibly moving and seemingly more relevant now than ever
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,"What a great movie. I cried, I laughed, I learnt. Thank you."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 November 2020,9/10,"I was sold on the opening scene.Ahhhh murica... Has anything actually changed?The movie is good.
The acting is good.
The judge is evil.
Makes me want to join a revolution."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 November 2020,9/10,Sasha and JGL kill it in this limited series. I love shows covering history of the past most don't know about. Very informative . Highly recommend
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 December 2020,8/10,"Excellent movie. The performances, direction and script are magnificent"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 December 2020,8/10,"I fall in love with this movie. The work of Sorkin is extremely realistic, he & actors did a great job.
I was a lawyer & I also had to face such judges who thinks that in court they are like gods, they hear only the arguments they want, if something goes not like they imagined it during the process they simply play double standards and punish the man just for the need of a fair trial.
I'm glad such stories are made into movies so more people could see all the faces of the trials. It's very sad that after having so much precedents of injustice the world political society & officials often made the same mistakes & doesn't talk with their own people, doesn't know what people do need.
This movie, in particular, describe a story of people who where put in front of the court just because they wish peace, equality, a right to chose for everyone. Those men simply cared about their folks, they saw the damage that war brings to people & believe they should help stop the destruction and open the eyes of the majority on that vast of young people. The movie shows us that to be human isn't easy, & it requires a big effort, there is always a risk you won't be understood & you may lose a lot. But at the end is our duty to make a sacrifice not for us, but for the sake of future generations."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 April 2021,10/10,I have seen most of the nominated movies this year. This by far the best film. So many good performances and story.How Hillbilly Elegy wasn't nominated for best picture also is puzzling.Glenn Close gives a mic drop performance.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"This was a ridiculously good movie!! After watching movies such as Mulan, I was beginning to think that we were never going to be able to watch a good movie in 2020. How blessed we are to have The Trial of the Chicago 7 now. Not only was the script fantastic, but the storyline was written so well! Aaron Sorkin is a genius. Please watch this movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 December 2020,9/10,If there is 1 movie in 2020 which will win Best Film Oscar (hoping there will be Oscars in 2021) then this is the ONE!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 March 2021,10/10,"This great movie was not just about the mistreatment of the defendants or their story,it highlighted the disgrace ""legal"" system in the States. A country that tries to pride itself on its fair treatment of its citizens.Which turns out to be a joke."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"Wanted to see if my memories matched what really happened. And they did! The acting, the writing, the visceral affects on my body, the hatred for the police and The Daly Machine in Chicago at that time was all there. They all came flooding back.... These nasty attitudes eventually drove me to move to Colorado... boring as that was in comparison.I cried when Tom Hayden stood and started reading the names of those who had died in the (undeclared) war during the trial. I noticed the one reference to the cast standing to the names being read... but I also remember that was a nightly thing at our dinner tables, ad nauseum. We are all so conditioned to these kinds of scenes now and protected from having to see them by our addiction to our cell phones....And cheered with the audience as each stood up in solidarity with the defendants. Was not surprised to see those who got up and left... I'm grateful for the closing credits to see the outcome of the rest of the participants. Sad to see the outcome of Ruben' s death and Hoffman's suicide, however. But happy that the Judge got his in the end! Tom Hayden success we all have heard of.Most wonderful and informative movie!! Hope it wins BIG TIME!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,9/10,"This one really draws you in. Keeps you thinking and emotionally engaged throughout the entire film. Great plot, relevant and terrific acting. Nuff said. Watch it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,He's the best living American screenwriter. What a phenomenal performance from Sasha Baron Cohen & Eddie Redmayne. Brava!!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"Give me a moment friend.... I've never been on trial for my thoughts beforeSic. 1984 , animal farmSo many high brow actors from television and tv, in a classy court room drama tget, regardless of your nationality or politics, is well worth two hours of your time"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,""" I have never been on trial for my thoughts"", this one line sums it up about the whole movie. Watch the movie, not only for 5 reasons given by Yayha Abdul Mateen, but the writing, the thoughts, and deliverance. When I decided to watch this movie, it was only for the reason of Aaron Sorkin and star cast and with very limited knowledge of the events which took place in 1968 in chicago. However, with in first 30 minutes of 2 hours, it took me back to days when a one minute long monologue of Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" gave goosebumps to an adult of 18 years of age who was not very fluent in english and not very familiar with american judicial system or revelation in "" Charlie Wilson's War"" , which was an another vantage point of looking at geo-politics happening in my country and region.The Trial of Chicago 7 may not have a room to depict drama as seen in previous work of Aaron Sorkins, however in 2 hours and 9 minutes, Aaron and cast of the movie has depicted whatever they could. The script not only provided a dimension to the trial, but the struggles of the main 7 character and the bianess they encountered from the Judicial System.The Court Room thriller, which also based on real event has become alive with this movie and surely will take back you to the days of ""Primal Fear"", ""12 Angry Men"", "" Philadelphia"", "" A Few Good Men"" , in which words, thoughts, and real human expression influenced an individual's thinking process.The entire cast of the movie has performed their best and Aaron Sorkins in his second direction venture has given a classic. The movie which for first few minutes appeared to be political satire eventually turned out to be a great political case, as told by Sacha Baron Cohen."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"Best film I've watched for a long time. Massive performances from Rylance, Redmayne and Baron Cohen!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,8/10,"The movie is about the trial begun for 7 accused for inciting the violence in a otherwise peaceful protests organised by the different youth leaders with different mindsets and way to deal with situations but protesting against the same decision of government for sending the US troops mostly young soldiers with less experience and no preparation which resulted in the death of these soldiers and grief for their family and friends. In the movie it's been depicted that the trial was politically motivated and jury was also tempered for reaching a prerecorded conviction. Movie has also shown the discrimination against the blacks in the court room except the fact that a big majority of people were still against this racism approach and they were not ready to accept that. An attorney general statement have also been not taken in front of jury as it would have been diverted the whole case in favour of the defendant, judge was already running on the guidelines sent by their akas. Movie is full of debate and you will get to learn lot from it. It is worth watching the movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 November 2020,10/10,"Pure cinematography! It needs/deserves the Oscar! A movie to watch. Good, smart humor here and there. It has all the ingredients of a good movie!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 November 2020,1/10,"The film is in the spirit of today, when the mainstream liberal media glorifies the left-wing cultural revolution carried out by BLM and antifa. Any sympathy for terror and chaos is mindless."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 October 2020,7/10,"A must see when it comes to historical movies, to human rights watch, understanding USA and our present.
It is very important at these dark times we are living, films like these be done and be success. And would like to link it to TV series like ""7 seconds"", ""How they see us"", to learn about 'justice' system.
I also liked very much everybody's and specially Mark Rylance's work."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 April 2021,8/10,"Nowadays, the story this film told is more important than ever: the importance of activism, taking the streets and protest against what we considere is wrong. And the police brutality, that often is display with no punishment. Because the essence of the government, of the state, is that they have the monopoly of the force: and what we have left as citizens?I found the acting on point: every scene I feel my stomach hurting, the tears streaming down my face. It's a movie that holds you and not let you go, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I'm Mexican, so I didn't have any idea about the Chicago riots, and it's surrealistic. I mean, it happen like 50 years ago. And it's so unbelievable how the things doesn't change that much."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 April 2021,9/10,"Combination of superb actors and fine director makes this movie the best movie of 2020.Respect to Jeremy ,Sacha and eddy."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,8/10,"A starstruck movie with actors really playing their rolls well, showing a not so good side of the USA"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"A much needed cinema for the current turmoil USA is facing. Regardless of the outcome, please remember ""the whole world is watching"" your actions will determine everything."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,6/10,"Do yourself a favor and watch this one. It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's surely a story you've never heard if you're on the younger side of the age spectrum. Aaron Sorkin once again proves he should stick to screenwriting, but his direction isn't necessarily bad per se. And as for the screenwriting, once again, it isn't Sorkin's best, but a decent Sorkin script is still miles ahead of lots of his competition. Frank Langella portrays a reprehensible judge presiding over this case; a performance that screams Oscar nominee. In my opinion, he is easily the standout. Through his performance he embodies the very complaints the defendants were fighting against.With this said, I think this movie falls into the same trap many socially conscious movies of the 21st century fall into- one-sidedness. The film portrayed The Seven as though they were only fighting for those lives so unnecessarily lost in Vietnam; but to me that idea is so laughable. Like so many ""revolutionaries"" in America at this tome, I believe these men cared more for their roles as 'leaders,' 'figureheads,' and whatnot rather than the cause they were actually fighting for. That complex isn't explored in this movie whatsoever.All in all, this is a good movie to watch but isn't necessarily reinventing anything. Watch it if you want to see a dramatic courtroom drama with fun characters and a cool story."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,10/10,"Loved the story telling, sharp edits and the way the whole movie comes together. This is a movie based on historic events and as the movie progresses, one is able to feel and understand the emotions that the participants of this historic event went through. All performances are great, and the movie is well paced."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"It's a brilliant movie with some excellent acting and a perfectly chosen cast .
The movie starts a little confusing unless you know a lot about the US political system
but then after around 10 minutes you start to get a grasp on what the movie and storyline is really about, And then your hooked for the next 2 hours,
I found it an enjoyable and very enlightening watch and I advise you all to give it a view and I feel confident you won't be disappointed 😉"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 August 2021,7/10,"I really enjoyed learning more about some history that i never dived into before. As I was watching it and the movie was close to the end I was hoping for something cheerful or something depressing but the ending when tom Hayden started reading the list of fallen men, and the music started to swell. It sounded cheesy making what was a great movie a little worse."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,10/10,"Just great movie. It has it all. I love it. The actrors , filmography soundtrack. All"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2020,6/10,"Goob, but not excelent! There is a lot of clichês of basic Hollywood cinema."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,5 March 2021,10/10,"Breathtaking, amazing, and wow.We are in 2021 and we still don't have this much of legal rights..."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,5/10,I'm a huge Sorkin fan but his scripts are cookie cutter. Characters all say witty lines and act self righteous. I caught him repeating script lines from his previous shows/movies. He always throws in dialogue about miscommunication related to names.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,One the best court room dramas to be made. The ending was excellently emotional and gave the idea of revolution through peace.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"Inspiradora, aterradora. Lo que el poder en el poder es capaz de hacer. No dejen de verla. THE WORLD IS WATCHING"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,8/10,"Aaron Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters working on Hollywood at the moment, and recently he started to also direct movies, this being his second feature. And one of his finest works if we include his screenplays.It's not perfect. It's really cliche, and the decision to focus on multiple characters on the Trial instead of the two that actually have arcs makes for a story not as effective.That been said, Sorkin screenplay, while not as effective as it has been in other movies like The Social Network, still is great to hear. He's very Sheaksperean in that he doesn't write as ordinary people talk. Still, he writes excellent sentences that in the mouth of the right actors, really stick with you.And what a cast! While some were better than others, there isn't a weak link in this cast. Special attention to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, his performance and lines really make Bob Sealle the most memorable character of the movie. Suppose anyone is going to be nominated for an oscar (something Netflix will definitely push for). In that case, I hope it will be him.Courtroom dramas can be boring thanks to the lack of variety in scenery. Without the right direction, even the best-written courtrooms dramas feel as dull as actual trials. And the direction here is simple, letting other professionals do their job, but still practical and that leads to the two best things in this movie: the editing and the music.Daniel Pemberton score is not as catchy and fun like his best work (Spider-Verse) but still has some headbangers. And combined to the beautiful editing of Alan Baumgarten, it produces some of the most memorable moments in the film.Is ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" cliche? Yes. But these cliches are made fresh with a great script, a strong cast, slight direction and outstanding score and editing. Check this one out!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 November 2020,10/10,"Legality isn't indication of morality. Great movie that shows how authorities try to blemish anyone that they deem to be ""enemy""."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,8/10,"This movie wakes up emotions. Tense, keeps attention. However, I feel that the whole story was not told."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,One of the better movies if not the best of the year. Well acted never dull and very topical. Highly recommend.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"If it wasn't for this movie, I wouldn't have known this part of the history of Chicago. I really enjoyed watching it and I will definitely watch it again."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,Revolutionary and bold. A great watch with a great message.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"The moment when Tom Hayden stands up in the court-room and begins reading from the list of names in his hands - that moment made me want either a time machine, or for all of us to step into the street tomorrow and begin reading our lists of the atrocities our current administration has inflicted, and is inflicting on the America people, and many other people at this ugly time.
I know my longing for those kinds of actions will be unmet. We are all far too occupied nattering around on social media and keeping ourselves busy, busy, busy. I also know that the Chicago 7 would not have had their moments of power without all the women who staffed radical offices, answered the phones, made copies, filed, and and and. The movie portrayed that injustice accurately.
Before you write, ""Okay, Boomer,"" know that I'm too old to be a Boomer. I'm a furious and heart-broken old woman."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,28 October 2020,10/10,Great Movie that captures the feeling of that era perfectly. It is moving and makes you draw paralles to the present as well. Big compliment to Aaron Sorkin and all the actors for making a Great and important movie that draws you in from the beginning to the end.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,10/10,"There have been cases in human history where we have shown how magnificent we are .
At the same time as always there are these others creatures, but they are irrelevant .
One thing I can't understand, how after such events and testimonies of human greatness we still divide on black and whites.
If this event failed to reconcile us I belive this film will ."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,9/10,"Aaron Sorkin vuelve a hacerlo con unos diálogos intensos y con un reparto asombroso de los que se destacan Langella y Rylance. Sacha pone su punto dramatico y cómico y lo equilibra perfectamente para un excelente personaje. La película es tensa, divertida, a veces tintes de comedia que hacen de esta un retrato ficticio majistral de un hecho real que no marcó solo a EE,UU si no que fué referencia en el mundo entero.
No es un 10 por que encuantro unos problemitas en la narración en cuanto a dirección que hacen ver que Sorkin es mejor guionista que director, 9/10."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 October 2020,10/10,Epic 2 hours of a courtroom over a period of months.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,30 October 2020,10/10,"This is by far the most compelling, moving and powerful films to be released in recent years.
It felt like an honour to watch this true story depicted by actors who smashed their roles."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 November 2020,,"The Trial of the Chicago 7, extends the red CSI string between the very real threats to our constitutional rights perpetrated by the president and his attorney general in 1968 to the current criminality of Trump and Bill Barr.
Unmentioned, but very present, is the one degree of separation between J. Edgar Hoover's FBI with its secret police thuggery and Trump - namely, Roy Cohn. Mr Cohn, personal friend of Hoover, lawyer for notorious Communist persecutor, Joe McCarthy and later, mentor to young Donald Trump.
Amazing what corruption crawls out when you start turning over rocks."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,15 November 2020,8/10,"This movie came to save the cinema this irregular year. The impeccable performances of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and without leaving aside, what in my opinion is the best performance of Sacha Baron Cohen made this film feel like it was not really a movie, it literally transports you in real time to the scene of the events and the trial; It's been a long time since my skin crawled with a movie and this movie without being overly pretentious and with an incredible development has managed to keep my hope to keep waiting for movies like this in the days to come. Thanks Aaron Sorkin"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 January 2021,8/10,"As a dramatisation of real events that can draw parallels to the current social (and political) unrest in the US, the Trial of the Chicago Seven is a carefully-written movie with a stellar cast who is able to well express Sorkin's own screenplay. While not being a documentary and rearranging timelines and events to support its narrative, the movie still sheds light on a period where protests (and the subsequent lawsuits and prosecutions) were common and transcended state borders. The film touches on subjects that are still very much present in current times: freedom of speech, political power, internal divisions, racism, prejudice and the evergoing fight between the establishment and youngsters who want to change the status quo.
The story presents multiple conflicts and connections, but also eloquent speech of charismatic characters.Sorkin's writing is pungently expressed by Baron Cohen's interpretation and the political battles depicted on the screen are underlie the relationships of the multiple factions in the trial; lawyers, defendants, judges and the audience.As a legal drama, the focus is often on the power relationship intercurring among the protagonists and it does a good job at characterising most of them as self-standing individuals and potentially achieves its goal of pushing the audience to investigate the period and renovate its polital fervour."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,10 November 2020,7/10,"Interesting, not incredible but not bad, enjoyed the majority of the storyline"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 November 2020,10/10,It is amazing touching movie .i adore the last scene .it was amazing .iam sure if there is oscar ceremony this year there will be alot of nominations for them.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 November 2020,10/10,What a great Movie! I was caught by it from the first second! I didn't know anything about the story and what was going on in Chicago by that time but now I really wanna find out more about it.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 January 2021,10/10,Watch it now it's really good and have fun my friend
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 March 2021,8/10,Well done recount of the Chicago 7 story! Would watch again.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,7 January 2021,9/10,"Looking for an intelligent, moving drama? This is worth the watch!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 January 2021,9/10,"Easy. A real story of a trial in the US on the end of the 60' during the Vietnam war. Well directed, funny, great actors, easy to follow and a great finale. Must watch"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,3 February 2021,10/10,"Farmer's protest in India has been going on for the last two months. Lakhs of farmers are protesting for the last 2 months in 1 degree celsius peacefully, but suddenly there was violence on 26th jan in the red fort of India. The entire government machinery and mainstream media started projecting these protesters as terrorists although 95 percent of the protest was peaceful. The perpetrators of violence who are captured in camera, have photos with the PM, HM and other members of the ruling party. Surprisingly(or not so surprisingly) the person who is captured in the photo has no FIR against him, but protesters who were never in the region of violence are booked and jailed without transparency. Barbed wires are installed to remove access to the protest sites and internet is completely shut off."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,27 March 2021,10/10,"Being a non-American and unfamiliar with the Vietnamese War and it's consequences on American lives, yet this movie was so splendid and remarkable. The actors and their performances made this way more than a courtroom drama. And the ending can melt even the most unbreakable hearts. Simply BEAUTIFUL."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 March 2021,10/10,"I'm from Ukraine. I watched this film because I'm just interested in the history of my world, no matter if it isn't about my country. Firstly, I was confused because of the big amount of different names and characters. Then after the first 30 minutes, I started to realize what happens. I was shocked after some scenes of the film. They're not scary or disgusting, they just make you think about our world. I stopped the film several times, because the actors, their speeches bothered me. The last scene was the hardest for me. You realized what the war is and this makes you cry. There are not many films with such an effect, so I recommend everyone to watch them."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 April 2021,9/10,"The trial of Chicago 7 is a historical-drama, that talks about 7 protestors against the Vietnam War, more precisely the trial towards them, when they were accused of conspiracy and incinting the riots. A spectacular cast and a splendid screenplay. The rhythm never decreases and the story never bores you, it keeps you glued to the screen. At first I was a little hesitant because it's based on a true story, but I was pleasantly surprised by how Sorkin managed the scenes and how beautifully they were written. Other than being a really good film it makes you think, the unfairness that is portrayed is still present today, no matter how many years have passed (1968-2021). A thing that I really liked about this film is how they make you live the trial with all the characters and how they make you feel, mostly upset for all the injustice but it also makes you laugh. I really recommend it, it makes you aware of a trial that you may not know ( or you know but not in a specific way) and it's very enjoyable."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,1 May 2021,9/10,"Moving dramatization of the 1968 Chicago riots at the Democratic Convention. Love the editing to flashbacks referring to the part in the trial. I now understand what really happened as was not fairly reported in the news at the time. I was 12 yrs old at the time and was under the impression that the rioters were the instigators and as usual the ""the establishment"" were the culprits making themselves the victim. Still happening today the protesters are made out to be the bad guys. Tom Hayes one of the defendants became a California congressman and worked trying to fix the system.But watch the movie and come to your own conclusions...have we changed much since?"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,2 July 2021,10/10,Guys watch this movie I was literally glued to the edge of my seat.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 May 2021,,20 minutes in i realized this was a 2+ hour courtroom drama and groaned out loud. Why didn't anyone warn me the trial of the chicago 7 was about a trial.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 May 2021,9/10,"This type of film with light humor, realistic touch of history social politics as well as humanities is my all time favorite type. The story was played out well, gradually exposing more of each character and imposed with occasional yet smart humors. Also had some shouts on unfair treatments on court and during parade. A timely topic to infuse discussion on police violence, political scheme etc."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,9/10,"The writing is masterful. The way the story unfolds takes the viewer on a journey that is riveting at every step. This is notable as a large portion of the film takes place in a courtroom. The performances are brilliant with special accolades to Sacha Baron Cohen and Yaya Abdul-Mateen II. I was riveted throughout and it left me wanting more. I almost wish this had been developed as a limited series to allow for time to delve more deeply into each of these individuals stories, but it is a brilliant movie as it is."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,9/10,"Excellent cast, brilliant story and Frank Langela what a turn.Scary that this happened in 1968 but could still probably happen now. Justice, but not necessarily for all"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 April 2021,9/10,"A great nail biter, cleverly done and with comedy. Excellent leads by 3 English actors plus many others. The story is great because the real life tale is little known outside of the US and as it unfolds you can't help but ask is this really true..? But it sticks to the facts and delivers one of the most engaging movies I've seen in a long while. A high 9 rating from me. I think this ranks with 12 Angry Men and Shawshank."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 September 2021,10/10,"I had chills down my spine watching this movie, only Sorkin can write and direct this kind of drama!This is specially impressive considering I am not an American or know much about its history."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 January 2021,6/10,A great movie that tells the story of 2 oppositions in the US. A side of history that is mostly unknown to people is shown in engaging and exciting manner.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 October 2020,10/10,One of the best courtroom dramas I have see. Great cast too. I have nothing to add without giving spoilers. You need to watch it.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 December 2020,10/10,Human laws are faulty at best for the sole reason they are made by humans!!!Nothing stands above the laws of God.Sasha Boren stole the show from his first presence on screen.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 April 2021,8/10,"I would recommend you to watch first the movie called ""Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)"" because is a complementary movie that will help you to understand better the Black Panthers mentioned in this movie."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 March 2021,10/10,Just Google 07 March 2021 Nea Smyrni cop beating civilian
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,6/10,"Good movie, but a bit one-sided.. It conveniently omitted the part where the anti-war protesters spit on the returning soldiers, calling them ""baby killers."" Let's not confuse them for ""patriots."""
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,4 October 2020,9/10,"I watched the movie yesterday in an open air cinema in Athens. I was amazed by this trial drama. Not knowing a lot about 68 in Chicago and the US it was a dense movie on the political volatility of values, society and lawmakers and judges. I reminds us all how important it is to have excellent and independent judges, lawmakers and courageous citizens to challenge the government"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,A must watch movie for all those who still consider America the land of opportunity and equality
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,21 November 2020,8/10,"I expected it to be a serious movie about political movement and trials at court, but after seeing the good reviews here, I gave it a try. I am Asian and did not know about this part of American history until I watched this movie. The movie turned out to be surprisingly entertaining as well! Some of the lines are so funny and witty. The judge is also such a character. Great acting as well! Certainly worth watching!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,6 February 2021,8/10,"Tough movie to get through without getting resentment to the American police force and justice system.Throughout the movie you are presented with injustice, abuse of power, racism and violence. Everything you want the world to be without is what this movie entails.After having watched the movie you'll be left with despair for justice and a sort of sad feeling. Differently not a feel good movie. On the other hand, the action is outstanding from every actor involved, the plot is intriguing and overall a great movie.Definitely a must-see-movie. Great job to Netflix and everyone involved."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,31 January 2021,8/10,Recommend to watch it and look over it in a broader global contexts.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,8/10,"The script is just marvelous. Even though I live nowhere near the United States, I felt the drama."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,24 December 2020,8/10,Not much to say except this: a hidden diamond in 2020.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,4/10,"I have seen The Social Network more times than you can imagine. I found the dialogues so amusing and did not want to miss any line or detail.
That being said, I was looking forward to this movie since I watched the trailer, but I found it very disappointing, and I doubt I'll ever watch it again.
It was too slow and lacked the gray areas of other Sorkin's films and characters, who you may like or dislike but at least you could still find sort of relatable in a way (like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men or the Winklevie in The Social Network). Here some characters were basically charicatures, although I still enjoyed Eddie Redmayne's and Michael Keaton's performances.
The final scene was almost like watching a 90's commedy (specially by the chosen song).
Frankly, as I read in some reviews, I believe the whole film might have turned better as a Mini Series."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,10/10,"Social injustices, dirty politicians, corrupt bureaucracy, and inequities. Sadly, the same mayhem exists today, some 40 years later.
Brilliant cast, and excellent screenplay. When at the end he was asked to keep his response short and he read all the names of the soldiers lost in vietnam, I stood, I clapped and I cried. Great acting and even better"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,This was a great movie. My man Aaron Sorkin crushes it yet again.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,5/10,"I have never really understood why filmmakers like Aaron Sorkin, who are so focused on dialogue, are making films and not theatre plays or radioplays instead.
This film is so pumped up with dialogue, that a blind man would be able to absorb nearly as much of the story as a man who is not blind. NOT very cinematic.
And this is exactly why european films are so much better than american ones these days. Because they are much more aware of how to visualize a story, and let the images tell the story and not the dialogue.
It is is also very exhausting to watch this film, because the tempo is the same all through, with no pauses in the dialogue. which is maybe the biggest problem; that there is no subtext occurring because of the constant rapid dialogue. And that makes it a very dull experience. everything is so spelled out that it leaves no room for the audience to participate. But I guess that's how american studios want it these days. Underestimating the audience."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,12 October 2020,10/10,I was pulled into this from start to finish. The extreme believability of this group of A listers made me feel as though I was there. One of the best films I've seen in my 68 years.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,9/10,"Well casted and the idea went through smoothly, specially at this time, right before an election. You can tell who are the good guys here even if their methods were not the right ones. But they got the point across.
Soooo Recommended!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,25 October 2020,6/10,I wanna hear the name of the vietnamese killed too.That was a dealbreaker for me. White guy dramatizes USA. More of the same. The scene when Bobby Seale speaks about how the fight from an intelectual mindset is different from a very physical one (ropes on a tree). Destroyed the whole point in watching the trial of the Yippies. Made it small.Also I wanna hear the names of the vietnamese men and women killed too.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,29 May 2021,7/10,"Not often do i write reviews, but this one got to me.The acting was FANTASTIC. The script, editing, costumes, decorations - all GREAT. Altogether its a solid interesting film. It is my favorite genre, too - films based on real stories. BUT! And its a big but. I am not american and i cannot bring myself to care about the events enough.I absolutely love that we have been seeing so many films about social injustice popping up recently, but this one did not make me care. Mostly because (even though throughout the movie they were saying that the whole world was watching) nobody outside the US really cared or cares about this trial.I am down to watch US-centric courtroom dramas, in fact, When They See Us and that series about OJ Simpson are gwo of my favorites. But come on, this ""Chicago 7"" thing just really isn't that remarkable for the world history. I am not even sure an average American would know who they were nowadays. But i would recommend it for anyone who is really-really into the US history.To sum this up, i still enjoyed the movie a lot for how it was made, so i give it a 6 + 1 more star solely to Sacha Baron Cohen."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"Very shocking film that shows how vulnerable western democracy is when the judiciary, executive and legislative branches are occupied by power-obsessed people. Fortunately, there are selfless people who manage to move the masses so that justice prevails. And this film shows this in an impressive way with a perfect cast."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,9/10,"It's been a very long time since a film brought out so many emotions in 2 hours. This is how a story like this should be told, bravo."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,26 November 2020,7/10,"It feels refreshing when such films are made, although they could be made better. In any case, the anticipated film is a great chance to go back and remember Jean-Luc Goddard's 'Vladimir et Rosa, inspired by the same events, as well as Woody Allen's satirical take 'Bananas', both made in 1971."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,Entire world should watch this! Had no expectations when i started to watch it and it really surprised me! Goes on my top 10 movies!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,11 November 2020,9/10,The music was annoying. It doesn't need to sound so sappy. I'm already getting all the emotion out of the scene without all these violins screaming.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 August 2021,10/10,"I will preface this by saying I'm a Brit born in the late 80s. I had never heard of the Chicago 7 nor the riots. I knew people protested the Vietnam war, and vaguely why.I watched this film because of the cast. I'm so glad I did. It was fascinating. Superbly acted, really compelling, and a well structured film. There was no lull or boring bit. I would have happily watched another 30 or 60 minutes if it.I'm now going to read around the subject more before re-watching. Fantastic film."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"I am not going to say anything, just watch it and you'll like it."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,19 October 2020,1/10,"Not a single conversation that felt authentic!
Last scene was super cringey with even the prosecutor standing up.... come on......"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,23 October 2020,10/10,"Loved it!
Thank you Aaron Sorkin for making this masterpiece, such great dialogues,
cast is great exceptionally consistent in their roles, acted well.If you want to have a great movie night in this delicate 2020, go for it. Won't regret it. Probably the best delivered in 2020 and surely deserve the academy award this year. Bravo Netflix!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,Before I watched this movie I didn't know anything about this topic but after finishing it I thought it was an excellent movie with amazing performances from all of the cast members and I definitely recommend.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,18 October 2020,10/10,"I was waiting for this movie for long time ago and I finally I watched.I really find acting perdormances amazing!! Top 4 actor for me Eddie Redmayne,Sacha baron cohen,Frank langella,Mark Rylance but Yahya and Joseph also good as well.My favorite one Eddie Redmayne.He has so cool and attractive performance in the movie as Tom hayden.At the final flash back scene he was amazing dialogue with Mark rylance.And also he was so good with sacha.Has great chemistry.This special note for myself.Eddie Redmayne's american accent It was Fantastic!! I want to say for sacha he surprised to me.He was seriously and also funny in role.All of the actors performances blow my mind 💓 I looking for oscar nominations 🌟🌟🌟🌟 The best movie of the year & the best acting performances of the year !!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 January 2021,9/10,"Superb actors in a fairly well-wrought courtroom drama. The script gets a little heavy handed from time to time, but overall the writing is okay. Given that the defendants in the trial were charged with inciting a riot, the film seems suddenly (January 2021) to be particularly pertinent."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,9 February 2021,10/10,So many parralels to the events we saw in 2020. I wondered if Aaron Sorkin made this film robe released around this time betting there would be some civil unrest and protests in 2020 with the culmination of the Presidential election. Just so relevant that it can't have been a total coincidence!
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,17 October 2020,10/10,"The movie was great. She doesn't really feel the time and has a funny gesture with Sasha Baron Cohen acting as Abbie Hoffman and also Eddie Redmayne. At first they both have their differences, however throughout the film they still put aside the differences to demonstrate their true intentions to demonstrate peacefully and express the reason for it. I liked the way his characters interacted."
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,22 October 2020,8/10,Everything about this was great except for 1 small flaw.....I love everything Sacha Baran Cohen is in..He's amazing! But he sounds like he is from Boston...not Chicago. I grew up in Chicago. No one sounds like that.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,20 October 2020,10/10,"Fantastic Art Direction, Performance.
It's 100% Oscar Movie!!!Cheers!!"
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,13 November 2020,7/10,This film is hidden gem on Netflix. Without big promotion it came to my attention and I was surprised how the plot enthrall me. The pace and the dense of dialogues are typical Sorkinian but in light version. What impressed me the most was Baron´s performance. He easily switches between drama tone and irony. The whole crew stick together well.
THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7,16 October 2020,10/10,"Amazing characterizing about every chicago 7. Brilliant using of cam language. This movie got huge historically educational meaning. So great to acknowledge this Vietnam war history. Must watch, especially in such a time when BLM going on nowadays. Stand we rise!"
