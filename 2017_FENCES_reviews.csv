FENCES,24 February 2017,,"Fences (2016) ** 1/2 (out of 4) The working-class Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) soon finds his little world crumbling down when his oldest son wants to play football. The father, for his own selfage reasons, refuses to let the son and this here opens up several other wounds.FENCES is based on the Broadway play and I must admit right up front that I really wanted to enjoy it more than I actually did. There are no questions that the film contains some great performances and there's also no question that there are some very dramatic and good scenes. With that said, I found there to be a lot of issues with Washington's direction and I honestly just didn't like the plays translation over to the big screen. The biggest issue I had with the picture is the fact that it looks rather lazy on the big screen and looks more like a play than a movie.I know some will say, ""well, it is play"". No, it is now a movie so it should look like one. With that said, I've heard several negative reviews talking about how the Washington character was just so mean, so unlikable and so obnoxious that you just couldn't enjoy the picture. All of that is certainly true about the character but at the same time I enjoy when movies try to tell the stories of unlikable people. This is certainly a very interesting character and I thought it should have worked much better than it did but as I said, the technical issues really kept the story from fully exploding.It's really too bad so many great performances are wasted. I really enjoyed Washington here who certainly got into every inch of this character. You could literally just see the actor floating from one scene to the next as he truly became this part and never once did you feel as if you were watching a performance but instead you were seeing a real person. Davis is also extremely good in her supporting part. The supporting cast is great as well as Jovan Adepo doing great work as the son, Stephen McKinley Henderson as the best friend and Mykelti Williamson as the retarded brother.FENCES runs way too long for what it is and, as I said, the play-like look on the big screen just didn't work for with. Still, the performances are great enough to where they can keep you entertained in what's going on."
FENCES,4 January 2019,4/10,"A good film it might be, but FENCES isn't for me. It's a 1950s-era family saga about the volatile relationship between man and boy; he's a failure for various reasons and he's determined to see his son turn out in his own image. The film not only stars Denzel Washington but was directed by him too, and he gives a very enthralling performance, supported well by Viola Davis. Sadly, what lets this down is a script; it's about everything and nothing, and it goes on and on an on hammering the same point home. The character vocabulary is limited, the characters themselves rather unlikeable, and it's one of those films where very little happens too."
FENCES,4 October 2017,7/10,"It's 1950s Pittsburgh. Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is a former pre-integration baseball player and a garbage man. He works with his best friend Jim Bono. Rose (Viola Davis) is his long suffering wife. He dominates his son Cory who is working to be a football player. He had purchased his home with disability money paid to his brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) who was injured in the war. His estranged son Lyons from a previous relationship often comes over to borrow money.These are two giants dialing their performances up to eleven. They stay there and don't allow for any gears to change. The setting is striped down which accentuates its play origins. A few tonal changes would help build the drama. Instead, they are just plowing through. It does have a great confrontational climax although the denouement should be shortened. This showcases great powerful actors but the story needs to have some differing tones."
FENCES,18 September 2017,6/10,"Because August Wilson wrote the play and screenplay, I figured this was going to be great. But it turned out to be an endless monologue of self pity. If the guy had a heart of gold or a modicum of concern for people, I may have gotten into this. I realize that Denzel Washington plays a character that has come up in the school of hard knocks and facing the evils of racism. But not only is he defeated, he openly tries to defeat everyone else in the film. Viola Davis is his long suffering wife. He's a guy that was a really good baseball player before the color barrier was broken. Maybe a star. But the times kept him from ever going anywhere. His brother is a war veteran who has suffered brain damage. He has a normal son with great athletic ability. His father betrays him when he is going to meet with recruiters which would lead to a college education. The movie looks like a stage production and Denzel delivers long speeches that he determines tell what the world is. In his eyes, it's not worth the effort. Disappointing after all the attention."
FENCES,18 February 2017,6/10,"Denzel Washington stars and directs the award winning play by August Wilson who died in 2005. Washington apart from the initial scenes has kept the film stage bound.Washington plays Troy, a working class refuse collector in 1950s America. His dreams of playing professional baseball were thwarted because of racism. He still holds the view that the white man holds the upper hand which would not be an uncommon belief in that time period.Troy can be charming, caustic as well as a braggart. He jokes and tells stories at the bar to his friends but we suspect he has told them many times before.His wife Rose (Viola Davis) usually intervenes before the tales gets too broad when he recounts them to his workmate and neighbour Mr Bono.We gather Troy was once a ladies man, he has a grown up son, Lyons from his first wife. A second son, Cory with Rose who he has been with for about 18 years. Regularly dropping in is Troy's brother Gabriel wounded in the head in the war.Initially we see the tension between Troy and musician son Lyons who shows up on payday for a loan from his dad. Troy is not happy that he refuses to get a job instead chasing a pipe dream of trying to become a musician.It is Rose who keeps the peace. We also see simmering tension that will progressively build up between Cory and Troy, as the father dashes his youngest son's dream of playing professional football. Troy wants him to get a trade.Cory has had enough of his father who he sees as a tyrant forever holding others back.Over time we find out first through Bono that Troy has been seeing another woman on the side. That Troy is a hypocrite.In due course he heads for a collision with Rose who desperately tries to keep her home and husband together.The film is an acting tour de force from Washington and Davis but it comes across too much as an overlong staged play.The confined stiff atmosphere ends up suffocating the film and the elements of the play get lost.The title 'Fences' has a subtext of building barriers whether it is physical or mental. The movie built a wall between the viewer and the screen."
FENCES,24 October 2017,9/10,"When Denzel and Viola were on Broadway in the successful revival of this August Wilson play, I would walk by the Cort theater as the show let out, wishing that I was a part of that very racially mixed audience. I was lucky enough to snag a playbill, but snagging an affordable ticket was impossible. I've stood in the back of the Cort theater for shows for standing room only, but that wasn't possible for this smash hit. In my many years of theater going, I've gotten to see one August Wilson play, ""The Piano Lesson"", learning about how the characters in all those plays were somehow connected, and that helped strike an interest in me to see all the others.Through lengthy conversations, the characters played by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis brought to the forefront every aspect of their personalities. Washington doesn't get much sympathy as the typical hard headed man of the house, objecting to his younger son's determination to get a sports scholarship (as he was considered too old when black men were finally able to join the professional leagues) and always harassing the older adult son over financial issues. His showier role however is upstaged by the subtlety of Viola Davis who quietly tries to guide him away from his stubborn ways while keeping their home happy. It's her steel magnolia that remains the heart and soul, while old fashioned macho pride threatens to vanquish everything she's managed to achieve. She remains a gentle and dignified soul, even when Washington drops a huge bombshell on her.Thought provoking and human, this is quite theatrical, an aspect that modern audiences might have a difficult time adapting to. Davis, who won a leading actress Tony, won the supporting actress Oscar, and it's very apparent that she should have been considered leading. I've seen some fine actresses in my time of all races, and Davis ranks near the top of the greatest. She's like a storm brewing inside, one that doesn't want to move up to hurricane level but eventually finds she has no choice. Davis allows herself to look undignified in one harsh moment where the young son must rush in to defend their mother, something I can totally identify with, bringing up long suppressed memories. This shows several variations of the human soul, some ugly and yet very human, and one gorgeous and heroic. It's the fences between the different levels of humanity that drives the idea home that it takes a special kind of heart to tear down those fences for good."
FENCES,28 February 2017,6/10,"In the 50's, in Pittsburgh, the bitter and proud fifty-three year-old garbageman Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) lives a simple life in a poor neighborhood with his wife Rose Maxson (Viola Davis), his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo), who is an amateur football player, and his brother Gabriel ""Gabe"" (Mykelti Williamson) that is an insane man after losing part of his skull in the war. His best friend is Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), who works with him, and his estranged thirty-four year-old son Lyons (Russell Hornsby) is married and tries to survive as a musician with financial difficulties. Troy is a frustrated man since he was too old to become a professional baseball player when the leagues began to admit black athletes. He refuses to receive the recruiter of a college and consequently does not allow Cory to join college. The tension increases in his family when he confesses to Rose that he has a mistress that is pregnant. Meanwhile he has been building a fence in the limits of his real estate.""Fences"" is a heavy drama in the 50's in a black community with a black family. The lead character Troy Maxson is not a bad man; actually he is a provider that delivers his paycheck to his wife. However, he is an illiterate man that treats his son the way he was treated in the past. He tries to protect him from the disappointments he had with sports and is unable to see that times are changing. But his attitudes build a fence between his family and he and Troy ends the story alone. The performances are top-notch and Viola Davis and Denzel Washington deserve the nominations to the Oscar. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Um Limite Entre Nós"" (""A Limit Between Us"")"
FENCES,13 August 2017,8/10,"The film takes place 1956-1957 in Pittsburgh. Troy (Denzel Washington) works as a garbage man. He harbors a certain bitterness of life. He is a black man in a white man's world, not seeing the changes since 1918. He was a successful ballplayer in the Negro Leagues, but was too old to play when the leagues were integrated. He likes to tell stories and has ""more stories than the devil has sinners"" and the stories grow with each re-telling. He has a wife Rose (Viola Davis) and a son Cory (Jovan Adepo) who lives in fear of his stern father.The movie is a long drama which doesn't have any real conflict until 75 minutes into the feature. We get to learn about Troy and take that walk in his shoes. In spite of all of his faults and failings, Troy believes in responsibility, perhaps more than love.It is an interesting look at life at that time when American race culture was making a slow change. This is far from an action film and may be too slow for those who don't want to see an emotional drama. Well acted.Guide: N-word. Sex talk. No swearing, sex, or nudity."
FENCES,15 February 2020,8/10,"When it comes to acting pieces (movies), this one can be seen as an example or how to or whatever you want to call it. Denzel is a powerhouse, but everyone else holds their own. This is really powerful stuff and every scene is mesmerizing and really holds a lot of tension. I do think that at places the pacing might be a bit off, but overall that is just nit picking.If you like dramas, this will do the trick. Also if you are into character pieces. Our main protagonist is flawed - actually that is an understatement. The fact that Denzel is playing him is quite the neat trick. You'll forgive him certain things .. it's Denzel after all right? But the character he's playing ... not an easy one to love. And yet he achieves that - it's Denzel after all (his wife is at least equally as good and as I said above, everyone acts their heart out)"
FENCES,26 January 2017,9/10,"Wow, Denzell Washington and Viola Davis are superb here, but if you think about it, Washington is playing two different characters in the movie. With his working stiff buddy Bono (Stephen Henderson) he's a brash and entertaining storyteller, regaling one and all with tales from his past that get rosier with each telling. I couldn't believe the way he dissed Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, stating that he was a better ball player than either of them. But because Troy Maxson (Washington) was a man who's time has passed him by, he takes out his frustrations on older son Lyons (Russell Hornsby), who he considers a slacker with a poor work ethic, and his teenage boy Cory (Jovan Adepo), who has dreams of his own to play football, earn a scholarship, and make a better life for himself.The killer scene occurs when Troy confronts wife Rose (Viola Davis) with the news that he's 'going to be a daddy'. Never have I seen an actor or actress turn on a dime so quickly, from a composed and motherly woman into one who's rage and emotion explodes so viscerally on screen. You watch Davis's face transform and it's a wonder to behold. Right there was where I became convinced she'll have an Oscar in waiting, so we'll just have to wait and see.At the time I saw this film I wasn't aware that the story was based on a stage play, which makes the picture more dialog driven than most. For me, that's just fine, as I like to see a story in which the players are given ample opportunity to develop their characters. In this one, Troy Maxson is a man you like and dislike at the same time, and an actor who can accomplish that is a rare commodity. This will be one movie to keep an eye on with the potential to upset the apple cart during the coming awards season."
FENCES,16 April 2017,10/10,"August Wilson was a renowned playwright whose works focused on the experiences of the African-American community throughout the twentieth century. His 1985 play ""Fences"" is about a garbage collector in 1950s Pittsburgh who struggles to cope with the changing world around him. Wilson wrote a screenplay but died before it got made into a movie. Well, Denzel Washington has brought ""Fences"" to the big screen.In addition to directing, Washington plays the main character, Troy. Troy is a working stiff who always has something to say. On the one hand, he tries to keep his marriage together, but he can't escape his past. Troy's wife Rose (Viola Davis) never misses a chance to have her say, especially when it comes to the future of their son.An important line is ""fences can keep people in or out"". The fence getting erected outside the house is an allegory for the emotional barrier that Troy has built between himself and his sons. Similarly, the fence reflects Rose's desire to keep the current family together.All in all, it's a fine piece of work. While mainly addressing the plight of African-Americans in the 1950s, the story could apply to just about any ethnic group. Viola Davis definitely deserved her Oscar for the role (she and Denzel Washington previously won Tonys for a stage production). Everyone should see it.Also starring Stephen Henderson, Russell Hornsby (Hank on ""Grimm"") and Mykelti Williamson (Bubba in ""Forrest Gump"")."
FENCES,18 February 2017,6/10,"I found about this film when it became part of Awards Season, the trailer for the film looked great, and I was most interested that the film was directed by leading actor Denzel Washington, based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by August Wilson, who completed a screenplay before his death in 2005. Basically set in 1950s Pittsburgh, working-class African-American Troy Maxson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) works as a waste collector to make a living, he lives with wife Rose Lee Maxson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Viola Davis) and son Cory (Jovan Adepo). Troy is adolescence ran away from home and committed robberies, he was sent to prison after killing a man during a robbery, when released he met best friend Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and developed a talent for baseball, he played for the professional Negro League, but was rejected for Major League Baseball because of his age, he is bitter and believes it was because he's black. Outside of work, Troy spends most of his time in the house trying to maintain a good life for his wife, he is visited occasionally by his estranged son Lyons (Russell Hornsby), born from his previous marriage, he only ever seems to visit to borrow money for an attempt at a music career. Troy's son Cory has dreams to join the college football team, but Troy is stern in his ways and dismisses his chances of making one day to the NFL (National Football League), this is both his lack of success in baseball, and he is concerned about his son facing racial discrimination. Troy is also often visited by his older brother Gabriel (Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson), who sustained a head injury in World War II that has left him mentally impaired, he and Rose often have to deal with people complaining about and tormenting Gabriel, and the advice that he should be institutionalised. Rose wants Troy to build a fence around their house, this becomes a slow process, Troy is emotionally damaged, struggling to cope with the past and trying to provide for his family, but Bono knows that he has a bigger secret that will change everything. Troy brings himself to tell Rose the truth, he reveals that he has been having an affair, and that his mistress is pregnant with his child, Rose is heartbroken, but he cannot escape his responsibility to the child, they become estranged in the following months. Troy continues to visit the mistress, who ultimately dies during childbirth, his baby daughter Raynell is brought home, Roses raises the child as her own, Troy is allowed to live in the house, but Rose will not accept him back into her life. The fence is slowly completed, Troy maintains a strained relationship with Lyons, but he gets into a big argument with Cory who gives up attending college, instead he joins the United States Marine Corps, Cory is driven out of the house, that night Troy is intoxicated and angrily rants at the Grim Reaper to come for him. Six years later, Troy has died from a heart attack, the family are preparing for his funeral, Cory returns home as a USMC corporal, but refuses to attend the funeral, he reconsiders talking to grown Raynell (Saniyya Sidney), Gabriel is released from hospital to attend, he prays to the sky above to open the gates for Troy, a shimmering sunlight glistens over them, a symbol of forgiveness and peace. Also starring Christopher Mele as Deputy Commissioner. Washington does a good job directing this essentially one location film, he gives a towering performance as the flawed yet sympathetic sanitation worker, Davis is compelling as his long-suffering wife, she gets so emotional that her nose gets really snotty, the other performances are all well done also, it is a marvellous script that compels you with its slow-burner story, it proves that you can be moved by the power of words, it is stagy, but a most watchable period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Adapted Screenplay. Good!"
FENCES,26 January 2017,7/10,"Fences was a successful play like August Wilson, and it is brought to the screen more or less intact, starring Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen Henderson, and Mykelti Williamson.The story concerns an emotionally damaged trash man, Troy (Washington) who tries to provide for his family, all the while sticking to ideas from the past that are restricting him and his family. In his world, the white man will always keep the black man down. He doesn't want his young son (Jovan Adepo) to play football and have a chance at a scholarship, nor is he interested in hearing his older son (Russell Hornsby), a musician, play. To him, working at the A&P is more valuable for your future.Troy's wife Rose (Viola Davis) doesn't agree with him about the kids, but she does seem to love him -- that is, until he makes an announcement. She then realizes that she sublimated her life and dreams to his and has come up empty.To say that the acting is powerful is a complete understatement. Both Davis and Washington are such powerful actors they blow you away.The problems with Fences are that the acting is better than the story, and the story wasn't adapted to the screen. Lots and lots of dialogue, some of which I was unable to get. Nevertheless, seeing these two titans was a valuable experience.I think we'll be hearing more from this film and its stars at Oscar time."
FENCES,26 December 2016,10/10,"What did it mean to be, in the 1950's, black and working class in America (and one should specify the North - the South was possibly a different story, though it's not to say one can tell right away Pittsburgh as being too different from a given city in the South, minus the snow)? There's so much history with any black working class person, and in the case of Troy, he's had a hard life with a lot of history. Or, that is, if one believes all the stories out of his mouth.Certainly one has to take him on his word when, during one of his rambles to his friend Bono (also to his older son who is there in the backyard where he does his yard work and talks his s***, usually with a bottle by his side), he tells about how he had to go off on his own when he was 14, fighting back against his father when he had enough of his beatings, and became a 'Man' by walking 200 miles to Mobile, Alabama (actually, then again, he did come from the South). The question then remains: does one excuse how horrible a person he can be, a right old bastard (literally and figuratively), to his younger son Cory and his wife Rose? Mmaybe excuse isn't even the point, and I think August Wilson wasn't out to necessarily judge his character, or any of the other characters who do put up with him because, hell, he's a charismatic guy. It's a portrait of a man in a time and place where a man was often expected to provide for the family, the mother/wife would stay home and care for the kids, and being black certainly was a major part of that life and worldview, though not the only part of it. Any one in working class America works this way, and I'm sure white people could be just as much drunk raconteur-filled womanizers with big personalities and big demands for their children (that is, this is MY house, you live under MY roof, eat MY food, etc etc).The extra component here, what makes it theatrical and so compelling, is Wilson adding this as a kind of 'Death of a Salesman' drama, this larger than life figure who had some ambition and drive early in life (in Troy's case he was a baseball player but started too late, for a number of reasons too much to get into here, more-so that you can find out yourself when you see the film), but took on a life as a father providing for a family and lost his self, and hey, who else to take it out on but the kids! I think that the major appeal of Fences, why it's such a massive piece of art on the human condition especially for Americans, is that it isn't only about the race of its characters. Of course it's there, it can't help but be there (this may have the most N words thrown about for a Christmas movie since... oh yeah last year was Hateful Eight, right). But the core of this man Troy, and what is there in Rose and Cory and even friend Bono, it's about what goes into being a person with compassion or morals or standards or much deeper questions like... what does it mean to live a good life? I might find the film fascinating on its own for those reasons - I haven't read the play so I take this as its own work - and yet I can't imagine who else could act in these roles. Seeing footage of James Earl Jones in the role of Troy in a clip from the 80's on stage is staggering but also a different tone - Washington is a looser Troy, at first a little closer to his character from Training Day: magnetic in personality, fun to be around... and also dangerous when you see that little glint in the eyes, that something else is 'off' here. There are other characters he deals with than his wife and sons, like his brother who has mental damage from the war (that's when his humanity, in its conflicted dimensions, shines through a lot). Here, Washington and Davis, especially Davis, bring these characters to complete life.You like performers and characters that grab you and won't let go (and this brought me to tears at least once, again I can't stress enough how Viola Davis runs away with this film from Washington - and consider that this is him delivering top, top career-level work, like Malcolm X level), then certainly this is for you. While the final minute of the film is a little hokey, it's a nitpick but worth mentioning, 99.5% of Fences actually elevates Miller's Death of a Salesman. Yes, I think Fences is a stronger, more tragic, more impactful depiction of the dashed hopes and dreams of the American working class than Arthur Miller if only because more of the characters are rounded, and the emotional stakes keep things raised to such a level of grand tragedy.You want to hate this guy Troy most times, but knowing where he comes from, what he became, is he worth the hate? What complexity comes from being a black garbageman (once baseball player) in Pittsburgh in the 1950s? Or is sons? Or beleaguered wife? I can't answer it more than anyone else, and I can't wait to go back to the film to see it asked more."
FENCES,24 January 2017,,"This film tells the story of an African American family, who lives in a relatively deprived neighbourhood. They work hard to make a living, and to make their lives work. However, every family faces their unique challenges and hardships, especially when things don't always go according to plan.""Fences"" is not just the object that the man of the house builds, but a metaphorical boundary between family members, between friends and between social classes. ""Fences"" tells a very touching story that viewers can relate to easily. Their problems are real problems that common people face, and I opine that people can connect to the characters easily as the eventful lives of the family is revealed. The wife, played by Viola Davis, gives another moving performance when she gives that heartfelt speech in the garden. Despite all the doom and gloom, the film give the feelings of desperation and hopelessness, as human virtues ultimately triumph."
FENCES,16 January 2018,8/10,"This is one of those don't miss flicks you hear about. Working as a trash collector in Pittsburgh in the late 1950's, Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is profoundly bitter about his station in life. He possessed the talent and aptitude to be a professional baseball player, but his dreams were shattered knowing no contract would be coming due to his age and the fact that major league baseball started admitting black athletes too late for him to take his swings for the fences. A mundane job with little chance for advancement and earning just enough to sustain a modest home for his long-suffering wife, Rose (Viola Davis); Troy is a conflicted man. And there is the shambled relationship with his estranged 17-year old son, Cory (Jovan Adepo). Troy is head strong in blocking Cory's opportunity to play college football. Not that misery loves company, but anger is easy to bestow on the one that follows. Fair of not, Maxson is hard headed in his belief that fences fence some folks in and other folks out. Prejudice and regret remains in the forefront. Washington and Davis are at the top of their game. Both characters are heartfelt and composed of reality. Rounding out the cast: Stephen Henderson, Saniyya Sidney, Mykelti Williamson and Russell Hornsby."
FENCES,3 January 2017,5/10,"Did someone say ""Last year's Oscars were too white"" ? Now that we're starting to hit awards season I'm starting to hear everyone in the media say this . I don't want to stir up any controversy , and I don't know about you but when I watch a movie I watch simply as a rabid cinephile . Three thousand eight hundred reviews on this site back up my credentials as someone who may actually watch too many movies . Likewise check out my review of SPOTLIGHT which I described as a weak contender for best picture and I was speaking as a hardcore anti-theist . I was disappointed as I was shocked when that movie beat THE REVENENT to the big prize . In other words I tend to leave politics , religion and other baggage at the cinema door and judge a film simply as a piece of stimulus . FENCES however gives me the impression it's going to be over awarded simply because some people think they'll be righting all the wrongs of the world by giving it prizes . Of course it won't affect my life one way or another but even so let's be honest and say this is a fairly tedious movie Let's have a look at the performances . I've seen such adjectives as ""Brilliant"" ""phenomenal"" ""great"" and every hyperbolic word you can think of . The truth is the performances are over-wrought , over-done and over melodramatic . Most people seem to think acting involves emoting an entire spectrum of mannerisms and gestures . I disagree . Great acting is subtlety where the actor becomes a character and even a small understated expression can convey a lot to an audience . I'm afraid I was constantly taken out of FENCES due to the actors being what can only be described as being ""too loud""FENCES is based on a play written by August Wilson . I'd never heard of either the play or the playwright who wrote it but within a couple of short minutes of the opening sequence I did realise I was watching something based on a source that belongs in another medium . The film itself is very static and talkative and never escapes its source which is probably down to director Denzil Washington . 12 ANGRY MEN is based on a play effectively filmed in one set but the drama involved there has an almost hypnotic effect over the audience . I did notice much of Wilson's dialogue has an existentialist element to it but all this gets drowned out in the performances and double negatives So a rather tedious film on the whole with the only real positives Marcelo Zarvos's score and Charlotte Bruus Christensen's muted cinematography . In fact the cinematography is the only thing in the movie that comes close to being muted"
FENCES,10 February 2017,10/10,"... what Robert Frost didn't add was good fences make GREAT movies. In three days this week I have watched Loving and Fences and in each case I was the only person in the auditorium. Okay, I watched both in the same Multiplex but it's still an indictment on the viewing public. Both films were outstanding - and I am white so I'm not supporting the Bros - and both deserve all the awards available, in fact if ever there was a case for 'joint' awards this is it. Denzil Washington has done a fine job of directing a truly brilliant cast which may or may not have been assembled by himself. Having starred in the play on Broadway with the beyond Outstanding Viola Davis both could arguably have phoned in their performances, instead they play the roles as if they're creating them in front of our eyes. There is no praise high enough for this truly brilliant film."
FENCES,14 August 2017,10/10,"Denzel Washington's devastating social commentary about growing up black in America during the 1940s and the 1950s in the movie ""Fences,"" based on August Wilson's award-winning Broadway play, is undeniably powerful stuff. Nevertheless, at the same time, the tragic saga about an embittered, blue-collar, Pittsburgh garbage collector searching for a better life is grueling from the get-go and doesn't let up until well over two hours have elapsed. Forget about any comic relief because there is none. It should be noted that Washington appeared in the 2010 revival of Wilson's play on Broadway, where it won several awards, but the cumulative effect of this drama is to leave you depressed. ""Fences"" channels the same sense of hopelessness as the memorable Arthur Miller play ""Death of a Salesman."" Mind you, Washington, who produced, directed, and rewrote parts of Wilson's play without credit, delivers a tour-de-force effort in each department, and the Oscar winning actor doesn't balk at showing the unsavory side of his lead character. There is nothing charming about the poor soul that he plays who is his own worst enemy. The theme of fathers and sons that runs through this awesome journey about an Alabama sharecropper who left Alabama after he had a fight with his abusive father and then fled north to find no better prospects is as insightful as it is disturbing. Washington displays unusual courage at showing warts and all in his character. He treats his own flesh with the same contempt and cunning that he handled his own father. Worse than this is his treatment of his steadfast, loving wife, played with dignity by Viola Davis, who took home a justly deserved Oscar. This is one of those movies with an ensemble cast, with Stephen Henderson and Mykelti Williamson shining in supporting roles as Washington's best friend and his war-wounded brother. As Troy Maxson, Washington laments the lack of opportunity that not only he suffered in American society but also the setbacks that African-Americans endured as they were breaking the color barrier during the racist post-World War II years. Wilson's material is so robust that Washington as a director doesn't have to concern himself with exterior peripheral details that show up in the form of anachronisms that filmmakers usually trip over when they plunge into the past to gain perspective on the future. Suffice to say, ""Fences"" is not the kind of movie that you watch to relieve your troubles after a long day. Unlike fantasy-based Hollywood movies that strive to eliminate every shred of reality from their narrative so audiences will emerge feeling better about themselves, ""Fences"" dares to be different with gusto. Washington's character will one that you will like initially until he peels back the layers of his breadwinner to show somebody that you'd never want to have anything to do with. You would cross the street so you wouldn't have to walk never him. The abuse with which he treats one son who merely wants a loan of ten dollars will leave you questioning your like for this charismatic actor. Nothing about ""Fences"" is lightweight. This is a heavyweight drama, and Washington proves that he is a consummate actor as well as a director to achieve this unforgettable, slice-of-life drama."
FENCES,13 May 2017,9/10,"Pittsburgh, mid-1950s. Troy Maxson is a sanitation worker, working a shift with his best friend Jim Bono. Troy has been happily married to Rose for 18 years and they have a teenage son, Cory. Regularly popping in and out of their lives is Gabe, Troy's brother who suffered brain damage while fighting the Japanese in WW2, and Lyons, Troy's 34-year old son from a previous relationship. Troy was a baseball star in the late-1930s, playing in the Negro League, and still bears a grudge for his not being able to play Major League Baseball. He projects this, and other experiences, onto everyone around him, particularly Cory, who has the potential to be a football star. More than just influencing Cory's career prospects (adversely, it appears), Troy has a larger-than- life impact on the lives of everyone around him.Wonderful, engaging film, directed by Denzel Washington. A character-driven drama with great depth, and some incredibly profound and emotional moments. Plot takes on several themes but in the end you are left with a great sense of family and how parents shape the lives of their children.Excellent performances all round. I can't think of a recent movie where I've seen so many outstanding performances in one film. Denzel Washington is great as Troy, dominating the screen and the dialogue. He's in just about every scene and probably ends up with more than 60% of the dialogue in the movie. However, despite Denzel Washington's larger-than-life presence, he is pipped in the performance stakes by Viola Davis. While Troy's character is pretty direct and uncomplicated, Rose's is much more nuanced, complex and evolving, and Viola Davis is brilliant as her. A powerful yet subtle performance and good enough to get Davis the 2017 Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Supporting cast are great too. The standout for me was Mykelti Williamson as the mentally-challenged Gabe. A difficult role, and one that can easily be botched, but Williamson does it very well, with a sensitive, convincing performance.Brilliant, and certainly better than Moonlight. It should have been a contest between Fences and La La Land for the 2017 Best Picture Oscar."
FENCES,3 January 2017,9/10,". . . she should be awarded yet another for her depiction of the long-suffering ""Rose Maxson"" in FENCES. She laughs, she cries, she also Speechifies, plus she dishes out the Silent Treatment: she's the glue that holds together a megalomaniac's family. FENCES director Denzel Washington, on the other hand, may merit his own Golden Statuette(s) for producing and directing FENCES, and maybe even a Tinseltown nod for portraying baseball wannabe ""Troy,"" but definitely NOT the Best Actor Oscar itself. Since Troy is so scary and mean, this role is just Denzel playing himself, and no one would have given the late John Wayne a Statuette for playing a Buffoonish Cowboy (UNLESS it was a Rigged Election!). For anyone interested in what Life was like for Garbagemen's Families in Pittsburgh during the 1950s, FENCES is the flick for you. It is NOT meant to be Realistic (as it has a character named ""Gabriel"" with a collection of trumpets to open Heaven's Gate). But at least it includes an ethnic alternative to Elvis' Dog Ditty, ""Ol' Shep."""
FENCES,2 January 2017,10/10,"FENCES (2016) **** Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby, Mykelti Williamson, Saniyya Sidney. Exceptionally well produced adaptation of the classic August Wilson play with career high turns by Washington (who also deftly directed) and Davis as a married couple in 1950s Pittsburgh at odds with the past and the present and a questionable future. Washington's Troy Maxson, a former baseball player who had talent but no chance for the big-time, struggles with his personal demons bubbling at the surface in every waking moment with regret, anger, and disbelief at what his life has been reduced to as a rubbish collector ; hard-bitten and rash. Davis is equally memorable as his long-suffering wife Rose who attempts to be the balm to the open wound that is her husband but often is at odds with her own existence as a woman who wants the best for them all including their athletic son, Cory (newcomer Adepo who acquits himself nicely) who is often the brunt of his father's disdain. One of the year's very best; poignant and real."
FENCES,31 December 2016,7/10,"Denzel Washington creates a very stage-bound film out of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Washington himself plays the lead, a middle-aged man who feels washed up and as a result acts the part of family tyrant to compensate for his feelings of male inadequacy. He blames his lot in life on whites and uses that same excuse to dampen his son's ambitions to go off to college on a football scholarship, claiming that the ""white man"" will never let him succeed. Meanwhile, his pragmatic wife, played marvelously by Viola Davis, keeps their home and family running as best she can.""Fences"" is nearly two and a half hours long, and I felt every minute of it. The acting is good, but Washington the director doesn't know how to open up a film and help it to transcend its stage origins. My other major problem is with the play itself. Washington's character has no dramatic arc, but he's the one who dominates the entire story. He ends in the same place he started, and instead the film is more about how his behavior impacts those around him. Thank goodness Davis is one of those characters, because she anchors the story and provides ballast to Washington's bluster. But two and a half hours is a LONG time to spend with such an overbearing, domineering character, and the fact that he doesn't grow much makes him not very interesting to boot.I also hated the cheesy, final scene.Grade: B+"
FENCES,14 May 2018,7/10,"Troy is a middle-aged garbage collector in 1950s Pittsburgh. Though he gets some enjoyment from life, he is rather bitter about his past, and brings that along into his relationship with his teenage son Cory, with wife Rose doing her best to mediate between them. Life isn't wonderful, but it could get worse... The story in this film is set up in the trailer, but there is a development at the two-thirds point which comes as a surprise, and which drives developments up to the end of the film.Having said that, the plot is secondary: this film is primarily a character study. As the film progresses, we learn how Troy became the man he is: cognisant of his responsibilities as a family man, loving, bullying, kind, controlling, narrow-minded and long-sighted - in short, full of the contradictions which make every one of us a human being.Denzel Washington, directing and starring in the film version of the play which he and co-star Viola Davis played successfully on Broadway, controls this film both behind and in front of the camera. It is a brilliant performance. By the time this film is finished, you love this man and despise him at the same time, attitudes which are shared by his son Cory.But every member of the cast is exemplary. Viola Davis deserved her Oscar nomination, but I greatly like Mykelti Williamson, playing a part which is some distance from his usual range.My sole reservation is that the film is somewhat depressing: despite his positive notes, Troy isn't a very likeable man, and he carries a great deal of not very likeable baggage with him. But that is not the point of this story, it IS this story. And it's a story which is worth seeing for the performances alone."
FENCES,22 December 2016,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Just about any use of words you can think of serves some part in this screen adaptation of renowned playwright August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize and multiple Tony award winning stage production. It first hit Broadway in 1987 with James Earl Jones and Mary Alice in the leads, and the 2010 revival starred Denzel Washington and Viola Davis – both who reprise their roles for the movie version. It's also the third directorial feature from Mr. Washington (The Great Debaters, Antwone Fisher).The story takes place in mid-1950's Pittsburgh and is a family drama character study centered on patriarch Troy Maxson (Washington), a former Negro League star and ex-con, who now works days on a garbage truck before coming home to his wife Rose of 18 years (Ms. Davis) and their son Cory (Jovan Adepo, ""The Leftovers""). The Friday night after work ritual finds Troy holding court in his backyard with his best friend and co-worker Bono (Stephen Henderson), as they share a bottle of gin and pontificate on the injustices that have landed them in this place and time.Another regular Friday occurrence is the drop-in of Troy's son by his first wife. Lyons (Russell Hornsby) is a musician who shows up on payday for a ""loan"" from dad. To say there is tension between the two would be an understatement, and it's the complex relationships between Troy and everyone else that is the crux of the story. Another player here is Troy's brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), who periodically wanders by talking about battling demons and hellhounds. See, Gabriel suffered a severe head injury during WWII and now has a plate in his head but no real place in society.Troy is a proud and bitter man, unwilling to acknowledge that the world is changing. Instead he holds firm to his belief that the white man will always hold back the man of color. It happened to him in baseball (though actually he was too old by the time Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers) and he refuses to believe Cory can succeed in football despite his being recruited by a college. Troy jumps between charming and caustic, and his fast-talking bellowing style can be entertaining, enlightening, condescending and intimidating  sometimes all of the above within a few sentences.There is magic in the words of Austin Wilson, and as a film, this is a true acting clinic. The performances keep us glued to the screen in each scene. Denzel is a dominating presence, and the single best moment belongs to the terrific Viola Davis. Her explosive release conveys the agony-of-the-years, the broken dreams, and the crushing blow of broken trust. As a viewer, we aren't sure whether to stand and applaud her or comfort her with a warm hug. The only possible criticism might be that the stage roots are obvious in the film version. The theatrical feel comes courtesy of the sets which are minimal and basic with no visual wow factor. But this minor drawback only serves to emphasize the characters and their interactions.It's pointed out to us (and Troy) that fences can be used to keep things out or keep things in. During his pontificating, Troy uses a couple of phrases more than once: ""Living with a full count"", and ""Take the crooked with the straight"". He often waxes philosophical, and it's through these words that we realize both he and Rose took their sense of duty and responsibility so seriously that they both lost their selves in the process. Making do with one's situation should not mean the end of dreams and hopes, and it certainly gives no one the right to hold back anyone from pursuing the path they choose. While watching the actors, don't miss the message."
FENCES,16 February 2017,9/10,"Troy Maxson makes his living as a sanitation worker in Pittsburgh. But he once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player, but was deemed too old when the major leagues began admitting black athletes. Bitter over his missed opportunity, Troy creates further tension in his family when he tries to quash his son's chance to meet a college football recruiter......Although Fences is primarily set in the family home (after all, it's based on a stage production), the film is an intense, sometimes unbearable film, and that's thanks to Washington's direction, and one of his greatest performances in a very long time.Washington is watchable in anything he's in, Virtuosity, 2 Guns, and the godawful Carbon Copy, are all ridiculous films, but Washington lifts the film whenever he utters a syllable.What makes the film so intense is that Troy is just so unpredictable, even when he's telling his delusional stories in his backyard making his friend and wife laugh, he just seems so unhinged, like he could change moo day any second.This could also be confirmed by the relationship he has with his brother, whom always feel that Troy is angry with him. Granted, his brother has what appears to be some sort of learning disability, but it's only Troy who gets this reaction.Davies is sensational as the foundation that keeps all the altercations from escalating just that little bit too far, she commands the screen when Washington isn't there, but he just ebbs her in the acting department.Troy is such a bitter, unsympathetic character, but you can't help but have empathy for him, he knew he had a chance at a good life, but due to discrimination, he missed his chance, no wonder the man is bitter and doesn't want his son to succeed.All in all, it's a wonderful film, with such brilliant performances.Guaranteed to give you mixed emotions."
FENCES,5 March 2017,10/10,"August Wilson (1945 – 2005), before his death, adapted his brilliant 1987 play FENCES for the screen. His other award winning plays are 'The Piano Lesson', 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom', 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone', 'Two Trains Running', 'Seven Guitars', 'Jitney' and 'King Hedley II'. Denzel Washington recreates his Broadway role (along with many of the other Broadway cast members) and directs this stunning film with extraordinary sensitivity.The play/film touches on many aspects - racism, the manner in which the world viewed Black Americans in the middle of the last century, marital infidelity, the impact of war injuries on wounded soldiers, the role women endured, child raising tensions, death, and more – and in the case of each the actors offer fully fleshed out performances of the characters August Wilson so intelligently created.Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) makes his living as a sanitation worker in 1956 Pittsburgh along side his best friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Maxson once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player, but when the major leagues began admitting black athletes he was 40 years old and was refused the permission to play. Bitter over his missed opportunity, Troy creates further tension in his family when he squashes his son's Cory (Jovan Adepo) chance to meet a college football recruiter. Troy lives in a small house with his stalwart wife Rose (Viola Davis) and Cory, and sometimes his war injured mentally impaired brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson). Troy's son by a previous relationship Lyons (Russell Hornsby) drops by every Friday, Troy's payday, to ask for money to support his dream of life as a successful musician. Troy holds his life together as best he can, concentrates on building a fence that Rose requests, but has an affair on the side that results in a pregnancy – a schism that almost destroys his relationship with Rose. But when the baby is born as the mother dies, Troy brings the baby home to Rose who compassionately cares for the child. Time passes and much changes, but to offer more of that would provide spoilers.The brilliance of acting by the entire cast is staggering and the film works on every level. One of the finest films in many years."
FENCES,30 November 2018,10/10,"Denzel Washington deserved a third Academy Award for his performance as Troy Maxson, a Pittsburgh garbage collector in the late fifties. He lives in the city with his loving and devoted wife, Ruth (Academy Award winner Viola Davis) and son, Cory. Troy and Cory are at odds with life and choices. Troy was once a promising baseball player but life dealt them a hard blow. Jimmy Bono, Troy's best friend and colleague, was played by Stephen McKinley Henderson (a veteran August Wilson actor in many productions). Henderson himself should have been nominate for best supporting actor. The production is faithful to the stage production. There is a lot of dialogue among the lead actors. The film stayed true to August Wilson's message about life and lessons about African American life through history. Viola Davis should have won for leading Actress in the role as Ruth."
FENCES,21 May 2018,6/10,"During the entire movie I was thinking that Fences should be a play instead of a movie. Most of the time I read the reviews on here after watching the movie, and so did I with this movie, and that's only then that I realized that it used to be a play before becoming a movie. I'm not surprised because the movie is basically people talking whole the time. You never get a minute of rest, it's all about Denzel Washington ranting and raving about everything and nothing. It sometimes feels like a monologue with sporadic comments of the rest of the cast. Denzel Washington's character isn't the most pleasant man to listen to so at one point it gets a bit boring. As far as Viola Davis winning an Oscar for best performance by an actress in a supporting role I wouldn't go that far. Don't get me wrong she's a good actress but this movie is just not Oscar material, at least not to me. But then again over the years I saw alot of movies that in my eyes didn't deserve Oscars, so it might be me with my bad taste. All in all the movie is okay to watch once, but I will certainly not watch it a second time."
FENCES,29 March 2017,,"While ""Fences"" is the best known of August Wilson's ten-play cycle set in each decade of the twentieth century, it should be known all ten of those plays are brilliant. ""Fences"" stands out in part due to the larger-than-life and deeply flawed protagonist, Troy Maxson.""Fences"" is Wilson's play of the 1950s, and the setting of Pittsburgh indicates changes are beginning in civil rights. Roberto Clemente had miraculously been stolen away from the Dodgers organization by the Pirates. And, in Troy's job as a garbage collector, he is surprised when, after filing a union complaint, that he is promoted to the position of driver, instead of being fired.But the only one who seems unable to grasp the implications of his changing world is Troy Maxson himself. His love-hate relationship with his son is one of the main strands of the film. Troy has many opportunities to allow for the growth and independence of his son Cory, yet, at every turn, he stifles his son's autonomy.The character who truly holds the Maxson film together is the selfless wife and mother Rose. In the incandescent performance by Viola Davis, the performer even holds the film together. Without a doubt, the best scenes in the film are those where Rose confronts Troy with the truth of his human limitations. The most unforgettable line delivery is when she says with resolve, ""You are a womanless man!"" Denzel Washington is also terrific in the role of Troy Maxson. Washington also directed the film excellent period style, set ups, and camera angles. The entire cast was splendid, and the film is a tribute to one of the great American poet-playwrights of the twentieth century."
FENCES,23 January 2017,5/10,"Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name by The Late/Great August Wilson, 'Fences' is a film that boasts Fabulous Performances from its terrific cast that Shine undeniably, but the film, as a whole, is overlong! Also, the narrative gets repetitive after a point. 'Fences' Synopsis: A working-class African-American father tries to raise his family in the 1950s, while coming to terms with the events of his life. Denzel Washington directs 'Fences' with a realistic feeling & the film legend is absolutely terrific in the central role. As Troy Maxson, the protagonist, Denzel is firebrand, delivering a performance full of feeling & frustration. But the film belongs to Viola Davis, who steals the show. Davis, an absolute acting pioneer, is priceless as the wife, offering a portrayal of loyalty, motherhood & heartbreak. Davis is sure to win Awards ahead (Already Having Won The Golden-Globe recently), yes Academy, I'm talking to you! In supporting roles, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby, Saniyya Sidney & Mykelti Williamson lend remarkable support.Now coming to the minuses! The Screenplay works in parts. Considering its been adapted from a play, the writing sticks to its true roots a bit too much. The locations remain the same & the literal translation becomes monotonous after a point. Troy's bitter attitude towards his Sons & his Wife's sacrifices, don't engross you beyond a point. The Writing needed to be crisper. And the film is overlong! At a 139-minutes, 'Fences' overstays its welcome by at least 20-minutes. I wish the narrative was stronger, as it begins beautifully.So what's the final word? 'Fences' is greatly acted, but as a film, it's a disappointment!"
FENCES,30 December 2016,,"""Good fences make good neighbors."" Robert FrostIn the case of August Wilson's inspired screenplay/play for Fences, that humble construction serves to isolate the protagonist, Troy (Denzel Washington), in his own Archie-Bunkerish know-it-all and his family: ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in."" Bono (Stephen Henderson) Because of his benign selfishness and his magnetism, Troy influences for good and bad everyone with whom he comes in contact.The 1950's were not model years for tolerance or equality, so in the riveting Fences, this black working class family, with dad as a garbage man, is just barely making it through. Yet, Director Denzel Washington brilliantly keeps our ears on sparkling dialogue, witty and revealing, less influenced by class and more by character weakness and alcohol.While Washington reprises his role from the Broadway production to be the best of his career, Troy's faithful wife, Rose, is played to perfection by Viola Davis for a sure Oscar nomination. As Troy attempts to express love for his younger son in rough and unloving ways (""I bust my butt 'cause I like you? You're about the biggest fool I ever saw""), Rose is aware of the sacrifices she has made, not the least of which are the 18 years with him: ""I gave eighteen years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!"" (Rose).Existentially she is much better off than he, for she lays claim to her conscious decisions that kept her tethered to him for almost two decades. He, however, never seems to be settled about his low station in life and sons who don't meet his expectations. His is not a peaceful life.The race issue of this outstanding 2016 film, where whites are the oppressors, is balanced by the mere presence on stage and frame of a black family with tragic components so often reserved for white heroes. In short play time, color is easily forgotten while character transcends to levels so color blind as to immediately assign the souls to humanity rather than race.""Now don't you go through life worrying about whether somebody like you or not! You best be makin' sure that they're doin' right by you! You understand what I'm sayin'?"" Troy"
FENCES,30 December 2016,8/10,"""Fences"" is based on a Tony and Broadway award winning play and even though I don't watch or attend plays I went and watched the big screen take just after Christmas and I must say pretty good film that gives an interesting and blunt take on life, and the struggles with race, moral choices, and the class issue of being poor showing that life takes many turns before all is said and done.Set in 1950's Pittsburgh Denzel Washington(in a good performance)is Troy Mayson a black father who struggles with life as for a black man he does the best he can to cope with life struggles of earning a living for his his family. Troy has seen his better days as his dreams of becoming a baseball player were never reached and he deals with the race issue of being black the best he can, as he busts his butt at work to earn a living he doesn't see eye to eye with his two grown sons and Troy even has a grown brother that's somewhat retarded.Still aside from it all Troy has a strong and loving wife in the form of Rose(in a fine turn from Viola Davis)she's a hard worker and fine cook and tries to give Troy a sense of direction and purpose as he struggles with the bottle and to beat it all he father's a child out of wedlock that's not Rose's. Still Rose has the love in her heart to take the little girl in. On the side to help to get thru it all Troy is determined to build a fence it's a project that he continues to work on day by day thru the years even. Yet in the end despite the ups and downs of life and despite fence building death comes and knocks on the door to take Troy away. Overall this film is a fine take on life and death using race, class, and moral choices to help shape the terms and events of one's life."
FENCES,21 December 2020,7/10,"""That is another thing which makes Troy a fascinating character, his masculine pride (the anathema that feeds bigotry) is all he has to hold onto after receiving many raw deals, and only through Washington's reeling-off, unrelieved elocution, Troy's ignorance, insularity and self-delusion bulk large, it is painful to watch him lay into his own son like a tyrant, yet, for an illiterate, case-hardened alpha man, who has three children all from different mothers, we should be thankful that his bark is worse than his bite.""to read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
FENCES,15 January 2017,8/10,"This is a film that isn't for everyone, especially if you aren't keen on listening to realistic and harsh dialogues for over 2 hours. This is based on a play after all. It's focused more on the banter and interactions which includes quite a bit of arguing and fighting with some cheers and singing thrown in. It's a movie that shows how the environment and deep past regrets fuiled by anger and really affect a man. And how that hatred and pain can affect even loved ones in a very painful and scarring way. If I watched this movie as just a kid before my teenage years, I would have been bored to death watching this. But as an adult, watching this put more insight and understanding to the human condition. Maybe it's because my father was a angry alcoholic, his past was full of betrayals and the loss of loved ones. He is a good man that has integrity but was full of anger and had a huge ego. Now as an adult I understand that he did the best he could as a father and as a man. Denzel Washington puts on another believable performance, but it's Viola Davis that really impressed me this time around. After playing the mean and intimidating role as Amanda Waller in ""Suicide Squad"". She plays a beautiful, loving and compassionate wife who tries to see the good in people. Her performance had so much realistic emotions and soul to it. As a matter of fact this is a soulful movie that pierces the heart. It shows the depressing side of reality but it still gives a bit of hope. I am not sure this is a film I would sit through again, but it's a impactful and tear-jerking film.8.8/10"
FENCES,26 December 2016,9/10,"'FENCES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed drama, based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play (of the same name) by August Wilson; who also wrote the screenplay (before his death in 2005). Denzel Washington directed the movie; which he also stars in, with actress Viola Davis (Washington and Davis both won Tony awards, for playing the same roles in the 2010 Broadway revival). The film also costars Stephen McKinley Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby and Mykelti Williamson. It was named one of the ten best movies of the year, by the American Film Institute, and it's expected to garner multiple Academy Award nominations. I think it's a superbly acted film, and it's equally as impressively directed; Washington once again proves why he's one of the most talented people in film today.The story is set in Pittsburgh, in the 1950s. Troy Maxson (Washington) is a waste collector, who's also married with two sons; one from a previous marriage (Hornsby), who's now 34-years-old. Maxson struggle with the race relations of that time, while he also has even more trouble getting along with his family. The whole time his loving wife, Rose (Davis), stays loyally by his side.The film is surprisingly faithful to the play (I've heard); so much so that it often feels like you're watching an actual play (more than a movie). This makes it very wordy, and quite long (and very slow- paced), but it's worth staying patient for. The performances are amazing, and so is the powerful character development. I was kind of shocked to learn how unlikable Washington's character is, more so as the movie goes on even, and he definitely didn't grow on me. I rooted for his abused family instead, and I did not wish to see Washington's antihero succeed. He is amazing in his role though, and so is Davis, and the film is quite fascinating to watch as well (if you have the patience to sit through it).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
FENCES,7 January 2017,6/10,"Admittedly, I fell asleep during Fences. And, unbelievably, it was during one of the many yelling, shout-matches.Sure, it was both a long day and the movie is repetitive. The movie screams PLAY and yeah, it does, in fact, come from a play with 95% of the original cast that appeared both on stage and on screen. Sometimes that works. SEE: Death and the Maiden. But this one never felt like a real movie. Just as a film-adaptation play. Sure, the characters, good or bad, are RICH. Namely Denzel Washington's ""Dad."" He's fantastic in it, though he's such a bad man. And the realism of the sets and surroundings feel authentic. Both Washington and on- screen/stage wife, Viola Davis, are excellent and characters gripping.But, as real as everything felt and you did get invested in the characters and story, the movie is something I never, ever want to revisit. Even when I did pass out somewhere in the middle of this over- long film. ***Final thoughts: Please tell me this wasn't to combat the ""OscarSoWhite"" campaign. Because, believe me, I loved Denzel ten times more in 2016's The Magnificent Seven-times more than this."
FENCES,11 July 2018,8/10,"Few movies make as little effort to disguise their stage origins as Fences. Director/Star Denzel seems to have no interest in turning Fences into a movie; he just wants to present the play on film. This is offputting at first, but as the movie proceeds the strength of its performances and the powerful words pull you in.Denzel plays a bitter, colorful guy so obsessed with the harm the world has done to him that he is blind to the harm he's done to others. It is an excellent, powerful performance; he is awful, yet you can see the charisma that keeps him from, at least at first, repelling the world.I had heard a lot about Viola Davis' award-winning performance, but her early scenes aren't all that impressive, perhaps because she doesn't have much to do. As the drama ramps up though, her performance becomes mesmerizing; a confrontation with Denzel is so searing one expects the film to melt.The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel.This sat in my queue for a long time, because I don't really have the interest in intense dramas I had in my younger days. But it is a deep and remarkably compelling drama well worth watching.Still, I feel a director more interested in making a movie than a filmed play would have been preferable."
FENCES,24 February 2017,7/10,"Adapted from August Wilson's Tony-winning play of the same title, ""Fences"" is the intense and upsetting portrayal of a fifty-something African-American father who works as a waste collector in Pittsburgh circa 1957. His name is Troy Maxson and he's played by Denzel Washington in a performance so full of speeches it will leave you speechless, not always positively. And to call him 'embittered' is an understatement, this is a man who've had the roughest time in his life: he left his house at the age of fourteen, he killed a man, went to jail and left a promising career in the Baseball Negro League because he couldn't make to the Major, believing it had to do with racism while it's strongly implied that age was the cause. In a nutshell, this is a man who had developed a sour taste of life that burst into vindictive rants and tirades over his family, mainly his two sons, a Jazz musician from a previous marriage and the son from his current marriage with Rose (Viola Davis), a kid under the radar of a football selector. While Troy is more patient and forgiving with Rose, on a larger scope, you can tell that she's had it with his tantrums and whenever he vents his frustrations over his sons, as a mother, she's like suffering by proxy.And this is not lying on the premise to say that the movie is all about anger, it's one angry monologue after another, even when you see Troy smiling, this is a smile that hurts one who loves him or at least shows him ""overdue"" respect. At least, the trailer doesn't lie about it, and all through the film, whether for giving ten dollars to his older son, or giving permission to the little one for playing football or buying a TV, Troy has a saying about everything. And he does have a point now and then, you've got to appreciate the standpoint of a man who's been wrestling with life, racism and death, but there's a fine line between teaching a lesson and bullying, and Troy crosses it so many times that there comes a moment you only pray for one bit of silence, a little breath. This is one hell of a depressingly heated movie, a ""Poppy Dearest"" that takes itself seriously. The screenplay, written by the late Wilson is a goldmine of one-liners and monologues and even surpasses ""Network"" on a quantitative level. The acting is top notch, you better believe it, besides Washington and Davis, Mykelti Williamson does a fine job as Gabriel, Troy's mentally impaired brother and Stephen Hendreson is the perfectly cool Yin to his buddy's tempestuous Yang. But the real problem is the directing. We're entrapped in that small house with a character so larger-than-life that even the audience must take a few steps back to let his feelings implode. I wouldn't call the film stagy, but it's too talkative for its own good, it never tries to reach the one quality where cinema can outshine theater: silence, close-ups, looks. Washington is one hell of an actor but not much of a director in the sense that he never translates a terrific script into movies' language.And there were many fields where he could play; how about having a glimpse on the two sons' lives, seeing them playing Jazz or football, or if Troy had to be the center of the film's universe, how about seeing his mistress? There's a whole monologue where he tells Rose why he cheated on her, because that forbidden relationship allowed an unsuspected part of him to express itself. It's a powerful speech but so less eloquent than seeing him actually having fun and being another person. Maybe the budget or the deadlines didn't make it possible but then the film should only be judged on the basis of what it's got to offer, which is dialogues and acting. The film was nominated for Best Actor, Actress, Adapted Screenplay and that was fine but Best Picture, I don't think so. This spot belonged to another film.Viola Davis will certainly win the Oscar although there's an obvious case of category fraud, but she was good and it wouldn't be undeserved. Now, it's on Washington that I will expand. It seems that he's the second front-runner along with Casey Affleck in ""Manchester by the Sea"". It's a two-man race but as deserved as the nomination was, Washington shouldn't win because this is a role he played so many times, the hardest part was over, he already inhabited his character and didn't even try to enrich him with new material. You can play a character a thousand times and keep him fresh and powerful, but Washington made me ""feel the screenplay"", it made feel there was someone who wrote these lines and thought they would provide terrific acting moments. Even the trailer lays that card, the film tries to venture in the realm of reality but there's something deeply unreal and theatrical in that man who has a powerful monologue about everything.On the other hand, Casey Affleck played a seemingly unlikable guy who didn't know exactly what to say at the right moments, being confused and embarrassed, a character who felt real because there was no sense of a screenplay driving his emotions, only reality. He fully embodied his character and took whatever came and at the moment it came, as if he really had to figure out what to say or how to act, or react, sure he was less eloquent than our friend Troy, but it felt real and it was diluted in a story where you could care for other people. ""Fences"" was a clothesline on which to hang Washington's emotional rants, your admiration is almost at the expense of your enjoyment. A little less could have meant a lot more."
FENCES,18 May 2018,6/10,"'Fences (2017)' is the long-awaited film adaptation of August Wilson's critically acclaimed play. It features fantastic powerhouse performances, including perhaps career bests for Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, but feels aimless and a little too long despite some emotionally powerful scenes. It feels like we're watching a play, being told everything when we could be shown it. It is still relatively engaging throughout. 6/10."
FENCES,3 February 2017,7/10,"Proper 'filmed theatre', as in making few, if any, concessions to 'cinema' is rare these days but Denzel Washington has chosen to film August Wilson's play ""Fences"", (adapted by Wilson himself), as if it were a play in which our attention is held solely by the actors and the dialogue and nothing else. The play, of course, is legendary, (it won the Pulitizer Prize), and is obviously something of a labour of love for Washington who also plays the lead, Troy Maxson, an African-American garbage man in Pittsburg in the 1950's. It's a great role and a very fine piece of acting from Washington, possibly the best thing he has ever done on screen, and which could easily win him a third Oscar.If Washington dominates the picture he is matched by Viola Davis as his wife Rose; the film is as much hers. There has been some controversy over Davis' inclusion in the Supporting Actress category for what is clearly a leading role but her Oscar is guaranteed and I am sure had she been nominated for Best Actress she would have won there, too. With material this good, of course, you simply can't fault anyone and it's to Wilson's credit that he can take something that, on face value, seems specific to the African-American experience (and at a particular time) and make it feel universal. People are the same everywhere; Black, White, Christian, Muslim. We all experience the same feelings; we eat, sleep, work, pay the bills and have sex no matter where we are in the world. As a film its appeal may be limited but as a record of a great play it remains essential."
FENCES,31 December 2016,8/10,"It's rare that I say a film is a must watch for any aspiring actors. But Fences is a rare movie. Masterful acting all-around with perhaps, dare I say, the most perfect performances of the year.Any time a play is adapted into a feature length film I have some understandable concerns. How does the pacing of the theater play compare to the big screen? Can a film truly recapture the tone and feel even though we aren't witnessing them first hand like in a theater? Are the actors of the same caliber as those who took on the roles on Broadway? Thankfully, Fences checks pretty much every box when it comes to the transition. This Pulitzer Prize winning play most certainly was worthy of the transition, and Denzel Washington & company did right by it.Washington and Viola Davis reprise their roles from the Broadway revival and give two of the most powerful performances of the year. That's what this film is built around, and rightfully so. There apparently wasn't a ton changed from the play as the film really rests on the shoulders of the strength of the cast's performance. If you're not invested from the opening scene, then I can't say this film is for you. But hearing Denzel rip right through monologue after monologue and Davis perform with so much hidden emotion was a thing of beauty. If I had to choose a film to show to an acting class, Fences may just be that film.The only real issue I had was with the third act. Because of how well the first two acts of the film were presented, it was going to be hard to encapsulate all the built up emotion in a satisfying way. It's not that I found the last third of the movie to be bad, I just found it to be less interesting than the set-up. But that just might be the nature of the play.Denzel returned to the director's chair here, and you can tell how much passion he had towards this story and these characters. He and every single one of the cast members sunk their teeth into this film and grounded it with a believably tragic story. Sure, the story may be ultimately better suited for a live theater experience, but there's no question that Denzel captured the spirit of the play, and made it into one of the best dramas of the year. I felt like I was a fly on the wall on an inner city family struggle, and not many films can make me feel that way. +Masterful acting across the board+Grounded direction from Denzel+I felt like I was there-Third act isn't as interesting8.7/10"
FENCES,9 January 2017,,"Fences is pretty much everything I expected it to be. I think part of the problem with that is that there are no surprises. Even not being familiar with the play I knew the type of film it would be. The performances are predictably great. Washington plays up the character completely and while I do think he's pretty great in the role, there's something really shamelessly showy and over-the- top about it. I think Viola Davis, although also showy, manages to bring the film back down to earth. Whether she is leading or supporting is really up to anyone, it's a very borderline performance. I do think it's her best performance yet though. Jovan Adepo is also really impressive and should be getting more awards traction."
FENCES,26 February 2017,,"Sturdily crafted & strongly performed, Fences follows a very determined route from start to finish, is faithfully adapted from its source material, and makes for a deftly-layered character study but I still felt cold, detached & withdrawn from everything that unfolded over the course of its runtime.The story of Fences follows the patriarch of an African-American family who's trying to raise his family in 1950s America. Still haunted by the unfulfilled dreams of his past, he creates further tension in the household after squashing his son's life goals and later confesses about a dark secret to his wife.Helmed by Denzel Washington in his third directional effort, Fences packs a dialogue-driven plot that was penned down by August Wilson himself. The conversations are endless yet the drama is never compelling and its tedious pace plus excessive runtime only turns it into a more frustrating sit.The film features a dependable cast in Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Jovan Adepo & Stephen Henderson, and all of them chip in with strong efforts. Every character is well-defined & exhibits a meaty arc, and although Washington delivers a top-notch performance, Davis still manages to best him on several occasions.On an overall scale, Fences is a competently crafted & patiently narrated drama that may resonate best with those who are well versed with its source material. Its deconstruction of race, poverty & fatherhood is interesting but the lack of cinematic qualities turns it into something that rambles on forever yet remains uninvolving until the very end."
FENCES,10 April 2017,8/10,"Fences is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It adapts a play in to film very effectively, staying true to its source material. The movie captures a man as he experiences somewhat of a midlife crisis when his children go off to pursue their dreams, something he feels he never had the chance to do. Normally we see it from the person pursuing the dream's point of view, and the parent that is not supporting them is somewhat of an antagonist, however, here we see it from their perspective, which creates a significantly different story. I did feel that it was a bit too like a play at some points, there are long sequences where the characters merely speak and it all has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. It clearly was not altered much from the theatre script, it could have changed some scenes to make them more film-esque, as their were far too many moments where I felt I could have just watched it on stage. The cast is phenomenal, Denzel Washington hits it out of the park with this one, portraying a damaged man with alcoholism. He develops his character's state very realistically throughout. Viola Davis also shines as Washington's wife and received a well deserved Academy Award for her passionate, daring and raw performance that is transcending every moment she is on screen. It was an Oscar contender for a reason, be sure not to miss it. Powerful, intense performances and an engrossing plot, Fences is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. A down on his luck father begins to spiral out of control as his children leave home. Best Performance: Denzel Washington"
FENCES,30 March 2017,8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Fences"" (2016) is all about performances and script, in my opinion. While directing by Denzel Washington was OK i guess (as there isn't really much going on in this movie, except for talking), great script and amazing performances carries this movie. I won't lie, i liked the overall movie and although i wasn't blow away by it, i liked this slow burning drama. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis were both absolutely stunning as a husband and a wife, living in 1950s USA. Husband Troy isn't perfect to say the least, and he is not a model father to say the least as well, but he is a good man while Rose tries to glue family together. There are also some racial undertones in here, but they are far and in between. Yet i struggled to see some deeper messages here in this story, it isn't really deep or anything, yet great script makes it worth seeing.Overall, this is a one rare film which you can basically watch because of great performances and solid as well as involving script. There isn't any action in this movie, this is a pure drama which at running time 2 h 13 min can drag here and there, but nevertheless is worth to see it once."
FENCES,14 June 2017,7/10,"It took nearly a decade for Denzel to direct another film and this time it sailed through the Oscars with four nominations and one won out of it. Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.A very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it. It is mainly for families.6/10"
FENCES,20 August 2020,7/10,This film has some of the best acting I've seen. Every character is lively and natural. The performances have so much emotion invested in them. Yet the film itself feels too slow most of the time. It lingers on lengthy monologues and doesn't really pick up the pace.
FENCES,22 March 2017,8/10,"Fences is a strong drama film that is based on an award winning play by August Wilson (also wrote the script). It is a powerful drama about Troy (Denzel Washington), who lives with his wife Rose (Viola Davis), and their son Cory (Jovan Adepo). Troy is stuck in the past about the hardship of choices and actions that he has experienced and is having difficulties accepting the choices that his son wants to make. Story takes place in the 1950s Pittsburgh. Troy is not an easy person for anyone to try to get along with, as his other son Lyons (Russel Hornsby) rejected the idea of getting a job that Troy insisted on helping him get, just so he can be a musician at a club. While his other son, Cory wants to play football. Which displeases Troy cause he believes playing sports is not going to get him anywhere in life and would rather him work at a job for living. Fences is a film that does feel like it's a play. Small set pieces that only takes place at Troy's home, or down the streets of Pittsburgh. These characters are in these set pieces with long periods of conversations. Which it does not make it a terrible film. The script is slow moving but very strong when it comes to character dynamics for a drama storyteller. The cast of Fences all did a phenomenal job in their roles. Denzel Washington is a great actor all around, playing a character that is stuck in his time of a man needing to work hard and be responsible. Viola Davis is a stunning actress and this has to be one of her best roles yet. The rest of the cast are unknown actors but have been in theatre playing the same characters like Mykelti Williamson, Russell Hornsby, and Stephen Henderson. The direction was pretty impressive, sticking to old school filmmaking in handling a slow moving drama film. Small set pieces, minimum use of a music score, and soft editing. Washington did well in capturing great performances with every actor on film. Overall, Fences is a good film with amazing performances in a slow moving drama film. I will rate it 4 out of 5 stars."
FENCES,25 February 2017,4/10,"There are a lot of good acting performances in Fences, which shouldn't be surprising considering the presence of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Emotions run high on many occasions and certain scenes are riveting.The thing about Fences, though, is that it just doesn't add up to much in the end. Characters seem to just wander in and out of the frame and the cramped feel of the film (adapted from a stage play) doesn't help the cause.Simply put, I felt like Fences was more a series of conversations (some heated, some humorous, etc.) than a fully formed film. The acting will get some awards in all likelihood, and perhaps deservedly so, but the movie itself doesn't live up to the break."
FENCES,26 February 2017,9/10,"While not cinematic in the purest sense of the word, this stageplay come to life as a feature film; whilst staying very much close to the roots of its stage-set origins, is a captivating piece of cinema that enthrals and shocks purely through its use of brilliantly brought to life and commanding performances moulded almost perfectly together with a gut-punch of a script by late playwright August Wilson.Denzel Washington's third feature film as a director and by far his most accomplished, Fences see's the well regarded actor bring back the stage plays core cast for another go around and it works wonders for Fences ability to draw in the audience despite what initially seems like a questionable run-time.For 130 or so minutes of the run-time attached to Fences, we barely leave the residence of Washington's hardworking yet equally as hardhearted garbage collection/bitter ex-sports star Troy Maxson and his fellow co-inhabitants, Viola Davis's caring and long-suffering wife/mother Rose and rightfully angry son Cory, whose recent foray into the possibility of becoming a pro-athlete spurns on many a heated family discussion, but the film never once feels like it's not doing or saying something.Sometimes visited by Troy's mentally handicapped ex-soldier brother Gabe, best friend Jim or Troy's oldest son Lyons, the household of the Maxson family becomes a battleground for these clashing souls and becomes the playground for the considerable acting chops of Washington and Davis in particular, who have honed their incarnations of these characters down to a fine art over their time in the stage version of this story so that every moment of love, anger or resentment feels whole-heartedly real.They are in many ways showy performances, there's ample time for tears, shouting and considered looks but there's no denying that they combine into one of the best double acts seen on screen in sometime.Since I had partaken in the quiet power of Manchester by the Sea, I felt fairly confident that the soon to be announced Best Actor Oscar was Casey Affleck's for the taking but with Washington taking control of every ounce of Troy's being, it's an award that you wish could be shared between the two differently styled actors but Washington you feel has the edge with Troy providing the veteran performer one of his most memorable roles.Every scene with Washington in it, particularly the films early onslaughts, allow the actor time and space to show off his impressive prowess and when Troy is unhappy about something (which is more often than not), Washington will have you glued to your seat, unable to take your eyes off his captivating turn.Not to be outdone however, Viola Davis's owns Rose's presence in the film and while Troy is a character we want to side with despite his many various faults and sins, Rose is a character that will break your heart as she tries desperately and earnestly to do the best with what she's been given and as is the general consensus, Davis is as bankable as you'd like when considering who is taking home this year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar.While it will be to stagey and wordy for some, Fences offers one of modern cinemas rare chances to see a film driven and brought to life purely through the art of acting whilst offering an insightful look at black lives in 1950's America. A refreshingly scaled back cinematic experience in many ways, just as its awards cohort Manchester by the Sea, Fences is full of heart, seething emotion and genuinely outstanding acting turns and is one of the best stage to film adaptations of the modern era.4 ½ trumpets out of 5"
FENCES,1 January 2017,6/10,"Fences (2016) was directed (and stars) Denzel Washington. It's based on a play by August Wilson, who wrote the screenplay for the movie.Denzel Washington is the protagonist, Troy Maxson. His acting is outstanding, which is no surprise. Viola Davis as his wife, Rose Maxson, Jovan Adepo as his son, Cory, and Stephen Henderson as his best friend, Jim Bono, are all skilled actors and portray their roles well.The movie takes place in the 1950's, in Pittsburgh. Even though Pittsburgh is a northern city, there was no shortage of prejudice against Blacks, and the Black people in the movie are acutely aware of this. Troy had been a superb baseball player when he was younger. He had to play in the Negro League, however, because the color barrier hadn't yet been broken. (Jackie Robinson was the first Black player to break that barrier, in 1947. Still, almost a decade later, Troy feels that discrimination still exists against Blacks in the major leagues.)In any case, all this was not relevant to Troy, because he was obviously too old to play in any league when the barrier came down. The problem with the plot--for me--is that this failure to achieve greatness is with Troy all day, every day. He works in sanitation, which isn't a prestige career, but he has just been promoted to driver. He has a loving wife, a great son, and a good friend. The problem is that Troy has no love for his son. Or possibly, he loves his son but envies Cory's youth and his athletic skills. He can't accept the fact that Cory has been offered a college athletic scholarship. In fact, in his own harsh way, Troy is closing doors for his son whenever and wherever they are opened.What makes the play popular is that Troy's character is complex and flawed. Flawed protagonists are often the source of tension and interest in a play or a film. However, I found Troy's character to be so negative that I couldn't identify with him in any way. Also, usually there's some redeeming quality about a flawed protagonist. If that redeeming quality was present in Troy, I missed it. I recognize that as I write this review, the IMDb rating for Fences is an extraordinary 8.0. It will surely lead to some Oscars. Denzel Washington might win two Oscars-- as Best Actor and Best Director. OK--I'm swimming against the stream here, but when I write reviews for IMDb I want to be as honest and forthright as possible. This movie didn't work for me. However, it certainly might work for you.We saw this movie at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, New York. Even though director Washington shows us scenes away from Troy's home, the real story takes place at the home. It's clearly a stage play turned into a movie. I'm sure it will work well on the small screen."
FENCES,16 September 2017,6/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because of the excellent performances from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, but you can definitely tell that it was written for the stage, because it's based on dialogue and emotions more than actions. Denzel plays Troy Maxton, who is a ex-baseball player working as a garbage man. He's a loving husband, married to Rose (Viola Davis), with 2 sons, and he works hard to provide for his family but his strict views and damaging upbringing, takes a toll in his everyday life. His son Cory (Jovan Adepo) finds it hard to understand his father's views, so his mother keeps the peace between the both of them. After a traumatic event, which puts a strain on Troy and Roses relationship, Troy's demons start haunting him and the family home isn't a happy place to be. Regardless of his behaviour, Rose doesn't allow anyone to bad mouth Troy, because she knows that he lived his life for his family, even though he didn't know how to show it. It's definitely an emotional movie which is very well written and full of drama but from a cinematic point of view, it is very one toned. You have to be in the right mood to watch it, and it's not the type of movie that you will watch over and over again but with that aside, the performances are top class and I really couldn't see anyone else playing the leading roles. I would have liked to have seen what happened to Troy, because the movie skips towards the end but it's a decent watch which will definitely touch the audience hearts. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is the 3rd movie directed by Denzel Washington, 62, who also directed Antwone Fisher and the Great Debaters in 2007. As he starred in the play alongside Viola Davis, who won the Oscar for Supporting Role, he was the best person to direct this emotional drama. It met all of my expectations, after reading the reviews and seeing various clips, so I wasn't surprised with the outcome, especially as it was based on the play by August Wilson, who sadly died in 2005. Budget: $24million Worldwide Gross: $65millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramas, starring Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby and Mykelti Williamson. 6/10"
FENCES,1 January 2017,9/10,"""Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner,"" Troy MaxsonSet in Pittsburgh in the late 1950s, Denzel Washington brings to the screen his 2010 Tony Award winning performance of 53-year-old Troy Maxson in August Wilson's powerful play, Fences, one of a cycle of his plays that depict the African-American experience in America. The illiterate Troy is a sanitation worker who is fond of telling stories about his brutal childhood when he left home at the age of 14, the years he spent in prison for robbery and murder, and his stint as a Negro League baseball player where his skills were not recognized. Married for 18 years to his devoted wife Rose (Viola Davis), Troy is a man full of both humor and sadness who blames racism for his past failures.The opening scene sets the stage for the relationships that continue throughout the film. Troy is seen after a day's work with bantering with his close friend and fellow worker Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), talking about his work ethic, bragging about his sports prowess and blustering about other subjects of which he is guaranteed to have an opinion as Rose looks on and smiles. With Bono, he is funny and charming but another side of him, a hurtful side, does not take long to emerge. Maxson is building a fence to keep folks like the devil and death on the other side, but, of course, fences are no barrier to them. Though Rose suggests that getting rid of the bottle might serve the purpose better than a fence, he won't listen as he declares ""I ain't going easy."" Central to the film is the contentious father-son relationship between dad Troy and his teenage son Cory (newcomer Jovan Adepo). Cory is a boy with big ideas and football plays a major role in them. A skilled high school athlete, he has been recruited for a scholarship to college and a recruiter is coming to their house to have Troy sign the papers, but Troy is not supportive. Because of his own failed dreams of becoming a major league baseball player, he tells Cory that it is more important for him to work at the super market than play football, ""The white man ain't gonna let you get nowhere with that football noway,"" he says. The end result, however, is to permanently damage their relationship.Desperate for his father's affection, Cory asks him whether or not he likes him but the answer is not what he wants to hear. ""Does the law say I have to like you?"" Troy asks him, saying that he is only responsible for his son's material needs: food, clothing and shelter and that's it, making fatherhood sound like a burdensome responsibility rather than an act of love. In a later confrontation, Adepo's strength and steely determination comes close to stealing the show from its star. Other players are also important to the story. Besides Rose and Cory, his son Lyons (Russell Hornby) from a former marriage, an unemployed musician, shows up usually on payday to ask to borrow some money which always gives dad an opportunity to tell him how worthless he is.Troy's brother Gabriel (Mikelti Williamson), a mentally damaged war veteran with a metal plate in his head is a frequent visitor. Like the archangel of the same name, he carries a trumpet and thinks he is the messenger of God. Though Troy, to his credit, treats Gabe with respect, it is partially out of guilt feelings that his brother's disability check allowed him to buy his house. Troy saves his final hurt for Rose, however, a woman who has given him eighteen years of his life. Rose emerges from the shadows towards the latter part of the film to dominate the drama and her words to her husband say it all. What about my life?, she asks. With tears streaming down her face, she says, ""I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom."" It is one of the most moving scenes in the film.Troy is an embittered character who is reminiscent of Willie Loman in Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman,"" another tired and aging worker who realizes how little satisfaction his life has brought. It is a different time, however, and some of his attitudes and resentments are understandable in that context as is his surprise and joy when he becomes the first black driver. Fences is a powerhouse drama delivered with passion that provides one of the few depictions in American cinema of the African-American working class. Though it is basically a filmed play shot mainly in the backyard of Maxson's house, the soaring poetry of the language and the superb quality of the acting more than compensates for its cinematic limitations. It is not an easily forgettable experience."
FENCES,23 March 2018,7/10,"It's very difficult to manage expectations when the talent on and off screen is immeasurable. Washington acting and directing, Davis, Wilson's original drafted screenplay and loyally abiding to Wilson's last wishes by utilising an all African-American cast. For the most part, this drama succeeds. An old-school family's trust is broken when the husband admits to being unfaithful. What follows is an almost Shakespearean American drama that is fuelled by values and traditions. On paper, these characters are formidable forces. Proud individuals who hold the utmost respect for themselves, yet their lives are far from the idyllic dreams that they once had. The son has the same aspirations as the father, yet due to his failed ventures he refuses to let his son follow the same doomed path. Insinuating that racism played a fundamental role to his demise, he attempts to manipulate his son into thinking the same. It's a harsh family environment where the members are constantly treading carefully, fortunately Wilson's screenplay conveys the tension eloquently. The first act is a tidal wave of dialogue that allows Washington and Davis to establish their prominence. The latter being incredible, particularly during the snot-filled scene where she exclaims ""Well I've been standing here with you!"". Immediately I was stricken with goosebumps. Washington's directing style was simple as he ensures the screenplay is at the forefront. However, the major issue I have with this unabridged conversion of the play is that it has no cinematic style. It's as if I was watching the play, yet because Washington attempted to adapt this cinematically he consequently loses the theatrical intensity. Thus I struggled to remain compelled through certain scenes. So much dialogue and acting that it just doesn't settle, it lacked that emotional involvement. Fences is an incredibly intimidating film, wonderfully written and acted but occasionally disinteresting. I just wanted something more from this..."
FENCES,14 March 2017,6/10,"Mrs. Shullivan and I were really looking forward to watching this four (4) time Oscar nominated film with two perennial stars in Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. After watching the first 20 minutes though of nothing more than the 53 year old garbage man Troy Maxon (Denzel Washington) talking trash rather than picking it up Mrs. Shullivan and I looked at each other and simultaneously asked...""what's that awful smell?""But we agreed to hang in there to see whether or not Troy would eventually build that fence in his backyard that he has been promising to build for his wife of eighteen (18) years whose name is Rose (Viola Davis). With all the self promotion that Denzel and Viola provided prior to the release of Fences which was a well received stage play written by August Wilson and drafted for the large screen we anticipated that with all this talent they would know how to transfer a stage play into a film version. Sadly, this was not the case and we felt as if it was a ""staged play"" filmed and edited for a video release.We love live theater and I am sure the original theater play was very powerful and moving when you see the quality of the story line. Here is a troubled man named Troy Maxon, a murderer, ex-convict who seems to have turned his life around and found steady employment as a sanitary engineer, who likes his booze on the weekends, but he also likes his broads. So Troy decides to penetrate three (3) different women once every seventeen (17) years apart and father three (3) children with three different (3) women. I loved Viola Davis's role as Troy's second wife Rose, and she was absolutely deserving of her Oscar award. As for Denzel, I have a bit of advice for you. Either choose to direct, or choose to act, but don't try and accomplish both because I think your ego got the better of you and for the first two (2) hours of this film it was all about you. It was nothing more, and nothing less than a vanity role. You were no ray of sunshine as the ending would have you portrayed as being.I think the 56 year old Laurence Fishburne, or the 69 year old Samuel L. Jackson or the 53 year old Blair Underwood would have provided more substance to the role of Troy Maxon and Denzel, as their director you could have drawn a stellar performance out of any of these three fine actors.I rate the film an 8 out of 10 for Viola Davis's excellent performance but I must subtract 2 points for Denzel's self-indulgent and over the top scene stealing over the first two hours. Remember Denzel....it's not all about you...at least not anymore."
FENCES,5 January 2017,4/10,"I may be the only person on earth comparing new race-drama Fences with 2009's superhero epic Watchmen, but hear me out. Both are based on acclaimed, non-film works (stage-play, comics); both are big, dramatic period-piece social stories; and despite their noble intentions and commitment to their sources, neither transfer as films. In what is only one step beyond a filming of the stage-play itself, Fences is a high school acting competition, with each performer delivering monologues with clockwork precision but with little connectivity. This is far from entirely the performers' faults. Most of the cast is the same from the most recent Broadway-run about this troubled 1950s black family. And while they were probably great on stage, the ultra-dramatics and super-written-feeling dialogue are ham-fisted on the big screen. Notably, the actors still have their moments. Adepo and Hornsby are standouts, and Davis is so great she even pulls off some blatant Oscar-clip moments. Unfortunately, they are asked to deliver some distractingly soap-operatic tragedies with impossible naturalism. At the center of all of this is director and star Washington, who despite his decent acting performance must take the blame overall. As the (perhaps warranted) bitter-old-man at the center of this tragedy train, he basically never stops talking, both verbally and in direction. Telling stories he's definitely told before and spouting off constant baseball metaphors, all I could think was how crazy it would drive me to be his friend. Worse yet, there's a dangerous message about abuse that is played off more like a character quirk than a problem. Fences is an occasionally stirring American period-piece whose troublesome & obnoxiously melodramatic awards-bait fodder becomes more-than-a-bit grating."
FENCES,3 January 2017,7/10,"""Fences"" (2016 release; 138 min.) brings the story of Troy. As the movie opens, we see Troy collecting garbage on his route in Pittsburgh in the late 50s. Soon we get to know Troy's inner circle of family and friends: there is Rose, his wife of 18 years, and their 17 yr. old son Cory who is showing promise as a football player and attracting interest from colleges. There is Bono, Troy's co-worker and long-time close friend, and Gabe, Tory's older brother who has never fully recovered from a WW II injury. And last but not least there is Lyons, Troy's 34 yr. old son from a previous relationship who shows up every Friday (when it's Troy's payday) to borrow $10 (Troy's weekly paycheck being $76, or roughly $630 in today's money).Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of the critically acclaimed and Pulitzer Prize winning theater play by August Wilson. I did not see the theater play so I cannot comment how closely the film sticks to the play. Denzel Washington reprises his theater play role for the big screen and for good measure also directs (and co-produces). The story played out is a complex family drama that focuses on Troy's flawed relationships with everyone around him. Troy means well, but his thinking is rigid and his background (leaving his family at age 14--back in 1919) leads him to treat others with mostly tough love, if you can even call it love. All of this makes Troy a not very sympathetic character, and given that the movie truly does evolve around him (I'm guessing Troy has as many lines as everyone else combined), this makes for tough watching at times. Not to mention that, at 2 hrs. 20 min., the movie is simply far too long for its own good. I have nothing against a long running time, but in this instance it feels unwarranted and not supported by enough plot advances. I realize that this movie is mostly a character study and hence plot advances are secondary. All that aside, the acting performances will blow you away. Washington as Troy of course, but equally so (in far less screen time) is Viola Davis as the aggrieved wife Rosa (her scene asking/accusing Tory ""what about me? what about my life?"" is the most moving of the entire movie). Both Washington and Davis are almost certainly going to collect a lot of honors in the upcoming award season, including Oscar nominations--mark my words. The support cast is equally fine.""Fences"" has been steadily expanding in theaters in recent weeks. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was packed, somewhat to my surprise, in particular due to the movie's long running time. But it seems there is quite a large appetite for this movie, and so much the better. For my own taste, I found the movie most certainly worthwhile if at times a bit tedious."
FENCES,12 September 2018,8/10,"In the film adaptation of August Wilson's magisterial play Fences, Denzel Washington reprised his role from the 2010 Tony Award winning revival (originally starring James Earl Jones on Broadway in 1987). Here Washington also directs, working with a screenplay written by Wilson prior to his death in 2005. Tony Kushner was brought on to perhaps do a re-write but ended up only getting a co-producer credit. Apparently Washington was not too keen on too many changes to the script as he regarded Wilson's words as sacrosanct. 
A brilliant actor, Washington proves to be only a competent director as the film adaptation of Fences feels like a filmed version of the play. Early on, there is a nice scene of the protagonist Troy Maxson (Washington) and his fellow sanitation worker Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) making the rounds hauling trash on the streets of 1950s Pittsburgh,but the vast majority of the action takes place at the Maxson home, where the stage play is set. 
Somehow the film could have been expanded to show additional settings but that would have required changes to Wilson's original draft, changes which Washington was not willing to make. In addition, there are too many long-winded speeches that weren't cut for the film and slow much of the proceedings down (I'm thinking particularly of all those baseball references that seem to go on and on), 
Nonetheless, Wilson's material is so good and the acting here so fine that complaints about the over staginess of the film ultimately fall by the wayside. In the hands of a master screenwriter, sure the script could have become more cinematic. But where do you find a writer comparable to Wilson?
 Fences is a tragic vision of a man who suffered the indignities growing up in a racist America but was also his own worst enemy. Unlike agitprop about chauvinistic black cultural pride in (recent) movies such as Black Panther, Wilson isn't afraid to paint a negative portrait of a black man done in not by the external forces of racism but by his own hubris.
 Troy is a complicated man as he has many likable attributes. Chief among them is his hard work ethic. Despite being a raised by a father who continually beat him and ending up serving 15 years in the penitentiary for armed robbery, Troy straightened his life out and now is a sanitation worker whom isn't afraid to stick up for what's right, Labeled as a troublemaker on the job, he manages to overcome the discrimination he encounters and is hired as Pittsburgh's first black driver for the Department of Sanitation).
 But clearly Troy has a big chip on his shoulder, embittered by being a successful Negro Leagues baseball player but not selected by the major leagues since he was playing at a time before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. It's revealed however that he was already too old to break into the majors but conveniently ignores this fact when disparaging baseball for not giving him a chance. His pettiness is fully on display when he ""disses"" the current crop of black ballplayers whom he regards as having inferior skills to those he had in his heyday.
 Troy has an older son from an earlier relationship, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), a struggling musician who often comes by on Friday (Troy's payday) and asks to borrow small amounts of money. Troy believes in ""tough love"" and refuses to give him any money, until his current wife Rose (Viola Davis) intervenes.
 Much worse is Troy's treatment of his younger son, Cory (Jovan Adepo), who has the opportunity of obtaining a football scholarship but is thwarted by Troy, who doesn't want to see his son fail as he did, in an unsuccessful career in sports. At the climax, Troy and Cory have a physical altercation and Cory leaves home.
 Troy's biggest transgression is betraying Rose, his wife of 18 years. He confesses he's having an affair with a younger woman, Alberta, who is now pregnant. The big dramatic moment of the narrative takes place when it's revealed that Alberta dies in childbirth and after bringing his infant daughter Raynell home, Rose agrees to raise her as her own.
 A subplot involving Troy's brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), a mentally ill man who sustained a head injury during World War II, highlights another aspect of Troy's conflicts. He uses the brother's disability payment from the Army to purchase his house and later has his brother committed-again gaining money at the brother's expense.]
 Much of Gabe's dialogue is meant symbolically, as he is some kind of angelic harbinger (announcing Troy's entrance into heaven at film's end). Despite slow-pacing, the denouement clearly ends on a hopeful, positive note. When Cory tells Rose he doesn't intend to attend his father's funeral, Rose changes his mind, indicating that she has forgiven Troy for all his faults.
 In comparing a Tony Awards clip from the 80s of James Earl Jones playing Troy, I am much more partial to Denzel Washington, who seems much more believable as an ""American-bred"" character than the classically trained Jones. Viola Davis won the Best Supporting Actress for Fences due to her powerful performance. Special mention should be made of Stephen McKinley Henderson as Bono, who complements Washington as Troy's confidant and moral conscience (it's Bono who urges Troy not to cheat on his wife and hurt her).
 In the hands of a master screenwriter, Fences could have been perhaps a more visual, cinematic experience. Nonetheless, as stated before, the material is so fine and the acting so powerful, that Fences still remains up there in the pantheon of classic American cinema."
FENCES,25 February 2017,8/10,"I said during my review of 'Moonlight' that some undeserving films were being nominated at the Academy Awards this year because of last year's #Oscarssowhite controversy. 'Fences' is not one of those films. 'Fences' is entirely deserving of all four awards it has been nominated for. As for actually winning them it may be a different matter, but the nominations are unquestionable. It's a film that is very simple at its core. Almost the entire film takes place in one setting, and there's really only one notable plot point that occurs throughout the entire film, and yet somehow the nearly 140 minute run time never seems to drag. The reason is the strength of the characters. They are real and they are brought to life fantastically by a terrific cast.Both Denzel Washington and Viola Davis have been nominated for Academy Awards in the Lead Role and Supporting Role respectively. Washington was truly brilliant. He was given some terrific dialogue to work with and then somehow managed to make it even better. He was captivating in every scene and I would not be unhappy, nor surprised, to see him upset Casey Affleck and take home the award. There has been a little bit of controversy surrounding Davis' role being considered ""Supporting"". She does have a tremendous amount of screen time to be considered in that category it has to be said. For this reason she is going to take home the award with out any trouble. No one playing a genuine supporting role could ever compete with the amount Davis has to be work with here. That category is an absolute shambles almost every year and needs to be sorted out.I really enjoyed 'Fences'. There probably wasn't enough to it for me to ever watch again, but it's a film that I'm happy I got to see. Simplicity can be a films biggest strength, or its biggest weakness depending on how it is utilised. For 'Fences' it was a strength. A pleasurable watch."
FENCES,18 December 2016,8/10,"A very strong emotional performance by the great Denzel Washington, not his best per say but it gives us everything we love about this great actor. A well driven vehicle for Washington as well as well made by Washington who also directed the film.Denzel and Viola Davis were a pretty outstanding combination. It seems like a no brainier that one day these two would work together on this level and here it is. It was worth seeing just to see these two as a couple going through their hard times.It's a very basic movie, despite putting some money into the CGI to make it look like the 1950s, it all takes place in one area and relies a lot on the experience actors and the performances they give, so little is done to change the tone. It really feels like the movie is giving us a Broadway production.It was also very gritty. Denzel and Viola gave some real life to these characters. It's very rare that you get the movie star whose also an actor and he's unafraid to open up, but that's what Denzel does and so did Viola, just not afraid to let it all hang out for the role. Worth seeing to see some real craftsmanship in acting. It was a great movie adaption to a great play. http://cinemagardens.com"
FENCES,2 February 2017,8/10,"Fences is a filmed version of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize winning play. Troy Maxson(Denzel Washington) is a retired Negro league baseball player seething with regret and anger because of the pre-Jackie Robinson era rules barring the participation of black men in the national past time. Instead of fame and fortune, Troy earns his living as a sanitation worker. One of his sons shows promise as a high school football player with the opportunity of a college scholarship. Troy constantly lectures the family of their continuing oppression by white society in all areas of life. Rose(Viola Davis) is subjected to a constant barrage of ""what if's"" and ""poor me"" by her angry and unpleasant husband. Later on, Troy makes a startling confession to Ruby, which leads to an Academy Award stealing scene by Viola Davis. Denzel is great,as usual, and does a fine directing job. Fences is easily one of the ten best movies of the year."
FENCES,6 February 2017,6/10,"""Fences"" is a movie that made me feel sorry for black people. Not for the characters on screen, who weren't really believable as ""people"", but for the actors playing them. You might wonder how it is possible to feel sorry for a filthy rich movie star like Denzel Washington, or even Viola Davis, who may not have quite his level of wealth, but is cherished for her ability as a thespian to at least the same regard.The answer is, that although Washington in particular has the money and clout to do whatever he wants, he is still apparently hamstrung by the colour of his skin in regards to what he is allowed to make of his career. Hell, he directed this movie as well as starred in it, and he couldn't even get a decent role for himself. I realised over the course of the movie's lengthy run-time that black people in movies don't just play characters. They play a shade of all black people out there. Washington is at first entirely believable as a washed up ex-baseball great who didn't make it, but then his one- note performance soars and soars and soars and you get the picture: he's not just a bitter never-was, he's All Black Men in That Situation, every talented man of colour who was unable to achieve his dreams because of the politics of race.Davis, of course, gets a double whammy: she's not only All Black Women, but All Women, period. Hers is probably the best performance in the movie. Too bad it doesn't give her anything to do we haven't seen before in every movie with a clashing father and son - or just every movie with a family. Of course, she's the Female Voice of Reason. Her being black means she's filled with self-righteous anger and fire also.What we have is the makings of a good B+ movie. Good actors in good performances, treading a well-worn path. The trouble is the film is stretched beyond breaking point, laying bare its stagey shortcomings. You realise you're watching a movie, then you realise it was based on a play, then you realise the play was less about real people than broad archetypes.When Mykelti Williamson, playing a character named Gabriel, arrives with a trumpet at the movie's end, that bit of metaphorical silliness is overlooked. The movie's archetypal pretend-characters are standing in the way."
FENCES,28 December 2016,6/10,"I saw ""Fences"", starring Denzel Washington-The Equalizer, He Got Game; Viola Davis-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, Law Abiding Citizen; Mykelti Williamson-The Purge:Election Year, Con Air and Stephen Henderson- Lincoln, Law & Order_tv.This is a movie that is based on a 1987 play, written by August Wilson and it is directed by Denzel Washington. It's about an African/American father-Denzel-trying to raise his family in the 1950's as he deals with race relations. Anyone familiar with the era knows it was not a particularly good time for African/Americans. Denzel was a baseball player and not too shabby at it. Problem was, he was in his 40's by the time blacks were being allowed to play, so he missed his chance to be in the big leagues. Now, he works as a sanitation collector, riding on the back of a truck, dumping garbage cans into the back of the truck. His goal is to one day be able to drive the truck. Viola is his wife of 20 years, with 2 kids-One with her and one from a previous relation. Mykelti is his brother, who was wounded in WW 2 and is now disabled with a head wound-he can get around alright but he is not quite all there in the mind department, having hallucinations and talking to 'Hell Hounds'. Stephen plays Denzel's best friend and co-worker that likes to give him advice on life. I have never seen the play but Denzel has performed in it over 100 times-That's why he wanted to direct it. The performances of everyone are all pretty good and I can see several of the actors getting Oscar nods next year. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes. Although this is not my favorite type of movie-I prefer the action packed variety-it does have some powerful performances. I wouldn't buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental."
FENCES,30 December 2016,8/10,"The dog days of August Wilson's play ""Fences"" about a a 1940's Pittsburgh Afican-American family has been adapted to the silver screen, and the Denzel has taken the helm. Mr. Washington directed the movie ""Fences"" and stars as Troy Maxson, a Pittsburgh garbageman in innner city Pittsburgh who goes through a mid-life crisis. Viola Davis co- stars as Rose Maxson, Troy's supportive wife. There are more actors that crossed the fence into this film including: Stephen McKinley Henderson as Troy's BFF & fellow garbageman Jim Bono, Jovan Adepo as the Maxson's teenage son Cory, Russell Hornsby as Troy's eldest son Lyons, and Mylketi Williamson as Troy's mentally-disabled brother Gabriel. Even though it was a little weary at times, Washington's direction was staged as an actor's showcase, and none of these actors disappointed. Washington and Davis are pretty much assured of Oscar acting nominations with their fiery performances, and deservingly so. McKinley Henderson was outstanding as Bono, as was Hornsby as Lyons. August Wilson's screenplay adaptation of his play was quite impressive; a powerhouse scribe. But I have to go back to playing the Violains; because it was Ms. Davis' performance that I thought was the primary reason I think all of you should jump the fence and hold on to view ""Fences"". **** Good"
FENCES,29 December 2016,8/10,"Troy Maxson is a Pittsburgh garbageman and former Negro League superstar raising a wife and son during the 50s. Maxon is bitter man most of the time except Fridays like most working stiffs with the weekend ahead of him. Still, the inequality of being a black man even in the East nags but more specifically the fact he he never got his shot in the majors tears at him most. His loyal wife Rose knows how to handle him as she constantly has to step between Troy and his boys that he remains distant from. A male Cassandra he nixes everything from a television to his son's chances at a sport's scholarship. In a white man's world you have to be twice as good as he postures about responsibility before committing a huge faux pas and alienates his son even further. Director Washington has little latitude with a static stage play that basically takes place in a kitchen and a backyard but he does give the exteriors a solid 50s feel while turning up the tension in the small space he has to work with within over two hour running time. Three outstanding performances make up for the lack of space entirely.Washington goes yard as Maxson with a performance that surpasses his Malcolm X. Packing on a few pounds going gray on top he digs deep inside to give us a portrait of a man desperately trying to hold the center in a hostile world. As Rose, Viola Davis is both strong vulnerable and outstanding.at each conveying hurt without stridency, strength with restraint. Hovan Adepo as son Cory clearly holds his own with the pros who are giving career performances. His scenes with Washington are truly moving albeit quite painful to watch yet mesmerizing to witness.Fences as a film is a fish out of water. I saw a stage play of it in 1992 where the lead brought down the house and the immediacy was beyond compelling. Clearly out of its element Washington has done a highly commendable transfer to screen where Wilson's words resonate just as well and where great acting can be found in both arenas but most of all for hiring himself to play the lead."
FENCES,7 December 2017,9/10,"(Flash Review)As great painters brush vivid colors onto canvas, Fences brushes meaningful and vibrant dialog onto film that paints a deep emotional story of a man trying to reconcile his station in life during the mid- 50s when African Americans were starting to make significant strides with their civil rights. One could argue that he builds mental fences for himself that slow him from adapting to a changing world as life scenarios with his kids, work and wife illustrate those points. Overall, the storytelling is excellent as dialog around family dynamics rather than action moves the story; fitting as this was adapted from the stage. Even though the film was very stationary, the cinematography was crisp with rich colors. But the acting stole the show. Every character was exemplary and evoked an array of emotions. Acting and script at its best!"
FENCES,23 January 2020,8/10,Excellent film from Denzel Washington. It has a Woody Allen dialog driven feel but Denzel adds his touches to make it feel more like a play that it originally was.
FENCES,1 May 2020,3/10,"Just another life drama movie. This one is more of a play than a movie, majority of playtime is in one place."
FENCES,29 April 2021,7/10,"A realistic and compassion look at what it means to find your way as blacks in American society of the last century. Powerful dialogue delivered by actors at their best, especially Viola Davis and Denzel Washington."
FENCES,4 January 2017,10/10,"I had no knowledge whatsoever of the subject matter of ""Fences"", but I knew that Wilson was one of America's best playwrights, and his Denzel Washington's adaptation of his play is a superb work of art. ""Fences"" explores the different issues that affect an African American family in the 50's. Their present situation is the result of years of frustration, the result of social/racial complications. The head of the family is the most conflicted, and his ongoing anger and resentment causes plenty of friction between him and the various family members. When the film begins, we see that his main source of happiness is his relationship with his wife, Rose (Davis). They seem to adore each other. He has the support of Bono, a long-time friend, but things are not perfect because of problems with both of his sons.His son Cory seems to have the talent to become a professional athlete. He's ready to see some coaches and there's the possibility he will succeed. His father is not supportive at all because he fears Cory might face the same disappointments, so he keeps pushing Cory to be more practical and look for ways to find a source of income and stability in the future. Troy is unable to communicate with any of his relatives or friends beyond simple social interactions, sharing a drink, references to certain acts and the expected obligations for a man in his society.As the story progresses, we learn the source of Troy's anger. He tries to live a normal existence by holding on to his job and providing for his family. His son from a previous marriage is also a disappointment because he wants to pursue his dream of becoming a musician and refuses to find steady, menial employment. He's constantly depending on a loan or support from his father or girlfriend. Troy always objects to giving away money that he feels is not deserved. Still, Rose becomes a mediator and the family strained relationships manage to survive.Tempers rise to almost unbearable levels, and because of Troy's sudden need to find some remedy for unfulfilled aspects of his life, he crosses a line that will change his life forever. This is when the movie reaches what few movies accomplish. Davis and Washington have never been better. We completely believe they have shared a life, each trying their best to help the other. He, hanging to Rose, as if she was his only way not to die, both emotionally or physically. He believes he has done everything he's supposed to do, always sacrificing himself in the process, feeling as if he had to give up much for others' happiness. He genuinely loves Rose, but he really doesn't know or understand her.In the end, his life crumbles for what he has done. Most of the climatic scenes are raw and hard to see without getting emotional. Denzel gives a performance that surpasses anything he's done before and anyone else this year. He's able to communicate every possible emotion, from joy to utter despair. Davis is his equal match in every scene, having as much or more time than Denzel. The supporting cast is excellent, too.""Fences"" is an important play, one that deals with universal themes and is not afraid to show the good and the bad, the compromises couples are forced to make in order to keep going. The film is strong and likely to start a few conversations."
FENCES,16 December 2016,9/10,"Review (with Spoilers)Noted Actor(s)Troy (Denzel Washington) | Rose (Viola Davis) | Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) | Mr. Bono (Stephen Henderson) |Lyons (Russel Hornsby)StorylineWhen a boy is forced to become a man at 14, his life is basically trial and error. Such is the case with Troy Maxson. This boy, one of eleven, left home ventured out and only found trouble. Made a baby in the process, found a woman after he paid his debt to society, and then was on the straight and narrow. However, men get old. Women get old too. There comes a point where find yourself looking around at all you have, all you have obtained through purchase or loyalty, and ask is it enough? Is it enough to have a wife and two healthy boys? Is it enough to have a husband, a good relationship with your stepson and a healthy one with your own? Is it enough to have a girl who sticks by you and a dad who, after giving you some lip, will loan you money. Is it enough to have both parents in the house if one seems to treat you like an obligation when it comes to caring for you? We are told fences are made to keep things, or people, in or out. But it may just be possibilities too we are trying to keep at bay.Things To NoteThough initially upset by the idea of Viola Davis not going for the Best Actress nominations, with her role basically being part of softening and redeeming Troy, it makes sense for her to go for Best Supporting Actress. Even if she is the only woman we ever see.HighlightsIt's a Lean ProductionThough over two hours, with things mostly focused just on Troy and Rose, featuring some comic relief from Gabriel and Mr. Bono, this is a tight production. In fact, based off not having the privilege of seeing the play when Davis and Washington were in it, you could argue this is almost as direct of an adaptation you could get. There is no extra fluff, some spare characters whose place don't seem like they were in the original blueprints. Everything which needs to be a part of this story to tell it right, it's here, well oiled, and in working order.Mr. Washington and Ms. DavisWith that said, let's talk about the two main characters. Now, prepare for theatrical dramatic/comedic monologues a lot. Nearly half the time Washington speaks it isn't to have a conversation but to express the inner workings of Troy. Why Troy acts the way he does, why he did this stupid thing, him explaining why he wasn't in his oldest son's Lyons' life. In many ways, his role seems like it is straight from the stage, nothing changed but now he doesn't have to turn to the audience but just look in the camera. But, as much as he may get dramatic and bring tears to your eyes, maybe even think of the relationship you have with your own father if it isn't some ideal sitcom type, he is funny too. Though there ain't a review for it here, it reminds me of watching Joe Morton in Let Me Loose. For every sob story, there is a joke somewhere in between. Reminding you things have gotten somewhat better since then so no need for your pity. While things may still look hard, and certainly Troy may not have a white man's privilege, at least he isn't out on the streets homeless and alone.As for Davis, oh boy. I question sometimes when actors talk about being intimidated by the presence of another. Could it be that serious? Yet, as Davis performs against Washington, you begin to understand an actor's fear. Hell, a writer's fear of doing this woman justice. For while I can't recall a single role when Davis wasn't playing someone who is suffering, that is her bread and butter. So, with that, seeing her go against Denzel and really make it seem she has him on the ropes. The man who this play is centered around, it was something. She made you tremble as that one snippet about how Rose has been standing there with Troy gets expanded. As you come to terms with your own standing in life. What compromises you make for certain relationships to continue and how there has to be a point where you got to wonder if it is a compromise or have you given yourself over and only gotten the other person's burdens in return. Burdens you have no idea what to do with besides try to untangle only to find the other person makes knots after you thought you were done.The Peace of Being SimpleA small thing I think worth noting is Gabriel. Like Rose, she is what helps humanize and shape Troy. But, separate from Troy, it is also nice to see a character like Gabriel who maybe simple, but he is not stupid. For while, at times, he seems like a comic relief, it is through him we get some of the most touching moments. Especially the ending.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)A film which makes you think, reflect, and feel. I don't feel like I watch enough of those. So when films like this come along, it is like cleaning your palate. It is like, being reminded of what a quality drama can be, and how from the old to the young, it isn't unfair to expect every character to make an effort to not just connect with you but to make you feel something. Now, I might not have cried like I thought I would, but damn if this doesn't put some perspective on your life, maybe your daddy's life, and make you contemplate on your way home what you going to do about your life."
FENCES,14 March 2019,8/10,"The script here comes across as genuinely authentic, and as this is a period piece, must have entailed a very hard-won effort to write it as such. Because of that, this is an important piece historically. The acting is so good that even persons not usually attracted to this type of play-to-movie drama should easily be satisfied. There is so much heart!"
FENCES,9 January 2017,8/10,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Two of the year's most outstanding performances help to elevate a flawed but effective transition from stage to screen.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A bitter and angry man destroys himself and his family.JIM'S REVIEW: That gifted writer August Wilson's eloquence and poetic language remains intact in his 1983 Pulitzer Prize winning play and this 2016 film version. But the transfer from stage to screen does little to hide its theatrical origins. Except for some mighty fine acting, the emotional connection is somehow off balance because the filmmaking lacks the nuanced cinematic expertise it needs.Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is an embittered black man whose early dreams of a baseball career were dashed by age, alcohol, and discrimination. Now he works as a garbageman in 1950's Pittsburgh, providing for his family and never really finding true happiness for himself. He is estranged from one son from a former marriage, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), bullies and thwarts the hopes of another son who wants a football career, Cory (Jovan Adepo), and tolerates his brain-injured older brother, Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson). All the while, his close friend, Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), and Troy's devoted wife, Rose (Viola Davis), act as his conscience, supporting him unconditionally and giving him sage advice, of which he continually ignores.￼What works well in a live theater production does not transition as well as a film. The filmmaking is competent enough but too conventional. The filming is basically straight-on shots and severe close-ups. The one set look (the back yard of the Maxson's house) keeps the stagey quality front and center, although there are some different locations thrown in to break up the monotony. Much of the dialogue becomes too much allegory (Troy's baseball references, the building of the fence itself, the constant alluding to the devil and the Grim Reaper, etc.) and never has a gritty authenticity to be truly convincing. Yet these monologues are still powerfully performed despite the artificiality and contrived plot mechanics on screen.Mr. Washington is the film's director and he gives it a valiant try to open up this drama but he just can't resist the urge to heighten the melodrama rather than underplay it. His vision is, at times, heavy-handed and lacks the subtlety and pathos that the text deserves. Stronger directorial restraint would have made the film even more effective.￼But it is the superb acting that sets this film apart from the routine. Mr. Washington is astounding. His larger-than-life performance shows his character's pride and envy. The actor is not afraid to show the flaws in this man and Mr. Washington delivers his lines with the perfect tension and anger as he browbeats the people he loves. His Troy is far from likable, but one strangely feels empathy for this damaged man. Ms. Davis also has her moments of power and passion as she tries to cajole her husband and protect her son from her husband's self-hatred. Her confrontation scene with Mr. Washington is flawless. The ensemble is uniformly fine, especially Mr. Henderson who downplays his role with the right degree of compassion and strength.￼Fences is excessively theatrical, more than it needed to be, but the movie-going experience is still a highly rewarding and engrossing drama due to one of the best ensembles one will see this year."
FENCES,10 December 2020,8/10,"Austin Wilson wrote a play about a man of the 1950s (or the first half of the 20th century, more broadly). Denzel filmed it as a play about that man of the 1950s/20th century. But the people who buy tickets to see movies in 2016 have no more concept of the being alive in the 1950s than they do of being alive in 1850, 1750 or 1650. Never mind being BL@CK and alive in the 1950s.Troy Maxson represents the difficult transition from huge sharecropping families to the fractured families of the industrial north. From fighting for their own freedom in America to getting their heads ''half blown off"" fighting the war in Europe. From being barred from professional sports because of skin color to being recruited for college on football scholarships. There's much more, of course, both explicit and implied. But you have to pay attention.Maybe it helps to have had a father very much from the middle of the 20th century. Who faced discrimination. Who had to work hard for every scrap. Who understood responsibility. Who had to sacrifice. Who was distant. Who was demanding. And yes, who was flawed.This is a deeply intelligent and thoughtful character study faithfully brought to life by Denzel. I mean, I am as white as a snowdrift but I had no trouble seeing Troy Maxson as a fully realized man. You rarely see that in movies in the first place. And these days, forget it. People wanna see super-heroes and happy endings.The musical bed was so subtle I barely remember it. Which means it was probably top of the class. There is a complete lack of obvious Hollywood ''here's how to feel now"" shmaltz. The supporting characters were uniformly excellent. Maybe a half-point deduction for the ''magical n3gro"" trope represented by Uncle Gabe overall and certainly in his scene at the end. Personally, i don't think the movie needed it.I feel profound sadness for people who were looking for a sympathetic protagonist or were bored by the pace. I was riveted."
FENCES,28 December 2016,8/10,"Fences is my latest review. It is based on a play and at times, it feels as such. Fences is a talky picture, made somewhat for the stage with its extended group scenes and singular moments of standoff violence. Don't shy away though. This is still powerful stuff, with timed acting of the highest order.Denzel Washington stars, produces, and directs. His setting is 1950's Pittsburgh. With a Christmas Day release and Washington playing opposite an actress like Viola Davis, you can almost smell the Academy Award nominations coming around the corner. You can also taste the Iron City Beer as well as the bottle of slow gin that Denzel's main character (Troy Maxon) drinks on a regular basis.Washington works with about five locations in Fences such as the Maxon family home, the street said home is on, and a local bar. His direction is simplistically brilliant as he captures such an authentic sense of time and place. His cast (including himself) is saddled with heavy-handed dialogue that deems itself metaphoric in regards to race and the sport of baseball. Possessing gray stubble and a little extra weight put on, Denzel Washington gives maybe his best performance ever in the claustrophobic-like setting that Fences inhabits. He spits his lines like a pellet gun .177. His Maxon is a supporting father and shucked bastard all at the same time. Heck, Denzel Hayes Washington Jr. is flat out ferocious.Distributed by Paramount Pictures and containing a script adapted from famed playwright, August Wilson (it was completed right before his passing in 2005), Fences follows waste collector/promoted garbage driver, Troy Maxon (Washington). In his early days, Maxon was a Negro league baseball player. Even before that, he was a convicted murderer and robber who served some considerable time. Now Troy comes home from work to pal around with his best friend (Jim Bono played by Stephen Henderson), drink hard liquor, and reminisce about cheating pneumonia-related death as a youth.Watching Fences at a Tuesday screening, I wasn't sure how long the time frame was. There is an elongated flash-forward progression toward its conclusion. Otherwise, most of the events in Fences could have taken place anywhere between 1-2 years. Its screenplay by the late August Wilson, recycles itself over and over again throughout the duration of Fences (139 minutes). It still regains its freshness with scenes that crackle and captivate. There's conflict in this vehicle between father and son, father and estranged son, husband and wife, and friend to friend. The backyard baseball (on a rope) in Fences acts as a symbol. It's a reminder of better times and simpler times for the volatile Troy. In conclusion, I'm hoping that when the dust settles and the end of January rolls around, Fences will garner Oscar consideration for Washington (Best Actor), Davis (Best Actress), and even Mykelti Williamson (Best Supporting Actor) as Maxon's mentally impaired brother. Overall, Fences builds its own ""fence"" around almost everything that came out in 2016. It's a real winner. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
FENCES,28 February 2018,6/10,"Fences sported a great cast and sounded like it could have been a great film. However this film fails badly when it comes to plot and story. While there are some interesting moments, backstory and development that goes on here there is an absence of a decent plot. Fences also never hits the ground running and one cannot quite figure out what the film is about. There is so much unnecessary dialogue that is supposed to be reflective of the lifestyle but this adds no value but time. For a two hour film cutting out the futile bickering and trading it for more depth and richer dialogue could have been better. The acting is very good. Denzel is superb as a monstrous character and Viola Davis is terrific in her role as well. The supporting cast do a great job. The rating for this largely comes from the superb acting and talent demonstrated. Its a shame it was for such a weak story and disappointing film. 6/10"
FENCES,1 July 2018,7/10,"The entire cast shines in this movie about a man so filled with anger that he ruins his life, driving his friends and family away, after costing some of them, notably his son, a future. He simply cannot believe that anything good can happen without a price."
FENCES,19 January 2020,7/10,"Directed by Denzel Washington. Starring Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Jovan Adepo, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Mykelti Williamson, Saniyya Sidney. (PG-13)Film version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning August Wilson play (adapted by Wilson himself before his death, with additional uncredited work from Tony Kushner) is stagy to the point of distraction--rarely has cinematic equivalency felt so unambitious. Character study of a working class black family in the 50s is a good one, and it's performed with intense pride and commitment by the whole cast (showy at times, but forgivably so). Some of the meatiest movie roles that either Washington and Davis have ever tackled--they both previously nabbed Tonys for starring in the Broadway revival, and the latter won an Oscar--and the material they work with is often powerful, though it can also become long-winded and overwrought; scenes sometimes drag on beyond the moment that the point is made or emotion is reached, demonstrating that some things, which work just fine on stage, can become clumsy and meandering on screen. Far more savagely prudent editing could've elevated this one to near-great status, but as is, the parts that work tremendously well outweigh the unfortunate filler.69/100"
FENCES,3 July 2018,8/10,"The main feature of this movie is the superb acting of all the performers including the richness of the dialogues, Sometimes we feel not to be watching a movie but to be peering through some keyhole or a window at a real family life. The main characters are a couple of strong personalities, the wife a good spouse and the husband a man with a character with positive and negative deeds. All of them are black but besides some spoken words they utter now and then we don't feel much racial tension but not its exclusion either. This movíe is full of life, love, drama, solidariry and friendship. It is much moving and makes you be well with yourself after watching it."
FENCES,27 February 2018,8/10,"Get ready for a roller coaster ride into deeply personal territory with 'Fences' as it pulls no punches with its strait talking assaults on the senses. Multi award winning playwright August Wilson digs deep into the soul of 50's black America as it comes to terms with life in the hard lane. He is no stranger to this hardship and you can feel the pain from his past and the people he writes about in every scene. This is Eugene O'Neill and James Agee territory and would have been right at home with the thoughtful production works of David Susskind (All The Way Home '63/East Side West Side series). The movie maybe an uneasy watch for those who don't enjoy movies based on stage productions but for those who enjoy in-depth character studies, this will offer some challenging and rewarding viewing. It's longish at around 130 mins so leave yourself a little more time to roll with it as it flows. Performances and photography are equally dynamic with an engaging music score to add the right amount of punctuation. Recommended for serious viewing."
FENCES,20 July 2017,5/10,"Eighty minutes of non-stop talk (mostly by Denzel Washington's character) followed by 20 minutes of reflection (again), then some difficult emotional moments topped with a sprinkling of light.In other words, it's not an easy movie to watch, and many won't stay with it for all the blather - personal 'philosophy' - spouted by Troy Maxson (Washington), who's lived a hard life which he's obviously thought a lot about as he's ready to share it continuously whether anyone wants to hear it (again) or not. He does provide for his family, though oftentimes it appears resentfully, and does exhibit some grace in the caring for his disabled brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson, Bubba in Forrest Gump (1994)), though even that comes from a sense of obligation.Viola Davis plays Rose, a wife who's a blessing to him beyond his due. She has sacrificed herself for Troy, as she cleans up the debris of his harsh parenting of their sons and even his act of betrayal. Fortunately for Troy, Rose has a Christian faith from which she draws her strength, as she selflessly serves the family. Ms. Davis was brilliant and won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar while playing what is essentially a leading role in this film; she likely would not have beaten Emma Stone (La La Land (2016)) in that category.Not too much to recommend unless you like listening to people talk, or actors' act; if you watch movies to be entertained - or uplifted - stay away. There's little hope here."
FENCES,25 February 2017,10/10,"In 1950's Pittsburgh, Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) lives with his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and their son Cory (Jovan Adepo), and works as a waste collector alongside his best friend, Jim Bono (Stephen Henderson). Troy's younger brother, Gabriel Maxson (Mykelti Williamson), sustained a head injury in World War II that left him mentally impaired, for which he received a $3,000 government payout that Troy used to purchase a home for his family. Gabriel has since moved out, but still lives in the neighborhood, where he is often tormented by the local children.In his adolescence, Troy left home and became a robber to sustain himself. After killing a man during a robbery led him to prison, he met Bono and revealed himself to be a talented baseball player. He then played in the professional Negro Leagues, but never made it to Major League Baseball. Although it is likely that he was rejected due to his advanced age, Troy firmly believes he was passed over due to the color of his skin. Having survived a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in his youth, Troy claims to have done so by defeating the Grim Reaper in a fistfight, upon which the Reaper vowed to return for a rematch.Troy's estranged son from a previous relationship, Lyons Maxson (Russell Hornsby), infrequently visits him to borrow money, upsetting Troy, whose belief in responsibility rejects Lyons' pursuing his dream of becoming a musician instead of finding a real job – Troy refuses to even visit the bar where his son's band is playing. Rose later tells Troy that Cory is being scouted by a college football team, but Troy is dismissive of Cory's chances of reaching the NFL. Not only is he stung by his own lack of success in baseball, but he believes that racial discrimination is still common in the major leagues. He tells Cory that he will not sign the permission documents if the college recruiter visits their home. He does not want his son to fail as he did, but there is also some jealousy that Cory might achieve the success that had eluded his father.Rose asks Troy to build a fence around their house, and Troy demands that Cory help him as punishment for Cory not doing his chores due to football practice. Troy and Cory clash over Cory's ambitions to play college football. On learning that Cory is not working at his part-time job due to football practice, Troy demands that he return to the job, despite Cory's attempts to convince him that the job is being held for him until football season is over."
FENCES,13 October 2018,7/10,"An American drama; A story about a working-class African-American father trying to raise his family in the 1950s, while coming to terms with the events of his life.
This is a stately and beautifully acted drama with exteriors beautifully photographed in a sunlit setting. It's a wordy play, but rich and intelligent. The two lead performances are excellent and played with great integrity. There is one speech by a father to his son which is very memorable about the difference between being liked versus responsibility and duty which is truly memorable.Fences the film is solidly crafted, a credit to its Pulitzer-winning source material. The film is not cinematic, and perhaps Washington is at times overpowering because it is a stagey production, but it is a true performance. Wilson's dialogue is soulful, authentic and timely with a cadence that's strict to the sound of black urban communities of the 1950s - a superb Academy Award winning performance."
FENCES,2 July 2017,8/10,"Featuring an all-black cast, Fences is a deeply riveting domestic drama that celebrates the talent of Denzel Washington in both the acting and directorial department. Sitting in the director's chair for the first time in over a decade, Washington makes a diligent effort both in front and behind the camera to bring August Wilson's Broadway play of the same time to life on the silver screen. His efforts not only embrace the beauty of Wilson's spectacular theatrical project but effectively shed a bright life on the foibles of the African-American culture during the pre-Civil Rights era when segregation between whites and blacks defined American society. It's only too bad that Wilson who wrote the script here passed away a little over a decade prior to this production. The basis of this historical drama is a story that trims away from action in favor of a dialogue-driven narrative, an effort that focuses on the study of one man struggling to make sense of life in a world where the African-American community were victim of shallow opportunities. Set in the 1950s, this film stars Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, a black garbageman raising his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family includes his stay-at-home wife Rose (played by Viola Davis), his impaired war veteran brother Gabriel (played by Mykelti Williamson), and his teenage son Cory (played by Javon Adepo) who's set to play college football. When Cory is given the opportunity, his hard-nosed father brushes it off as of result of his disillusionment for not being able to play Major League Baseball at the right age before blacks were being accepted in the league. The tensions between him, Cory, and Rose soon become more heated when they learn some dark secrets about his past.""Some fences are built to keep people out, others are built to themselves in"", a quote by Denzel Washington's character that signifies the premise of his historically resonated drama. This play-based film operates with the story that cradles the history of the troubled race relations that confined many families in the black community in a cage lacking of life opportunities and short of social prosperity. The focus here is not on based on a true story but instead a character study of a man with intense complexity that greatly unravels throughout the story's proceeding. Denzel Washington adopts the role of Troy Maxson who dreams of his family, especially his son, to succeed in life but his deeply perplexing personality not only places a strain on his family, but leaves audiences to discover he is definitely not a great man as he seems. While he evolves into a somewhat unlikable figure, he nonetheless grows into an interesting character. He's plagued with many flaws that define him as a character, and when a secret of his past finally meets the ears of his beloved wife, things take a turn for the worse. The scene in which this happens marks one of the film's most emotional landmarks. Denzel Washington and Viola in particular, are the revelation of the film's emotional crux. The subtle, yet cutthroat dialogue delivered by Washington quickly grabs your attention each scene after another, and the emotionally-charged delivery by Davis is gut-wrenching. The emotional chemistry between the two and his son is powerful enough to the point where it is easy to forget you are watching a movie adapted from a play. Washington's direction certainly ignites the feel of an onstage play, but his execution of the domestic tension in each scene wrings a high-strung sense of authenticity from start to finish. Unlike some cinematic entities where the action is firmly confined to talking, this film succeeds on operating with snappy dialogue without feeling the need ignite an action set piece to lasso one's attention. Fences is a powerfully rewarding play-based drama helmed by the wildly appealing directorial and acting talent by Denzel Washington, as well as Viola Davis in her powerhouse performance. The movie may feel like a play, especially as it is edited like a play. But does that make it any less powerful? Absolutely not. Washington shines with incredible talent, a talent that more than deserves widespread attention."
FENCES,21 February 2017,7/10,"Fences is not a movie that will conquer everyone, it is a film that only has dialogues, they are great, but that alone does not support a film, Denzel Washington sends well in the direction, but it shines even in the act, deserved the indication to Oscar, Viola Davis, who is the favorite for the Oscar actress, is great, she and Naomie Harris are my favorites, the rest of the cast is very competent, the script is very good, the pace is slow, and the film can be tiring For most people, the soundtrack is good, the picture is beautiful, the story of the film is beautiful too, the chemistry between Denzel Washington and Viola Davis works very well, so much so that they can carry the film, that was one of the reasons Fences is an interesting film, full of dialogues, great performances of the protagonist, and a very good direction of Denzel, I recommend. Note 7.3"
FENCES,28 July 2018,6/10,"'Fences' is a reasonably good drama film that benefits from some excellent acting performances, especially from Denzel Washington as lead character Troy. It's a raw and realistic film that focuses heavily on character and story development and dialogue. Normally this would be good to see, but 'Fences' goes overboard and the excessive dialogue and running length works to the film's disadvantage.Many of the scenes of extended dialogue have little or no significance to the storyline and the film wouldn't have suffered if they had just been cut out altogether. The characters are also difficult to connect and sympathise with, especially Washington's character Troy, even though this is a character-driven drama. As a result it can be a struggle to stay interested for the full duration of the film, and I must admit that I found myself drifting off on more than one occasion."
FENCES,20 March 2018,7/10,"Based on the play by August Wilson: in 1950s Pittsburgh, the story centres on Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) and his family and friends. Troy is a troubled soul who believes life has given him a bad deal due to his race but his big breaks might have been missed due to other circumstances including his own misgivings. This causes a lot of family tension.The effect of the scenes in this film vary: some are quite moving and engaging while others are too long. Troy has a troubled relationship with his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo). At the film's beginning, this conflict plus Troy's inner conflict seem like promising material but during the film's long run, both of these conflicts seem to flatten and go nowhere despite the length of time they have to resolve themselves. Such criticisms might justify a maximum rating of two-and-a-half stars. But there are enough virtues in this film to raise the rating. These include the other scenes two of which stand out.The final scene is the perfect conclusion of all that has taken place before it. It's quite moving and leaves a lump in the throat. The film's greatest scene, however, takes place in the second half when Troy has a confrontation with his wife Rose (Viola Davis). Both of these experienced performers are at their peak and they play off each other superbly. If there were an award category for Best Scene in a Film, this one would certainly qualify as a nominee.In addition to Washington and Davis, there are also fine performances from Adepo and Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother, a World War II veteran who was mentally damaged during the war."
FENCES,3 April 2017,6/10,"Was the cast excellent, yes. Was the storyline incredibly emotional and fraught with tension, yes. In the first fifteen minutes the language just about did me in. All that in a PG-13 movie? Left a bad taste in my mouth. Ooohwee no one can ugly cry like Viola Davis, she deserved the Oscar imho. Wow. I cannot imagine performing this material on the stage eight times a week. Kudos. Good but not great is my final verdict."
FENCES,7 February 2018,6/10,"Very strong and in depth story but the flavor of theatre remained strong as well. So much that I guessed it was a play at first. In a play, talk is king, and it is what we get. Good film anyway, but I admit I did snooze a few minutes and I did not care to rewind to see, or rather hear, what I missed."
FENCES,3 January 2017,9/10,"When Denzel makes a movie, you run and see it. He's that kind of actor. Fences is his take on a August Wilson stage play. It's all about the dialogue. Like Glengarry Glen Ross, you'll enjoy every last word you'll hear from the characters's mouths. But then, there's the delivery of those incredible words in the performances of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, which triumph above any of the performances we've seen in 2016. They give it their all, and they blow the house down. Denzel, who has historically given fantastic performances, once again proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is the best actor of his generation, and completely destroys it as Troy Maxson. He plays a complicated working-class father who bitterly clings to the old days of his success as a Negro-Leauge baseball star. He blames the whole world for all of his problems, never is satisfied with what he has, and takes out his rage on his loving wife and son, who begin to question his angry ways. Viola Davis as Rose Maxson, however, is the performance of this film that has the entire film world talking. She completely upstages Denzel, and gives a performance that must take home an Oscar this year. Seriously, no funny business, Academy. What a powerhouse performance. Watching her was an amazing experience. This is a performance driven film, for the record, so there shouldn't be much emphasis on the cinematic flaws (if any), or the visual scope. Just focus on the words, and focus on the actors, and you will see the magic of Fences."
FENCES,3 January 2017,7/10,"I've never seen Antoine Fischer but I have seen The Great Debaters, as far as Denzel Washington's directional efforts go. The Great Debaters was good, a very interesting project. Fences comes along during award season hype and some of the performances were getting rave reviews. Naturally, being the cinephile I am, I had to see it for myself to form my opinion on the film and performances.The film is based on a play and is about a man named Tony and his wife Rose and their relationships with their children, friends, and family as time goes on. The problem is Tony and his son do not get along and there seems to be respectful animosity between the two. The film also deals with issues like blue collar working life, the changing times, infidelity, and the limitation of career opportunities for black people in the 1950s. The setting of the film is very contained, I'd say 85% of the film takes place in the backyard of the Maxon house. I'm sure this is how the stage is set in the play and I found it to be perfectly okay. The film is based on its subject matter, delivery, and acting performances. Without having read the play, I'd say Denzel has done a respectable job of adapting this play.I think one thing can always go without saying and that is that Viola Davis is so good. Even in a film as bad as Suicide Squad you couldn't fault her for her convincing performance. She's rather excellent in this. She becomes a real force towards the end of the film. Denzel Washington is a very reliable actor, in that you can expect him to bring a convincing portrayal to the screen. His Tony Maxon is very unlikable. I'd say he starts off being a middle aged, hard working man who wants to support his family. He seems likable in the beginning with his wise cracks and metaphorical wisdom. As the film rolls along its hard to enjoy his tough love antics, infidelity, and sheer arrogance. At times he's a pompous asshole who you just want to punch. Tony is unlikable and I think it warrants great credit to Denzel for bringing that emotion to his character. Side note, I also really liked seeing Russel Horsnby in the film, love him on Grimm.The film is quite long, honestly its a little too long. The film could have been more effective if it were concise and condensed. It still manages to remain interesting, even if you don't identify or agree with the characters. I'd say Tony's character is not only flawed but a certain event (or two) seem really out of turn writing-wise, that I wonder if he is written the exact same way in the play. I think we can expect Viola Davis to be up there in the running for an Oscar. As far as the film goes, its carried by excellent performances and strong source material even though everything else is not always perfect.7/10"
FENCES,8 March 2019,6/10,"Before going into this film, I knew it was based on a play of the same name. Of course, even if I didn't know this, I could have told you it was based on a play. Perhaps that's what kept bugging me throughout this movie: it was clearly a play. I could see in my mind's eye how it would look on the stage, which wasn't helped by the actors' cadence and almost continual monologues. If I wanted to see this as a play, I'd see it as a play; I watch a movie to get a more well-rounded experience.So, aside from this film being an almost direct adaptation of the play it's based on, the next thing that caught my attention was how many tropes were contained in the plot. Honestly, with topics like mental health, marital infidelity, inter-generational conflict, and death, the plot didn't seem that original to me at all. Add to this, one of the main characters (Denzel Washington's Troy Maxon) who rambles nonsense half the time and just straight-up poor decisions the other half of the time, and I had trouble even paying attention to what was happening. Life cannot be so simply condensed to baseball metaphors.Of course, while many elements in this movie irked me, the total of their parts ended up being somewhat tolerable. This was mainly due to the stellar performance by Viola Davis, which earned her the Best Actress Oscar. By the end of the film, despite very few surprises, the finale is at least satisfying and fitting. I'm just disappointed that more of the extensive and immersive capabilities of movies weren't utilized to bring this plot a greater depth than just a one-for-one transfer from the stage.A theater play wrapped in a film's skin, I give Fences 3.0 stars out of 5."
FENCES,12 January 2017,6/10,"It is very difficult to open a dialogue driven play into a movie. When it's done successfully you have Evita, Les Mis, and Chicago. When it's not opened and trapped within the play you have Fences. It feels like you are watching a filmed play. Close ups of the side of the stars heads aren't enough and eventually become a distraction.August Wilson is a great writer. The performances are excellent, especially Viola Davis who should reap a slew of awards for her work. Set in the mid fifties, things seem a bit dated. The movie is too long. Troy the main character is gone but the movie drags on. Nearly everything is communicated through dialogue. Rose telling Troy about the Baby and mother is such a flaw. The kid coming home for the funeral and making an issue about not going feels too written. Why come home if you haven't been there in six years and plan not to go.The performances make this worth seeing. If you see this in a theater wear comfortable clothes. It will play well on home platforms."
FENCES,13 January 2017,7/10,"Usually, when I say a film is a ""must watch in the movie theater"", I mean it is big and loud and flashy with incredible special effects with (probably) not the most intricate of plots.  FENCES is a ""must watch in the movie theater"" film for just the opposite reason.  It is small, intimate, without much in the way of action, but filled with raw emotion and tremendous acting that requires rapt attention so a nuanced raise in the eyebrow is meaningful and the viewing of this film at home with all the distractions (your phone, your dog, the kids, getting up to get food, killing cockroaches) will be a detriment.For this slow moving, slow burn film about Troy Maxon, a former, embittered, Negro League baseball player who is trying to ""get by"" in Pittsburgh in the late 1950's, is based on the Broadway revival of August Wilson's 1987 Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name and the film unfolds like you are watching a stageplay with all of the inherent plusses and minuses of this sort of thing.Let's start with the performances, which are terrific. both Stephen McKinley Henderson and Russell Hornsby reprise their Broadway roles and provide strong supporting turns as Troy's best friend and oldest child, respectively.  They have to be on their game for they are up against the Tony Award winning performances of Denzel Washington as Troy (more on him later) and the great Viola Davis as Rose, Troy's long suffering wife.  Davis is - no surprise here - nothing short of terrific in this role.  Her Rose is a real person with ups and  downs, quirks and flaws and they are all on display here.  Davis brings a naturalness and grounding to her role that is a much needed anchor.  Her performance recently brought her  a Golden Globe Award and I guarantee it will bring her an Academy Award nomination - and probably a win.The surprise for me in this film is Mykelti Williamson (you know, Bubba from Forrest Gump) reprising his Broadway turn as Gabriel, Troy's brother who was injured in WWII.  This part could easily be a caricature of a handicapped person but Williamson brings an innocence, strength and dignity to this role, characteristics that are needed to round this character into a real - albeit troubled - person.As for Washington, as the center of this story, he is a force to be reckoned with.  His Troy is a fast talker, alternating between joy and sorrow, happiness and sadness, triumph and tragedy - all tinged with an underlying ANGER that seethes (and sometimes bubbles over) throughout the film.  Washington, who also directed this film, is very good in this role, relying on his inherent charm to help us, the viewer, to forgive him his trespasses - and there are many.  The one thing that bugged me whilst watching this is that I felt that this character needed to be a larger physical presence than Washington is.  I sensed that this part was written for an aging, burly man who's muscles are slowly transforming into flab.  When looking up the original Broadway cast in 1987, I see that James Earl Jones played this part, and that makes sense to me.As for Washington's direction, it is workmanlike and professional and not much else.  He plants his camera on his actors so that these people can carry this film.  As a Director, I sensed that Washington just didn't want to get in the way of the performances. and he hasn't, he just hasn't added to them as well.  This movie feels like a filmed play - and that's okay - but it knocks this film down a star or two, for I am judging it as a FILM and not a PLAY.  The PLAY is terrific, the FILM is ""good"".The play, FENCES, is the 6th in August Wilson's 10 play ""Pittsburgh Cycle"" that explores the African-American experience in the 21st Century.  Washington has stated that he plans on filming all 10 of these plays.  If FENCES is any indication, we  shall have Oscar- caliber performances to look forward to for years to come, I just hope we end up having FILMS to watch and not just filmed PLAYS.Letter Grade ""B""7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
FENCES,29 October 2017,4/10,"An overlong boring movie which would be more suited to the stage or the radio. Set in the 1950's we are punished to endure over 2 hours examining the life of a loser garbage collector with a criminal record who is cruel to his family who are forced to put up with him. Yes super performance from the cast and excellent screenplay, that is why I gave a vote above the lowest; yet film-makers need to realize that generally speaking pictures are a visual medium and pure talk simply is not enough nor entertaining.4/10."
FENCES,2 January 2017,5/10,"Fences. They can be used to keep people out or to keep people in. Or both. And they don't have to be about people at all. Fences can help keep pets in or keep out prying eyes or even keep out something more nebulous. That's where fences start to become less physical reality and more allegory. We often build metaphorical fences between other people and ourselves and even within our own minds, as a way of separating ideas, memories or aspects of our personalities that cannot peacefully coexist. Many of these scenarios play out in the drama ""Fences"" (PG-13, 2:18). The film is based on a play by the late August Wilson and is the sixth play in his 10-part ""Pittsburgh Cycle"". The play ""Fences"" won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award in 1987, with original Broadway cast members James Earl Jones and Mary Alice winning individual Tonys, and Frankie Faison and a 17-year-old Courtney B. Vance earning nominations. A Broadway revival in 2010 won Tonys for the play and for its two leads, Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Yes, ""Fences"" has been a very successful play, but it falls short in its transition to the big screen.The setting is an African-American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both the 20th century and main character Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) are both in their mid-50s. Troy is a strong man – both in his body and in his demeanor. He works as a trash collector, but wonders aloud why only white men get to do the driving, while black man are always relegated to lifting the garbage cans. And that's not the only racial issue that preoccupies Troy. He had been a star in the Negro Leagues before World War II, but never made it to the majors. In spite of Jackie Robinson and others breaking down barriers in professional baseball, Troy is convinced that he didn't get a shot because of the color of his skin. At least, that's the story he tells when talking with his long-time best friend and co-worker, Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Troy's wife, Rose (Viola Davis), injects herself into Troy's most recent trip down Glory Day Lane, saying that Troy isn't playing major league baseball because of his age.Troy and Rose have been married for 18 years and are very much in love. It shows in their playful banter, their public displays of affection and their steadfast commitment to one another. They have a son together, a 17-year-old named Cory (Jovan Adepo), who is a star high school football player and is being recruited to play college ball. Troy also has a son from his first marriage, a man named Lyons (Russell Hornsby), who is a struggling musician and sometimes stops by Troy's house to borrow money (and has to put up with Troy's criticisms before getting the money he needs). Troy is also dealing with his mentally-challenged younger brother, Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), who suffered a head injury in the war and now roams the streets ""chasing hellhounds"", sometimes personally visits Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, and always carries a trumpet, slung over his shoulder by a rope, so he's always ready to tell Peter when he needs to open those gates. Troy's life isn't an easy one, but he makes the best of it.Troy is more of a talker than a doer. He does what he needs to do to care for his family, but has a hard time going beyond what's necessary when it comes to expressing emotions like love and acceptance. He's very good at telling people how to live their lives, but doesn't always live up to his own ideals. As Troy might say it (if he were criticizing someone else), he's good at the plate when he's psyching out the pitcher, but not so good with his follow through. For example, it takes him a very long time to build a fence that Rose wants around the yard. Both physically and metaphorically, Rose wants the fence to keep people in, while Troy eventually completes it to keep people out – including the grim reaper which Troy talks about as if he were a person, one with which Troy has done battle in the past – and will again.""Fences"" is wonderfully acted, but too talky to be an excellent film. The characters and the story in the original play are engaging and Washington's direction brings all that onto the big screen very successfully, but he chooses not to take it further. For example, he unnecessarily limits himself to too few locations in telling the story, references characters which he never shows and talks about incidents which we never see. Plays and movies each show us what they can in their own way. Movies can show the audience more, but this one fails to take advantage of that advantage. However, this story does us all a service in shedding light on the seldom examined 20th century African-American experience and giving us characters to which many Movie Fans can relate – and learn from – regardless of racial divides. I just wish Washington had used his impressive cast and his chosen medium to tell the story with less talk and more vibrancy. In spite of this movie's award-worthy performances, this story would have been better off if, rather than the Hollywood side, it had stayed on the Broadway side of the fence. ""B-"""
FENCES,5 January 2017,8/10,"The extraordinary play by August Wilson is brought to the big screen by Denzel Washington who stars and directs. Viola Davis co-stars in a powerful performance. As the movie is based on a play the location in primarily focused in the backyard of the house and a few rooms. Still, the movie packs a powerful punch with emotion and deep contemplation of universal issues.Troy Maxson (Washington) is a garbage man working hard each day trying to move up in the world to a simple garbage truck driver but the racism of the fifties holds him back. He works hard for a small amount of pay and has to use this money to pay for his house and other expenses. He works with his friend Bono (Stephen Henderson) and comes home every Friday to share a bottle of gin in the backyard. The dialogue fills in the rest of the story and Washington is brilliant with lines that pop and utilize the actors best abilities. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
FENCES,18 March 2017,6/10,"In ""Fences"" Denzel Washington plays Troy – a bitter, self-centred and selfish man in his mid-fifties who loves the sound of his own voice. They say ""empty vessels make the most noise"" and here is a case in point. Set in the early fifties, race plays a strong card in every aspect of life, and Troy feels betrayed by a failed baseball career that – in his eyes at least – looked over his skills to the colour of his skin. But Troy is also a stubborn cuss, and refuses to acknowledge that even in the 50's ""The times they are a changing'"". His cussedness puts him on a collision course with his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo), given his aspirations for a college football scholarship, and his mother (Viola Davis, ""The Help"") tries to keep the peace between the two of them.This is a film primarily about resistance to change. All those changes in the outside world are on the 'other side of the fence' that Troy habitually tries to finish but never seems to put his mind to. Fences keep things out; but they also keep things in, and Troy is in a cocoon of his own making. He justifies his actions as a 'family provider' with lengthy speeches but ultimately they deliver hollow words and assertions that don't stand up to scrutiny.This is a pressure cooker of family life that is primed to blow, and a revelation (which I didn't see coming) sets that fuse alight.This is a film worth watching for the acting performances of Denzel Washington and (particularly) Viola Davis, winner of the Best Supporting Actress BAFTA and a strong contender for the Oscar. Both give assured performances, although Troy is such an instantly dis- likable and pitiable character that I could feel my emotions influencing my judgement about his performance. But this is also a strong ensemble cast, with Mykelti Williamson (famously appearing as Bubba of the 'Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory' fame) being effective as Troy's disabled brother and English-born Jovan Adepo being particularly impressive in an extremely assured feature debut.However, the Broadway roots of the piece are highly visible with 98% of the film set either in the back yard, in the house, or on the front steps (the set could clearly rotate!). For such a claustrophobic topic, this is perhaps apt. But as a feature film I longed for the action to go elsewhere. The film version of the story – with a few tweaks to the screenplay – has lots of opportunities for this, but these are never taken. This makes the whole piece feel 'worthy but dull'. In particular, anyone looking for a useful tutorial on fence building needs to look elsewhere!As for the recent ""Moonlight"" there is also excessive use of the ""N"" word and other outdated racial references that have the potential to offend.Good luck to Viola Davis and Denzel Washington (who also directed this) for their Best Supporting Actress and Best Actor Oscars nominations. But ""Best Film"" Oscar? No, I don't think so. In truth this is a film that I will struggle to remember or get excited about in a month's time and it will not be on my re-watch list.(This review was written just prior to the 2017 Oscars.

FENCES,4 November 2019,9/10,"Saw this on a plane and left me speechless. Almost on the verge of tears even. Powerful performance by Denzel Washington.Seeing the actors, I was originally expecting a bit more. Yet, while watching the film, I noticed it was more styled in the form of a play. A different direction for other films I've seen by Washington, but an enjoyable pivot.Emphasized with all of the characters and understood their internal conflicts. This movie deserves more praise that what it received."
FENCES,16 March 2017,7/10,"Well, it's been great catching up on 2 more Academy Award nominated movies this weekend . To me tomorrow is what Grand Final Day is to sports fans.I'll be watching the Academy awards live and perhaps lunching royalty while I await my predictions or others to eventuate. Fences I did not enjoy as a movie but Viola Davis is stunning as Rose Maxson the devoted mother and self sacrificing wife and I predict a shoe in certainty for the Best Supporting Actress award tomorrow Denzel Washington gives a great performance but this movie is so obviously a film of a stage play. I think it's too long, especially the first half and over directed by Denzel Washington.His character which I found lo.ud and utterly unlikeable ,which is not a complaint about Denzel Washington's acting it's the dialogue of the playwright he was performing but at times almost made me want to leave the movie but I'm glad I didn't as the second half and conclusion was worth sitting through this play. It must have been amazing and intense on the Broadway stage but not all stage works transfer well to the screen .."
FENCES,30 January 2020,4/10,"1st half was a real drag, because nothing happended but talk talk talk. i get that you need to establish the setting but this was a little too much. after the first half, is switched to life lessons, and end with more life. the entire movie is held together by its performances, because for the entire movie, nothing is an A plot, its all B's.4/10: performed good, but really boring"
FENCES,23 February 2017,10/10,"This is a deeply emotional film which is set in 1950's America, directed by Denzel Washington. This was originally a Broadway stage play, written by August Wilson, which won both Politzer and Tony prizes. Denzel Washington plays Troy, a bitter, heavy drinking man, who resents his missed opportunities due to colour and age, who we now see has conformed to the norms of society. He works hard as a rubbish collector to provide the basics for his family. Troy consistently voices his strong opinions and is definitely the master of his household. The film is very dialogue heavy with some very lengthy lines, some of which were delivered in a Shakespearian manner, this was a hugely positive aspect of the film for me. The film mainly takes place in the house or in the rear garden where we see Troy is building a fence to keep his family safe from the devil, in reality he's building a symbolic fence around himself to keep them all out. The relationship Troy has with his sons is difficult, we learn through a flashback that Troy had a tough childhood, his father beat him and provided very little so he had to leave home at 14 and fend for himself, this had a big part in shaping his complex and deeply flawed character. Think of the phrase ""The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the sons."" We see that he loves his wife deeply, but he obviously wanted more from life. Now we see in the film some conflict has grown, they clash over many things and this may have been the cause of this drinking problem, he even cheats on his wife where he ends up having a baby with another woman!Only after his death, do his family realise that even though he was bitter, and angry at times, he actually had good intentions. The performances are fabulous across the board, particularly Oscar worthy from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. All the characters have great chemistry and you grow to care deeply for all of them. A very powerful emotional drama, which left me completely exhausted at the end, very highly recommended."
FENCES,25 December 2016,10/10,"Denzel Washington is clearly one of the best actors we have ever had, African-American or otherwise. Whether it has been in serious, sober-minded films like GLORY, MALCOLM X, and COURAGE UNDER FIRE, or explosive action films like CRIMSON TIDE, MAN ON FIRE, and UNSTOPPABLE, Washington has given all of himself, and then some. And then, like more than a few great actors, he also itched to get behind, as well as in front of, the camera as a director, which he did in 2002 with ANTWONE FISHER, and again in 2007 with THE GREAT DEBATERS. He does double duty again for one of the most insightful and true films of 2016, FENCES.Scripted by noted playwright August Wilson from his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play, FENCES stars Washington as an average Joe-type sanitation worker in late 1950s Pittsburgh dealing with the world at large. He had been a baseball player once before World War II, but it never amounted to much; and when one of his sons (Jovan Adepo) wants to get into football while going to college, Washington tries to steer him away, managing only to alienate his son further than he already is. Washington does have a good friend in Mr. Bono (Stephen Henderson), but he is still troubled by a dark park of himself, one that threatens the eighteen-year marriage between him and his wife Rose (Viola Davis).Adapting stage plays to the screen is not exactly the easiest thing in the world to do, because what works on a stage needs a great deal to transfer it to a movie, and a real, breathing set. Fortunately, Washington found a way of making it happen by filming in a part of Pittsburgh that seems not to have changed all that much from the way it must have looked in the actual time that FENCES is set. Wilson's stage play and screenplay are full of language and slang that is very right for the times, and, yes, this does include a profuse use of the 'N' word. But a certain amount of uncomfortable language is what is necessary for a story like this, especially given that it involves not only Washington on both sides of the camera, but also another hugely superb performance by Davis as his wife, who manages to somehow stand by her man despite the horrible secret he reveals near the end. Equally fine in supporting roles are Adepo and Henderson, as well as Mykelti Williamson as a former war buddy of his whose mind isn't right because of a severe head wound suffered in the war, and Russell Hornsby as Washington's son by an earlier marriage who constantly comes to his dad on payday for ten-dollar loans.Though it is an African-American cast and story, FENCES works because it feels universal, and it is a story that could happen in any family, regardless of skin color or ethnicity. Washington and Wilson (who passed away in 2005, and thus never saw FENCES make it to the big screen) make this very clear but in a non-heavy-handed way, and with dialogue scenes that are often long but never dull, earning it justifiable and favorable comparisons to Arthur Miller's classic ""Death Of A Salesman"".All of these elements make FENCES easily one of the best films of 2016, and a sure-fire winner likely to be regarded as a classic in a very short time."
FENCES,19 February 2017,8/10,"Fences is a drama film starring and directed by Denzel Washington. Despite knowing next to nothing about how African American people lived back in the 1950's, this film offers an interesting look into how things once were for them. It also features one of Denzel Washington's best acting roles of his career.In 1950's Pittsburgh, Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington), a working-class father, works in his neighbourhood's waste management service. In the midst of dealing with his job and personal insecurities, Troy also tries to come to terms with the needs of his mentally impaired older brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), his two sons, and his wife Rose (Viola Davis).Featuring a brilliant performance from both Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, Fences is an earnest and convincing depiction of life in a 1950's African American neighbourhood. The direction from Washington is also worth noting, with his interesting choices in camera angles and framing of certain scenes. The film's screenplay feels very much like a play, of which its original source material is based on. My only major complaint is that the film feels a bit long. At almost 2 hours and 20 minutes in length, I feel that roughly 10 minutes could have been cut from its overall runtime.I rate it 7.5/10"
FENCES,2 February 2017,6/10,"It's a movie that can not be said to be bad, in fact, I scored it with a six, the problem for my taste is that I do not see an interesting script, I do not know what you're telling me apart from extended moments of conversations between friends. Then something interesting happens and passes it over and ends. But the actors make it so believable and the direction is nice and you see it without problem.They are all very well, you believe all the actors, but it is that does not penetrate in them either.Photography without being wonderful is decent. In general it is sad and it fits well.It has a nice address, even if it is not great. Many times you do not know why it changes planes, but at least it does not cling to make close-ups constantly. That would have to know that the part of the talks is too long.The atmosphere is very good, because it makes you believe that you are in the time that you want to transmit. The costumes, makeup and hairdresser, fulfill their role.I do not know if we need to make a movie so long to tell us that we all hide something"
FENCES,2 January 2017,9/10,"Had no knowledge of the fact this was a play first, but about 15 minutes into the film, I thought to myself, 'this must have been a play originally.' The profuse dialog and lack of set changes is what clued me in. Point is, if you are bored by plays in general, you might have the same reaction to this film. However, it's well worth throwing any hesitance aside simply to witness the performances if nothing else. All are impeccable, with that of Ms. Davis being the most gut-wrenching. And a special added bonus is that there is absolutely no vulgarity in the film, save the 'n- word,' but even it is not used in a vulgar manner. While I have no issue with situation-appropriate language, I do find it rather refreshing when profanity is not relied upon in an attempt to make a film interesting (see the western by Seth McFarland for totally inappropriate use of profanity).If this film isn't nominated for several acting and even directing awards by the 'Academy,' then it truly is a rigged system that's not worth giving the time of day. Well done to all involved with this picture."
FENCES,13 January 2017,5/10,"Don't get me wrong it's great to see Washington in a real drama again, but he demonstrates though he's a great actor he doesn't know where the camera should be placed or how to turn a stage play into a film. And even great material becomes static and over-long if a film director doesn't make a film of it. The camera and editing are distracting, the opening scenes look exactly like a stage play and the talk is wall to wall. Other scenes will suddenly cut to a long shot in the middle of something dramatic and often the actors eye lines don't match from shot to shot--the basics of what's know as ""the line"" are unknown to either camera woman or director or both. It's shot and edited so poorly that you'll feel like the characters have suddenly stopped looking at each other because the camera changes perspective at the wrong times. It even has long fade to blacks at what seem like each act of a 3 act play come to an end--only with the film you get no intermission to digest, it really just seems endless as the final third of the story jumps ahead week and then years. Most of the play and film are in the backyard and when they attempt to open up the film with other locations it just points out how much time we are stuck in that backyard.The subplot with the injured war veteran is a disaster on film and feels like deleted scenes from Forest Gump.Though play write Wilson (and I like his plays a lot) gets screen credit he was dead years before this film was made, and that may be part of the problem as his words have been enshrined rather than adapted. The play itself stops making sense at several occasions and the attempts at little silent montages with music only drag things out, the films feels like it's 4 and a half hours long. The ending doesn't work at all, despite one touching scene between half sister and brother. Cheesy computer created sunlight streaming into the lens meaningfully also falls flat. Washington's own performance and most of the casts are terrific, but it all falls apart before it's over. Perhaps some of the basic drama of the play can engage people who have never seen Wilson's plays done on stage, or maybe good intentions are enough for some critics starved for a real drama, but I can't say the movie works."
FENCES,4 November 2020,9/10,"Denzel Washington is truly a fantastic actor, and never has this been more perfectly demonstrated than in 'Fences'. His performance in this was the best I've seen him. So engaging, so well done, so involved. I couldn't take my eyes off of him and was hanging on every word. It really was fantastic, watch this film purely for his performance and you won't be disappointed. Viola Davis was of course incredible as Denzel's wife, and thoroughly deserving of her Oscar for this performance. The interactions between the two of them felt so real, so visceral, so meaningful and poignant. Two greats at their peak in my opinion.The story that Fences tells is fantastic. A very personal, uncomfortable yet uplifting look into the life of this family, with the focus on their flawed patriarch. The story explores key themes of family, race, relationships (the father - son relationship being a focus), the American dream, the purpose and meaning of life. There's a lot to dig through and digest after watching Fences that's for sure, as delivers power and beauty in equal measure.You can also definitely tell that it is based off of a play. They can't have changed too much as it feels like it's been lifted straight off the boards, with plenty of dialogue and the action confined to a small set. Not that is bad at all. They recreate the close and contained atmosphere of the theatre, the closeness to the characters and the emotion, and do it so well. You feel as involved as you do in the theatre without leaving the sofa!I absolutely loved it, and if you love stellar acting, accomplished story telling and intriguing characters, you will surely love Fences too."
FENCES,8 February 2017,9/10,"The cinema year gone by was extraordinary for the richness of offerings centred on the African- American experience. Several of these films share a world once fenced off, notably Moonlight (2016), Loving (2016), and Hidden Figures (2016). The quality of these films is remarkable and they reflect wider cultural changes that have been underway for some time. The adaptation of August Wilson's Fences (2016) is another important contribution to this growing body of cinematic work. Its power comes from superb acting that weaves together a unique domestic narrative with themes of universal relevance.The sparse plot is framed around a set of domestic vignettes that are found in any family, regardless of colour. Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is a jovial, larger than life, might-have- been-famous baseball player who works at the dirty end of a garbage truck. Both his sporting ambitions and desire for promotion have been stymied by racial discrimination, so sport and work are recurring metaphors. His devoted and tolerant wife Rose (Viola Davis) is the peacemaker between Troy and his two sons. Young Cory (Jovan Adepo) is keen to pursue his own sporting ambitions but is blocked by Troy. Older son Lyons is a musician who drops in every payday to ask Troy for money. Scenes of father and son conflict recur to the bitter end, punctuated by the impacts of Troy's infidelity. A brain-damaged brother Gabe enters the stage regularly to speak non sequiturs with lyrical messages, like a court jester offering snippets of garbled wisdom. Troy desperately wants to assert masculine dignity but the world of the 1950s had no respect or place for people of his colour. Without respect he is just ""a black man who has two strikes against you before you're even born"". Life is stacked against men like Troy, but worse without a woman like Rose.It is easy to see this as a filmed play rather than a play adapted to film. The wide-frame setting turns Troy's backyard into a place where he holds court within his kingdom where fences are for keeping in and locking out. The colour palette evokes an era of rich vibrant tones that reflect African-American heritage punctuated with rhythm and blues musical themes. Troy and Rose are the quintessential black American strugglers forgotten by history and ignored by the newly rising racial consciousness of the times. The generation that followed were promised better lives while they were left with the crumbs of the American dream, a dream that belonged to white people.The two stars push their performances to the limit: Denzel doesn't play but is angry, conflicted, unfulfilled; Viola is strong, altruistic, hopeful of a better life. Their performance duet is a memorable tour-de-force. Troy has spent his life both building and fighting fences, but what he most craves comes too late. This film feels like live theatre with intimacy of characterisation and dense lyrical dialogue delivered with authenticity and depth. It is classic powerhouse drama.

FENCES,15 November 2020,6/10,"Based on a Pulitzer prize winning play of 1985, ""Fences"" is an endearing drama of a black working class man and the upheavals of his relationship with his wife and children. The film offers some excellent interludes of dialogues giving the essence of a play, powered by excellent performances of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, both nominated for the Oscars. Rather than on a plodding whole, the film impresses in instances like the emotional clashes between Denzel Washington with his son over quitting the job for joining football or the emotional outbursts of Viola Davis. The dialogues are pretty long, but these hold much of the attention. The biggest flaw of the film remains its pace and incoherence which fails to keep up the audiences unlike ""Help"" or ""Moonlight.""Rating: 2 stars out of 4"
FENCES,5 March 2018,8/10,"August Wilson's storied play 'Fences' got the big screen treatment in 2016, thanks to the careful stewardship of Denzel Washington. Following a starring role in the play itself for 114 performances, Washington played double duty by directing and acting the film adaptation.If 'Fences' is nothing else, it is authentic. Set in 1950s Pittsburgh, the film follows the relationship a sanitation worker (Washington's Troy Maxson) and his family, namely his wife, Rose (Viola Davis), teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo) and his special needs veteran brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson). Troy is a flawed man, and this becomes clear as the story unfolds. He is unnecessarily tough on Cory, who wants to follow in his footsteps as a talented athlete. He's a drunk. And he cheats on his wife.Still, Troy is seen as a sympathetic character. He does not understand the pain and frustration he causes. When he begrudgingly gives his older son Lyons $10, it's to teach him a lesson, but it also exposes the strained relationship between them. And then there's the fence. Not only the namesake of the movie, but a symbol of the barrier that is slowly being built between Troy and everyone around him.Of course, we're all here for the acting performances. Davis and Washington deliver what are among the best performances of their careers, a large part of this due to the incredible dialogue and the rawness that they bring to their characters.'Fences' is a deep, emotional film that paints a picture of a very specific time in our nation's history, and should be appreciated for its modesty and humility."
FENCES,4 February 2017,9/10,"Set in an archetypal black household in mid-20th century Pittsburgh, ""Fences"" is a tale of an apologetically flawed man who's a product of an era. Adapted from an August Wilson play, the story centers around foul-mouthed garbage man Troy Maxson who lives with the bitterness of being shut out of a professional sports career and sees his family as nothing but another in a long list of responsibilities he's saddled with. His disabled war veteran brother depends on him for support, his oldest son asks for handouts and his lover-on-the-side (although he has a genuinely visible love for his wife played brilliantly by Viola Davis) saddles him with another kid. On the other end of the spectrum is a middle son played by Jovan Adepo who would be able to thrive if his father could give him the chance.Does Troy represent the popular image of the African-American man? Is he to blame for his ill fortunes or is he a product of society? Did Troy fail his children? The fact that he and his situation are complex enough that you can argue these questions any which way makes this such a provocative work of art.The film embodies what's best about theatrical adaptations from the poetry in the dialogue to the thoroughness to which the actors do their legwork. Denzel Washington directs it with a very light touch (I can't even be sure he did much of anything at all but it's very much appreciated).The film also boasts the year's best ensemble which includes unsung actor Jovan Apedo and Mykelti Williamson playing one of the few performances of mentally disabled that I personally left wanting more."
FENCES,5 February 2017,6/10,"I feel a little mean criticising a Pulitzer Prize and multiple Tony winning play that has now become a movie. In the 2016 stage revival of the 1983 August Wilson play, both Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, the movie's stars, picked up best actor awards for their performances, alongside fellow actors Stephen Henderson (Bono), Mykelti Williamson (Gabe) and Russell Hornsby (Lyons).But, and here's the rub. This is very much a play. Not a movie.Ever seen a good movie version of All my Sons, A view from the Bridge, Death of a Salesman? (A minor success of the latter hit our screens in 2000, winning a couple of Golden Globes, but nothing of significance from the Miller pen has made the cut in the last 50 years.) That's because Miller, like Wilson, wrote for the stage. Long, often deeply allegorical speeches populate both of their plays about life, the universe, family, honour, duty, human fragility and responsibility. Meaty subjects that work in the intimacy of theatre where you can almost smell the actor's vulnerability.Hats off to Denzel Washington for taking a modern theatre classic, crafted very much in the style of Arthur Miller, and attempting to recreate that dramatic tension on the screen. Incidentally it has taken 35 years to reach us because August Wilson strictly instructed that this ultimate of 'Black' plays could only be directed on screen by a 'black' director. But, my overall criticism is that, from the opening extended and overly vernacular (for my ears) dialogue between Troy (Washington) Bono (Henderson) and Rose (Davis) scene, this feels like a stage production with a few wide angle shots and locations thrown in. (As an aside, in the first scene the continuity person needs a rocket as the levels in the very obvious 'pint' of gin that Troy shares goes up and down like a yo-yo. A criminal mistake given that the prop is central to illustrate Troy's dependence on alcohol.)The play's title is a full-on allegory about the role of the fence that Troy laboriously builds throughout the play (something Donald Trump might surely prick his ears up to). On the one hand it's a physical and protective barrier (Trump's not much cop at complex allegories so that's him out of the way now) on the other it's both an emotional barrier representing Troy's inability to accept his sons' affections and a shield to the Grim Reaper who stalks his life.Both Washington and Davis are excellent in their roles, as are the supporting ensemble, but I could not escape, almost at any point, the fact that this felt a cheat. A pirate movie for those of us who couldn't see it (like me) in the theatre, where it should be seen. It made me distinctly uncomfortable.It's like watching pop stars mime in film studios. Somehow fake, unreal, unworthy.For all its strengths I'm reminded of a quote by a former Hibernian FC manager, Bobby Williamson, a dull and forgettable man in any other scheme of things.He uttered the immortal sentence, after another 0 - 0 draw, ""If you want entertainment, go to the theatre.""That's how I saw this production."
FENCES,10 February 2017,8/10,"This review of Fences is spoiler free**** (4/5)BEFORE HIS DEATH in 2005, August Wilson was very opinionated when it came to his plays, for the last 30 years other filmmakers have been trying to adapt them into big screen hits. Unfortunately they all lacked something he wanted; he wanted an African-American director. One of them did try to star Eddie Murphy but didn't pass through Wilson's high standards. Until in 2010 Denzel Washington and Viola Davis starred in the Broadway adaptation of Fences in memory of the playwrite himself which lead to success at the Tony awards they were given one each for their powerful performances, but also Washington announced that he would like to direct the big-screen adaptation with Wilson's screenplay. He lived up to his promise but instead of choosing another actor to perform his role he decided to do the role himself and cast co-star Davis from the play to perform as his wife. Washington's third film as a director/actor is a very promising fit to his career, which has been a bit up-and-down of late, but with this adaptation it might lead him to Oscar glory. In Fences he plays as sanitation worker Troy Madson, who once had a dream to become a famous baseball player, but his dream ended when he was told that he was too old to play in the nationals. With no hope left he decided to work in sanitation. Over the years of working in a dead-end job he became bitter about his life, which effects the lives of others including his youngest son Cory (Jovan Adepo) who wants to become a college football player but with his father's bitterness he constantly tries to stop him to get a normal job, this starts to effect the young man in the long run he starts to become quite aggressive towards him, but Troy is persistent he won't give up in telling his son that football isn't for him. It's a show-off tour de force by Washington, though it looks he doesn't breathe throughout as he says most of the lines, at times it feels like a long monologue that continues throughout, at these points it makes us want to shout at the screen to ask him to shut-up until his co-star Davis who plays his wife of 18 years, Rose a stay-at-home housewife who for a while puts up with Troy's bitterness with his family, so much that she goes with it. Though she does try to be politely persuasive towards him when concerning his hard-earned cash, which he has a hard time giving up when his family are in need. But he just states that he needs it for his life to continue, his bitterness is consistent throughout. Don't think that Wilson's screenplay always contains this type of attitude or is always serious because it's not, it contains some levity with Troy talking about his life with his best-friend/co-worker Bono (Henderson), who share quite a bit of banter together, he talks about his avoidance with death and his scythe, there are even some uses of sports jargon as he uses Baseball terminology to describe some of his difficulties with life. Wilson keeps it polite all-though it does feel as if he intended to give Washington the most lines, but he delivers them so well with a lot of clarity. For about an hour Washington continuously goes back-and-forth from their counsel house to the back garden until suddenly he gets an epiphany to build a picket fence through the garden, it's here when the film lives up to its title. ""Some people build fences to keep people out,"" Bono states, this suggests that Troy wants to keep something inside, something he doesn't want to leave behind. From here, his life becomes topsy-turvy when everyone in his life starts to turn on him, but it turns out he has a secret that he has been keeping for years when he lets that secret out his life begins to take a vicious turn for the worst. Though the performances in Fences are sometimes stagy with the over-long monologues or the angry shouting, this is the best Washington has been in years. VERDICT: This is a poignant, funny, charming and very moving drama with awards-calibre performances. Washington's third is a direct hit for the Oscars and is his best film in years."
FENCES,28 February 2017,8/10,"""Fences"" is a completely passionate film, it is troubled, familiar, ruthless, romantic, charismatic and brutal, engraved 50% on the back of a house in an American suburb in the 50s it shows the story of Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) A 53-year-old father of a family who works as a garbage collector and fight to support his family, living at age 18 with his wife Rose (Viola Davis), he begins to face problems in his relationship and in his family. It is an adjusted script, capable of having a 20 minute long scene between 3 characters sitting talking, the film is unique and exclusively dialogue, and best of all, this makes the film highly attractive, its 2 hours and little seemed 20 minutes To me, the script full of great dialogues added to stupendous performances make a movie that had everything to be dragged to have a spectacular rhythm. We have a family history, with events that can happen in any family, it is beautiful to demonstrate the beauty of the causes in the family, yes, he is beautiful in demonstrating the problems, however incredible it may seem, the film does not have a great Moral, it just shows how love can be gross, that we do not choose who we love or how we love, but simply, we love. We have a good picture, with an extremely gray color palette, a timid soundtrack - although the music is present in an extremely sentimental way in the film - a great set-up and camera angles that practically act as a character in the movie, between To the dialogues the camera splices against planes and planes sequences, it turns, turns, profiles and is even subjective when needed, the camera acts in history as mere viewers, and even when the camera stands still on the tripe, the characters move from one Side to side, as if they were in a theater, is very delicious. In terms of acting, we have the best in film in 20I6, Denzel Washington is a completely incredible character, his acting is terrifying and at the same time completely emotional, he swallows the camera, steals the scene, it grows to such a point that we are without Reaction, we want to throw the popcorn off, sit glued to the screen, listen to its history and its lessons, learn about the cruelty of love, hate, love, fear and respect. Viola Davis is also wonderful, she does not shed tears, she drool, tears, falls, she surrenders completely to characters, that little screen corner in the film, she grabs hard, her dramatic load is enormous, and when Denzel Does not appear in the film and leaves the camera free for Viola, she also swallows it with extreme ferocity, would be very happy if both took the acting Oscar - but we know only Viola will take. And congratulations to Denzel Washington who also shines in the direction, I0 years later he returns to direct, and concretizes the best work of his career. Finally, we have a simple movie, that enters the house of a family to tell us their stories, we do not have a technically brilliant film, we have a fabulous rhythm, incredible performances, and a story that marks, finally, we have a great movie that It's purp cinema."
FENCES,22 December 2016,8/10,"When you pair up Denzel Washington with Viola Davis on screen, you know you're in for two of the most outstanding performances you'll see all year and that's exactly what you get from FENCES. That said, if only director Denzel Washington and his crew could've figured out some ways to lessen the stage play feel to it and make this seem more cinematic. But then again, breaking out of that format is indeed usually the challenge when dealing with straight up adaptations from stage plays, just like ""August: Osage County"" a few years ago.Scripted by August Wilson, adapted by Wilson's own Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Denzel Washington plays an African-American father struggling with race relations in the United States while trying to raise his family in the 1950s. He's still bitter from his doomed baseball career in the past, blames it on the white man, so when his son tries to get into sports, he discourages him, telling him that the white man wouldn't give him a single opportunity out there in the field. Denzel's character's wife, played by Viola Davis, faithfully stands by his side despite the secret that would change their family forever.Story-wise, it doesn't get more well-thought out than FENCES, it's dialogue-driven, it's performance-driven, this material is every actor's dream come true because it has so many layers and it provides room for you to showcase the best version of your chops. We know Denzel and Viola Davis are phenomenal, but FENCES allows them to venture into places and show us shades that may not have been seen before. And I'm sure it feels liberating for all the actors involved in this film to just dig deep down, tap into those emotions and lay them bare for the world to see, and there's no wrong way of doing it.The conflicts in FENCES are powerful, like a fist through a wall. Nuances surround the characters so you end up understanding where they're coming from despite being in agreement or disagreement with many of their decisions. To a certain extent, I think Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin fans would find FENCES appealing since each of the characters has incredibly long lines that run like 100 mph. Marital affair, resentments, built up hatred, forgiving your past, there's no shortage of drama in FENCES, its cup overflows. But again, as I said earlier, I think there's a missed opportunity here, the film just didn't do enough to make itself appear cinematic. Composer Marcelo Zarvos' music is almost non-existent. Forget the backseat, many of film's elements are practically locked up in the trunk."
FENCES,28 February 2017,10/10,"After going to the movies for nearly 50 years I have seen them all...all come and go while sitting alone in a dark theatre..I have seen the birth and growth of every single genre and always left the theatre with some kind of emotion ...whether it's the Bond series..the ridiculous Star Wars saga...the endless popcorn Eddie Murphyish style of celluloid ...and every single horror, thriller,detective,comedy,kids and whatever style you can mention.Firstly I will tell my top 10 movies in no particular order so you can either keep reading or skip to next review..Paper Moon...Glenngarry Glen Ross..Missing...The Apartment .. Revenant...Kes...Spotlight...Birdman...Danny Collins..The Family Way..Seven year Itch...Scent Of A Woman..anything with Jack Lemon in...Oooppsss..I've overdone it..but now you have either left or you know where I'm at.The 1 thing in common here is each one is about the people and the story....no special effects ..just brilliantly made stories. Never before have I seen a directors debut so good..he should do more...every second enthralls and each and every actor gives 100% !!This , very cleverly has the feel of a play and I would have loved to have seen it on the stage.Without any shadow of a doubt the best of the year!Some reviews say boring...thats OK..stick to action and adventure..This could not be bettered...as close to perfection as you can get..I'm not going to say anything about the subject matter as this will speak for itself if you take 2 hours to visit the cinema!Well done to all involved!!"
FENCES,19 October 2019,,"Fences - I do come here humbly after ready so many good and to my thinking well deserved reviews. However I just struggled to watch this movie taped on my TV and enjoyed it thoroughly. Struggled yes, because the dialogue in this movie is vital and my hearing despite my newly acquired hearing aids I did missed a lot and especially when Troy reveals the unthinkable to his wife. Had to heavily google to be able to continue the viewing with some understanding at this point. I do like drama very much and always enjoyed Denzel's acting. His counterpart Viola as so praised and rewarded for her acting was even more than a match. I won't go on nit picking about some aspect of this movie that some would dislike. Nothing is ever perfect or at least pleasing everyone. We are individuals with different taste and idea so to each its own.
Going back to the dialogue I did not even have subtitle on that particular channel. Perhaps technology one day will permit hearing challenged people to be able to follow such dialogues. And with more technical miracles the same will apply to blind people. (Would I ever have thought of this when I had no problem!) I also wished that technology would extend to what I found with language learning program on the web...you can slow down the speech speed for better understanding, Marvellous, wouldn't you say... Sorry I'm getting carried away! FENCES is a wonderful experience for those who enjoy such intelligent drama. I have not read the play but I feel that the author would be proud of how it's been transferred to the big screen. I expected another racial injustice drama but if found it was so much more than this if it was ever much about race. I feel it was about human complexity to deal with its lot in an ever changing tempo. I'll go back to it with subtitle available!
Sorry I never rate!"
FENCES,24 April 2021,7/10,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today movie review - Fences (2016) a drama starring my man Denzel Washington who directed and stars in this adaptation of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, which revolves around a garbage collector named Troy Maxson in 1950s who is still bitter that due to his skin colour, his baseball future was ended abruptly. Maxson is prone to taking out his frustrations on his loved ones, including his wife, Rose, played by the amazing Viola Davis who won a Tony and an Oscar award for her performance. The movie which is adapted from a play does very well feel like a big-budgeted play, playing out scene for scene that is now on the big screen. The movie is pretty much told at the family house which may sound boring but makes up for it with a strong dialogue. Throughout its entire duration. The dialogue sounds like an everyday chit chat of an ordinary family, where the husband works, spends time with his family and friends and reminisces past events which slowly gives the audience an insight of who these characters are and represent.Davis acting is charismatic with the affection she shows to her husband and I found myself sympathizing with her character at the end of the movie of what she had to suffer and persevered which the actor made it so authentic. From start to end you can see how Troy's antics is measuring how much Rose can put up with Troy. She loves him and she does much to soften his rough edges even when she's pointing out how wrong he is.The performances between Denzel Washington and Viola Davis shine through and you can see how they committed acting their character roles with both evaporating into their respectful personas. Both actors play off each other with powerful performances and really makes them look like a real married couple. Throughout the movie they smile, laugh, get angry and fight at every single perfect moment.You can see Denzel as the filmmaker and star made this movie with a lot of passion and due to that along with the ensemble cast the movie is a beautiful acted drama film which looks upon domestic tragedy at any normal family regardless of what era they are in. Overall, Fences may not be able to attract a broad audience, due to its very specific style of storytelling, but it's without a doubt a very well-made picture. Overall 7.6/10."
FENCES,29 December 2016,8/10,"It is interesting to go to a movie not knowing what to expect except that a movie directed and produced by Denzel Washington, written by the late August Wilson, and starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis should be seen. Such was the case with us when we went to the see August Wilson's Pulitzer-prize winning play (adapted for film) today. In this day and age, of movie going, it would be a little like expecting to see a ""regular"" movie and ending up by seeing Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh instead—a lot of conversation with little action or even different scene locations. The main setting for this movie takes place in the backyard of a colored man's house in 1950s Pittsburgh—that of Troy Maxon (Denzel Washington). The movie actually begins on the back of a garbage truck with two old friends and work mates:Troy and his lifelong friend, Bono (Stephen Henderson)--working together and wishing they could drive the truck rather than picking up the garbage cans from home to home. After work one payday Friday, the friends continue their conversation in Troy's backyard as Troy starts to build his fence. They are joined by Troy's wife Rose (Viola Davis) as she goes in and out of the backyard from the back porch. Tory's 34-year-old-son, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), stops by his dad's house to borrow $10 from his dad. Lyons gets no money or sympathy from his dad who gives him a lecture about the value of money and life in general. As we watch the interactions, we notice that Lyons calls Troy ""dad"" and Rose by her first name, indicating that she is not his mother.Cory (Jovan Adepo) is Troy and Rose's high school-aged son who lives with them. Cory and Troy argue over Cory's job and his wanting to play football for the school team. Soon, Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) enters the picture as Troy's mentally handicapped younger brother. He talks and behaves as the ""fool"" of the play, but he is no bother to anyone who knows him except that he needs to be watched. Troy tells Bono that without Gabriel's sacrifice during the war (he now has a metal plate in his head), he and Rose would not have been able to own the house. (Gabriel's government checks paid for most of the mortgage payments.)Troy's past is plagued with problems. He hates his father and still wonders if he is alive somewhere. He had also served time in prison. Before prison, Troy had been a great baseball player—in the Negro Leagues before blacks players were accepted in the majors. Now at 53, he resents this and says that there were better Negro players than Jackie Robinson; they were just never given a chance to play in the majors. (The baseball metaphor is used throughout the play, and talking about baseball is both a continuous topic of conversation with Bono and as an object lessons to teach Cory about life—""That's Strike one"" (as if to say, 'you have two more strikes before you're out of here'). In fathering Cory, Troy seems as doomed to be hated by his son as Troy was to hate his own father. But, unlike his dad, Troy has ""stuck it out"" with his family rather than running away. In exchange, he wants people to respect him and HIS house more. This leads us back into the building of FENCES: Fences to keep the bad things out of his house (and to perhaps separate Troy from his own past?: Troy challenges Death to come and get him after he builds a fence). But, as Bono has known for some time, Troy has been keeping a secret from Rose: He has been seeing another woman, and now she is expecting his baby. When Troy finally has to confront Rose with his problem, this leads them to their biggest confrontation. The baby and what to do about it..... When the baby's mother dies in childbirth, he is left alone with the baby to confront the world alone, again...... One last scene takes place in the Maxon's backyard 6 years later. This movie that starts with idol and disconnected conversations, remembrances, and arguments, builds into an extended family saga. As we watched this movie in a fairly crowded theater on a holiday weekend, we noticed that the audience was clearly griped by the movie. One could tell by their silent attention and timely gasps."
FENCES,29 December 2016,6/10,"We have hit that time of year. The time of year when all the big, dumb, fun movies are out of the way and all the serious dramas come out. This is when we get the movies that have all the award buzz around them. Even before many people see them. Usually with these films, there are two kinds of movies that we get. There are the legitimately great emotional dramas and then there are the Oscar bait movies. These films seem to be made with the sole purpose to get their creators meaningless awards. The Oscar-bait films are usually the ones that have a ""progressive"" gimmick. Like being gay, or black, or really anything that isn't straight white males. These films will then choose which one of these things they want to have. After they decide which ""progressive"" topic they want to put into their film they then make the film around that gimmick. Now, having topics like these is perfectly fine as long as it makes sense and works with the film. But when the film is only that one thing, then it becomes troublesome. So far this year we have gotten a slew of both kinds of films. 'Moonlight' being a legitimately great, emotional drama and 'Loving' being exactly Oscar bait (to name a few examples).The weird thing about 'Fences' is that it's a sort of hybrid between the two. The film is mostly all black but that holds no sway on the film. The fact that everyone is black is completely inconsequential. Yet this film somehow still manages to be Oscar Bait. This is mainly because it feels like nothing more than a vessel for the stars to give great performances that will likely gather a bunch of awards.Because the great performances are almost the only good part of this film. But they are exceptional. Like, really exceptional. Denzel and Viola give the best performances I have ever seen from them. They really bring their A game and it makes their characters come to life. And, thankfully, there was actually characters to care about here. Washington plays a complex mix of touching and aggressive and Davis is heartfelt and stern in her own way.Watching all the different, unique characters interact is definitely the highlight of the film. They have genuinely emotional moments that pluck at one's heartstrings without it feeling false or manipulative. This is because we actually care about them. We want to see them succeed and work together to be better. So when things go south you actually want things to turn around for them. That being said, in order to make a film like this interesting you have to put these characters in situations and show how they deal with them. And this doesn't happen for nearly sixty minutes. I'm pretty sure the opening, inconsequential scene goes on for nearly thirty minutes. Which is only a prelude for what is to come in the remainder of the film. The entire run time is filled with endless talking scenes that feel like they just go nowhere.Especially in the first half of the movie. My goodness does the first half drag. All it is is talking here, then moving over there and talking, then moving over here and talking. These scenes are so dull and long that a story can't even form for nearly sixty minutes. For an entire hour, the film literally does nothing. Sure we get to know the characters but why couldn't we get to know them as the story happened?It seems like the film wanted us to get a complete grasp on the characters and then throw them into conflict. Instead of throwing them into the conflict which would then help show us who they are. Even when a story starts to materialize it comes completely out of nowhere and just tells you how you should feel. Even though the last half is a definite step up from the first it still features endless exposition scenes that drag on way longer than they need to. And some drag on so long that they stop feeling real. Some scenes actually become cheesy and melodramatic. Which is not what this should've been.'Fences' is the kind of movie that you see with your family and then completely forget about. It will make some cry and then two weeks later you'll forget why you cried in the first place. This film has everything in place to be good. Talented actors, the writer of the original play, and characters that are actually complex. But the script and structure of the film completely kill it. Things feel jumbled, out of place, and poorly put together but it's worst sin is that it's exposition heavy and takes forever to go anywhere or do anything."
FENCES,9 June 2017,5/10,"Fences earned Oscar nominations and Viola Davis won Best Actress as Rose, so expectations were high. Unfortunately, Fences disappoints.The story had next to no intrigue. Denzel as Troy is a disgruntled working class man in the 1950s who is just getting by. He's got a big personality with opinions on everything. And he talks, constantly, to the point of being annoying. The film slowly reveals the challenges he's had in his life, and most recently, due to his skin color. He overused the N-word to the point of exhaustion. He dominates the film, the story, and the house.Their modest typical 1950s house stacked next to all the other city houses was the centerpiece of practically all activity. He was fenced in in many ways. This cinematography was pretty clever. There were next to no beautiful landscape shots or anything attractive, which furthered the plainness of survival-level living.Fences circles back to this fence that Troy has been working on for years for his wife Rose. I guess it is an analogy for their relationship, always working on it, looks good on the outside, but it just isn't. And it's slow work, involving a lot of back and forth.Troy's wife Rose is a hard character to watch. Her job is to take care of the house and the kids and manage the money. She has no pleasures in life other than taking care of everyone except herself. She endures many hardships brought on by Troy. She is tough but in many ways weak. She fails to stand up to Troy's abusive lifestyle, ever, taking more and more crap from him.As the movie plods along, Troy disrespects everyone - wife, kids, friends. You get to a key point of the movie, and again he just dumps. He acts like he's not responsible for his own stupid decisions and that everyone needs to accept him because he makes money.Many times I screamed at Rose to do or say something strong, take a stand. The only one with backbone is their youngest child Cory, who develops over time into a child anyone would be proud of. Except Troy, who I think is jealous of Cory. I got very tired watching Fences due to the length and repetition of events. There are many dialogues where it feels like the director is having the character preach to the audience like in Blazing Saddles. Troy's behavior exhausted me like that part by Decaprio in Wolf of Wall Street. Self absorbed behavior that could have really been expressed by the Director in a lot less scenes would have helped.In the end, the story has very little twists and turns. There is no excitement, no Hollywood ending. People's behaviors infuriated me by actions or lack of reactions. The ending was poor by trying to get the audience to feel sympathy when none was really due. Fences featured terrific acting by Viola Davis and the actor who played Bono, Denzel's friend. But Denzel was way over the top, so again, either the story or the Director needed to reign this in.Disappointing film, sorry to say."
FENCES,10 January 2019,8/10,"Since viewing the film's trailer mid last year, Fences was a film that I have desired to see in cinemas (I had the same feeling after I watched the trailer for Logan).Unfortunately for me, Fences was released during the same week as Fifty Shades Darker, and Fences was pushed off the sessions times in many cinemas in QLD. I was starting to think that Fences was a film I was going to miss as it was only being shown in approximately two cinemas, both very far away.By luck, last week my local cinema provided a couple of sessions calling it a ""last chance screening"" and I finally had the honour of watching this new drama.Fences stars Denzel Washington as Troy (Denzel Washington is also the film's director) and Viola Davis as Rose. Before I go further, perhaps you are are not aware that Fences is actually based on a famous stage play which actor Denzel Washington had previously performed in many times. Denzel has always been a huge fan of the play and naturally developed the desire to transform Fences into a motion picture for the whole world to see. Because this is based on a stage play, Fences is a film that is very heavy with dialogue and requires your complete attention.The film introduces us to Troy (Washington), who is a husband & a father of two boys- one teenage, one adult. Troy works daily as a trash collector and has done so over the last 18 years of his life (you know, the normal Monday till Friday kinda job). His pay is handed to his wife weekly and they use the money to try and get by each week. His wife Rose (Davis) is honourable & humble. She provides a clean home, cooks meals, is welcoming of guests, attends church & supports her husband in ALL circumstances.Fences is a film that can make the viewer enjoy key moments one minute and then suddenly feel very uncomfortable the next. Happy moments between two people change suddenly with simple dialogue. The film does a great job of showing the many challenges this family are currently facing as well as explaining information about our characters past. The information about characters pasts also explains why they deal with certain situations like they do within the film...Our leads as you would expect are outstanding. The dialogue between the leads is quick, snappy and never fails to deliver an outstanding performance. While Fences is a heavy drama (even for a PG film) as audience members I feel we can connect & relate to this film in some way. Every husband wants to be a good provider for his home and the list goes on.The film doesn't have any real motion picture soundtrack. In fact, I think over 2 hours I heard 3 minor amounts of music (mostly for scene transitions) and the scenes are mostly focused within a home and its back yard. This all sounds very basic, but the good news is it's all very effective and feels real.At times you swear you are simply watching a stage play and not a film.
Walkden Entertainment"
FENCES,29 December 2016,8/10,"Fences, based on the award winning play by August Wilson, is a brilliantly acted drama centered around a black father trying to do right by his family in 1950s Pittsburgh. Directed and adapted by Denzel Washington, Fences shows that Washington is far less interested in crafting a film than he is in showing raw human emotion. The basics of it is simple: this is the best acted film of the year. Hands down. Between Viola Davis' brilliant performance as Rose Maxon and Denzel Washington's fierce portrayal of Troy Maxon, the performances are so rich and so layered that you end up not caring about any of the film's faults.It's hard to not look at this film like the play it is based on. It never ventures from being what it was meant to be and for that, I have to commend Washington's determination even if I thought it really ended up trivializing some of the film. The film is a compelling drama about the relationship between a father and a son and the resentment that can be a part of something like that. We've seen many films like this before but never have we seen a film with the performances this film has. I can't praise the actors here enough. They're truly mystifying.Overall, Fences is a performance heavy film that relies on its actors to progress the film. Many films are afraid to take a chance like that but Denzel Washington nails it in ways that I don't think another director could. This is a film that will resonate with you, not because of anything that happens but because of the tenacity of the filmmaker and his quest to make a performance based film. It is the best acted film of the year, there is no question about that."
FENCES,15 October 2021,8/10,"The film ""Fences"" seems to be an excellent adaptation of the stage play; I can't say for sure since I forget the play, having read it long ago in school. This film is well made, good direction by Denzel, good acting by all, authentic Hill District location, and good cinematography. There are many issues here that are relatable and moving. There is a realism here, though it is tinged by negativity which makes this film not one I would revisit anytime soon, but definitely worth a watch. My rating: 8/10."
FENCES,18 June 2019,7/10,"Fences star Denzel Washington and Viola Davis and is a story about an African-American couple who tries to raise a family in the 50s. This movie exists to be in the Oscars, the acting and dialogue was unparalleled in how impactful and beautifully emotional it was. Fences is much collection on scenes that revolve around the central characters and focuses on having those impactful moments rather than a coherently strung together movie. That's not to say that the movie was incoherent but simply, continuity wasn't the main focus.This movie reminded me a lot of Death of a Salesman, the play by Arthur Miller that was then turned to film in 1985. It told a very different story in terms of the characters and setting but essentially, at its core it tells the same story about family, self worth and the American dream. I find that it is an especially interesting foil to Death of a Salesman given that one is about a white middle income family and Fences is about a lower income African American family. While the patriarch of the family have different hopes and dreams for themselves and their children there is a similar sense of both being 'dreamers' and looking into a brighter future, the core of the American Dream.In order to achieve this thematic exploration, Fences enlists two of Hollywood's best in Denzel and Viola Davis. The acting in this movie were full of life and painfully authentic, from Davis' ugly crying to Denzel's stern monologues. This is a film that celebrates acting and playwrights, a very interesting watch indeed."
FENCES,28 January 2017,8/10,"29 years after its Broadway premiere, ""Fences"" arrives in theatres courtesy of a screenplay by the late playwright August Wilson himself. With two Pulitzer Prizes and his ten-play magnum opus, ""The Pittsburgh Cycle,"" (of which ""Fences"" is the sixth work), Wilson takes his rightful place alongside Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams as one of the greatest American playwrights. The focus of Wilson's cycle is African-American life across the entire 20th century, with each play taking place in a particular decade. ""Fences"" is set in the 1950's, but the time frame does not date the material. Its universal themes supersede any of its societal details, though based on this year's election cycle, viewers may be stunned to discover that the American working class is more than just Midwestern and White.Denzel Washington as Director realises that the greatest star in this film is its writing composition. It focuses briefly on a Garbage collector Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) who holds court in the backyard of the Pittsburgh home he shares with his wife, Rose (Viola Davis) and their son, Cory (Jovan Adepo). At the point when a film has Actors this focused on talking their lines, to the point where it appears they are turning themselves back to front with anguish, the camera is dependably precisely where it should be. It is with them, tuning in as eagerly as we in the crowd seem to be. This kind of heading is an under-appreciated skill these days, inspiring an earlier time when experts like Billy Wilder and Sidney Lumet carried out their special-ties. Truth be told, it was Wilder who shunned the thought that garish, gaudy course was what made for awesome dramatisation, saying that if ""something were said to be very much coordinated, that is verification that it is definitely not."" Washington comprehends this, and ""Fences"" is considerably more capable for his commitment to his on-screen characters' speciality. At the point when Viola Davis is demonstrating to you how hard her heart is breaking, the camera doesn't should vie for your consideration.""Fences"" is a film about how our surroundings shapes us, and how, regardless of how honourable their aims, our folks can't resist the urge to destroy us in some form, similarly as their folks had accomplished for them. This is our legacy as people. Possibly we influence ourselves against that which we saw as amiss with our folks, or we get their ailment and we pass it on. Washington's visual reiteration of crosses all through the film, either on the divider or in the chain Rose wears around her neck, is an indication of the best father-child story ever told. This thought is in the script as well: maybe the most mercilessly legitimate thing Rose tells Cory close to the film's end is that he's much the same as Troy. Particularly after Cory's discourse about how he made a decent attempt to expel Troy's unnerving impact from his spirit. Cory's acknowledgement of this truth, spoke to in his co-selecting of the tune Troy used to sing, is as appalling as it is lovely. Regardless of whether we need it or not, this is our legacy.Denzel Washington coordinates and stars in a towering screen adaptation of August Wilson's play about an imperfect inward city patriarch. It's convincing, additionally beats the substantial with the significance."
FENCES,7 January 2021,10/10,Really enjoyed it throughout. Brilliant performance by all cast. As always Denzel does a great job with any character he plays.
FENCES,12 February 2018,4/10,"I honestly only watched this movie because it was on my Oscar 2017 highlights and it was the only movie I haven't watched from this list. Fences tells the story of the Maxson family and that's pretty much it. This movie is one of the most boring movie experiences I've ever watched and by far I guess the worst movie of 2016. The only three redeemable things about this movie are Viola Davis' and Denzel Washington's performances and some life lessons that Troy tells his children. The story of this movie is just about their life and that's it. I understand that it tried to be realistic but unlike Moonlight where that story was told in an interesting way that catched my attention and made me interested in what happened next, in this movie there is nothing interesting happening or something that might catch my attention and make me wanna watch the rest of the movie. It also tried to have bad-ass dialogue and be a dialogue-driven movie like Pulp Fiction but that movie was memorable for it's interesting storyline that had multiple stories intertwine by the end and more importantly for it's dialogue which was catchy either with it's constant language abuse or weird circumstances. Here there is nothing catchy or interesting or entertaining at all. The rest of things are just average like the score which had only 2 cues in the whole 50 minutes i watched or the cinematography which was average as was probably necessary in the movie.Boring movie with only 2 good performances and some life lessons, weak score, weak and uninteresting story that made me sleep after 26 minutes but on a rewatch the next day nothing improved and I decided to stop wasting my time with this movie at the 50 minutes mark. 4/10"
FENCES,1 March 2017,3/10,"I really looked forward to this film , the trailer was excellent and set up what looked like being a good drama . But honestly the fire exit sign was more exciting , I found myself constantly comparing it with what was on screen and trying to assure myself that the film was more watchable but it wasn't . This may work well on stage with a single set , but what on earth did they spend $24m on , yes there was an authentic looking late 1950s Pittsburg but one of the adjoining house to Rose's was brand new ! Her Oscar was well deserved and there was some good acting by the supporting cast particularly his brother Gabe and young daughter . He was such a despicable character that took out his failure on his son that spoilt the enjoyment . It was the son's strength that brought some salvation. The film was an hour too long , far too much dialogue delivered at breakneck speed , it needed better adaptation to the screen and script editing and more than anything it shouldn't have even been released Give it a miss , save yourself 2.5 hours of looking at the inside of your eyelids !"
FENCES,15 January 2017,6/10,"I just finished watching the movie Fences. Honestly I wanted to enjoy the movie for my own confirmation bias for Denzel Washington. As always a good actor, but I could not for the life of me tell you what the point of the movie was. Neither could I explain the point of the plots of the movie. Unfortunately I actually fell asleep on the movie it was very long and mediocre. I could only describe the movie to me as a sandwich without mayonnaise or fries without the ketchup. Viola Davis did a great job as far as it comes to acting but the acting gets under mined when the story is complicated to follow through without the necessary tools to see it and connect to it properly. Maybe some things are better off left as plays."
FENCES,6 October 2021,10/10,"This should remind you of Dustin Hoffman playing Willy in Death of a Salesman, the film adaptation. Fences is very theatrically performed, that means a lot of words and limited staging, though less 'art-house' then salesman, as it uses real locations, but the theatricality is dominant, limited characters moving in a very dense universe.Parallels continue between the works, they are both largely tragedies, though Fences ends on a spiritual note, Literally. And a big difference is that the tragedy of The character Hoffman plays is largely based on his passionate delusions and mental lock on his rhapsodizing ancient dreams.Denzel's tragedy is his hammer lock on grim realities, but realities that were fused into him in earlier times, and he has not changed with the era he's in. The young man's impressions and conclusions are alive and well in the current guy, and while a composite of eminently real things, they are locking him out of the world he's in, and more importantly, the family he's devoted to.It seems to be a movie about the way a tender heart , especially as a black man born in 1918, has to create an iron shield around itself, until that shield becomes the dominant personality, and in that sense it is about
the evolution of the alpha male's adaptation in a relentlessly cruel culture. And then Viola Davis doing a star turn. She rudder's down Denzel's wild battleship personality, until finally he hurt's her so badly that she staggers and totters under the blow. Denzel's best friend and his sons all turn in
great performances, sometimes exaggerated in the manner of the projection that has to be used in a play, upon which of course, this is lovingly based. As far as I know, Washington has been in 5 Broadway plays ,including this one, and he also directed and co-produced this film.It's compelling and has some rough edges, which seem in keeping with
the rough.edges in the lives of these characters. It's full of passionate dramatic non-stop acting, mainly theatric acting, but not in the style of Mamet, and why should it be?There's quite a lot to think about with this one, and i rate if as 'terrific'."
FENCES,26 February 2017,9/10,"I don't get ratings here. If they would cut-end this movie 32 minutes in, it would still be best movie of the year. Despite Denzel Washingto showing off his acting muscles, Viola Davis gives him an astonishing perspective for what can be done. The level of detail it was written, acted and shot.... wow! Every word, every emotion, every look... wow"
FENCES,27 February 2017,7/10,"Full of raw power, the dialogue and performances in this are pure vitality. Troy is a compelling character of real human dichotomies, someone you can loathe and love in equal measure. His baseball analogies verge on the embarrassing he's so obsessed with them, which in hindsight makes me a little sad.This film never comes alive as a film however, it always feels slightly restrained as an obvious adaptation of a play. I've never really understood this critique of plays-into-movies before (feeling that character and dialogue will trump lack of settings and fancy camera work) but watching this, and seeing how some of the scenes are awkward with how the actors are standing around, then randomly sitting down and being so careful with their stage movements. It wasn't fully engaging me viscerally as a film. Too many unnecessary close-ups of people's faces when dialogue becomes ""important"". Also weird CGI or something with some of the backgrounds and the tree at the end?I also felt Denzel was projecting a bit too much at times - like he was still giving a stage performance. I understand his character ""filled a room"" with his personality, and to that extent he succeeds, but I still couldn't shake that feeling. Viola is the best snot cryer in the biz."
FENCES,6 March 2017,8/10,"A character study of a black man (played by Denzel Washington) in 1950s America who had big dreams that remained just that. Washington is middle-aged, works as a garbage man, has a loving wife (played by Viola Davis), two children and a house — a decent living by most standards, but Washington is unhappy despite the many times we see him smile and grin. Unfulfilled dreams, the bitterness he holds on to due to the racism he and many blacks endured for so long, and the constant repetition of his weekly routine year after year has taken a toll on him, making him do something that will threaten to destroy his marriage and everything he worked so hard to build should his secret come to light.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Fences"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Washington's secret comes out and he has an explosive argument with Davis. One can feel the pain, disappointment, and rage so much that Washington and Davis, for a moment, cease to be actors and become real people whose lives are rapidly crushed within a span of minutes.For those who are unaware of the origin of ""Fences,"" it started as a play; and the movie stays true to its roots. Heavy on the dialogue, a sparse cast, and few settings, ""Fences"" holds your attention purely on the spoken words and the great performances of Washington and Davis.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
FENCES,25 March 2017,7/10,"I would give this film a good 7.5 out of 10 stars. I read some mixed reviews about this film and I'm on the side that says it's good, a bit long for what it was trying to deliver, but good. This film didn't need all of the thrills or heavy duty suspense to stay afloat. With brilliant and top notch actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis playing the leads their performances alone will make this film something worth seeing. Being that this film is from a stage play it's almost as if this were just a stage play done on a movie set, that's probably why it had so many bad reviews but I think the director (Denzel Washington) wanted it that way. This is purely a drama film delivered well by some of the most brilliant acting I have ever seen. I must admit, it does take a little while for the story to get good but it's well worth the wait. If you're into drama filled experiences with lots of symbolism and good acting I highly recommend this film."
FENCES,4 August 2021,10/10,"No need to say a lot, the aforementioned performances by the
""Dynamic Duo"" is all you need to know!This movie, in my
opinion is one of Denzel's and Viola's
BEST performances!Denzel made me want to slap the hell out of him, and Viola I wanted to hug and sit on the porch with!"
FENCES,7 July 2021,6/10,"Interesting movie, was more like friends conversation after work in his yard, cuz 90% of movie happened in his back yard or from house. I found the movie a bit boring becasue of that.No discussion that some people loved it, i just liked it ... i like long story telling movies but this one was a bit too static for me."
FENCES,23 March 2020,6/10,Fences should remain as a play rather than being made into a film.It's very stagey. Well-acted but I lost interest from the mumbly opening.
FENCES,8 January 2017,8/10,"I'm always weary and leery of plays what have adapted into film. I rarely enjoy staged plays because of the literal histrionics, all of which are unnecessary when projected onto the big screen. You see, movies benefit from close-ups, microphones, and thoughtful editing, none of which are appropriate for the theater, whether in-the-round or not. Indeed, one can hermetically take in a movie on a phone with earbuds, alone, in bed.What is the point of making a play into a movie? It all too often falls flat. The actors act so hard you can taste the hint of Golden Globes, maybe an ensemble Emmy (depending upon the venue). I have to admit, the first act of Fences is like this. The dialogue flies at you so fast you're not sure you're hearing actual conversations or a handful of logorrheic psychopaths who just happen to occupy the same backyard from time to time. Robert Altman, I'm looking at you.Thankfully, the second and third acts cycle forth with a better pace, with a perfect mix of seriousness and the occasional light- heartedness, ultimately finishing with a satisfying lesson: the racism and classism that has permeated American life from Day One will not be disappearing anytime soon in the face of neoliberal globalization and the faceless mulitnational corporations who benefit from the mantra: Make Good Life Choices and You Will Succeed.The acting is superb and only occasionally takes on too much of the play-y tone. Go ahead and watch it on your phone, alone, in bed."
FENCES,28 December 2016,10/10,"Denzel Washington as Director and lead actor of the movie Fences is excellent. Denzel Washington as a middle aged Troy Maxson and his wife Viola Davis as Rose Maxson seemed too real. Perfect mannerisms of a black, happy husband and wife. Stephen Henderson ( seen recently in Manchester by the sea)as Troy's friend for years was terrific. Troy, disciplined in his own way, has his share of foibles. Rose recognizes his pitfalls and is strong in her own opinions about how people have to be dealt with. Rose shows her maternal instincts in dealing with Troy's mentally disturbed brother Gabriel. Rose is lovable and kind . Rose respects Troy's son Lyons. And then of course their son Cory who is not too happy with dad's interference in his desire to play football. Rose does extremely well in taking care of Raynell because she is motherless and does not hesitate telling her husband Troy that now he has no woman in his life. Script is great . I enjoyed the screenplay , Direction, acting . Oscar worthy. Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen Henderson... terrific."
FENCES,29 February 2020,1/10,"Movies were invented because plays suck. We have the invention of the camera with all its capabilities because watching people confined to a stage is boring. So there's no more bland, superfluous use of a camera than photographing a stage play - the very problem with early movies from cinema's first few decades, and the only modern instance I can think of that pulled off the formula successfully was Glengarry Glen Ross. What I'm saying is, What was the point of this plain, TV-flat, boring video that does nothing to move beyond the limitations of its source material? Denzel directs and stars in this, not even 'adaptation', but straight-up direct photographing of August Derleth's play. The actors mostly talk/yell, pace around the house that the vast majority of the story is confined to, dramatize in classic stage fashion, familiar family melodrama unfolds - y'know, a play. Same exact formulaic flatness as all those Willaims/Miller/O'Neill's you probably had to read in high school or college. This pretty much only exists as boring homework for Acting teachers to assign to their theater class."
FENCES,23 February 2017,8/10,"More or less set within one single location, Fences is the third directorial effort from Denzel Washington and is quite tellingly an adaptation of August Wilson's stage play. It always intrigues me when an actor of Washington's calibre steps behind the camera, having not done so many times before, and with a cast that also includes Viola Davis, Fences was definitely going to grab my attention even more.Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is a man who very much lives by the old school values of working hard and never letting anybody give you a head start in life. Living in 1950s Pittsburgh with his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and their son Cory (Jovan Adepo), Troy tries to raise his family while coming to terms with the past mishaps in his life.Fences is very much a film driven by some astonishing performances and powerful dialogue written by August Wilson. The basic setting of the film lures you in while the far from basic narrative, full of emotion and consequence, packs the punch that makes Fences such essential viewing.There's no glitz or glam to any of the direction or cinematography however, there doesn't really need to be when a film can hold your attention through just the dialogue and performances. Fences has left me wanting to see how the adaption stands up against the stage play, and if it's anything like the film, it must be a pleasure to sit through.Coming to the performances, which really are the film's major strength, Fences will knock you well and truly out of your seat. I could watch Denzel Washington act all day and while it may seem like he's on autopilot sometimes, I can assure you he's not. Washington just makes it look so easy because he is so damn good and in Fences, he gives the best performance I've seen from him in a while. Up against him is Viola Davis, herself a force of nature in the acting department, and she delivers a wonderful performance, one stunning moment in particular making it adamantly clear that there is no one stopping Davis from winning all of the Best Supporting Actress awards going.Fences is a little lengthy however, when the film possesses such great performances and meaningful dialogue, it demands your attention from the first moment right through to the very last."
FENCES,7 March 2017,10/10,"My opinion---FENCES is the third feature film directed by Denzel Washington and it is the wonderful adaptation of the play of the same name by August Wilson, who received numerous awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Best Theater in 1987 . I was amazed by the incredible interpretation of Denzel Washington: (""legitimate voted best actor in the Oscars 2017"") and Viola Davis: (""best actress in a supporting role in the 2017 Golden Globes"") they are wonderful And make the movie even more powerful and emotional. This film depicts with great realism a poor African American family of the 50s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This film takes place like a closed house between the house and its small garden where the majority of the events take place there and the family life is dissected, FENCES is also marked by verbal jousts of Troy, the (Denzel Washington), his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and his children, you can feel all the feelings Troy has on your heart like: love, death, success, failures and conflicts of generations. - even having experienced and felt all these emotions with his father, wanting to restore his feelings to his family entourage. This film is powerful all the actors of the film have a presence that makes fly at every moment of their dialogues or publication, of the big, great spectacle. I loved this movie because the emotions were all on the surface, I never felt any exaggeration that could have harmed the film, on the contrary, a powerful film to discover, I adored him and he Gives for all these positive points the score of 10/10."
FENCES,12 February 2017,5/10,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.This is based on a play. That is obvious. Denzel Washington is carrying this so gracefully and strong, and still, I find this movie all to long and boring, in fact. Good dialogue, great acting, great composed. I still find it boring. As seeing a theatre in a very slow pace and almost just having a vast dialogue up close.If you like Denzel Washington and movies moving in a heavy pace from a play to a screenplay, you will love this. I have to defend Fences also. I have read some reviews giving one or two stars, and saying ""it is awful and just plain dull"". That is so far wrong. It is interesting, it is vast in acting. Its smooth camera work is exciting. Its costumes and time management of the 50's is astonishing. Therefor I will give this movie a 5,3. Worth the watch.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Academy Award nomination. Further questions? - The actors : Academy Award nomination. Further questions? - Entertainment : Sadly, just a little. Interesting, though. - Age : 135,3 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)"
FENCES,22 September 2020,9/10,"If you're disappointed (or even outraged) that Tyler Perry has never gotten Best Actor for one of his Medea films, do yourself a favor and avoid FENCES.If, on the other hand, you're a thinking adult with abundant life experience, you may just appreciate FENCES as much as I did. Though set in a working-class Black neighborhood in 1950s Pittsburgh, the themes it explores are timeless and universal.Yes, the film is mostly dialogue. But so what? It happens to be some of the best dialogue ever written! And it fully fleshes out the characters as three-dimensional human beings. What were you expecting? Action scenes a la UNSTOPPABLE? To quote a 1960s pop hit, come back when you grow up."
FENCES,1 January 2017,9/10,"I was glued to the screen for the entirety of this film. Denzel Washington is just so damn likable and charming that you are immediately sucked into his character. And as soon as he shows his more despicable side, you are able to sympathize with him more than you would have if Washington hadn't delivered as well as he did. He carries this film, and contributes so much to its emotion and heart. Troy is a very well-rounded character, and Washington perfectly encapsulates every nuanced element of the character. It's definitely one of the best performances of the year. Viola Davis has an equally subtle role as well, with moments of outburst that will leave you with chills. She is a very genuine and sympathetic person, and it makes some of the things that happen in this film all the more heartbreaking. But the performance I was most surprised by was Mykelti Williamson as Troy's mentally disabled brother. He never went overboard or over-the-top with the performance, but was rather restrained. It made for a very real performance that took me by surprise. I would definitely put him in consideration for a Best Supporting Actor award at the Academy Awards."
FENCES,28 December 2016,6/10,"Denzel Washington is not too good at playing the bad guy. I think Samuel Lee Jackson would have been a far better actor for the role. Samuel Lee Jackson has played the bad guy in movies like Pulp Fiction, and he is a very believable perpetrator. Denzel Washington is type cast. He is too sophisticated to play a character who screams at his son, has affairs and is a frustrated man in general. I understand that Fences is a movie about good and bad - a component of life - and I understand that Troy, the lead character in the movie is not all good or bad - however Denzel Washington is too nice a man to play this kind of a role. Denzel Washington, to me, is a man of integrity, vision, treating people with respect and trying his best to do good - like in the movie, The Bone Collector. I did not find it believable to see Denzel Washington's character, drinking gin with his buddy Mr. Bono and his adult son. Denzel Washington is too clean and sober to portray this kind of a hard lifestyle. To me, it seems that, in real life, Denzel Washington was a man of privilege. I cannot imagine that he climbed his way from a ghetto to fame. In fact, I think he is like B. Obama who had a silver spoon in his mouth. Samuel Lee Jackson - on the other hand - can really act in roles were anger, frustration, violence and conviction surface and it all seems believable to me. I am quite sure that a technique in acting is to draw on your own life experience, and this, in my opinion is what has made Samuel Lee Jackson a far more complex human being and actor then Denzel Washington.The movie Fences was a blurred vision of good and bad mixed together. I find it very hard as a white person to judge this movie. Who am I to judge another race and their interactions with each other? And who am I to judge if this is real or not? Is there a universal meaning to this movie? A universal message, transcending race? Is this movie about contributing to change in American and in humanity? Is this a movie about unfair starts in life? About family cycles of abuse? About the fact that it is hard to change oneself in order to get ahead in society? Is this a movie about inequality or the perception of inequality? Is this a movie about rich and poor? In some ways this movie was like the movie, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" where it was like a play and not an actual Hollywood Movie. Long dialogues and not much action or scene shots. I did have the feeling of ""Cry Freedom"" in this movie - but it was a feeling only. In Cry Freedom, Denzel Washington had a much more honourable role, in my opinion and I believe that Denzel Washington fit in the Steve Biko role far better then this role as Troy.Perhaps I am missing the point of this movie, Fences. The author of the book, wanted to have a black director for Fences - but in my opinion Denzel Washington is the most white black man that I have seen on the big screen in cinema. His blackness has all but disappeared. He has not characteristics, like Peter Tosh or Bob Marley had. Nor Nelson Mandela - who were Universal heroes in the International Community and who held on to their cultural heritage and reflected their cultural heritage. I do not see that in Denzel Washington."
FENCES,26 February 2017,8/10,"August Wilson's dramatic theatre play is brought to the screen by the hands of the passionate actor/director Denzel Washington.Set in 1950s Pittsburgh, Troy Maxons (Washington) returns home to his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and son Cory (Jovan Adepo) where he can earn the hard weeks work to where he regales his life experience upon his wife and friend, control the life of his son, and make a start on putting up a fence in his garden. Traveling in a absent distance of time, we watch as the family tension increases, as Troy ignorantly makes his stand as the man of the house and will continue tot point that out to everyone around him. As the dram continues the fence is gradually being built, but Wilson has not just created a fence as set piece, but all characters have their own metaphorical fence that they are using for their own reasons.What has clearly caught the Academy's attention is the powerful, and brilliant performances by Washington and Davis, and surprising by the supporting role Mykelti Williamson claims. Being 4 years since Washington's last nomination, and has since been filling that time by appearing in mainstream action blockbusters The Equalizer and recent Magnificent Seven remake, Washington proves he is still as talented as he ever was. Claiming the majority of the supporting actress awards is Viola Davis, who especially shines as the innocent housewife of Washington, evens out the balance of terrific acting that Washington sets. Most definitely going to claim that Oscar for herself, if not Naomi Harris or Michelle Williams. But the big tension is whether Washington will steal it from Affleck. I still hold faith that the Academy will make the right decision with Affleck, but rightly deserved nomination for Washington is also just.It is crystal clear that Washington has great love and passion for Wilson's script, as from also appearing on the stage play. Old Denzel shows that he knows these lines in his sleep, and definitely brings justice to the play on screen, but that is the issue.With Charlotte Bruus Christensen panning the camera around the comfortable set piece that through the 2hr and 18ms length we get very cosy with, we at witnessing acting happening in front of us, like being a theatre audience member. It cannot be denied that Washington brings the theatre experience alive on screen, but this is not where the story belongs. Watching the sensational performances in front is an experience that I would have preferred to see on the stage, which weakens the Fences' position as a film, making it feel like someone as actually just film the play.What one redeeming factor that film adaptation has brought is its rather well used editing by Hughes Winborne, but even when montage flashes and score arrive it takes away the authenticity of the acting in front of me, which therefore makes work better as a on stage play. Although I have nor seen the play, the film made wish I was watching the play.The film ending impact left me a similar feeling from familiar play adaptation August Osage County(2013), by dragging all warm emotions in me and leaving me feeling empty. So to say that its depressing is an under statement, but concluding with a satisfactory emotional end.Fences therefore becomes a hard hitting drama, made by the very accomplished performances from the cast, with a very uncanny appearance of the stage play, and an unnecessarily long length. With a nomination for Best Picture, I must say that I do not think this a good decision by the Academy, as I cannot recommend it as a film but as a frame of amazing acting. 8.2/10"
FENCES,10 August 2018,5/10,"They say this movie is based on a play...so I was focused on the dialogue. 
The dialogue was good.
Overall it was a good movie if you are prepared for it. By that I mean that if you expect an action movie you will be dissapointed. 
This is a drama that puts some light on the relationships within a black family.
Personally, as a black person raised in a black family, I felt interested by the story."
FENCES,3 October 2021,5/10,Viola Davis is the movie... flat out great acting. Washington was more like a chatterbox on stage. I never got the feeling that any character was truly related to another and just bringing home a paycheck doesn't make one a good father. Washington's character was deeply flawed by his past... and in turn he hurt other people without the right... and in the end... it was brushed over like it was cute. There is nothing cute about this movie... just sadness.
FENCES,28 December 2016,9/10,"Denzel Washington has been a favorite actor of mine off of the sheer fact that he is a highly talented performer. As if we did not already know this fact, 'Fences' puts the stamp on it (again, as if it has not been stamped more than a travelers passport). Denzel strings together immaculate lines and keeps the charisma and delivery at 100%.. Beyond Denzel, it was not only his performance that was strong but everyone's, and especially Viola Davis'. Without spoilers, everyone performed with such passion and power from every high point to low point, you as an audience feel it. You feel every emotion from high to low.. Lastly, I was impressed with simply how well done the play was translated to a movie screen. Having the author as the screenplay writer surely helps but regardless, in a time where we are drowning in a sea of book-turned- movie adaptations, this was a breath of fresh air as it locks your attention throughout with its cleverly chosen words/lines as well as how they were performed.With quite possibly one of the best acting performance films I have seen, 'Fences' is a must-see. Clearly, very dialogue heavy and possibly slow to some who do not like this type of film but regardless, if you are a fan of film, this is one to see.-- Oberrated --"
FENCES,26 December 2016,7/10,"Walking into this film, I had never seen the play ""Fences"" nor was I familiar with the story or what it had to say. While the film may have its downsides, its strengths make an extraordinary and emotionally powerful movie experience. The film's biggest strength is its stellar performances by its cast; particularly its two leads: Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Their performances are completely outstanding and they deliver some of their best in their careers (and that's saying a lot since both of them are incredible actors). Everyone delivers their lines with such conviction and emotion that it makes it impossible for you as a viewer to not feel like you're experiencing these dramatic events yourself. At times, you're reminded that this is indeed a play by it's theater-feel screenplay and it's pacing. That might be a downside or it might be a strength depending on how you look at it. Regardless, the film showcases amazing performances and a rich, complex character study of these characters who represent many in the the community in which they live. There is indeed a lot of truth to how this story is written. That being said, with that truth comes a sort of baggage or weight that comes from watching something like this. It's not an uplifting film nor does it get you into the Christmas spirit. It's a somber piece and it's probably not for everybody. Despite its demographic being restricted, the essence of the story and the characters feels important and should be valued. Overall, it's a pretty good film with phenomenal performances. If you're a fan of these actors or the source material, this is probably your cup of tea. If you're more of a casual movie goer and not looking for a film to emotionally drain you, you might want to look elsewhere for an ""easier"" watch."
FENCES,3 February 2017,8/10,"Unless music is involved, nobody these days talks enough about the great live Broadway performances, but more so the movie or TV series they are streaming on a mobile screen. So now, Denzel Washington (Malcolm X, Training Day) sets a clever strategy in place to create better public appreciation of the performing arts: using his experience acting in August Wilson's play, Fences, he combines the humanistic, real-time feel of a play with the eye-to-eye level of power created by the culturally obsessed virtual screen.How does he accomplish that you may ask? Well, only one single set takes up the majority of the film's run-time, giving the feel of one single continuous scene, only relying on dialogue to carry the tension. The genius fusion of these two artistic mediums results in a heated, unsettling character drama which sticks to your ribs and controls you.The living situation of the run-down family is meticulously detailed within their all-Negro neighborhood. Mr. Washington plays the indecent ruling patriarch over the home, a full-time colored garbage man, and the home's sole breadwinner. The mother played by Viola Davis (Doubt, The Help) stays at home, wondering where her self- centered husband goes after work each day. The oldest son played by Russell Hornsby (Grimm, Lincoln Heights) plans to pursue a music career, with money bargained by his unwilling father. The youngest son played by Jovan Adepo (The Leftovers) still survives under their roof, dictated by his unloving father. As we see their few highs and many lows under the heated sun, attention never gets lost with the crucial information learned about their hearts.Denzel Washington proves how his experience acting on Broadway has prepared him for his tremendous screen direction. He stages the actors to express the household's separation, however much the religious decorations on the house's borders force them together. Although the sets look way too much like on stage, hurting the ability to feel engrossed in an authentic looking worn-down predicament. But the theatrical greatness comes less from the theatrical set, and more from the theatrical dialogue.Everything coming out the actors' lips parallels a live show, while also imitating talk by genuine people. They talk aplenty about their personal issues growing up, so much so, you need to pay close attention to remember something important. In fact, the dialogue pacing spits out in the speed of a play, rather unsuitable within cinematic bounds, where the actors are not the only visual element to the story. So you may have to put your glowing screen in your pocket away while you ingest your undivided attention to the feature.Gradually, the tension between the tiny cast grows and grows from a serious lack of faith. Then suddenly, a devastating plot twist strikes you with snake fangs, pulling the less active characters out from the shadows to take charge. Never before since The Sixth Sense could a plot twist shake you so unnervingly. Even then, you won't as feel shaken as Viola Davis was while delivering her dialogue of epiphany, commanding true, powerful tears from the ideal independent woman who understands the world's needs.The discomforting new nature of this Tony-nominated play pulls back the picket fence to reveal a completely different side to the American Dream at the dawn of the Civil Rights Era. While the lack of any redeeming White characters gives the race an overly bad name, it helps to recreate the play's unique depiction of a fallen African-American family inside a changing world.So due to recent events, everybody must see Fences right away, no matter their skin color. Both 2016 and 2017 needed a reminder on the importance of building fences: who are we keeping away from our existence? Who are we keeping in to better ourselves? What do we tear down to help our loved ones be better than we ever were? Such questions explain the vitality of in-person storytelling including stage productions: it forces us to look closer and see people in person for who they are, which in my perspective, we could benefit from."
FENCES,18 April 2021,8/10,"From the very opening scene, to the very end credits, the performances in this film are off the charts good.I sometimes feel like Denzel Washington doesn't get the recognition he deserves, this film is an example of how good an actor he really is. One of the best of his generation."
FENCES,30 December 2016,8/10,"For those who may or may not know, Fences was originally a 1983 play by the legendary American playwright August Wilson. Set in the 1950s, Fences explores the evolving African-American experience, family, the relationship between a father and son, examines race relations, among other themes. The play won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 1987 Tony Award for Best Play. Fences premiered on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on March 26, 1987, and closed on June 26, 1988, after 525 performances and 11 previews. Directed by Lloyd Richards, the cast featured James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader, The Sandlot) as Troy Maxson, Mary Alice (Malcolm X, The Matrix Revolutions) as Rose, and Courtney B. Vance (Terminator Genisys, Office Christmas Party) as Cory. More recently, Broadway revived the iconic play. It opened at the Cort Theatre on April 26, 2010, with limited showing. Directed by Kenny Leon, this time around the production starred Denzel Washington (Training Day, The Equalizer) as Troy Maxson and Viola Davis (Prisoners, Suicide Squad) as Rose, as the married couple struggling with American race relations. The play was nominated for a total of ten Tony Awards, winning three for Best Revival of a Play, Best Actor in a Play (Denzel Washington), and Best Actress in a Play (Viola Davis). Now that we got that little history lesson out the way. Let's talk about the actual movie Fences, because that's what I'm assuming you are here for. The movie Fences is Denzel Washington's third directorial film. This time honoring August Wilson's powerful evocation of an African- American patriarch in 1950s Pittsburgh. Much like the 2010 play, this film brings back Denzel Washington and Viola Davis in recurring roles. The film focuses on Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) makes his living as a struggling garbage man worker in 1950s Pittsburgh. Maxson once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player, but was deemed too old, and at a time when the major leagues did not want black athletes. Bitter over his missed opportunity, Troy creates further tension in his family when he squashes his son's (Jovan Adepo) chance to meet a college football recruiter. I have seen bits and pieces of the play online, and a couple of things I can say is the play really does a good a good job of allowing the audience to feel sympathy for everyone, and has really good dialogue. It seems like Denzel really wanted to stay true to the original source material. This movie has a lot of dialogue that really brings you into the story. At some parts of the movie, it does feel like an actual play. Meaning, there is lengthy dialogue, not to many scene changes, and the acting is great. I know that may sound boring to many people. But believe me when I tell you this movie has great performances, you feel a connection to every character on screen, at times funny, at times sad, and there are some good life lessons throughout the movie. Now even though Troy is a tough father, you do see things from his point of view. On the other hand, you see things from his son Cory's point of view. Cory tells his father that he is jealous of him, and he will grow up to be better than his father. Jovan Adepo does an excellent job as playing Cory. In the film he does change. In the beginning he is scared, angry, and you really see all that rage build up inside of him, and when he finally unleashes that rage he might as well turn into the Hulk. So we see things from the father's point of view, and the son.The son wants to defend himself, live his life, and go for his dream. So every character in here you can relate to, even though they do have flaws. That is what makes the characters relatable and feel like real people instead of characters.Accordingly, this movie really is more about the characters and performances. Everyone does well in there performances, but when it comes to performances Viola Davis takes all the cake. So these are My Final B*tchin' Buddha Thoughts on Fences. If Denzel really claims his character was so good at baseball, I would believe him, because this movie hits so many home runs for me. It may have a plot we've seen before of the whole family drama. On the other hand, this has amazing acting, especially by Viola Davis. Anyone who has had family drama will certainly relate to this movie. It shows that the cast and crew love the original source material. The dialogue will encourage you, make you laugh, smile, fearful, and it sticks with you even after the movie has finished. In my opinion, the ending was just a little cheesy, but I like cheese. By the 3rd act of the movie, you start to really see Troy Maxson's real personality. So overall Denzel has crafted a movie a majority of people can get behind. I believe Fences earns8 out of 10!If you want to see a real good adaption of a play, you should definitely check this out. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always."
FENCES,17 October 2021,,"It was a film like a slice of life with its impeccable acting performances. Viola and Denzel's performances were truly unforgettable. Although I was pretty bored at the beginning of the movie, the movie pulled me in over time. I would have liked the movie more if Troy was a less antipathetic character, but it's good as it is."
FENCES,3 January 2017,9/10,"I really enjoyed Fences, starring the magnificent Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. The character that Denzel played in Fences, Troy Maxson, reminded me of the role of Walter Lee Younger in which Denzel starred in the play, Raisin in the Sun. I saw the play in New York in May 2014, and I was in the third row, center stage. I was in awe.Troy is a lovable character who was unfortunately bound to the hardships and discrimination that Black men endured during the 1950s in America. There were very limited kinds of opportunities available for Black men during the 1950s, and Troy was frustrated because he wanted better. However, he had to play with the hand that was dealt him. As a result, he found a few minutes of pleasure with another woman, and these few minutes allowed him the chance to relax and forget about the burdens and obligations of being the head of the family, being the only bread winner for his wife and son.Troy's wife Rose had her own problems. She too was bound to the limitations that her husband had to endure. She could only rise up if he rose up, and she had to make use of only what he provided. Hard times for the two of them.This movie was very believable and it was easy to get comfortable with all of the characters. I highly recommend this movie for people that want to view true cinematic genius, and not just the loud explosions and mediocre dialog.Again, I highly recommend this movie."
FENCES,12 June 2020,1/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but an episode of BBC soap Eastenders wasn't it.It's a family with an overbearing (not abusive) character of a dad. Washington's character loves to speak all day long about himself and his opinions. He was something in baseball before becoming a bin man. He complains about not getting far in baseball because of his colour etc (we assume there were different leagues for black/white players, we're not told). Every other word he utters, has baseball related terms. BORING! Rose his wife looks miserable and downtrodden, probably due to his overbearing personality. We don't know if she works too.I wanted to like it, but it was like watching a too long stage play (which it was), with actors just saying their lines. There was no feeling of warmth towards the characters (except Cory and Lyons). Davis overacts so badly: she's either sad and miserable looking but the scene with tears and smiles as she talks of love is hilarious. It's just so overdone. As for the final scene - what the heck was that!If you like a family drama where not much happens except emotions, a few arguments, and some very over the top acting (from the two leads) then this is for you. Me; I can get this at home!Loved hearing Dinah Washington."
FENCES,13 November 2020,6/10,"Not sure how many stars this should get to be honest. It's a decent character study, but feels unwieldy at times... not sure it hits the right spots, feels episodic and ""choppy""... the direction is pretty good, writing as well.... Danzel is alright, it's just that the theme feels a tad generic and the production isn't anywhere near it could have been. Also the conversations between the father and son feel repetitive after a while..."
FENCES,31 March 2020,7/10,"Acting of Denzel and all the other characters are great. Story is not so powerful, tells the lives of ordinary black peoplefocusing on a family. Technically film is perfect. You should be American to get the full taste. Not as well as Purple Years but more beautiful than many Hollywood films."
FENCES,22 February 2017,8/10,"The new drama film Fences based on a stage or theatre play starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. In Fences Denzel Washington stars and directs this compelling drama about a black family in 1950s Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1950s Pittsburgh, Troy Maxson (American actor Denzel Washington - Man On Fire, 2 Guns) once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player. Nowadays, he's a sanitation worker with a wife Rose Maxson (American actress Viola Davis - Prisoners, Get On Up: The James Brown Story) and a teenage son Cory Maxson (English actor Jovan Adepo - US TV Series The Leftovers), who dreams of playing football. But Troy remains bitter about the missed opportunities of his past, while at the same time trying to cope with the pressures of being a husband and father. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis reprise their roles from the award-winning revival of August Wilson's acclaimed play. The movie is tipped for Oscar greatness, having picking up nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Washington), Best Supporting Actress (Davis) and Best Adapted Screenplay. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Fences include American actor Stephen Henderson (Manchester By The Sea, Lincoln) as Jim Bono a longtime friend of Troy, American actor Russell Hornsby (Get Rich Or Die Trying', After The Sunset) as Lyons Troy's other older son, American actor Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump, Con Air) as Gabriel another friend of Troy, Saniyya Sidney (US TV Series American Horror Story) as Raynell Troy's daughter. Overall Fences is a good drama film filled with drama, family, friendship, the way of life back in 1950's Pittsburgh, arguments, falling outs, some minor fights nothing too major, the odd laugh here and there, tongue and cheek stuff, catchy music, sadness, hardship, story telling and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Fences an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Fences is worth seeing if you like other drama films along the same lines as this. So if you get the chance to see Fences in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."
FENCES,5 April 2020,8/10,This movie is packed with incredible performances by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Following Troy's character as he struggles to keep daily wages while raise a family in the way he believes is right for the times they are living in. Worth a watch for all who do not know how life in the 50s was for colored people.
FENCES,10 March 2018,7/10,"It is non-stop action (action of speech) from the word go, and once you are well and truly into it, there is no escape. It is understandably the cinematic version of a Pulitzer-winning play, with a handful of characters and few location shots; but my word, what acting by all, Viola Davis rightfully claiming her Academy award for a memorable performance. Denzel made me remember my own very strict father who I lost early and to say the least, it is indeed very touching. 7.5."
FENCES,3 January 2017,6/10,"I didn't like watching a selfish sadist hog the show. Troy was a narcissist and his son pegged him as such -- they don't want their sons to out-shine them so they give little to no encouragement or advice. His ""I don't have to like you"" speech to his son sounds like he's covering all the bases if you measure bases by food and shelter. But he leaves out love which is even more important. A boy raised with love out in the rain with little food would have been far more equipped to deal with life than Cory is. Troy hates himself and he's going to make sure no one else has any fun either.I am guessing August Wilson came from such a home. Perhaps Cory, the son, is a fictional version of Mr. Wilson. I don't think anyone could make up such a life of bitterness and rage out of whole cloth. But why do we have to see it? How does it benefit me to know such a vile selfish person lived and crapped all over those he was in contact with? It was probably therapeutic to write it all down. But since I had to listen to it I'd like to see a little of the therapy money. That's how hard it was for me to watch how he treated Cory, Rose and even Lyons, his older son (though Lyons wasn't trapped and could stop dropping by at any time). This isn't a movie review, obviously. It's my reaction to a story that was very difficult to watch. It wasn't much different than watching a Mamet play or something from Eugene O'Neil (or Edward Albee, or Arthur Miller). The characters all need help, lots of it."
FENCES,6 January 2017,,"This is a very moving film about the frustrations of blacks in the 1950's in America, a time when their disadvantaged status was changing from legal discrimination to customary discrimination. The acting of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis is superb and deserves recognition by the Oscars. However, while some might think this film helps to further the mutual acceptance of whites and blacks it could have entirely the opposite result. This honest portrayal of a black family, their life style, their concerns, their problems and their hopes can be viewed by whites with great compassion and sympathy, but it can also give whites the sense that they are correct in wanting as little daily contact with blacks as possible -- reinforcing their segregationist wishes as to housing, educations, and social relations. Blacks in the film do what they have to do to survive but many middle class whites will first feel that they are not like these blacks and don't want to mix with them. This is simply reality, not anyone's intention."
FENCES,16 February 2017,4/10,"**Watched for the 2017 OscarsJesus that was excruciatingly boring. This film completely disregards the entire concept of 'show don't tell'. The whole thing was characters talking at each other about seemingly unimportant events that happened outside the film that were somehow important to the story. Washington's character was incredibly annoying and wouldn't stop talking through the entire thing. Even though he was saying things, I had no idea what he was talking about for the vast majority of the film.The entire film felt completely unnecessary. Movies can do so much more than plays, but this didn't utilize any of that, and just felt like a play, which makes me question the entire purpose of turning it into a film in the first place. Really should have just stayed as a play. Additionally, this could easily have been cut down to an hour and a half instead of nearly two and a half.I really don't think this should have been nominated for any Oscars. It felt like obligatory damage control the Academy did so they don't get yelled at by liberals like they did last year.If anything, the only part of this I actually liked was Saniyya Sidney. She was a great actress and I'm excited to see more of her in years to come."
FENCES,2 September 2020,10/10,Denzel Washington and Viola Davis Should have Oscars for these performances in this play by Austin Wilson. A moving picture of the working classes in the 50's and one family's story. Loved this movie. It's truly A gem!
FENCES,9 January 2017,9/10,"In Fences, Troy Maxton is a middle-aged trash collector living in mid-1950s Pittsburgh with his wife Rose and their high school-aged son Cory. Maxton was once a baseball player of some promise in the Negro League. Unfortunately, the color barrier was not broken in major league baseball until Maxton's prime had already passedalthough a thirteen-year stretch in prison for an accidental murder also undoubtedly contributed to Troy's failure to reach the big leagues.As the picture begins, Troy's thoughts are occupied with a confrontation he recently initiated with his employer over an essential unfairness: The relatively-menial task of garbage collection is being performed by black employees, while the less-strenuous and higher-paying position of driving the garbage trucks is assigned to whites. On their walk home from work, Troy vows to this friend Bono that he intends to pursue the resolution of the unfairness, even if it costs him his job.Arriving home, however, Troy is also surprised by his wife with the information that their son Cory is being scouted by a major university, with the intention of recruiting him for a football scholarship—rewarding the son with a free education in exchange for his athletic abilities. Troy's reaction is surprising: The elder Maxton is mistrusting: Nothing, he claims, is ever given away for free, and the son is better off where he is—finishing school and keeping his job working weekends at the nearby A&P grocery market. It is suggested that Troy resists the son's college scholarship because he fears the son exceeding his own modest accomplishments.Also members of the Maxtons' extended family are Troy's younger brother Gabriel, and Troy's adult son Lyons. Gabriel is a World War II veteran who sustained a disabling combat wound, and is now mentally disabled and living on a veteran's pension. $3000 paid to Gabriel by the US government for his wound was used by Troy to purchase the Maxtons' home, with the understanding that Troy and his family would be Gabriel's caregivers, although as the picture begins Gabriel has recently moved into the home of a woman in the neighborhood, to whom the Maxtons pay a monthly rent.Troy's primary pursuit during evenings and weekends is the construction of a wooden fence around the perimeter of the backyard of the Maxton home. The reason for the fence is variously suggested as a means of protecting the family from the outside world, isolating the family in a domain where Troy is their sole provider, or as a means of keeping death—the Grim Reaper—away from Troy. In this manner, the Angel of Death becomes almost an unseen member of the picture's cast. The fence also is symbolic of the barriers Troy has erected between himself and his sons.Originally produced in 1983, a limited 13-week stage revival of Fences was staged in April of 2010 at Broadway's Cort Theatre. That production starred Denzel Washington and Viola Davis as Troy and Rose, and won three Tony Awards—for Washington and Davis as Outstanding Actor and Actress, and for Best Revival of a Play.The movie is directed by star Denzel Washington, and Washington the director serves the source material of Fences wellpossibly a little too well. Although August Wilson died in October of 2005, prior even to the acclaimed Broadway revival of Fences, Wilson is credited appropriately as the author of the picture's screenplay, ""based upon his play."" And with very few exceptions, a filmed version of the Broadway play is what we see with Washington's motion picture version. Most of the cast—-Washington and Davis, Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel, Russell Hornsby as Troy's adult son Lyons, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Bono—-also reprise their roles from the 2010 Broadway revival. And after certain key scenes, Washington the director even allows the screen to fade to black—for the viewer, it's impossible to not imagine the curtain descending in a stage production, to provide a break between scenes.But stage-bound depiction aside, Fences as a movie is an honor to watch, if not precisely a pleasure This is not a happy picture, and family patriarch Troy Maxton is revealed throughout the drama as a deeply-flawed individual. But the production is remarkably well-crafted, almost flawless, making superb use of its filming locations in Pittsburgh's Hill District, although the exteriors are seen in only a few shots. Backgrounds are digitally added showing 1950s-era steel mill smokestacks. And the production design is nearly perfect—even the garbage collected by Troy and Bono looks authentic, although the laundry Rose hangs on the clothesline in the backyards sometimes looks like it's already been dried and pressed.And the acting is uniformly superb by all cast members. At age 62, Denzel Washington as an actor has become nearly a force of nature, and plainly in Fences he's never been better or more effective. The sight of Washington opening a window during a rainstorm to bellow in rage at the Angel of Death reminds the viewer that film acting just doesn't get any better than this.Matching Washington eyeball-to-eyeball, if not scene-to-scene, is the excellence—almost saintliness—of Viola Davis as Rose. Davis' performance is a revelation, nearly an epiphany, and makes the viewer wish her gift as a performer could be used in more motion picture productions beyond the supporting roles she's played in other, more inferior films. This is not a supporting role—Rose could easily be advertised as the primary character in Fences.Fences the motion picture is also a work in which time has caught up with the artistic intentions and expressions of author August Wilson. Is Fences still relevant, thirty years after its stage premiere? Absolutely. More than age or affluence, inequality, generations, unfairness, politics, or even race, Fences is a movie about American life."
FENCES,27 December 2016,1/10,"First and foremost, this film is NOT about, ""An African-American father struggles with race relations in the United States while trying to raise his family in the 1950s and coming to terms with the events of his life."" It's about the late-in-life downward emotional, moral, and spiritual spiral of a self-centered, bitter, abusive, adulterous, and unapologetic African-American husband and father who from beginning to end, proudly spews his self indulgent negativity non-stop, and to the severe detriment of each member of his family. If your criteria for rating/recommending this movie is solely based on how well it adapts the stage play to film, or on the intensity and skill of delivering long lines of dialog, then you may rate this movie high, as many others have and many others will. It does those things. But what if your criteria for rating/recommending this movie, as 'unsophisticated' and politically incorrect as some may view it, is based on if it entertains you, if it lifts your spirit, if it inspires - if it makes you feel good as you're walking out of the theater? This wordy dirge does absolutely NONE of those things (with the notable exception of the charming performance of his mentally-challenged brother who delivers the most poignant scene of the movie at the very end).Although expertly delivered, the repetitive string of tediously self indulgent soliloquies were, cumulatively, very depressing. Thankfully the movie finally concludes, and with it comes a welcome conclusion to all the on-screen, and viewing, misery. There's more than enough real-life misery waiting for us all outside the theater without having to pay to suffer though it on the inside.P.S. The 'struggle' that our self-righteous protagonist speaks non- stop on and is attempting to portray, and that many viewers will BLINDLY champion, is mostly self-imposed: Choosing to be a strong-arm thief in his youth, he murders a man he is robbing. His choice sends him to prison which robs him of the youth his dream of playing baseball required. As a result, his choice also robs his wife of a husband, and his oldest son of a father as he was growing up; and his angry bitterness robs his younger son of not only a positive role model as he was growing up, but of his opportunity of earning a football scholarship. The film begins with him complaining that because of racial prejudice there are no black truck drivers. But when he asks for the job, he GETS it, becoming the first-ever-black-truck driver. But THEN he complains about being a driver! He finds a reason to complain about anything and everything! Wallowing and reveling in the all too common 'victim' mode, he finds fault everywhere, except within where it lies most: HIMSELF.One has to wonder why the intelligently talented Denzel invested himself in and associated himself with such a self-pitying loser of an African-American role and story. P.P.S. On a directorial level, the choice of suddenly ramping up a blues ballad to a series of pretty camera shots of the seasons changing was abrupt, disjointed, amateurish, and . . . WEIRD!"
FENCES,25 January 2017,,"Simply echoing what some have astutely pointed out already -- this is not a well-rounded stage-to-screen adaptation. By adhering to the palcosenico's static nature, the film ends up feeling devoid of progression, making it rather difficult for the viewer to connect to the characters that, on the whole, are simply not likable. Failing to frame the protagonists with even hints of the era and society they are living in, their turmoil and choices come across as haphazard, pointless and, at times, not very clever at all.Viola Davis should have been allowed to spread her thespian wings much more since the two instances where she is finally, finally! allowed to act, are the highest points of this effort. Sadly, Denzel Washington suffocates each and every scene with Troy's ego to the point of becoming tiresome and oh-so-repetitive; such focus is placed even on the most inane details of Troy's persona that had I not known he was the one sitting behind the lens, I would have thought the director were actually in love with the actor.An unnecessarily mishandled, overdrawn, mildly masturbatory disappointment, clearly structured on award watch and self-importance rather than with the viewer in mind. Alas. This, too, could have been something.Sidenote and praise to the owed: Hats off to Mykelti Williamson for his portrayal of Gabriel."
FENCES,16 January 2017,6/10,"FENCES is an okay movie that masquerades with the bragging rights of having been based on a Pulitzer-Prize winning play. I can think of many cinematic instances of a movie-adaptation failing to meet expectations (most recently I recall 'August: Osage County') and here is no change. What was once fine source material falls into a rut of theatrics and an artificial feel.The story is a close-knit family in an urban Pittsburgh setting. Troy (Denzel Washington) and his wife Rose (Viola Davis) struggle to make ends meet. Troy is a garbage collector with a son aiming at becoming a pro-footballer. His son shoots for the stars, and time again Troy works to keep him level-headed on the ground. Like the great characters we remember from Denzel's filmography, this is not a man we come to like or even begin to understand. He's the anti-hero. Rose, his caring and sociable wife, works to counteract her husband's stubbornness while never overstepping.The film seems to be a faithful adaptation to the play (the likes of which I have not seen), and here is the root of the problem. What I think filmmakers fail to realize is that although theater and movies run a similar vein, they are not interchangeable. Washington, who also directs the movie, lets his camera linger in wide shots while characters recite their lines as though memorized. They shift blocking periodically to create more interest in the frame, and then the dialogue continues. Think back to 'Doubt,' which was also an adaptation of a Pulitzer-prize winner. That movie used visuals and framing to help develop the story beyond words, and trust me that movie had a lot of words. Think of the snowy setting, the wind, the canted framing in the cinematography... It's not enough to just let an actor read dialogue. On film, audiences need to be wowed. I did find myself wowed only 2 times, and that was with the leading performances of both Washington and Davis, Oscar-caliber in every regard and such shining examples of why these two are some of the best. Denzel always has a control over his scenes, an eerie focus on his presentation, and even when we know that the film is falling flat, it is he that continues to wow scene after scene. Same with Viola, twice an Oscar-nominee (Doubt & The Help) and perhaps this year's winner, she doesn't so much surprise as demonstrate her fiery focus to her craft. I remember her major debut in Doubt and few minutes of screen time she had. It was an electric moment, acting like we have never seen... Viola's performance is not better or worse than those brief scenes, but it's hard not to get chills when you see a woman performing at the top of her craft.While I would give the movie a so-so rating, the acting is surely the only reason I could recommend seeing this movie. It's not often that a great play can be adapted into a great movie, but you have to commend the filmmakers for trying. If I had to be completely honest, the movie overall is a bore."
FENCES,11 January 2017,9/10,"Superb film. Across the board, the writing, acting, and directing are top notch in Fences. Of course, it's hard to go wrong when it's based on an August Wilson play--he was among our finest American playwrights-- but it could've been slow and lumbering in the wrong hands. Washington does an excellent job of directing the piece and keeping the story moving. It is often said that film is about visuals and the the theater is about ideas, and there's certainly a number of issues explored here. The play takes place in 1957 Pittsburgh. Washington plays a larger than life character who is former Negro league baseball star, who never made it to the big leagues, in large part due to racial prejudice of the day. 30 years later, he now works for the Pittsburgh Dept of Sanitation. He has strong opinions on, well, just about everything, but mostly on what a man's duty to his family is, the importance of a strong work ethic and a marketable skill, and how racial oppression damages the soul. There's a raw, untamed quality to Denzel's character, and though he laughs and jokes and flirts with his wife, you can always see that the rage of not having fulfilled his potential is always simmering underneath the surface. Viola Davis is amazing playing opposite him, as a woman who's whole identity seems to the success of her family and subordinating her own needs to those of her husband.What happens when a dream is deferred? How do you deal with that disappointment and anger? How does it affect those around you. These are all themes covered in the film. A powerful story that stays with you. For me, if a film can both entertain me and make me think, that's about as good as it gets."
FENCES,31 August 2018,9/10,Great movie wonderful acting denzel is electrifying as he controls each scene proving he is still one of the best.its pure acting no extra unnecessary things in this film it's just a great movie
FENCES,7 July 2017,9/10,"First of all, I must say that when I was already at my seat, I didn't actually knew what I was going to see. I mean, I had already seen the trailer and read the synopsis which basically says that the movie talks about the family struggles of an African-American man at the late 50's, and that's all.And this movie was also the must unexplored film of the Oscars for me because literally there was no cinema in the entire city that was projecting it and actually the only one nominated to the Oscars which seemed that all the theaters ignored.But then one day (last week) I was checking the listings of a theater that only plays art films and cult classics and I suddenly saw that this movie theater was projecting Fences. I immediately told my mother who also wanted to see it long time ago.Anyway, we finally could see this movie today and I must say that at first I wasn't understanding and easily missing quite a bit of what was going on because there were lots of dialogues which were said too fast, but then when I started understanding the story, I was more shocked every time, as for the truly unexpected situations, so for the performances (which were more stunning every minute) of Mr. Washington and Mrs. Davis. They were so great and real.I also enjoyed to see again Mykelti Williamson (who also did a great job), because I hadn't seen him acting again since Forrest Gump.In conclusion, this is a great movie that I highly recommend especially for the performances and the twists of the story. I think Denzel Washington did a great job of direction and performance. I'm certainly glad that Viola Davis got her Oscar, but I think this film was worthy of many more, including Best Actor (I still don't get what the Academy saw on the terrible and empty ""performance"" of Casey Affleck).Standing ovation for Mr. Washington!"
FENCES,23 January 2017,10/10,"""Some people build fences to keep people out--and other people build fences to keep people in"". The film ""Fences"" (released Christmas Day 2016) is based on the 1987 Pulitzer Prize winning play and screenplay by the brilliant playwright August Wilson (1945-2005). The psychology of his damaged character Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) lies beneath the surface as the camera lingers on his charm--and his luminescent smile-- smothering his dark side. Parts of ""Fences"" are almost unendurable for the tragic nature of each character. Fathers acting out their pain onto their children appear throughout literature and film, and this quiet catastrophe is a masterpiece. Read my entire review at: unhealedwound.com"
FENCES,26 October 2019,1/10,There aren't many films I give up so early but I could only take the first 15mins of this. I mean Denzel W is normally a good actor but his performance at the start of this film is amateurish and unwatchable. If only the director had told him to reign it in. Laughably bad
FENCES,6 April 2017,9/10,"Build A Fence To Keep Love In I'm sure most of y'all watched Fences because Viola Davis won the Oscars for SupportingActress and trust me she deserved that Osars for that performance. She was great and Denzel SHOULD have won not Casey Affleck for this film because his performance was moving, touching and brilliant.The film I will admit is a bit slow because it's basically Denzel, Viola, this son and one of Troy's brother Gabriel who is mentally ill due to being injuried in WWI and his co-worker/friend Jim Bono standing, sitting and arguing about everything from money, work, furniture, baseball, football and life.Now the film itself was a bit slow in parts but you forget all that when Denzel and Viola have their scenes together. Their is a scene in the film I can't really talk about because it's a very important scene in the movie but it's you've seen the film then you know what I'm talking about where Viola pours out her heart and soul to Denzel to try to make him understand how she feels, now that's why she got and earned that Oscars. Watch the film and tell me that scene won't make you shade some tears. Another scene and a scene that is a personal favorite of mines is where the son ask Troy if he likes him and Denzel gives this whole big speech about how it's his job to provide for him and his mother, it's not his job to like him. Ooh that scene was great and that's the part that should have won Denzel the Oscars but like I said it went to Casey which I've already mention and won't get into at the moment. Theirs a lot of emotional scenes but they add so much drama to the film and it's really interesting to watch.Now that we got all that out of the way let me tell you what I feel about the film. Now I saw it twice, once on blu-ray and I liked it so much I wanted my parents to see it so I rented it again on DVD so we could watch it together. Now you have to understand my Dad is a western/war type guy I didn't think he'd be interested in a film about African-Americans standing around arguing about money or what have you BUT he loved it. I was surprised when he told me thought the film was really interesting and that's saying something coming from a man who only really watches western films.Should you rent this film. No you shouldn't rent this film! You should BUY this film. It's that good. Now it's not for everything so I would rent it if you're not sure but trust me you'll want to add it to your collection."
FENCES,6 March 2017,5/10,"This movie is to acting what Steve Vai is to guitar. All fiddly-piddly high achieving riff mastery. But where's any tune melody or rhythm? Take a play and then use it as a film. But a film has many more elements. You need a likable protagonist, a great score, also don't film it in a backyard or it will bore people to tears.Great acting, set design and costumes. I you like Lars Von Trier you might like this. Personally I prefer a more dynamic work."
FENCES,5 October 2017,8/10,The cast is without any doubt awesome. Their capability is not unknown to most of us. So what they did on screen was not a shock yet we must take a breath and admire their work.Denzel again proved he is one of the best. Those monologues and those big stories were captivating. He can hold attention of the audience to an unimaginable level. Viola delivered a performance that overshadowed all her amazing performances that I've seen before. She is one of the best ever and she showed it here again. The supporting actors were not far from their leading comrades. They did great to complete the story.Denzel's first direction was pretty good. And I would love to see more from him. These types of acting driven movies are not that common and they are more than often very enjoyable.
FENCES,22 March 2017,10/10,"Films that are made from theatre source material can be a chore to sit through, but the best ones play so well that the dialogue alone moves the story. Plays are mainly dialogue, because all the actors have behind them are static sets so some imagination is involved in moving along the story. The best plays that are made into movies keep this flavor alive, and only add little cinematic effects to enhance rather than detract, and that's exactly what Fences does. This is Denzel Washington's third movie as a director and while previous outings Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters were both very good, this is probably his most universally appealing and a well-acted one. Washington and Viola Davis give the best performances of a male and female lead this year, leading to scenes so intense and true to life that it is is easy to overlook how powerful they are or how other actors would have played them wrong. Lack of success can make people bitter and act out in ways that have awful consequences for their loved ones, and as flawed as these characters are, it is impossible not to hope they can all find some measure of peace with each other. We are them and they are us, and we all want love and understanding at a basic level, especially when we are at our worst."
FENCES,4 December 2018,1/10,"What the hell did I just watch? Boring boring boring. People talk about nothing, no action, no story, just two hours of talking. Densel and viola are my favorite actors but geez, what's the plot here?"
FENCES,23 January 2017,7/10,"I attended Fences with full intention of writing a review. It's a hobby. You can sit down, start a piece, and finish. No one is paying me, I don't slog through a dozen revisions, or listen to an editor. And the reward is there, akin to a conversation with a close friend before even exiting the theater. The best are better and the disasters are suddenly goldmines.But sometimes the words are dead on the page. Out of habit, I scratch out X00 uninspired words without insight, perspective, or anything that could possibly appeal to anyone. See Fences, draft one. An obviously very good movie that was equally obvious not great. What a spectacular thesis. So I trashed it. Time passes. I allow myself to read some reviews. Every critic compared Fences and source material in a lazy attempt to animate their own lifeless reviews. Excuse the metacriticism, but this mediocrity will not stand.Fences is originally a Pulitzer Prize winning play. The sixth in playwright August Wilson's ""Pittsburgh Cycle,"" Fences was revived in 2010 starring the same faces in the film, Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. It won a fistful on Tonys. I did not know any of this going in, and I shouldn't have to. The film stands on its own. Fences is a character driven piece with little plot. The universe revolves around patriarch Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington), former Negro League star, now garbage man. Troy is an eloquent speaker and captivating storyteller. Good thing, because 90% of the film are his conversations, mostly expressions of deep frustration. Troy's primary salvation is Rose (Viola Davis), a devout, but infinitely strong wife. Together they have a son Cory, who seems to have a promising future in athletics. Troy is wary of such success because of what little professional baseball provided him. Troy forbids Cory's pursuits, an act beyond his son's comprehension that leaves an irreparable rift. Another troubled relationship is between Troy and his eldest son Lyons. Lyons is in his early 30's with a love of music, but without direction. Separated when Lyons was young, Troy outwardly treats Lyon more like a parasite than a son. A final anxiety is Troy's brother Gabriel. Permanently addled by war, the veteran wanders the street with a trumpet waiting for judgement day. Troy acts as caretaker, but it is Gabriel's assistance that payed for the home. Overwhelmed, we learn from friend Bono (Stephen Henderson) that smooth talking Troy is turning to another women for relief. Seasoned cinephiles can spot adaptations a mile off. Wrought with narration? Fair chance the movie was once a book. Same principal, different guidelines for adaptations of plays. First giveaway, dialogue heavy script. Second, limited locales with action primarily restricted to a single setting. Fences is a prime example of both points. Now these obstructions might bore some audiences, especially those who have never found live drama compelling. Worth mentioning, but the film is still not the play. One essential difference is the camera. In Fences, the camera is quiet, but never static, influencing the viewer in a way that should not be underestimated. A close up cannot be replicated on stage. If little old me knows that, so do the makers of Fences, but they're not resorting to such obvious devices. Critics might have loved an extreme close up or more long takes. In Fences, camera actions exist to highlight the performances. That's what the story calls for. When the takes do get longer, with the perspective slowly spinning around the back yard, that invisible camera dominates your attention. Failing to notice this manipulation is like never seeing strings in a puppet show. The puppet master did their job. Those complaining that Fences never escaped the shadow of the play went to the show hoping to see strings. Maybe we all missed the opportunity of a lifetime not taking a trip to New York and missing Denzel Washington and Viola Davis act this material live. Can't say, but I was happy to catch them in the movie theater. Chalk it up to nightly rehearsals on Broadway, this pair of performances establishes Fences as one of the best acted films of the year. And Troy Maxson himself, that character is an avatar of an agony beyond race, one that film rarely explores. Fences the film is a success. That should be all I need to say."
FENCES,2 January 2017,8/10,"Why did it take almost 30 years to bring this play to the big screen?A) They were waiting for Denzel Washington to be ready? B) They were waiting for Viola Davis to be ready? C) They were waiting for both of them to be ready?I'm not sure of the actual answer; but, C would work for me. Denzel has dialog that runs forever and he carry it all off with great emotion and facial expression. Viola Davis' dialog tends to run shorter; but, her emotional intensity is truly amazing. I can't speak to whether this is a true example of representative black life in the late '40's and early 50's; but, the movie does a great job of making me think it does.Award nods to both Washington and Davis and big kudos to the rest of the cast; especially Mykelti Williamson, Stephen Henderson, and Russell Hornsby. This film is both potent and poignant and should be seen."
FENCES,10 July 2019,7/10,"Denzel Washington both, stars and directs this Oscar-worthy drama with extreme confidence and reduced set-places in order to make this flick completely strong and almost dependent of the performances, which are top-notch coming from Washington and Viola Davis, providing excellent character, dialogue and acting in general, which unfortunately are the strongest cards of the film, overall, since it won't possess enough strength to flow as other superior flicks."
FENCES,25 January 2017,9/10,"Denzel Washington at his usual finest. Viola Davis Oscar worthy! Not to take away from the supporting cast but... Wow, she is amazing.While to some, the play adaptation may seemed cramped on the big screen, I believe this intentional. After all, we're talking about people living such a tight existence the only thing left between them is the shards of their broken dreams and one small unfinished backyard fence.Bitterness wrapped up in resignation, hope squashed at every turn, plus an ageing victim compelled to destroy the spirit of youthful ambition. Unaware of the cycle he's repeating.Absolutely beautiful to watch as a middle aged man come to terms with his own failures, demons, and temptations; not to mention the lives caught in his wreckage.We can literally feel the heartache on screen. This is raw, emotional vulnerability- understated yet powerful as it builds. Only at the end do we see the redemption and love that remains."
FENCES,12 November 2021,7/10,"It may start to get a little confusing, but it quickly solidifies and becomes exciting.The film does not live up to its script in terms of direction. It is as if Washington has made no effort to be creative and find a cinematic language to bring back Wilson's play. All film sequences are filmed in the simplest and most action-packed way possible. Fortunately, the scripts and games are so deep and brilliant that they do not stop the enjoyment of the film, but well, it can be said that the film with more active, creative and bold directing could add to the script and make it better than it is.Personally, I did not like the final scene of the film and the final framing, because it contrasts badly with the realistic texture of the rest of the film."
FENCES,22 December 2016,9/10,"In the new movie ""Fences"" based on an August Wilson play with the same name, lead actor and director Denzel Washington explores places with the film unexplored in the play.The story takes place in 1957 and depicts the daily life of an African-American family consisting of Troy (Denzel Washington), Rose (Viola Davis), Cory (Jovan Adepo) living in the city of Pittsburgh, playwright August Wilson's hometown. The struggles of their everyday life where Troy maintains his job as a garbage man, seeking a promotion, and Rose is the matriarch who's constantly going up for bat for their 16-year-old son Cory who has a promising future as a profootball player. An opportunity Troy is partially cautious of and partially jealous of. He himself sought a career as a pro athlete.Troy's guilt of using his brother, Gabriel's (Mykelti Williamson) insurance money from an accident for being his caretaker to buy the house for his family along with growing up with an abusive father and coping with the lack of moving forward in his life results in drinking and abusive behavior towards his son.The majority of the cast reprise their roles in the film from the play which they had acted in on Broadway. Viola Davis who plays Rose, won a Tony for her portrayal.During the first Los Angeles screening of the movie, the full cast was present to answer questions from Variety editor who moderated the event. Seven years ago, producer Scott Rudin send Denzel Washington a screenplay. ""Wilson wrote a masterpiece. One of the great plays of all time.it's the gift that keeps on giving,"" Washington described the ""Fences"" play.In the film ""Fences"", ""we get to see how Rose feels when Troy leaves. That wasn't in the play"" said Washington.Viola Davis said the two things that Washington said to the actors before filming were, ""remember the one"" and ""trust me."" Davis said ""he's got a bullshit meter. A lot of actors don't know what to say to you to bring it out."" She said of Washington that he's a great leader and you can trust him.The young actor, Jovan Adepo, who plays Washington's son, Cory said he cried when he learned he got the role in ""Fences."" He said ""it's a role you wait for and it's a blessing.""In the first act, Rose points out to Troy to finish the fence, a project that he has been working on with son Cory. A fence, it's noted to either keep the ones Rose loves in, or a fence to keep others out.Full review at: HollywoodJunket.com"
FENCES,5 August 2017,1/10,Bitter Black man blames White people for all his problems and the reason he treats his family like crap and cheats on his wife.The wife of the movie was the real star... standing faithfully by her bitter loser cheating husband while he destroys everything in his path.Would not recommend this movie as it does not portray Black men in a positive light.
FENCES,16 March 2017,9/10,"You've seen the movie it's a wonderful life? This one should be titled it's a miserable life. How Denzel did not win best actor and/or best director is beyond me. This movie is a bit like watching a play and reminded me a lot of death of a salesmen. Denzel is amazing in this role. He reminds us of how hard life was and can still be. He's an SOB who is dedicated to providing for his family as a man, but fails as one as well. He's strong and weak, leaving behind both anger, resentment, and yet love. This movie is fairly painful to watch and you don't walk away feeling much for him in the end. He's not a hero. He is just a man that tried, struck to it each day and made a life for those around him even though it was not pretty it was something they could hold on to. The movie also does a very good job of showing the perspective from each of the characters. Often movies only represent the main character, but you can see the pain of each of the characters as if the movie was their story. Well done ."
FENCES,14 December 2016,8/10,"This film is a great example of how exceptional writing can rivet an audience. It's based on a play, I understand. For anyone as unfamiliar as myself, the easiest way to describe it is as being very reminiscent of Death Of A Salesman. It follows in that long line of stories about Patriarchs crushed under the weight of their own psychological implosion, King Lear, the Old Testament's Nebuchadnezzar and so on.The quality of the writing is such that, by focussing on the psychology of one man and his own life, and its impact on his family, it makes you think about your own life and certainly your relationship with your father. It's called Fences, I interpreted this as the psychological fences people erect to protect themselves, fences which tragically keep those closest to you out.There was a little unevenness, the beginning seemed on the long side, but when the story steps up a gear, it seemed a little underdeveloped. But this is really a small issue. The writing pulls you in masterfully and exceptional actors work their magic with it. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis deliver master classes in power and nuance.I'm surprised that the IMDb description has it as being concerned with race relations. As far as I could see it had little to do with it and was instead concerned with the emotional faultlines of a family in a totally universally relateable way.Really worth it, go see it."
FENCES,1 February 2017,6/10,"Every boy and girls has dreams of what they'd like to be when they grow up: an astronaut, a ball player, a ballerina, a princess. Fences is the story of Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) who had a dream to play baseball. Growing up in the early 1900's, that dream was impossible for him as African Americans weren't allowed to play professional baseball until Jackie Robinson broke through that racial wall in 1947. By that time, the league deemed Maxson too old to play and he continued his career as a sanitation worker in Pittsburgh to provide for his family. He tried to be the good husband and father, but the pain of missed opportunity grew to resentment and anger over the years putting a strain on his family.Troy's wife, Rose (Viola Davis) tells him that their son, Cory (Jovan Adepo) is being looked at by a college recruiter to play football. Troy is set against it. Being a talented baseball player never got him anything. Tensions grow so deep in their family, Cory actually confronts his father asking why he never liked him. Troy's response is ""What law says I have to like you?"" His job is to put food on the table and a roof over their heads. He advises Cory that he can't go through life worrying about if anybody likes him. And that's just one of many problems facing the Maxsons. Troy's other son is a struggling musician who stops by regularly for money. Troy's brother suffered a major head injury while in the military. Troy is summoned to meet with union representatives after questioning his boss why only white men get to drive the sanitation trucks. And Troy is also dealing with other demons finding solace at another woman's home.Fences has been nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Leading Actor (Denzel Washington), Best Leading Actress (Viola Davis) and Best Adapted Screenplay (August Wilson). August Wilson was an American playwright who wrote a series of ten plays called The Pittsburgh Cycle. He won two Pullitzer Prizes for drama. Fences earned him one of those. Wilson was always revered for his portrayal of African Americans with humor, drama, and real brutal honesty. Washington and Davis brought every ounce of emotion from his writing and from the era to life in a film that is a slow, methodical, character-driven realistic tragedy of American Pittsburgh in the 1950's.I gave what looked like a beautifully and sincerely acted drama a 4 Star Prediction. At this point, I need to remind you of what my rating scale means. 5 Stars does not necessarily mean a movie is Oscar-worthy. It's more about my own personal preferences and the likelihood of my owning said movie and watching it repeatedly. By the same token 3 or 4 stars does not mean I hated the movie. In fact, I can see a movie and agree with it being nominated or even winning awards and still only give it 3 stars if seeing it once is enough for me. With that in mind, I'm giving Fences 3 Stars. Directed by and starring Denzel Washington, the August Wilson play was literally brought directly from the stage to the big screen. It had the same feeling as watching Oklahoma or Glengarry Glen Ross or Six Degrees of Separation. That's not a bad thing, but it felt very much like watching a Broadway production on a movie screen rather than a screenplay that was adapted for a motion picture. And Washington and Davis gave performances that would surely earn either of them a Tony Award Nomination. Though I don't disagree with their nominations for Oscars, I don't see either of them winning for their roles, nor do I see Fences taking home the trophy for Best Picture of the year. It was real, beautiful, smart, funny, tragic and wonderful; but for me, once was enough. If this was a stage performance making a tour like Wicked or Phantom of the Opera, I could see wanting to catch it again the next time it's in town. Being a major motion picture, though, I doubt I'll be watching it again and I'm sure I won't be owning Fences.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"
FENCES,5 January 2017,10/10,"OH MY GOD! Denzel is so good in this, it's not that somewhere in the movie he's giving an Oscar-winning performance. In the whole movie, his performance is a winning performance.I am so at awe with this performance. Not being English-native and having seen this movie in English only, I have not get it all and the fact that it did not matter says it all. I could have listened to this all day long, feeling like I have been invited into the intimacy of a kind family.It can be so hard to live and Denzel shows it all in this riveting piece with all actors being as good as him! No, really, class act! The truth of the matter is that African-Americans have shown too much grace all along their history. You're people to look up to! Kudos!! <3 <3"
FENCES,14 May 2018,9/10,"Fences was better than I expected it to be. This is a truthful story about America in the 1950s, bringing across themes such as race and religion as truthfully as possible. Other themes such as a parent's love for their child, a child's hopes and dreams, as well as a couple's love, was brought about many times throughout the film and was delivered to great satisfaction. Denzel Washington was amazing as the lead of being Troy Maxson, creating a character that we hated and loved, loathed, yet sympathized, and brought about a truly life-sized and three dimensional character. His intensity stole every scene he was in and his words was delicate, yet tough and scary at times.Viola Davis, as Rose, brought about an emotional performance as the wife of Troy Maxson, and was done so well that I actually felt an emotional connection with her.There are emotionally high and low moments that succeeded. I wept and cheered, and was genuinely angry at some of the decisions the main character makes. Rarely does such a film make me so engrossed in their characters. Fences is truly one of the best films of 2017."
FENCES,22 February 2017,8/10,"It's a powerful performance, no doubt. There was (most of) everything I would have expected in performances of a great movie. Troy (Denzel) was the centerpiece of that power. He really does a great job and I do not know what to call the Oscars hereafter if he didn't get it for this mammoth accomplishment! It is so strong and powerful. Viola's performance is equally powerful, not second to Denzel's. Her immense strength was to show the resilience she has at many low point moments in their life. And to upfront the reality, in many challenging situations, especially when Troy reveals about his affair with another woman. Most people nowadays will find Troy's character is so bullying and intimidating but that was the usual nature of fathers in the last century. We need to look at it in perspective, one in the evolution of much better parenthood we experience today. So it is not smart to blame the movie for Troy's oppressive parental regime. However, it was not without snags. Main drawback being far too long. It was pretty boring at some repetitive, overdone scenes and my guess was it could've ideally done half an hour shorter, in 1 hour 45 minutes, instead of 2 hrs 20. The most significant other failure is, it could not escape the original story's theatrical set up. It just looks like you were watching a performance at the Broadway. Set-up frames are really limited. Although it was adapted from theater, of course Denzel could have induced cinematic charm and background or set-ups to show that it was a movie! Location limitations were quite obvious, more than three quarter of scenes limiting to Troy's house and it's back yard. Director may have a theory in that strategy - like trying to tell how small the world Troy lived in. But it doesn't help to impose a gloomy limitation to the story line and how bad the location selections were made! My 8/10 rating is because of these snags.Overall, it is a good movie. I mean a really good movie. But it is not for the faint hearted! It certainly deserves couple of awards, especially to Troy and Rose characters. But we all know Oscars are not for great things and they all will go to la la people and that's the bitter reality of the world we are in now."
FENCES,20 September 2019,6/10,"So this is a play. I know they've filmed it and I'm not sure why, but it's still a play. You just happen to be watching it on celluloid. It makes it feel that it was done unnecessarily. Bar three scenes which are cumulative 5 minutes the whole piece takes place in and around Troy Maxson's (Denzel Washington) House, which he shares with his wife and and son. Maxson is a former baseball player that was never given the chance because of his race and now has to grind out a living on a garbage truck.
Maxson is reformed, (mostly) principled and engaging (to those around him) but is also loud, overbearing and damaged.
This can be established relatively quickly, certainly within 30 minutes you're going to have a good handle on the character. However Denzel (who directs this) uses all of the first two hours to establish these traits. He throws in a bit of plot so the characters wheel about a bit, but it's mostly ""here's what kind of person Maxson is"".
Maxson is not all bad. His intentions are good and he's fleetingly humorous but I didn't enjoy his company. Rose his wife says ""he filled up the house"" and he fills up this play. There's barely room for anyone else and everyone else is excellent, maybe not Lyons but everyone else. I just wanted a break from him. You do get one and it's glorious. Comfortably the most enjoyable section and because it's a little more ensemble, it works better and the other characters shine.
With the contrast laid bare it almost feels like the movie is self indulgent. Denzel takes on the role of legendary producer Bruce Dickinson, walks on to the set as says ""great, great but I think it needs more Denzel"". Like a cowbell? No it doesn't.
Well shot, well filmed, well cast and likely a good director in the making but I didn't want to spend two hours with Maxson and likely neither will you. SIX"
FENCES,11 February 2017,7/10,"Fences is a down the middle adaptation of the Pulitzer winning stage play by August Wilson. Denzel Washington stars and directs and it is soon apparent that Washington adores the material, not surprisingly as it is considered a classic especially in the African-American community. The downside is that there is a very specific talent in translating stage to film and Washington I fear, did not have the temerity to cut or change something he so loved. If you want to see that skill in action contrast Fences with Jenkin's ""Moonlight"" which is able to bring the stagecraft into the world of cinema.Despite this the film has meaty roles which bring out the best across the cast. Though I think Washington was not up to the directing challenge, he has no trouble in the acting department tearing off whole scenes and eating them up as Troy Maxson. He is matched at every turn by Viola Davis as his wife Rose - if anything Davis, has a more haunted and subtle performance. The rest of the ensemble are very good without shining.The major issue is that the film is too claustrophobic. Washington could not find a way to break the walls down whether of the stage or the house. Nearly all the scenes are two handers which then pivot to another character in the house. Washington needed to be ruthless - cut the running time down, edit the scenes down especially the ones in the first half and give the project some fresh air. Once the film finds its legs towards the third act there is so much dramatic momentum that it really sings but it is unfortunately too late."
FENCES,15 November 2021,4/10,"Except for the brilliant Viola Davies acting, this movie is somehow very boring. I had a hard work to avoid falling sleep through it. At the end, the message wasn't even enlightened or anything like that. I would never recommend it to anyone."
FENCES,24 March 2019,9/10,"I don't understand the comments about the film's dramatic origin. So what? It's a compelling story about a flawed man and his struggle to resolve all ""the whips and scorns of time"" he's suffered through.
The pace is slow and methodical, the man has issues to be sure. That is the point of the story. I streamed the movie expecting to pause it and continue it later, yet, I just couldn't do it.
All I can add is the final scene made me cry. Me, a 66 year old man with my own long slate of ""whips and scorns of time"" to deal with, yes, I admit it, it made me cry. Good job!"
FENCES,2 March 2021,8/10,"Fences was one of the first movies that I watched where I was immediately ticked off that the film was adapted from a play. Each piece of dialogue was uncomfortably long and I often felt it was gratuitous. Still, there was a clear benefit: the audience felt very familiar and understood each character and their motivations. Without the familiarity of the cast of players, Troy's reveal would have been much less impactful. We get an in-depth look at how families grow to be like or different from their parents and how families don't need to be blood-related, even in the most challenging of situations. Viola Davis gives a phenomenal performance that displays her being distraught as well as her resolve. I give Fences an 8/10."
FENCES,1 June 2017,1/10,"This film is so bad, i don't know where to start! It's just scene after scene of pointless dialogue. I've just finished watching the film and I couldn't tell you what it's about! This film should be offered by doctors on prescription for people that have trouble sleeping. Just pop this baby into your DVD player and you'll be in nod nod land in no time. If this film is worthy of an award then it should be for curing sleep deprivation. This film proves that even with an amazing cast of talented actors, acting their behinds off, you need some sort of semblance of a plot. Whoever wrote this, clearly just recorded a few conversations over the garden fence that his drunk neighbour was having in his garden and thought 'Yep, that'll do' When my baby son is older, I will use this film as a punishment for when he's naughty. I won't be grounding him or taking away pocket money, I will make him sit and watch Fences. I can guarantee after being punished once by me with this, he will never be naughty again."
FENCES,28 September 2017,8/10,"Thirty years after its first staging Denzel Washington produced a moving film about a poor black working class man chasing ghosts of the past (US segregated years) and its effects on his family (gathering around his caring and strong wife) and life long friend.The story is moving not at the least because of the strong performance of all the actors.Although almost the entire movie is staged in the backyard of the house, the story itself offers much stuff tot think over and discuss whatever your role you play in your family.Great movie."
FENCES,13 March 2017,8/10,"After seeing ""Moonlight"", I thought it was over rated and did not deserve the ""Best Picture Academy Award"". Today, I saw ""Fences"" and it is head and shoulders better than ""Moonlight"". Much more profound and thoughtful, with overall better acting performances and even the script seemed more realistic although ""Moonlight"" supposedly is based on the true story of the producer growing up. Much better done overall, so I have to ask why ""Moonlight"" won the award, and not ""Fences""? Was there some kind of backlash against Denzel Washington or some Hollywood insider voting to give a ""no-name"" or ""lesser name"" some notoriety. For what it is worth, I give this movie an ""8"", whereas I gave a ""5"" to ""Moonlight"" as my votes here at IMDb."
FENCES,2 August 2017,5/10,"This movie was very hard to sit through. It was so hyped up. I thought I was going to be watching another Training day or another amazing Denzel Movie. Fact is, it SUCKED! I hated it ad so did every person I know who has seen it.This film is suppose to be a Broadway play and a Broadway play it should have stayed! This script has no business being a feature film. The acting was great. Im not taking anything away from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, but it just seemed like a Broadway play on screen. That's all. It feels like this was just an opportunity for 2 amazing actors to show off their acting ability. Somewhat like Daniel Day Lewis did in ""There will be blood"", but the fundamental difference between ""Fences"" and ""There will be blood"", is THE SCRIPT! Fences is so inferior to the There will be blood. And as good as Denzel is at acting, Daniel Day Lewis is probably THE greatest of all time, Yes, even better than the legends.Bottom line is this. I feel it was incredibly over-hyped because of all the race-related drama going on in the world. The Black Lives Matter movement, and the ""Oscars so white"" controversy. It feels like they just HAD to put two amazing actors together and nominate them for the big awards. But it sucked man. It really did. Anyone who says different is either lying to you, or to themselves.6/10 stars"
FENCES,7 January 2017,8/10,"8/10. Based in the 1950's, we see the struggles of growing and living as an African American. This is the third movie directed by Denzel Washington, in which he also does an amazing and heart wrenching job as the lead actor. There is a lot of dialogue in this film, and is a bottle style movie, which all happens pretty much in the one house. Outstanding job by Denzel and by Viola Davis to remember all their lines, this is raw acting by the both of them, and really brings you into their lives. An absolutely gut wrenching job by Viola Davis, that frankly tares your heart out. Denzel excels in all parts of this movie, from director to his solid non stop role. I would recommend to watch this if you are a Denzel fan. Fences Movie #fences"
FENCES,6 April 2017,10/10,"It is the 1950s and middle class laborer Troy Maxson (Washington) struggles to raise his family, and despite having the support of a loving wife, Rose, (Davis), he must come to grips with the reality of his meandering life. This includes a baseball career that failed to pan out, a difficult relationship with a son from a previous marriage, and a back and forth with another son (Adepo) tired of living under his thumb. But a slip-up by Troy causes marital difficulty and he and Rose's love is put to the test. Both Washington and Davis are their usual brilliant selves, and it was a travesty that Washington did not win the Best Actor Oscar, but it is Henderson who subtly steals scenes as Troy's co-worker, alter-ego, and drinking buddy, Bono."
FENCES,19 July 2020,2/10,Me myself and I as the hiphop song from the 90s.. Too much superficial talk.. It may works as a live performance..Why so much talk ans so little consistency? But Denzel Washington is of course a great actor..
FENCES,1 January 2017,10/10,"We got outta the house for a minute, today on New Years Day to see ""Fences"". It was worth getting outta my pajama's. Great acting - Denzel, Viola of course. But also Mykelti Williamson/ Gabriel was a big surprise and very convincing. This story deals with ALL the ""Fences"" a family could possibly face and how they deal with them and remain a family. Coming from a background that was not privileged, it really touched me because I could relate to many of the issues. The issues the family deals with are so diverse, many would rip most relationships apart. I give it a 10! Hands Down...standing ovation!"
FENCES,9 March 2017,7/10,"+++ It so happens that once in awhile some fine movies crawl in at the local cinema amongst many mediocre ones. The last such good one was Midnight in Paris.Fences captivates through intense dialogues. These reveal present family problems, and pleasant or dramatical aspects of the past. Tory has had a rough upbringing (left home as a teen, prison) that left traces in his personality. Later in life, he experiences anger toward his son and is unfaithful. He prides himself on how he managed to raise his family despite the adversities. It is up to viewer to evaluate the worthiness of his life, especially if the viewer has a family. I don't have a problem with movies that contain little scenery and mainly talking (eg Carnage) if the talking is interesting. That's the case here- we are imbued into 50s black culture and the language is savorous. The script also touches social topics such as union and racism (eg the drivers are white) Interesting is also that Tory's best friend Bono is white, he calls him ""niggar"" and Bono shares some of his culture. Fences resembles the good ol' Spike Lee creations.--- I found the close ups unnecessary and making the filming more confined than it should be. The last 20-30 minutes could have been cut; at some point in the end it became preachy goody-good Hollywood style. Sure, more scenes showing the neighbourhood would have been nice (as in A Bronx Tale)- perhaps they would have affected the budget."
FENCES,20 April 2017,10/10,"Fantastic coming of age film about family and stability. The play and the movie mirror so many in society. May think about what could have been. Many hold their children back, afraid that they might pass them as far as success. Or they do not want their children to be disappointed if their dreams do not come true. Great acting and directing."
FENCES,29 September 2019,8/10,"The overall quality of the movie rests heavily on the shoulders of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Both were exceptional to watch as on screen husband and wife and in the dialogue driven movie about resentment, anger, pain, love, forgiveness and an old fashioned way of thinking they both shine brightly. The story is powerful and the long speeches are effective at setting the overall atmosphere. Denzel performs double duty here too as he stars and directs and coming away from this film I realise that he should definitely direct more frequently. My only real critique of this film is that it does somewhat drag at times and could do with being 20 minutes or so shorter."
FENCES,7 February 2017,9/10,"I never watched the stage play of this film but it definitely had a stage play presence in the very beginning as people stood around and talked in only two areas of the movie; the house and the backyard. At first I felt like it was going to be boring but I kept watching for something to finally engage me, and it did. When Denzel Washington(Troy), who also directed and produced the film, finally let out his frustrations to his step son, Cory (Jovan Adepo), I was interested in why Troy was so resentful and self centered towards the boy and even his wife. As the movie unfolded, we began to see why Troy acted the way he acted. And to some extent, I am sure a lot of the men in the audience could relate. By this time, I was hooked. I wanted to know what was he going to do as a man of the house now. He preached so much about how much he did for everyone and so persistent on putting up that darn fence, what was he going to do now? I was disappointed in his character but nonetheless very much enjoyed the movie. I do believe that August Wilson(screenwriter) would have been proud. Movie deserves a 9 from me."
FENCES,12 March 2017,5/10,"Style really does take priority over substance for Denzels' one-man-band; a whole lot of fuss for a film quite ordinary.Fences in many ways mimics a 1989 film, Do the Right Thing, which essentially tells a tale of life, with no intentions to over-dramatise or show a Hollywood filter over events. The idea of Fences is paved with good intentions - it is not a cash-grab like past Denzel Washington movies have been, and the plot does flow at a consistent rate. That consistent rate in question happens to be, however, a sluggishly slow rate.The movie seems to make a big fuss out of every little event that occurs; the opening of the film is a twenty minute conversation between Troy (Washington), his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and his best friend, Jim Bono (Stephen Henderson), with little context or connection to the rest of the film, with no other purpose than to make the characters appear more relatable - but this scene was far too drawn out to be a Tarantino-esque dialogue masterpiece.Despite these attempts, Troy is not a relatable character at all either, in fact most of the decisions he makes throughout the movie are completely unreasonable and yet as the main character he is painted out to be the moral authority. The idea of excusing him for his actions simply because he is from a troubled background with many difficult situations to deal with at once, is not how the movie should deal with his character. A character can only be excused for their unrelatable actions if their reasons for their actions are relatable, which in this case, they are not.Troy was played well by Washington, and most actors did a great job as a whole. Viola Davis was excellent in her role, and was essentially perfectly cast; Cory (Jovan Adepo) was good as Troy and Rose's son, attempting to impress his father constantly, and the emotions he conveyed whenever Troy would do something he disagreed with were authentic and natural as a performance.The problem Fences has is that it doesn't really go anywhere. The film has great actors, and environment for those characters to be in, but no opportunity to make a fantastic film out of a worthy script, which has some lines which even repeat during the movie.Fences does not really have a premise, there isn't a moral of the story and it appears like the film was put together as an idea before the script was even written to be able to simulate 'real life' action and conversation, but there was no need for all of this self-celebratory pretentious style which made the movie irritating to watch.I never found myself engrossed in the plot at all, and I couldn't recommend this since I barely found myself caring about how events would unfold or what would happen to the characters.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-fences.html"
FENCES,7 May 2017,10/10,We haven't seen this kind of movies in a while now... it reminds us of education... respect for our parents... depicts a family's story... a man's story... a family's history... how they hold on to each other... through everything... the maturity of the wife is amazing to see..I identified myself with the movie.. felt it.. and recommend it...
FENCES,7 April 2017,8/10,"To those who did not applaud, the eclipse of poverty blinds those who are too fortunate. Forgiveness is the foreground of this film, an honest portrayal of pride and racism, retained behind a 1950's city fence. There is no greater lesson than letting go of hatred and absorbing unconditional love, as we are all taught by Gabriel, Troy's disadvantaged​ brother. Lacking a true soundtrack from the era of civil rights, the cast and cinematography blend a beautiful climax."
FENCES,31 July 2018,8/10,"What a movie! Brilliant casting, amazing filming, a few scenes are maybe a tiny too long but it is undoubtedly a great great great movie."
FENCES,15 April 2017,4/10,Viola Davis and Mykelti Williamson were very good - but the pacing of the film was so slow and cramped. There are films out there with great acting - but the movie itself isn't good. This is one of them. Not every stage play should be put on film. What's good on stage doesn't always translate to the screen.
FENCES,26 February 2017,10/10,Intense movie. Powerful message. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are impeccable. I hope they both wins Oscars for this incredible acting. I think that Denzel should have been nominated for best director as well. The fact that they played the same roles on Broadway it's even more great. I think it's a good movie that should be more advertise.
FENCES,21 June 2019,8/10,"Denzel Washington knocks it out of the park on this one. He is entirely believable as a complex character- courageous but a bully, affectionate and tender but also hard and nasty. He should have received awards. Viola Davis also is convincing.The script is entertaining and some of the dialog is brilliant- especially the humorous parts. But it is not a classic, as it has a bit too much melodrama, especially at the end.One good thing about the script is that it shows a number of different character-types in a balanced way. You see each family member through the eyes of the others, but each (male) seems unable to understand his defects that are obvious to the other family members.It would have been more complete to include more religion, as surely it was an important part of the culture- and this household, based on the house decor, but there are only superficial references."
FENCES,5 February 2019,10/10,I enjoyed it. Viola Davis is a delight to watch on screen. The story was appropriate for that time period I think. I enjoyed it.
FENCES,2 August 2020,9/10,"An former frustrated baseball player lives his life as a garbage man looking only to support his family and throughout the movie it will present to us the relationship between Troy and the members of his family.
There's many reasons why I can rate this movie a 9 and here's some that u can catch at the first view.
Troy is a man attached to his past and all decisions that he made and all his views about the world were 100% influence by his past and all he had to live in. It's easy to symphatize with this character although it's equally easy to disapprove his actions and attitudes when evolve some actions that he had done with some members of his family. This easy symphatize is achieve because the writers and the director had the wisdom to give us his point of view and that make us understand it.
At the end of the second act to the third we are presented with an rollercoaster of emotions. It has been past some time and now things change and life went by. Everyone took different and one thing that I really appreciate is the fact that the metaphors didn't disappeared. The third act is very emotional. As the time goes by we will be presented with the feeling that something is missing, that maybe some issues should had been resolved and it wasn't because of the pride.
Rose is an incredible profund character. In my point of view she plays two parts. The audience part and off course the role she ment to be. With her we get to acknowledge that maybe the opposites of the story are in fact quite alike, and with her we are able to feel all the emotions that the movie have to offer. Viola Davis gave us the performance that we really don't deserve, but we need it. Rose is the sould of the movie and she carries out the 3rd act. Viola give us the true look when she's happy, sad or even worst when she's disappointed.
I like the fact that the redemption went in such an moving and not such direct way.
The only thing that I might criticise about this movie is some dialogue's that are too long and helps to much the audience understand every metaphor. I would prefer that the director had the courage to give the audience the opportunity to understand by themselves."
FENCES,31 March 2017,8/10,"Denzel Washington and Viola Davis - WOW! These two consummate actors carried this over-long movie so that the viewer ALMOST forgets how long it really is.Almost forgets, but can't quite forget. Two hours and 19 minutes of stage time is no problem. However, two hours and 19 minutes of movie time had better have explosions or engaging CGI imagery or, at the very least, beautiful scenery and many set changes. ""Fences"" has wonderful acting, not only from Washington and Davis, but it plays like - well, like a play on a proscenium stage.I'm sure the director (Washington both directed and starred) made the artistic choice to remain as close to the stage play as possible. However, some judicious editing to tighten the play (particularly the dialogue) would have been best.Plan your evening accordingly. Make lots of popcorn, pause the DVD playback for trips to the bathroom and/or refrigerator, and be aware that you need to listen to what's being said and prepare to feel for these people - because you will feel for them if you are paying attention."
FENCES,15 March 2017,,"It's clear this is a film adaptation of a play: in fact, it has the hallmarks of a play: little to no change of scenery, slow movements and focuses on the drama playing out among the actors. This explains why so many people who wrote reviews were split either calling it ""the worst film"" they'd ever seen, ""boring"", ""without action"", or ""superbly acted"". I do think the movie could have been shortened somewhat, and the script tightened up in the middle of the film where things seemed to wander somewhat. However, that being said, this is an acting tour de force. In the 21st C many people want to be entertained when they watch a film; but this film pulls you in by the sheer mental and emotional force of its characters, in particular Denzel Washington's Troy - the fast-talking, rigid, and sometimes bullying main character, while Viola Davis plays his quieter but extremely powerful wife. The supporting cast is excellent. Language is a vehicle for feeling and this is definitely a movie that allows these actors to display their acting chops and incredible talent. The writer explores some uncomfortable themes in a very honest way: the complexity of father-son as well as husband-wife relationships and responsibilities. For those who complained that the story was ""bleak"", I would simply say that not all story telling is about faeries and roses; life is bleak and miserable at times, people sometimes lose their dreams or become lost by giving up too much - an important message in this film - and it takes courage to write about these uncomfortable truths, and to examine them honestly and in such a powerful way on screen. If you enjoy superb acting, then this a great film. Viola Davis definitely deserved the Golden Globe and Oscar, and Denzel Washington brings all his talent and years of experience to the fore to play a not very likable but complex man who tried to do the right thing."
FENCES,3 February 2017,3/10,"30 mins in and I can't help feeling like I'm watching a true to life depiction of South Park's episode where 2 black couples are rambling about some loch ness monster, I'm not even kidding. And to think that this will go on for another hour and a half is just not what I can consider as entertainment. The ramblings go on and on about some s*** I couldn't give two (more like tree fiddy, lol) s**ts about. Most of the time, the audience was disconnected from the ramblings because it was going nowhere. It was odd not in a good way. I Have to admit that my expectations were high even though I'm not into serious drama genres, I saw the trailer and I knew I had to give it a shot. Denzel alone had me sold. So what happened? It's like the script was written to show off acting skills but it's like written by a guy with a bad case of Asperger, totally oblivious that people are going to sit through it and watch...It's so tedious that I did not notice the acting if it was good or not I couldn't tell."
FENCES,9 October 2017,10/10,"This theory simply states, that anthropologically, humans gave succor to the familiar, for survival purposes. If they knew the animal from past encounters, it meant it had not eaten them; therefore it was not a threat and a familiar interloper. Humankind can also be seen on the sidelines (i.e., the cave) clapping, when threatening species are killed by other predators. Fast-forward to entertainment in the twenty-first century; and why the mediocre are pushed forward as exemplars of entertainment.It can be noted that Australian actors win many awards in the USA, but do they win any awards anywhere else, no!? This is a false reading, as American acting has a limited pool of participants, who are not nurtured but then rushed in front of the cameras for what is termed 'product'. So when an Australian wins an American acting award, it is not anything more than a nod to being little more than mediocre. It is the mediocre defeating the mediocre. Case in point, Denzel Washington's brilliant performance in Fences, as leading male actor, was not familiar, was not mediocre, was utterly brilliant, as was the movie; but he was supplanted by the lead from the movie Manchester by Sea, as this was more familiar territory, a black man can't beat a white boy when he is acting the white man blues, this is the familiarity of survival. So Denzel's appropriate Oscar goes begging but will come up again, when the acting agenda is more familiar.In the USA, unlike Australia, there are no acting schools linked to a government fee program, hence the actors in America come from a fraternity of professionally focused individuals, the attrition levels must be incredible, but the actors who do make it to stardom, are then fully-supported in a 'star-system'. In Australia, it is more of an elite group, who are professionally trained but on the whim of perceived talents. Reading some of the other reviews for Fences reminds me of the Charles Bukowski line: 'They hate a man with a vocabulary'. Some here object to the fact that, the script is wall-to-wall text. Well for some of us that is all that matters, as one gun in a script is one gun too many, as the gun is meant to solve all script problems, beginnings, middles and endings – when in doubt shoot someone.Fences to me, as a scribbler, is 10/10, and when I see a movie rated thus I wouldn't see it, I generally become interested in a movie if it is rated 1/10 from the critics, as I have molded my tastes differently."
FENCES,2 November 2018,10/10,"Couldn't say much about the movie Fences. It is everything, family, father, husband, wife, son, daughter, friends, brother... Think this, If it was an Asian-American family story; if it was a Mexican-American family story, or any family, even our own family story... This movie is a mirror... feel the love, not to speak, watch this movie and speechless..."
FENCES,30 January 2019,10/10,"Best screenplay to movie in decades.
Where you can't even see, touch or smell ANY acting going on, it's that good. Transcendent portrait of an American family's struggle."
FENCES,28 February 2017,9/10,"In her Oscar speech, the wonderful Viola Davis gave away the reason why she's an actress. She said she wants to tell stories that celebrate life. That's exactly what Fences is about. Celebrating the whole journey.Fences is about a man, with so many fallen dreams. You can look at him and his dreams with very different lenses. You can see a man who has killed his own dreams, a man who chose to be miserable, stiff and unable to enjoy the little things in life. You can also see him as an innocent hardworking one who was pulled down with weights bigger than he could carry. You can see him as a lucky man considering his doings, who has a job, a family and a very good friend. And you can see him as all of these in one human being. There will be things you'll appreciate and others you don't, and that depends on who you are as a person.Fences is also about poverty, about love and respect and how fine a line can be drawn between both. It's about the difference between what we can change and what we will have to accept. It is about choices. It is about our minds, how and what we choose to believe. There are also painful scenes about mental illness, painful and poetic and true. My personal opinion is that race is not one of the themes as others have pointed out. I guess the story is very universal, very inclusive.The acting in the whole movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Amazing direction, amazing screenplay. Maybe the first 30 minutes weren't very eventful or purposeful, but the overall slow rate and steady rhythm were important to the story as a whole.People who love slow movies, with good drama and realistic characters may enjoy this. I don't know if we can learn something out of it, just enjoy it or have some good discussions about its themes. I guess it offers something different for everyone."
FENCES,11 June 2017,10/10,"""Fences"" (2016) I readily admit that I am an ""acting addict"". In other words, I greatly admire the craft of acting when it is responsible for making a good film into a great film. ""Fences"" is an example of this.Based on the play by August Wilson and directed by Denzell Washington, ""Fences"" will never appeal to those of us who relish those action-packed, comic book spectacles that dominate the industry now. That said, ""Fences"" was shot as a play: intricate scenes, minimal locations, emphasis on words and acting. Never boring, frequently riveting, it presents itself as a venue for all thought-provoking matters of the heart, as well as the nuances of growing up black in the urban setting of Pittsburg in the 1950's.So as not to ruin the experience, I won't get into specifics, but I will say that this film cemented my opinion that Viola Davis is one the finest actors of our time and earned the best actress Oscar, easily beating a quartet of wonderful nominees. Her performance was chilling; this is what her craft is all about. ""Fences"" was also nominated for the best picture award.With Denzell Washington at the helm, the film really delivered August Wilson's messages. I am miffed that Denzell was not nominated for the best director award. But, Mr. Washington's acting chops were on full display here and he delivered another notch in his belt of many superlative roles. Denzell rightfully earned a best actor Oscar nomination last year for ""Fences"".The cast was rounded out by Russell Hornsby (Grimm, Suits), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump, CSI: NY, Justified), Stephen Henderson (Manchester-By-The-Sea, Lincoln) and Jovan Adepo (The Leftovers, NCIS: Los Angeles) - all wonderful.My only complaint, a minor one, is the length of the movie; at 2 hours, 19 minutes, it does tend to drag a in the middle of the film. Rated PG-13 for language. Appropriate for teens; in fact, a great discussion film for parents and their older kids. There's a lot going on here that teens and all of us adults could learn from.Available on DVD and Blue ray. Should be on-demand from Netflix, cable companies and on premium channels, soon."
FENCES,25 December 2016,9/10,"""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in.""The first thing movie-goers should understand about Fences is that it is very much a filmed play. An adaption of August Wilson's Tony- winning play, director Denzel Washington has kept the project as minimalist as possible. There's good reason for this. Wilson's words are exciting enough that there is just no need for big action, large sets nor grandiose cinematography. Fences is a small, intimate story about Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) and his close-knit circle of family and friends. This small cast of characters is used to speak volumes about how far the Black community had come in overcoming prejudices by the 50s-era the story takes place in, but how far they still had to go. It talks about the roles of husbands, wives and children; the sacrifices we all make to support each other, often giving up our own dreams but never losing sight of them.Much has been said of the performances here, and with good reason. They're terrific. Viola Davis will get her Oscar this year, there's little doubt in my mind. Her Rose Maxson is so reserved and subtle for much of the film, allowing Troy's continual imperfections and abuses to store inside her and chip away at her emotionally until the final straw causes her to erupt near the final act of the movie. It's an emotional and painful performance to observe, and one many, particularly long-time wives and mothers, will find easy to relate to but at times difficult to watch.As for Washington, I find it difficult to understand why he isn't the front-runner for Best Actor this year. I've seen front-runner Casey Affleck's performance in Manchester By The Sea and it is excellent and look forward to Ryan Gosling's turn in La La Land; but what Washington does in Fences is special. Simpy put, it's one of the best performances I've ever seen an actor give. Troy is a very imperfect man to say the least. He's not necessarily a ""bad guy"", in fact most men will be able to see a little of themselves in Troy. He's a likable personality who does some despicable things. HIs tough love approach to raising his son seems more out of spite than love. And while there can be no doubt that he loves Rose, his behavior proves that love and respect are not the same thing. Washington crawls into this raw and complex character, becoming Troy to the extent that no matter how big a star Washington is, you forget you're watching an actor.The supporting cast fairs well, particularly Stephen Henderson as Troy's friend and work-mate Bono, Jovan Adepo as his son Cory and Mykelti Williamson as his mentally-challenged brother Gabriel. Everyone seems to be working their hardest to do Wilson's words justice, and their efforts result it what may be the most overall well-acted film of the year.Fences won't appeal to everyone. Those looking for action and extravaganza, this is not your movie. But if you're like me and enjoy watching good actors perform a well-written script, then you'll be enthralled by every minute of Fences."
FENCES,25 June 2018,6/10,Viola Davis and Denzel Washington were both excellent as expected.The problem with this movie is the fact that it is lost in a dilemma:Giving a universal message and inspire people or to make people cry over the characters' personal dramas.
FENCES,17 February 2017,10/10,"How lovely to see a film with *proper* dialogue and excellent diction. It is, of course, adapted from a Broadway play, so works hard to make every word count. In that respect it reminds me of 'West Side Story' or 'Casablanca' - lots of memorable lines that one will never tire of hearing. ""How come you don't like me?"" ""I don't have to like you!"" (Not a spoiler as this classic exchange is in the trailer.)It was a nice surprise not to feel my heart sink, as I realise I can barely understand a word the cast are saying in most films these days, as they mumble incomprehensible one-liners - for example, Nicole Kidman in 'Lion' (nonetheless a great film) - it restored my faith in the American accent and that it is not a completely different language needing subtitles.Viola Davis delivers an absolutely stunning performance. I cannot understand how in the BAFTA ceremony she only got 'best supporting actress', as she is far superior to Emma Stone in La-La-Land, who got 'best actress'.It's a super, super drama. The father and son conflict is acted out superbly. There are no superlatives to describe just how excellent this film is."
FENCES,18 March 2017,10/10,"***Contains SpoilersI finally watched this movie tonight and it was excellent. No, its not a thriller, an action adventure or a sci-fi movie, it is a movie about life. The life of a couple in the 1950's where men were viewed differently and so was the role of a woman. The acting was superb and the mentality of the main character was developed as you learned his childhood, early adulthood and all the things that led him to where he was and created a man struggling, self centered and prideful. I am a woman in her late forties and the movie is quite accurate in its depiction of the character being illiterate and believing finding a labor trade is the only real stability for a black man. It is uniquely true as well that a woman in Viola Davis role (Rose) would go along to get along and lean on the church for comfort and never consider leaving her husband.In these days women had few options and to have a man that wouldn't leave was something to cherish at all cost.You either have to have the age to understand this position or with wisdom appreciate their was a time these characters were more the norm than the exception to enjoy this movie. Not everything is for everyone but this is a glimpse back in to what was a realistic portrayal of an African American family in the 50s."
FENCES,4 September 2017,5/10,"I remember that everybody's acting was excellent, but I do not remember the story after I have watched. I remember only the husband Troy was cheating on his wife Rose with a younger woman and the wife was going to raise the child from the younger woman because she died from her child birth. There are too many things going on this movie and it is difficult to follow. Troy was so depressed and he was not nice at all. That was a story about a dysfunctional family which did not go anywhere. I got depressed after I watched. I did not find hope or life lessons from this movie because it was too depressing."
FENCES,19 July 2018,1/10,"I was hoping better from Denzel, the movie was very depressing."
FENCES,20 January 2017,3/10,"This movie took way to long to get to the point. It's basically this, a mean father treats everyone like bad, and eventually pisses off his own kid and makes him want to beat him up. Then the father dies an old, crazy old man after trying to mess up every ones life, nothing new here, but what makes this movie very hard to sit through is that fact that they make me site through every insult that they could come up with. It was like the same scene over and over, but with different cuss words in each retake. I figured out in the first half hour that the main character was an asshole, but they kept shoving this fact down my throat for another hour and a half.I get it, back in those days allot of people were not happy. Especially blacks who were discriminated against, but you don't have to try to kill me by making we watch dialog that reexplains this fact every thirty minutes. Throw in a car chase or something. Yes I know the crazy friend/cousin was the ""filler"" of the movie, but even that was lame or must I say not acted well. If it wasn't for Viola getting in some great acting (as she always does) this movie would of really sucked. I see you Denzel and I'm not liking what I see in this movie. I can say that Denzels character did kind of remind me of my Grandfather, he was strict, everything was his way or the high way. Didn't like no one, unless they came with some whiskey or beer. Funny how I can relate to that part of Denzels character. I got hot flashes remember how I used to get hit when I broke the rules. That's my own issue I guess. If you want to watch this movie because you love the actors in it, really wait for it to come out on Blue Ray. Save your movie money for another movie. This movie is nothing special(It could of been probably, maybe), and it will leave you wishing you could get back your money and spend it on therapy."
FENCES,1 June 2017,6/10,"I'll skip right to the only decent part of this movie - I didn't have to pay for it. It's too bad that the story was boring and predictable as can be, because I like Denzel and Viola. You've got a black guy in the 50's who is angry he never got to play major league baseball(Denzel) - even though he was a career robber and murderer. He's got a brain damaged brother who didn't get enough benefits after head trauma in WWII. A housewife who's nose gushes snot like a fire hydrant when she cries(Viola). And a high school age son who is being recruited by colleges due to his football prowess. By the end of this Sanford and Son episode the self centered liar Denzel has 3 kids with 3 different women, and he keeps his son from going to college. Add a bunch of drinking, a little child abuse, and the n-word about 45,00 times and you've got the perfect movie for ""affirmative action academy awards year"". Pathetic."
FENCES,23 August 2020,9/10,"Although I live in Russia, which is wild for the whole world, the film touched the heart and turned my soul. I recommend it to everyone. This is life and it is the same everywhere. sorry for mistakes - google translator."
FENCES,25 January 2017,8/10,"This film is about a man. A man who carries the burden of generations of hardship, who couldn't fulfill his own greatest dreams because of the oppressive context in which he lived and who tries to close himself off from the world with fences. Tragically, in closing himself off he loses site of the changing times, he boxes his loved-ones in, and he creates an oppressive environment that emulates everything he tried to guard against. The timeless question lies within this story (adapted from a Pulitzer winning play) is: can we hate a man like this? Or, when we consider his circumstances and trials, is he a hero to admire?It's worth seeing and is worthy of praise. If not from the acting (particularly Viola's), from the captivating and poetic screenplay. Every word uttered seems calculated by the mind of a genius."
FENCES,17 March 2017,2/10,"Sorry but this film SUCKED!All it did was drag on and on with highly paced dialogue. I don't know if what I am saying makes sense but it seemed to be to ""over-acted"" if that makes sense. When I watched it, I felt Denzel was acting too hard as if trying to show how great he is and maybe trying too hard for an Oscar.The fast pace of the dialogue lost me a couple of times and I lost interest and finally, after an hour, I walked out of the movie.This is something that should be good but isn't. I am sure it didn't cost much to make apart from paying Denzel's fee as it just seemed to be nothing but boring talk mainly in a back yard.Major fail for Denzel W"
FENCES,20 February 2017,6/10,"I didn't like this movie as much as I expected to. Sorry. The movie centers around Troy Maxon (Denzel Washington), a father to two boys of different mothers, a husband to Rose (played wonderfully by Viola Davis) for the past 18 years, an ex-con, a garbage man, and above all, an ordinary black man in the 1950's. No doubt it was a powerful script that most likely created an incredible play but it was not meant for the screen. It was obvious that it was a play, in the way they spoke and entered a room and carried themselves in a scene. I, of course, have not seen the play so I cannot speak with 100% certainty but I feel like the script wasn't adapted for the screen at all. It's not like it needed any major changes, just a few here and there to improve clarity. The passage of time confused me throughout. A scene would end and it would be the next day, then a minute passes and it abruptly jumps to six months later with no indication. This could be a statement on how his life passed quickly and routinely, but it felt like a swing and a miss for me. Viola Davis was wonderful. She deserves every award coming her way. I could sing songs of praise about how magnificent she was. 10/10 for her. Beautiful.Denzel Washington was certainly egging for an Oscar as he did what he did, but that's not degrading his performance. He did do good, but it was a bit distracting when he stole the show and didn't really let the other actors bounce off each other and him as much. It was all about him. Even though I constantly found myself criticizing this movie, I did like it. It had a magnitude that I cannot explain, otherwise I would've given it a much lower rating. I recommend this if you are willing to. I will warn you, it is tough to sit through a movie with no one to root for. Washington's character is not a good person and very unlikable, you don't really want to cheer him on."
FENCES,28 December 2016,9/10,"As others have mentioned, this film gets off to a rocky start, in that it feels very much like watching a filmed stage performance. This is in large part due to the static camera-work and odd framing choices that just moved back and forth between the three characters in the conversation. In fact, there were a few times during the film that I wondered if the scenes were shot with an entirely different camera crew, or if there were better options and the editor chose inferior takes. Undoubtedly, the average movie-goer won't notice any of this, but anyone who makes films or has studied them may be taken out of the story. But it doesn't last very long.I think it's actually a great testament to the quality of this film that despite the small distractions, I was able to dive back into the movie almost immediately. It can be difficult when you have such well known actors to not get caught up in watching them. But never once did it feel like I was watching Denzel and Viola as Troy and Rose. This movie is filled with award worthy performances, not just from them but from the entire cast, notably Stephen Henderson, Jovan Adepo and Mykelti Williamson. As an African American who grew up in Pittsburgh a generation and a half after this film takes place, it was a very real and honest portrayal of what I imagine life was like at those times. It is everything I pictured life must have been like at that time. That's what I've always loved about August Wilson plays. They are a beautiful snapshot of a moment in history. This film leaves you questioning what motivates you, what do you hold most dear, and whether or not you've let the people you care about know just how important they are to you."
FENCES,15 March 2021,10/10,"As a fan of the play I was hesitant to watch it, afraid that it may Hollywoodize the story, but this wasn't the case. Denzel and Viola deliver great performances, and manage to make this a fascinating watch despite the limitations of the setting. Highly recommended."
FENCES,7 March 2017,7/10,"I listen to highbrow music, try to stay well read, and make an effort to see all the Oscar nominated movies. But sometimes Radiohead is too heavy, Faulkner makes no sense, and fantastic performances are a part of slow paced movies. Viola Davis and Denzel were sensational, with Davis especially securing her spot as reigning Oscar heavyweight. I read recently that we all underrate Denzel's performances, because he's so consistently spot on. I thought these two were going to have an Academy Awards night sweep, especially after the SAG awards this year. But I don't picture myself re-watching this anytime soon. Performances near perfection, but film, 7.2/10"
FENCES,4 January 2017,10/10,"I watched this movie and thought:Wow what would it be like to live in a time where you didn't have much but made it buy anyway because you had to!Then i thought about my life and instantly identified with the story. This movie brought me back to when i was a boy about 6 yrs old and seeing my father come home from work every day but what made me sad was when he talked about his father and told us how hard it was,it brought back the times when living in the city (people have NO CLUE what black people go through)my father and i use to have to go down stairs and get water from a spout on the side of the court way building(it was about as cold as it could possibly be for me)we stayed in back in 1970 because the landlord allowed the water heater to free some how i have no clue but i know that the old contraption looked like a 5ft water fall that was frozen solid. We had to fill buckets up to bring upstairs to the third floor for drinking,bathing and for toilet use. That was another problem because,it was frozen solid too.The movie just made me feel like anything can be achieved if you just try hard enough.Most people might not begin to understand where i'm coming from but that's OK,i know some of you guys have your own stories.I felt like a kid just watching the story happen and wished at some point i was there living in that time.Viola Davis is one of my favorite actors and loved her part in the story,i can't see anyone else playing that part but her.Denzel,well what can you say.Superb!"
FENCES,24 June 2019,8/10,There's a ridiculous amount of talking but the hidden messages are absolutely fantastic. This movie could actually teach some of us a lot. You kinda get upset sometimes but it provides a real vision about the positive and negative sides of life. Negativities that we would love to just get rid off but unfortunately they will always exist. Mistakes that we all hate but some of us still make them. And there comes love.. this movie shows you many sides of true love. This is an absolute must watch on a quiet rainy day and I kinda can't wait to watch it again at some point.
FENCES,8 February 2017,10/10,"Oh, to have been a 'fly-in-the-brain' when Denzel Washington first imbibed August Wilson's character of Troy. It's straight out of the school of Arthur Miller's dysfunctional,dystopian 1950's, social family inertia, where dreams can never aspire or be allowed passage to a better place. Yet 'Fences' is even darker. At best Willy Loman could elicit, if not sympathy, then a degree of empathy with his audience, Troy, on the other hand, is manifestly without redeeming features. As an audience, we instinctively or intuitively understand that his motivation and actions were constructed, albeit with an unconscious misplaced belief, for personal gain and recognition. This is what sets him apart from Miller's protagonist. With Troy, 'self, self, self' overrides all of his actions. The only area in which he could glean a smidgen of morality, is his association with his brother, but even here he is left bereft, stealing from the traumatized war veteran. It has been said, in previous reviews, that Mr Washington completely and succinctly inhabits Troy's character. In the entire picture, not once are the audience given any facial expression, any physical gesture to feel that Troy questions his actions. His fervent belief that he is correct in all he does and says produces an actor of extraordinary performance skills. This performance by Mr Washington elevates him into the select pantheon of actors that can be mentioned in a single breath. What makes his performance unique in my mind, however, is that he sustains a character devoid of pity/sympathy, throughout, who the audience despise to their core, yet can acknowledge that this is one of the greatest presentations they have ever seen. This is the ability of a truly magnificent actor."
FENCES,2 January 2017,10/10,"The performance of Denzel Washington is perfect for this role. He should be nominated for an Academy Award. Viola Davis is also excellent. Moreover, the dialogue created by playwright August Wilson is as rich and poetic as you will find in any medium. I do not recall any other film that has such well-developed dialogue. Even though most plays do not translate very well to film because they have very few scenes and very limited action, this play does so. Despite the 1950's African-American dialect and slang, I was able to understand just about every word. If you are looking for a rags to riches drama or a film where the protagonists learn the lessons of life and move forward and upward, this film will not meet your needs.In the famous dialogue between Denzel Washington's character and his son about not loving his son, I regret at the end of his lecture not seeing the father put his arm around his son's shoulders to show that love. However, this movie is not about redemption but about how many people often cannot push away the effects of the injustices suffered in the past. Perhaps sometimes it is better to forgive those who cause us to suffer if that allows us to move on rather than to be chained to the past and not recognize progress by society. Denzel's character cannot recognize the progress made by blacks in sports, particularly in the baseball he loved, nor that blacks such as him could receive job promotions by their white superiors. He holds on to his bitterness too long, and excuses his misbehavior too easily."
FENCES,14 February 2017,3/10,"My husband and I embarked on a journey to watch all of the Oscar nominated films for Best Picture this year. The last one on our list was Fences. We had high expectations considering that Denzel Washington was the lead actor. We have never been disappointed with a Denzel Washington movie ... until now.The entire movie reminded me of a one-scene stage play. 90% of the movie takes place in the back yard, the living room, and the kitchen. There is far too much dialogue, and the non-stop verbal diarrhea came at us with the speed of machine gun fire.The entire plot of the movie is centered around an angry man who has nothing positive to say about his life or the people in it. What do angry people do? They complain. If I wanted to spend two-hours watching someone complain about their life, I'll go visit my in-laws and at least get a free meal out of it.We waited it out, teeth gritted expecting the movie to turn suddenly in an exciting direction. We waited for a very tedious two hours and fifteen minutes. Nothing happened.How this movie ever got nominated for Best Picture is completely beyond me."
FENCES,15 March 2017,3/10,"No white actors, not normally a problem. A movie based on a stage play, obviously well transferred. Nothing happens other than predictable emotional issues mainly from a mothers point of view. Brilliantly acted, but heavily dated and consisting mainly of incompetently addressed social issues. This plot has been done before in countless movies. Banal, boring and nothing happens. Don't waste over 2 hours of your time."
FENCES,4 January 2017,8/10,"In this age of CG and plots relying on action this film was a breath of fresh air. Having the feel of sitting and watching a play, both Washington and Davis field performances that are award worthy. A drama based in Pittsburgh in the 1950's it illustrates the trials and tribulations of the working class Afreican American at that time. It is hard to create a protagonist that has deep flaws, but it was managed very well in this film. A dark deeply gritty reflection of life in the 50's. The supporting cast is well rounded and adds to the flavor of this piece. I can see ""Fences"" win awards for Actor and Picture. It is not a light-hearted piece , so I would recommend being prepared to be drawn into a couple of hours of strong dialogue based drama. Well done."
FENCES,29 August 2021,10/10,"The film cannot be recommended for everybody and it is needed a kind of mood. It is about a poor afro-american man who's wordview is decided by hos childhood, his father and racism. There are some especially monologs, dialogs between father and his sons, the husband and wife, mother and the son. Denzel Washington is amazing, but Viola Davis who plays his wife and the young actors who played his sons and the older actors who played his friends stand their ground next to him. Viola Davis got Oscar, she deserves it."
FENCES,30 June 2021,7/10,"Very strong acting from Denzel and Viola, some quite powerful moments were captured here. The raw emotions captured in this film were under my suspicion of being unscripted (eg. Denzel hitting pots in kitchen). These moments are very powerful and were nice to see. The overall story really provoked some strong emotions in me of the family life themes that I can assume are quite common and universal. It seemed like there were too many words at times and one had to be quite attentive to hear what every word was being said. The accents were quite strong to hear the English clearly, despite being a native English speaker myself. The mass of words in high speed sometimes were not required and more suited for a live theatre setting rather than film. It seemed like it was a bit too long overall too. Overall, worth watching for something a little different and great acting."
FENCES,1 August 2021,9/10,"Good dad. Dont sleep on it, not for the action oriented."
FENCES,27 December 2016,6/10,"Didn't care for Fences on the stage and didn't care for it on the screen. I found it too talky with very little action. I was told in writing classes to SHOW--not TELL. I didn't feel Wilson followed this rule. There seemed to be endless monologues of Troy pontificating about race relations, job security, extramarital sex, etc. Instead of him talking about these things--why weren't there scenes of him actually experiencing them? Wilson couldn't have flashbacks of when Troy was turned down as a baseball player, when Troy went to prison, when Troy met the woman who gave birth to his daughter, etc.? These scenes would've been a lot more interesting than Troy's endless monologues. And it would've improved the cinematography in the film too! The only thing I liked about this movie were Washington and Davis's performances."
FENCES,5 April 2017,8/10,"A meaty film, lots to chew on, often not easy to watch. This is not kick-back entertainment. This is a film to watch when the grey cells are craving stimulation and nourishment.You can quibble about staginess, and about the over-prolonged story arc, and this and that. But in scene after scene, you will be transported by dead-on powerful acting. The scene where Troy brings his illegitimate newborn daughter home to his wife is just one that deserves mention.In the end, you are left to ponder a vision of a strong man warped and twisted inside. He loves, but he is full of anger, and he hurts those he loves. It's a tragedy. The characters must suffer, supported only by the strength of stubborn stoicism. They build fences.The fence he builds out of boards is never completed, but it's just a symbol of the fences of the mind, that are likewise imperfect attempts at defense and control, the fences that keep us in our private, invisible, and inescapable prisons."
FENCES,29 March 2021,9/10,"You need to get into this at first
It's a lot of talking.But it sucks you in quickly.He's a stubborn know-it-all.But what a performance. Not just Denzel Washington but his whole family does a fantastic job."
FENCES,3 January 2017,8/10,"Fences is a movie about life. It won't be for everyone. Ten people in our theatre left early. It is a really strong performance by the whole cast. It may hit home for some people, as it did for me, but others may not want to see their memories brought to the big screen in the way these actors performed. Denzel is a disciplinarian, and he has his rules that only he can understand. Without question, Fences is the best film I have seen in a year.My wife and I really appreciated seeing this. While I am no expert on cinema, I anticipate Fences winning some awards."
FENCES,13 January 2019,1/10,I now understand why Denzel directed this movie and chose to star in it because the main character literally never stops talking. If the movie didn't have subtitles I would have checked out within the first 5 minutes but I made it to 35 before turning it off out of sheer boredom.
FENCES,17 August 2017,2/10,"We watched about 10 minutes of this, trying to give it a chance. It wasn't going anywhere and was just boring. Fastforwarded...Same crap, same slow pace. Boring, unintelligeble dialogue, no character development, no plot, nothing to hold your interest. Why this movie is rated above 4 or 5 stars is a mystery."
FENCES,1 March 2018,7/10,"This movie begins slowly, pacing its way through established character history and the complicated natures of human relationships. The lens with which Denzel has chosen to cast light on these characters takes time to ignite, but when it does? Watch out. This is exceptionally true in the case of Viola's depiction. Her character not only carries the weight of her husband's mistakes, her acting also carries the plot forward. Rose's strength is the foundation that keeps this family together. Her commitment to her family transcends the constraints of the complications between her and her husband. There are so many moments that I wish I could delve into, but this movie surprised me. It took a bit to get where it was going, and by the time I was ready to give in, it threw an emotional tidal wave at my feet as if saying, ""There. Are you happy now?""When it hits, it hurts. Someone get Viola Davis a million dollars."
FENCES,5 March 2017,8/10,"I regret but I was disappointed. As a play this would be magnificent but film is not play unless it is a film of a play. The acting is terrific but it could have taken place against a moving background - yard, house, street. The intensity of the dialogue even Shakespearean, would be excellent for a drama in the theatre but not for a film. Imagine a play where we had long discursive periods of silence. That is the equivalent of this film. I wished it would finish. I had come for a film and not for theatre. Also, as a character,Rose not of course as a dramatic character, I think is a weak woman. I am sure she is right for the period and the society but today why could she not stand up for her son?"
FENCES,25 February 2017,8/10,"To Viola Davis. I can't say that I'm not impressed. But that was the best motherly, wifely act I've ever seen. The role suited you perfectly. You were terrific. On the other hand, Denzel Washington. My man😁..The acting was beyond my expectation I ain't never seen no acting like that before. It was superb. Denzel put on one hell of a show. The best colored drama I've seen. Flight was another great movie that I admire so much. Now, I Can't wait to watch the second installment of the equalizer."
FENCES,18 March 2017,6/10,"the film fails to expand upon August Wilson's stage version. While sticking true to the play, the film does not adapt well on the big screen. Simply put, it does not introduce the viewer to the 1950's Hill District, or Pittsburgh in a larger context. Why not show Troy's interactions beyond his home or Corey's success on the football field?...something impossible on the small stage. While a poignant story Fences is better left for the stage."
FENCES,30 July 2017,8/10,"A very good and heart-wrenching movie, but it stays a bit too close to its roots as a play. Everyone involved delivers a gripping performance. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are both amazing; all the supporting cast are wonderful too but I'd specifically praise Stephen Henderson (Bono) and Jovan Adepo (Cory). The movie is small and tight and focused; I can respect that choice, but it comes at a cost. We spend probably less than five minutes anywhere outside the Maxson home, and every one of those scenes feels like a welcome view into the larger world that Troy inhabits. Exploring this world would flesh out Troy's life and ground the choices he makes. Maybe that wouldn't work out well -- it would require stepping away from August Wilson's excellent play and creating new material. With Wilson no longer alive, it would be a serious risk, and so the safer choice is essentially a filmed staging of the play. Rating this movie with 8/10 stars is a bit unfair, as it's filled with wonderful performances. But it suffers from being so near to greatness without quite making the jump."
FENCES,12 August 2018,10/10,Fences displays some of the finest acting I've ever seen in a film. Denzel is greatly supported by the rest of the cast loved all of the actors. I want denzel to direct more films. He should have won his 3rd oscar but lost to a pervert aka cassey affleck
FENCES,20 February 2017,4/10,"I did not like this movie. In fact, I barely made it to the half-hour mark. I kept wishing that Denzel Washington would just shut up. Within minutes, I was irritated by his self-absorbed, narcissistic, bullshit- spewing character.I'm sure some people will say that I should have watched the entire film in order to give it a fair review, but from what I've read in others' reviews, that would not have changed much. It seems the entire (too long) film was the same as the first 30 minutes.I don't generally like movies that are based on plays because it is so obvious that they are stage productions, and this is certainly no exception. I wasn't aware that this was play before I sat down, but I recognized that it was within minutes. And it should have stayed in the playhouse, in my opinion.Some will agree with my assessment and some will disagree. And that's what's great about art: It means different things to different people. For me, this was not a contender for best picture."
FENCES,29 January 2021,4/10,"Films and movies are they really the same thing? I suppose it depends on your definition or maybe you subscribe to whatever definition is online or suits you but for me they are different. For me when I think of a movie I think of something that calls in crowds and draws large ticket sales, at least in modern respects. Film on the other hand, and again this is the way I think about it, doesn't have to be good overall but must have great performances by one or more performers. Fences falls in the ""film"" category for me. The individual performances are fantastic but the story is just blah. If you asked 19 people who saw this film what it was about you might get 10 different answers and they would probably all be correct. I am a big fan of all of the main performers in this film but I almost shut it off several times. I found myself grabbing my phone and surfing the news instead of trying to keep up with the random shouting about oppression or baseball or parenting or providing for a family or adultery or war or war injuries or money blah blah blah. Watch it if you want. You won't feel good about it at the end. You will however probably say ""what the hell did I just watch?"""
FENCES,19 October 2020,6/10,"Oh, dear. The paternalistic way the father (DW) was building (however imperfectly) his son's character was a great example of the traditional father, the normal family; you know, the people, that BLM want to destroy. This black 1950's family was rich compared to us; he worried about the cost of repairing the roof -- ergo they OWNED the house. I was jealous of him having such a problem: we white Irish had no such luck -- it was rented rooms all our childhood. I'm just looking at the film through the eyes of my own experience. Two booooring hours in. There's a Jesus plate on the kitchen seal; she's in Church. Lack Lives Marxists are going to hate that. Can I take another 45 minutes?? No, stopped with 35 mins to go."
FENCES,2 March 2017,,"I enjoyed viewing this the day of the Oscars and I think I might go see it again! The theme of this movie is about manhood, being a father and being a husband for Troy Maxson, an illiterate African American man born in 1918. He left home at age 14. He was incarcerated. He was a Negro League ball player. He is a full time sanitation worker (what we used to call a garbageman). He is a good provider. He turns over his weekly paycheck to his wife. He takes care of his disabled brother. He is the father of 3 children by 3 different women. He drinks gin. He builds a fence.Troy Maxson is also a raconteur, a strict father and an adulterer.This is an African American story. But, there is also a larger human story here about what it means to be a father. There were elements of Troy Maxson's character that reminded me of my father, who was Caucasian and born 10 years after Troy, and I see some of these elements reflected in my brother: the desire to feel free, the desire to feel powerful and the desire to protect their sons. I see also the downside of being so stoic and responsible -- the inability to show an interest in their son's talents. The definition of love for this generation was quite different. As Troy Maxson tells Cory, ""I don't have to like you."""
FENCES,9 October 2020,7/10,"Troy's long monologues, which are worth listening to in the original language to grasp the marked Afro-American cadence, are effective but demanding for the viewer, who requires an effort to fully appreciate a film with a clear theatrical setting, long lasting and total absence of dynamism. Excellent performance of Washington and Davis."
FENCES,24 May 2017,8/10,"Watching ""Fences"", it isn't hard to tell it was based on a play. It is very dialogue-heavy and much of it takes place in and around the same house. In the beginning, it can be hard to keep up with the dialogue, but eventually it becomes easier to understand. The performances are superb. Denzel Washington is terrific, making his character sometimes difficult to like, but entirely human throughout. Viola Davis is also astonishing (it's no wonder she won an Oscar), and Washington's direction is also commendable. As I mentioned, some may find it too talk-heavy, but it's still well-worth viewing for the strength of its performances and emotional resonance. 8/10."
FENCES,5 December 2017,4/10,"This is like watching people who are really good at their job. Unfortunately, that job is sorting widgets. The dialogue pacing is way off. Too slick and too snappy. The first 10 minutes of the movie made my head spin with the dialogue. I literally could not remember anything of the dialogue from the first ten minutes later in the movie. I think they forgot this is a movie and not a play. Overacting and some poor acting abounds. Get the feeling the director failed to reign in Denzel."
FENCES,3 June 2019,9/10,"Extremely well done movie. All acting, no frills. Denzel Washington amazing as always, Viola Davis and all other actors top notch. Highly recommend."
FENCES,31 May 2017,6/10,"I had high expectations for this film, and was rewarded with a truly excellent performance by Ms. Davis. But there were too many other problems with it, starting with poor editing, stilted dialogue and a surprisingly unconvincing performance by Denzel Washington. Since Mr. Washington was the main character, that of course led to a problematic result. I can't say I would not recommend this film, and perhaps it should be viewed for Ms. Davis's performance. But on the whole this was unfortunately rather mediocre."
FENCES,31 May 2020,4/10,"Very boring. Very , very boring. I did not bear more than 20 minutes and asked myself, who on earth would like to watch such a tedious film?"
FENCES,18 July 2021,5/10,"Denzel's character speaks too fast, too much, it was really tiring to watch."
FENCES,11 February 2021,9/10,It's a beautiful film...its poetic at time with those lines...the depth in the characters...rich in story tellingWhat a cast...amazing... love it...life in poetry
FENCES,24 December 2018,9/10,A perfect story about an imperfect father. Beautiful script
FENCES,26 July 2021,1/10,Denzel is an awesome actor but this movie put me to sleep.
FENCES,2 October 2017,8/10,"At first sight, I did not want to watch this movie at all, but fortunately I did! This was a beautiful movie. the actors went deep into their roles. some scenes lasted for a few minutes but the actors continued to go on in there roles which was really impressive to me. One of the nicer things in this movie was the beautiful acting work. Denzel Washington who played as Troy Maxson does a fantastic job! This man could act incredibly well! his role as a father could not be better suited to anyone else. Something that struck me is that The film showed us that not only white people but also colored people participated in the world war what many movies do not show us. Colored people have also done their duty in the war! Troy Maxsons told us that life as a colored person is not easy. He works for his family and does everything to have a roof over his head, but sometimes he forgets to think about his family. and neglects his son and wife. When the son returns from the war he gets the message that his father died. he does not want to go to his funeral first, but his mother can conquer him. This movie went unbelievably deep, yet no other movie that could show the reality so beautifully. people build a fence around their homes to keep people out. or, to keep them in..."
FENCES,6 October 2018,10/10,"Wow wow wow ... the most influential movie i have ever seen in this Millennium
great performance from denzel and viola . it can makes me cry . i don't have negative criticize for this movie ... maybe at the beginning i have got annoyed from too much of speak but it was necessary to move between sadness and happy , 
it has great message and good scenario"
FENCES,30 December 2017,9/10,"Eloquent, powerful dialogue. Gritty scenes and words and emotions. Intense acting. And a captivating, measured pace. I have not seen this story on stage, its original home, but now want to see it.Translations (""adaptations,"" in a less artistic word) from novels and plays and short stories to the big screen present challenges, and yet potential glorious victories (see my love for ""Nobody's Fool,"" ""Fail Safe,"" ""Arrival,"" ""West Side Story"" and others). Fences is a glorious victory in and of itself.Denzel Washington, one of today's most compelling actors, finds the victory not only in acting the prominent role, but also as director."
FENCES,8 December 2016,,"First let me say that this is a powerful, engaging film. Seemingly, however stereotypical, the opening of this movie feels like a stage play exposition. Although moving forward I found myself increasingly involved in the life of, to me, a thoroughly selfish, almost despicable, protagonist. Denzel Washington inhabits his role as one would fit into a perfectly tailored suit. The depth of his character fits him like a glove. The dislike of his ""Troy' is palpable. It is Viola Davis' performance that gives us any acceptance, and even a modicum of empathy, for his unrelenting dis- likability. Her 'Rose' is a tour-de-force and one of the most honest performances ever put on film.I personally see it as less a film about a man coming to grips with prejudice than as a damaged child trying to make sense of a world over which he was unable to reconcile his life. In the greater scheme of things, yes, he had a menial job, but he did have a job. He has a family that he treats as possessions rather than people. When his son accuses him of not wanting him to surpass his father in life, there is a validity to the claim.The direction, cinematography, music and period feel, with the exception of an uneven opening, proves Washington a masterful film maker. The difficulty in adapting a stage play to the screen is almost overcome with only a few scenes playing like a filmed stage set.If it were up to me both Denzel and Viola would receive the top 'Best' academy awards with Denzel also receiving a nomination for best director. Unfortunately the stiffness of the script, in my opinion, should keep it from a best film nomination (although it will probably get one). As a side note, it seems silly for Viola Davis to be entered into the competitions in a supporting category. She is the strength of the movie and in too many scenes to even be considered 'supporting.'"
FENCES,22 May 2021,7/10,"Viola and Denzel turn in their best ever performances (and thats saying somthing). Powerful, nuanced and complex characters. Viola was rightly rewarded with an Oscar, Denzel should have also won, but lost out.The performances are, however, let down by some very basic film making from Denzel. The screenplay feels like a direct lift from the stage production and doesn't benefit from all the opportunities that film could offer."
FENCES,20 July 2018,9/10,"The real Denzel Washington is here, a movie for the history.
Really great performance of Denzel and Viola, great start, real drama, fair ending.
I like this man."
FENCES,3 June 2018,7/10,"Great acting, all performed good in that movie. But sometimes i found it boring, too long movie."
FENCES,29 December 2016,4/10,"I usually love his movies, but this ones a bust. Wonderful acting by all, but drags and drags and drags and drags, much like this sentence. Yippie Denz can memorize 2000 words and banter back and forth with his fellow actors. Nothing but dialogue for the 1st hour with nothing, going nowhere. I literally droned out for large chunks of the movie, he talks so fast and so much I just couldn't stay focused on any part of it. This was not just me feeling this way. My mother wanted to leave after 30 minutes and on the way out the couple in front of us were debating on what place it was going to be on their ""worst movies ever list"". I heard ""we should have going and seen Rogue One"" by a group that was behind us.This movie has some great acting, but it takes more than that to make a great movie. This one does not measure up. One of the most boringly paced movies I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and wait till it comes out on Netflix so you don't feel violated by spending good money on it."
FENCES,12 January 2017,9/10,"Watching ""Fences"" worried me that it would be another bleak, realistic life drama. I don't enjoy watching those kinds of films since real life is hard enough. Because I appreciate Denzel Washington as a positive person and talented actor, I viewed it to the end. The ending was so worth it. Love is redemption. I so agree that love makes life worth it. Acting was amazing! Viola Davis and Denzel Washington well deserve all acting awards. Washington sympathetically portrayed a flawed character who despite seeming like a really hard man was so much better a father than his father was. Viola Davis's characterization really touched my heart. So many times I wish I could have hugged her. She brilliantly portrayed how difficult it is to be everything for the man you love and yet try to carve out a place in your life to realize your separate dreams too."
FENCES,8 April 2017,2/10,"It is basically a fd up story of a man and his family. A man who is very odd and egoistic and rude to his kids. This man thinks that he is a realist and he is the best and perfect. He thinks that he knows everything and whatever he knows and does is the best right thing to be done. But...! this comes out later that he is wrong, he is no good like he thinks he is. He made mistakes in the past which wasn't good at all. He again making mistakes doing wrong things thinking that they are the right things. He totally messed up the lives of his family; his wife, his kids and then the guy dies leaving his family behind with nothing so good to live with. It is a totally messed up story of a very complicated man and his family, there is no good in it. Okay, if we see from the perspective of what we can learn from it is just the one thing that don't think that you are the best and the perfect one and knows everything. Put your ego aside and let others lead a life they want to live. Don't put them with restrictions and limitations according to what your mind can think is the right thing to be done. It is a real Fd up story no one ever needed to watch and waste their time upon. Yes, if u have got real plenty of free time, you can go for it, but it is no good, there is no good in it and nothing to learn as well. Just waste."
FENCES,21 March 2018,9/10,"Story of my life? Maybe this is a peek of what goes on in my own father's mind. It's crazy how much of the screen time is just them sitting back and chit chatting, but they pull it off"
FENCES,16 April 2021,9/10,"The movie version of August Wilson's play, is shot almost entirely in the backyard of a house in the 1950s.The male lead role was played by Denzel Washington who plays a selfish man who cannot follow the changing world and consequently underestimates and oppresses others around him. Considering that he is wronged and that life owes him, he demonstrates power at the first opportunity, unable to express himself in a different way.Excellent Viola Davis who fully justifies the winning oscar for best performance by an actress in a supporting role and sums up an entire school of fathers with the phrase : ""Your father wanted you to become everything he was not and at the same time he wanted you to become everything he was""."
FENCES,27 February 2017,4/10,"With a total of 139 min one might think this movie is packed with stories. But no. It is extremely long paced and for the most part boring. The acting is spot on and the dialogues portrait life the way it could have happened to this family. But I basically just lost over two hours of my life listening to some insignificant dialogues which I would've ignored if I would've overheard them in real life. It took him more than 1,5 hours to even start with his fence. I mean really how can you get so easily distracted the first 200 times you try to start building a fence. This somewhat enraged me. I know - one can argue - that the fence is just a mere metaphor. But it is also a vital task!This might be a good script for the stage, but it hasn't been very well adapted on the screen. Viola's acting is superb, though. And the final scene is gold. But it's not worth the chore of waiting over two hours for that."
FENCES,3 February 2017,10/10,Like the title says watch this movie if you're looking to get into acting. Mr Washington at his best. Smooth talking direct. Any black/brown person out there will be able to related not because of the issues that the movie covers but being able to like DW to their grandpa or dad or even some 50 year old man. Everyone knows someone like the character DW play. The way he carried his lines. The flow it was him talking. Was not him remembering lines. He got everyone around him to become improvise. Real good movie. Will it get and Oscar ? maybe but i feel the movie was not done for that. It was done just to show of how good DW can be. We are often seeing him killing people or being a bad guy. So to see him just being a dad in the 50s who regrets and want to talk about is past. It Movie touches on racism but only a little. So its never in danger of being a black vs white movie. The passion love /hate between DW and Viola Davis is outstanding. All through the movie you see what happens one two people marry for different reasons. One for love the other to just be with someone.
FENCES,5 January 2017,1/10,"""The New Yorker"" says that this based-on-a-stage-play movie itself is somewhat stagy. It's far more than that. It begins on a fast treadmill with Denzel Washington talking non-stop for about the first 20 minutes; others can barely get a word in edgewise. I actually put my hands over my ears to mute somewhat the annoying patter. So much for personal reaction. As a critic I think the dialogue problem is twofold: (1) The text itself is stilted--typical Broadway drama trying to sound like the way blacks talk (e.g., like I hear them in the YMCA locker room), but it has no rhythm, no lilt, no naturalness--there's a ""Broadway formality"" about it; (2) neither Denzel Washington nor Viola Davis sound at all natural with the text--no rhythm, no style, stiff--they sound like they're reciting a text. In fact, they both played in the 2010 Broadway production--they still sound like they're on stage instead of before a movie camera.Not only is the dialogue stagy, the camera work and direction (Washington is the director too) are extremely stagy. I was constantly conscious that I was sitting there watching a movie rather than getting lost in the story itself; I could practically hear the director saying, ""Move here. Get that clever shot from the ceiling there. Etc."" It felt mechanical and poorly edited, without the flow and grace of a MOVING picture.The problem with this film is Denzel Washington himself. According to Lauren Chval of Redeye (whose article was printed not once but twice in the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle), author August Wilson insisted that a black man direct because he could bring ""cultural literacy"" to the film. Fair enough; the problem is that Washington did a lousy job of it. Washington also worked with Wilson on adapting the script to the film; he did a lousy job of that too. Based on this movie, Washington should stick to acting because here he is in sore need of direction as an actor, of a good script adapter, and of a good director who knows how to take a camera and turn a stage play into a MOVING picture.For the first 30 minutes, Washington does practically all the talking, non-stop, as if on a verbal treadmill. I began saying to myself, ""Will you shut up? Shut Up! SHUT UP!!!!"" In all honesty, I walked out after the first half-hour. I know how the story develops; I just refused to endure the torture of getting there."
FENCES,20 March 2017,2/10,"I have never seen a movie where all they did was complain! I got tired of hearing the ""n"" word being dropped. I watched about 20 minutes of the movie and I found the movie very annoying. Great actors and plot but I think Denzel's attitude ruined the movie. Maybe I should have had more patience and watched the entire movie but I found it to be dull, slow and draggy."
FENCES,10 August 2017,7/10,"FENCES (2016) MOVIE REVIEWFences movie is about a working-class African-American father, who tries to raise his family in the 1950s, while coming to terms with the events of his life.Fences look like a filmed play. Most of the action is happening in the backyard. Actually there is almost no action in the movie. Just a long dialogues. If you find some kind of yourself in any character, then the movie will make you think.An acting.. acting is amazingly good. This is what this movie famous about.Fences won't appeal to everyone. Those looking for action and extravaganza, this is not your movie. But if you are enjoy watching good actors perform a well-written script, then you'll be enthralled by every minute of Fences.Rating: 7/10"
FENCES,16 December 2017,10/10,"Sorry if you were expecting car crashes, multiple murders, and a CGI fest to cover up for a lack of storytelling. This movie had what all those types of movies lack. Superb acting, great script, and characters that you can identify with flaws and all"
FENCES,27 May 2017,1/10,"I did not realize this was a movie made from a play, but I was thinking the stage would have been a more suitable platform. Come to find out, it was. Yes, Viola Davis was great and deserves her Oscar. The rest of the movie is a long, crazy diatribe by Denzel Washington. Overall, poorly executed. I wish I had not purchased the movie."
FENCES,22 March 2020,8/10,"Denzel Washington and Viola Davis can only be a recipe for a good movie. That's what i said to myself when I saw the cast of Fences. And it was the last movie of 2017 best picture nominations which I haven't seen yet. So I had enough reasons to give it a try.
If there is one thing to be said about this movie is this: Viola Davis is superb. Her acting gives you chills. It is that good. Her oscar was really well deserved. I really can't put into words how good she is. The movie is basically plain dialog so you can understand that the whole cast did a great job.
But the most complex character is Denzel's Troy. He seems to love his wife very much and it seems they really have good relationship...untill you find out he is cheating on her. At first he looks like a really good father figure, working man, providing for his family. But suddenly he seemed to me just like someone with a big drinking problem, trying to project his life ambitions on his son in a very agressive way. Or more like he was trying to prevent his son to be more succesfull than him. Cory was a succesfull man in the end. But was it all worth it? At the end he just hated his father for all he did."
FENCES,16 June 2019,10/10,"If you like Denzel Washington after this film you'll love him . And the other actors will make you remember them .
Any bad review would be unfair or biased. This film will let you know what's really acting."
FENCES,19 March 2017,1/10,"I was very disappointed in this film. The hype was so positive, so when I tried to watch it, I couldn't. This is the most boring movie I have watched in years. In fact I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I was so sick of hearing Denzel talk and talk and talk. Good grief just shut up for a while. In my opinion, this movie was awful. I dint want to sit there and hear his endless talking another minute. Denzel has made much better films than this one. I cant see why everyone was talking about this was he best film yet. It was not to me."
FENCES,5 October 2021,10/10,"Few actors can be as convincing as Denzel Washington. He and Viola Davies makes for an exceptional powerhouse couple in this movie, and had me from the start to the finish line. Absolutely brilliant film. Well deserved Oscar for Viola too. The whole cast was brilliant. Loved it. One of my faves."
FENCES,10 March 2017,7/10,"This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a major blockbuster with Denzel being his incredible self and badass then you need to look elsewhere as that is not the point of this movie or his character. Rather, this is a move about life. If you appreciated the subtle greatness of Manchester by the Sea then you should find this to your liking as wellIncredible writing and directing makes it little wonder that this film received Oscar nominations. Not to mention the outstanding acting from both Denzel and Viola Davis. Their performances deliver such believable characters that make it easy to empathise with their choices and emotions."
FENCES,30 June 2018,10/10,"Fences, told a part of the american story, seldom shared with the public, no matter the color of subjects. I thought the way in which, the story was brought to life on the big screen, was nothing short of genius. The nature of the sensitive subject matter, is difficult all by itself. The ability to fit so much of the experience of the story into a movie, is a skill set I have only dreamt about. The amount amazing people that made this film remarkable, is astounding. I could not help but to feel connected to these characters. By the end of the movie I was shedding tears of joy, finding forgiveness, peace, and a new understanding in some of my own family's history, to be quite moving."
FENCES,9 June 2019,9/10,"Excellent film superbly acted by Washington and Davis, two of my favorite actors. The story of this family in the 50s in Pittsburgh touches my heart also, because I grew up in the 50s in the Pittsburgh area, too, so it was particularly poignant for me."
FENCES,8 August 2020,1/10,"Wasted 2 hours of my life...
Boringgggggg...
No sound effects .. nothing attracts you ..
No story...
Just scenes and events during a mean father which had a tough childhood.."
FENCES,8 January 2017,4/10,"I'm giving this a 4 for the acting only as they were strong performances and they created believable characters. The problem was the message. Sure, the main character had some charisma but he was also really unlikable, especially when it came to his personal relationships with his kids and wife. There was little warmth, rather a lot of depressing events that sure didn't make me feel good. Real respect is not born from fear or intimidation. His life long sour demeanor does not make for tender memories in death and does nothing to help turn around the tortured soul of the son, even though this is what they want you to feel. That is a disconnect between reality the film is trying to force upon the watcher. I almost walked out twice but just had to watch it through to the end. (deep sigh) Oh well, just glad he wasn't my dad."
FENCES,10 August 2019,1/10,I had to turn it off !! It was that boring.i don't recommend renting this movie
FENCES,28 December 2016,3/10,"Most of these reviews will say the same thing: Fences is a fabulous film due to amazing acting. However, acting alone does not make a film. Let's start with the story line. There is no real plot of this film that continuously builds. Every event seems to be unconnected except for the fact that the main character, Tony, is involved in each one. The film is also unbelievably boring. There is very little music in the film and very little change of scenery (about 2 hours of the 2 hour and 18 minute film takes place in or around the same house). The movie is in no way entertaining. For me personally, the most exciting part of this film didn't even come from Fences. Instead, it came from the neighboring theater (which was obviously showing Rogue One). The vibrations from exciting parts of a neighboring movie proved more entertaining than this film. Of course, filmmakers and fans of Fences can always blame the fact that the horrendous plot came from the adaption of the stage play, but if they really believed in the hard-nosed attitude portrayed by this film, they would realize that their movie was extremely disappointing."
FENCES,9 February 2017,7/10,"I think many need to remember that this is a play being adapted for the big screen ... so it's unlikely to be driven by action. Rather, Fences is driven by the excellent performances of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, and is also driven by the excellent adapted screenplay by playwright August Wilson. The further you watch the more invested you become. Troy Maxson was by far my favourite character ... despite the wrongs he committed, I always felt that I could see a little bit of myself in him, which thus made me extremely invested in the story. This isn't for anyone. If you aren't a fan of minimalism, or stripped back dialogue then you may find yourself bored. However, if you enjoy character driven stories then this will be right up your alley."
FENCES,15 March 2017,8/10,"Fences is a movie that shines so bright until the last 15 minutes. The dialogue and acting are probably the best you will see in a movie all year. Denzel is spectacular. You can see a bit of the stage acting come off in his performance but he survives it.Viola is masterful in her role. You feel her pain and forget she is an actress. Jovan Adepo does well in his role as her son though his emotional acting needs a little practice.Okay, acting aside...I'd say 85-90% of this movie takes place in one house or its backyard. Despite this the plot moves forward smoothly through our characters and never seems to lose focus. The trailer is good enough to not give away major plot points and Troy (Denzel Washington) comes off as a bit of a surprise considering how they build him up at first. Yes, he lives in the past and is not the most loving father but he is portrayed as an honest man who loves his wife and works hard.As the story unfolds this becomes less so when he reveals that he used his disabled brother's, who is a war veteran, money to buy the house they live in. To his credit, he feels much shame and guilt about this but it sure didn't stop him from screwing his brother over again later in the movie when he commits him.Then, quite abruptly, he tells his wife that he is having a child by another woman. She is shocked and appalled and he responds by telling her to basically get over it. It is a powerful scene in which both actors really shine.After this his relationship with her 17 year old son really deteriorates and this leads to a final confrontation between them both. Troy tells her son to leave after a short physical altercation and her son does in fact leave to go join the Marines.This is the moment the movie falls...and hard.Six years pass and the son returns to the home for Troy's funeral. Troy's daughter, out of wedlock, has been raised by Rose (Viola Davis)and is bounding around the house doing everything but getting dressed for the funeral. Cory (Adepo) arrives to meet his half-brother and Troy's best friend inside the house where they have a short conversation.Cory walks to the backyard and when his mother arrives he tells her he isn't going to the funeral. She responds quite negatively to this and they have a, far too long, conversation about Troy. I noticed Viola's quality in acting dropped slightly for the end of the movie as well which was disappointing considering how amazing she was up to this point. The little girl comes outside after Rose goes back into the house and she shares a, far too long, moment with her brother in which they sing a song that Troy taught them.Then it happens. The worst part of the movie. Troy's brother comes running down the alley by the house yelling, ""Rose, I'm here! I'm here!"" To this, everyone in the house runs outside to meet him in the backyard. He goes on about telling St. Peter to open the gates for Troy and then yells Troy's name toward the sky in a very ""KHAN!"" like moment. Then he raises a trumpet, which he carries the whole movie, and eventually gets one steady note to play toward the sky. With this, the freaking clouds part and the sun shines through. All the characters stare up at it in amazement and the movie suddenly has a very ridiculous feeling about it. This is an, ""Oh no, why did they do this?"" moment.This movie for me was a strong 9/10 up until the last 15 minutes or so. Then it dips to about a 5/10. The acting, writing, and technical shooting of the movie is brilliant up until the end and is so good the movie still gets an 8/10 despite such an amazingly horrible ending.Worth watching for sure but when Cory leaves the home just turn it off and imagine any kind of ending for this movie. It will be better than actually watching the ending."
FENCES,16 March 2017,8/10,"I gave 8 stars solely because of Viola, Denzel and Russell Hornsby. Denzel can command any stage as well as Viola. The story line, however is sorely lacking. Anyone over 50 has lived this life, regardless of skin color, it's offered nothing new. Mean alcoholic father, abusive husband, self entitled male in the 50s. An average life in that time frame."
FENCES,28 December 2016,9/10,"August Wilson's screenplay adaptation of his Broadway opus, Fences, has been masterfully directed and acted by Denzel Washington. It's the story of Troy Maxson, a blue collar worker for the Pittsburg Dept. of Refuse (a garbage collector).We meet him when he's 53 years-old. The year is 1957, and although it pre-dates the Civil Rights movement, Troy has taken the initiative to apply for a promotion that historically has gone to white men only. In short order, we discover how charming this man is. He's an amusing raconteur who talks in monologues. Amusing, that is, until we see how he interacts with his two sons: Lyons (Russell Hornsby), the older one from a previous relationship, and Cory (Jovan Adepo), his teenage son from his marriage to the long-suffering Rose, played by Viola Davis. Troy relishes tormenting his children, mocking Lyons in front of a family friend and berating Cory for changing the hours of his part-time work in order to attend football practices. As we watch Troy's behavior: bullying like a tyrant one minute, complimenting and flirting with Rose the next, it becomes obvious that this is not a one-dimensional man. Troy relates a harrowing tale of his last interaction with his father and a synopsis of the path he took when he left rural Alabama for the city. His was not an easy life, and it's obvious he resents his sons who have more choices and freedom.Fences, whether they're designed to keep people out or in, is also a metaphor for Troy's relationships with his family members. He won't let them in or out. At the very end, both his sons realize that despite their father's fences, Troy managed to inhabit them and those around him.This film stayed with me and made me reflect on the complexity of human beings, on the pain we inflict and joy we infuse and share with others during our brief time on earth. It is such a welcome relief from the formulaic movies that audiences are often fed.Before watching Fences, I was convinced Casey Affleck would win the Oscar for best actor. Now I think the award needs to go to Denzel. His portrayal made me think no other actor could have inhabited this role so completely, creating this larger-than-life personality in Troy Maxson. And Viola, oh Viola -- I bow in homage to your transcendence. You broke my heart. The character of Rose could have easily been subsumed by the power of Troy's personality, but not with Viola in the cast. I sincerely hope that Oscar voters recognize the intensity and professionalism of these two actors this February."
FENCES,19 March 2017,10/10,"It is rare for me to see a film in which I experience so many different emotions: Anger, sadness, disgust, Joy, etc. It is an absolute masterclass in why a film needs good actors. Denzel and Viola give two gut-wrenching performances that I can't help but forget I'm watching a film. Even supporting roles such as Russell Hornsby's performance is so subdued and real. In particular Mykelti Williamson's performance is exceptional to the point where I wanted to intervene in the film. In addition one simpler aspect of the film is that it is one where you'll be talking about it with your friend/s and just be quoting dialogue and scenes from the film. Please support this film, as well as other works of August Wilson's as films and screenplays like this gem are rare and should be embraced as such."
FENCES,29 January 2017,9/10,"This movie reminded me of those early 1960's movies with Marlon Brando like On the waterfront and Streetcar Named Desire. A movie about a workingman's life. I felt like I knew the characters from the people I was around years ago. A tale about the flaws in ourselves and in our families and overcoming the pain of life. Somehow today things aren't the same...maybe because life is easier and we have so much more to enjoy- TV, cell phones, computers and cars that we don't spend as much time getting to hate each other as much. To live day in and day out with each others sins and trying to forgive them was what families did. The thing is our fathers weren't the only ones to blame, we all have done things we are not proud of. That is how we learn to forgive and to remember all of us are better than the worse things we do."
FENCES,12 April 2017,,"The thunderous portrayal of Troy Maxson, by Mr. Denzel Washington sets the foundation of an authority figure who has been forged into manhood by much pain and much fear. His present achievements of having a good wife (played by Viola Davis),two sons, and a home-bought and payed for, are testaments of his strength ... A perfect formula for any man-or, so one would think,until his ways are confronted and examined by his youngest son, who has dreams of his own. Here, lies the fork, or should I say ""The Fence"" in the road!For a full review go to https://niume.com/pages/post/?postID=228242 or cootw.com"
FENCES,17 January 2017,7/10,"If I hadn't known what Fences was going in, I would have been able to tell before any color hit the screen. In a second before the vibrant world of Fences fades into view, the astute theater-goer will recognize the fast-paced almost narrative cadence of two characters talking as lines written for a stage play. Fences is an adaptation of August Wilson's 1987 play, a part of his Pittsburgh Cycle. It won the Pulitzer Price for Drama in as well as the Tony Award for Best Play, repeating this with the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play in 2010.We're not venturing into mere trivia either, as that revival starred Denzel Washington and Viola Davis (both taking Tonys for their acting). Not only do both reprise their roles in this film, but Denzel Washington directs. This probably explains why Washington puts in such a theater-like performance. For him, it must have felt like stepping into old shoes with very little desire for change. As I alluded, those accustomed with the stage will recognize and probably even like the kind of performance that at all times demands audience attention, as on stage, you have to do exactly that. In movie form, some might confuse it for scene-chewing, but either way, it gives his character a larger than life affability. As is said in the movie, his ability to fill a house could apply as much to his small house in universe as it could to a theater house. It goes a long way to explaining why in the end, these characters have such a strange respect for a man who is such a heinous character.If it seems like I'm only praising Washington's performance as relatively good, that might be because he shares the screen with Viola Davis. Davis's performance is not only more suited for film, a medium she has taken by storm lately, but it's also transcendentally fantastic in its own right. In one pivotal scene, Davis's character pours her heart as the actress pours tears and snot down her face. It's not many movies that I can leave and think, boy, we really should have more snot in our films. When it comes to movies, I like to think of myself as an everyman. I approach the Oscars with a sort of double-speak. There's the film that should win (Moana), and there's the film that should win and has a chance (Hell or High Water). In a rare moment of finding these opinions in concert, I could only describe the possibility of Viola Davis not taking home the Best Actress Award with one word: ridiculous.Denzel Washington certainly doesn't need to feel upstaged. While August Wilson wrote the screenplay himself before passing away in 2005 (a little uncredited work was done on it by Tony Kushner, who settled for a co-producer credit), it's still no small feat to take something designed for the small stage putting it on a film screen. A while the film is still more than a bit obvious, I think Washington really did as much as he could to make it as a good a movie as it could be. There are few real scenes and constant talk, but there's just as much constant motion. Characters walk down a crowded street, transition through the house, come in and off screen organically. It gives a similar effect as if a long scene was done in take. But none of this would matter if it weren't for the impeccable set design. Taking place in the actual Hill District of Pittsburgh that was so important to Wilson's stories, the recreation of the 1950s feels almost too alive. The back alley where the eponymous fence is being built is very reminiscent of the set of Rear Window, perhaps smaller in scale, but feeling no less lived in.Fences is a film built upon quite a pedigree, but what is it about? I believe that Fences is a story about masculinity. In the film, masculinity provides. It helps you ensure that get what you are owed. But masculinity also takes. Troy Maxson (Washington) is an old man obsessed with what he believes the world owes him. The world owed him glory in sports. The world owed him a better profession. A better standard of living. He even believes that the Grim Reaper owes him life. Even though there are legitimate arguments as to why he never obtains these things, we can still say that they are fair wishes. But as the movie progresses, we see that when he tries to take the things he's owed, he doesn't necessarily think about who he's taking from or what they are owed.Due to its strict adaptation, Fences is extremely dense in its amount of talking compared to other films. The depth this gives to its characters and sheer literature value certainly goes a long way to cement Fences as one of the smartest films of the season. But I have to be a little self-aware and recognize that as a source of entertainment, Fences probably appealed to me mostly as a man who enjoys the stage. Others might not be as indulgent with it as I am."
FENCES,24 January 2019,5/10,"Not sure what the point of the film was just some random guy living his life and I just watched him live it for 2 hours and 19 minutes of my life and I'm left wondering why did I just watch this - is Denzel Washington this charismatic that I just used up precious time in my one go around in life to watch a man just have random conversations about random situations he may or may not have experienced, and I'm left realising yes, when Denzel Washington acts I watch, damn you Denzel I just watched you on this trash worse than what you pick up in the film and it was riveting and boring all at the same time, damn you...sir."
FENCES,4 January 2019,1/10,"Boring and ... boring.
And too long... and
Boring.
Story is also pretty basic."
FENCES,26 March 2018,5/10,"This is the first review I have ever written on IMDB; and quite frankly I only felt the need to write it to express how poor this film is in general.There are some excellent pieces of acting that do need to be highlighted, Denzel Washington as always puts on a fantastic performance. Though with all the good of the performances there is no character progression (maybe that's the point to show the stagnation of the characters, but either way it wasn't entertaining). There is a lot of still scenes; one person talking to another. Again this may have been the idea to show the lack of progress the characters are making in life, and from a directors point of view if you were to analyse the film it would be quite interesting; but from an out and out entertainment point of view it made the film slow, boring and really ruined any chance of becoming engrossed in what you were watching."
FENCES,6 February 2017,8/10,"Fences undeniably features amazing acting, directing, and soundtrack, just to name a few aspects. The characters and dialogue are rich and engrossing, so where does the film falter? The film doesn't feel like a film.I like to have as little information as possible prior to seeing a film. I think avoiding trailers and buzz contributes to the experience, so going into Fences, I was unaware it was adapted from a play. Though the actors deliver the dialogue well, it becomes really apparent very early on in the film that this was adapted from a play. Director Denzel Washington uses every tactic he can to keep the audience's attention, tactics such as changing the camera angle, having the actors speak quickly, and incorporating blocking. However, for the beginning thirty minutes of the movie, the tactics did not prove to be effective because the conversations were so drawn out and continuously did not build to anything. In fact when the conversations did build–when a character said something that changed the mood–the scene became very intense and the film would suddenly grab me in. But for the most part, it just doesn't keep your attention despite trying really hard to.If, however, prior to seeing this film, you understand that the script was adapted from a play, the movie is really great, because once I overlooked this, I actually enjoyed Fences quite a bit. Every character is very interesting and are all portrayed excellently by a stellar cast.The only other flaw that stuck out to me was the actor who played the brother of Denzel Washington's character. The brother suffers from injury that I don't want to get into because of spoilers, but he basically suffers from dementia, which is a very difficult topic for some, but the actor exaggerated the illness so much it felt disrespectful. I don't believe that was his intent at all, but his portrayal made the character seem comical, despite his condition being so sad.Overall, I think Fences is a competent film. I think when Denzel Washington gets a chance to direct, he continues to surprise. I think it deserves its Oscar nominations, and I'm going to give it an 8 out 10."
FENCES,19 February 2017,9/10,"It is not very common to see Denzel Washington moving behind the camera. When he does so, it is often to deal with intense characters and stories though. As in Antwone Fisher for instance, we meet the character of Troy Maxson, an African-American, working as a waste collector with his best friend Bono. He and his wife Rose are living in a little house with their son Cory. They also have occasionally to take care of Troy's brother mentally ill. All in all, we're just watching a story about life.All along this movie, we will see how Troy tries to raise his children with authority despite of the events. Let's tell it right now, Denzel Washington fits perfectly with its tough, violent character. The education received from his father strongly impacted his way of life. The more the movie moves forward the more we feel compassion for Troy. With regard to his wife Rose, once again the Viola Davis performance is amazing. This is when her peaceful housewife way of life will be upset that the depth of the character is revealed. And Viola Davis is remarkably precise in it.Even though this movie is not strictly speaking a ""movie about racism"", we can feel it during all the movie. Troy can't stop considering the ""fences"" between white and coloured people. These fences will be the thread of the movie and the root of all Troy's decisions. Concerning the other characters they are all contributing to this disturbed atmosphere weighing in on Maxon's family. Among them we can mention the mentally-ill brother Gabriel, probably the most endearing character. Besides, Jovan Adepo also delivers a very notable performance as Cory.As a conclusion, I think that Denzel Washington directed one of his best movies, if not the best. It offers to Viola Davis and to himself, deep characters that allow them to reveal all their potential. Probably one of the best movies of 2016."
FENCES,28 July 2018,8/10,"Thanks to denzel washington , sambolic father , tipical hero like around the world"
FENCES,19 February 2017,10/10,"This movie illustrates in perfect shapes the difficulties in our lives and shows us that nothing ever changes. Problems are a part of every's life. Personally, I think this movie's full of semantics, fences that are literally fences around your house, fences that are raised to keep the loved inside, together and the bad ones outside from our lives, fences to keep us safe from ourselves, fences built against the black people and many others. You get touched by this movies in every way possible: cruel reality, love, family care, issues that we all encounter during our lives, things that basically are our shadows. Ty for doing this masterpiece!"
FENCES,6 March 2017,3/10,"This move was about 2 hours 2 long. A fantastic cast wasted on a boring movie. The whole thing is one long drawn our rambling conversation of an old, selfish, self-centered man who hates the world. Troy has no redeeming qualities besides his work ethic. He fails as a husband, a man, and a father. Rose just plays the typical 50's dutiful house wife with very little backbone and allows Troy to walk all over her like most women on screen in the time period. This movie brought nothing new to light and had little depth. A house, a yard and a long conversation. If you see the trailer you have seen the movie."
FENCES,26 February 2017,9/10,"I was really moved by this movie, which is difficult when you see a lot, excellent work from Denzel Washington. As an actor he got everything from this role than anyone could ask, and as a director he passed the story through his eyes in a beautiful way.I was amazed. Simple as that. Emotions flow right through you and you become one with the story. Great job from all the actors! Don't loose time and watch the movie!!"
FENCES,26 March 2017,3/10,"This film was nominated for 4 Oscars (winning 1 for Viola Davis' performance), so this sparked off my curiosity and made me all the more interested in the film. The Oscars are a big deal to me and I'm a huge film buff so naturally I had to watch it. I watched the film with high expectations, and all I got in return was a huge frown, from a boring film. Let me start with the positives (although there are few), the acting in this film is remarkable, Denzel Washington was fantastic and this film could be the best performance of his career. The same can be said for Viola Davis, she delivers a fantastic performance that is both heartbreaking and responsive. But for me personally, this is where the magic disappeared.The negative side of this film was everything else, the film had very little story and what little story it did have, it simply didn't grab me with much interest. And although the film is called 'Fences' there is very little mention of Troy (Denzel Washington's character) building the fence he says he's going to build, and when he is building his fence, he is berating his son Cory.That is all I have to say about 'Fences'. In summary, it is a film that had so much promise, but only delivered a boring film about an abusive father who is trying to raise his family."
FENCES,4 September 2017,5/10,"Sat through two hours and nineteen minutes of ""Fences"" tonight. Such a shame it took over an hour of celluloid running before the movie even started. We were so close to turning this off, and then there was the scene where Troy (Denzel Washington) revealed to Rose (Viola Davis) that he was about to become a father to another woman. That was 70 minutes in. And that was the precise moment this movie really began. Up until that moment we found this pointless and hard going. We understand that they wanted to show the character of these people. But that could have been done in 20 minutes. For far too long we sat through a self-indulgent working-class whinge-fest that went nowhere. At an hour in, we were just about to turn this off as we didn't care about any of the characters and whether they lived, died, or simply disappeared. And then we had real character drama. We had real conflict. We had purpose and direction as to where this was going. And this is where the characters became real, and the acting shone. Shame it took an hour to get to this point. Viola Davis truly deserved her Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. A powerhouse performance by her. But prior to this was just a bunch of people miserable about their lives. I expect the reason this falls down as a movie is that it is taken straight from the stage and filmed with only two sets . . . the kitchen and the backyard. There was no real adaptation for the screen, and this let the movie down. It was a stage-bound production that didn't fly as I was expecting it to. It may have been a great play on the stage, but a bit of a flop as a movie. And it doesn't have to be like this. Some great plays have been transformed into excellent movies. A prime example is ""'night, mother"" with Sissie Spacek and Anne Bancroft. This two-hander play is also filmed essentially with a single set comprising kitchen and lounge-room. But WOW! the filmed version never disappoints. I guess it depends on the material, the actors, and great direction. But somehow, it didn't translate for ""Fences"". We were sorely left wanting. Denzel's character had no growth or development. He remained the most self-centred, indulgent, and egocentric character I think I have seen for a long time. And that made it very hard to like him at all. The other characters seemed to soften and develop understanding and compassion to a degree, but not him. I was actually glad when he died and the others could have a life and gain some respite from his selfish tirades. And the realistic dialogue did not help . . . very fast speech and with extremely heavy period accents and intonation. . . along with lots of shouting. This made large chunks of this dialogue-driven film worthless. Large pieces of monologue were lost to unintelligible speech; but in the end, most of this was ranting by Troy about his lot in life, so likely we didn't miss that much. This film could have been vastly improved by trimming 50 or 60 minutes from the beginning. Have just a little discontent character background to begin with, but then launch into the drama of the illegitimate child and the impact of this upon the family. That would have made this far more palatable and tolerable. With trimming I might elevate this to a 7.5 from 10. But as it stands, at 139 minutes (but feels like 300), I give it 5 out of 10."

I knew just by looking at the cast that this was going to be a new classic.Troy's (played by Denzel Washington) larger than life personality will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. The film is truly heart-warming and very appropriate for the entire family. Full of morals, lessons, and life's hidden nuggets of gold, #FencesMovie will tug at your heart and make you appreciate your own family: the good, the bad, and the ugly.After all, our family, or lack thereof, is what helps us build character!LaDana Drigo"
FENCES,14 January 2017,1/10,"Thank you for reading my first ever IMDb movie review, a result of having wasted my hard-earned money and time on this ""movie"" which is really just a badly acted play put to film. The play on film format is not new or original as a story vehicle, and is used here with the apparent intention of conveying the raw emotion and the harsh lives of the characters. I was willing to go with that but in the end, the acting was so over the top, the characters so ridiculously dark and lacking in any redeeming qualities, I simply couldn't find my way to appreciating the story or the format on any level.My conclusion? Fences is nothing more than a self-indulgent demonstration of actors seeing Oscars dancing before their eyes. Want to see a great film on play? Rent Death of a Salesman, a true classic that did it right. Where Salesman succeeded, Fences fails on every level."
FENCES,30 January 2017,9/10,"Being a film adaptation of a stage play, going into Fences with an air of caution was going to be likely for most audiences. After all, we have seen countless hit and miss attempts to bring plays to the big screen in the past and the fear was that this outing could follow a similar path. As it turns out the opposite is true, and the stripped back nature of Fences lends perfectly to the two powerhouse performances of Washington and Davis. The very first act sets the tone for the rest of the film. Carried almost single-handedly for the first half an hour by Washington's Troy, a Pittsburgh trash collector living with the demons of his past and still dealing with the effects of 50's racism in America, the emission of flash cinematography lends perfectly to the movie's set up. We hear Troy spewing story after story, each one further exaggerated than the last, with his friend and wife in toe in his back yard. But this isn't storytelling as we're used to on the big screen; Troy's melodic, almost jazz like rifts ebb and flow much like his own life, travelling in every conceivable direction before arriving at it's end destination. It's this exceptional use of dialogue that separates fences from other failed stage play adaptations, leaving audiences hanging on every word that leaves Troy's mouth.But Washington isn't alone in his outstanding performance and is more than adequately backed up by Davis who plays Troy's loyal and loving wife Rose who sits back quietly on the sidelines until midway through the second act where her performance really kicks in. If ever there was a line to sum up a performance then it's Roses ""What about my life? What about me?""; a line delivered with the kind of emotion and conviction that most actors will fail to achieve in their entire careers. A heart- wrenching and brutally honest assessment of her own life and ambitions spews from Rose's tongue in what is surely the film's most powerful moment.It this kind of raw, emotive passion that makes Fences the success that it is. Sure, some will complain about the lack of cinematography or the way that Fences closely mirrors a stage production and feels that exactly that way; but that is precisely what makes the film the success that it is. A no frills, stripped down, back-to-basics set which puts the spotlight directly on the two leads and the film's two biggest assets. Two powerhouse performances from two of the industries titans."
FENCES,1 March 2017,10/10,I have never saw this movie but it seems to be a great movie. This movie is on my watchlist because it's a deep story. The father is very hard on his son because he wants everything to be right and just fine for him. The whole time the father is doing that he doesn't realize that he's putting a heavy weight on him and his wife. That soon causes relationship problems between them.
FENCES,17 February 2017,6/10,"The acting in this film is outstanding. Denzel and Viola are truly at their best and the consistency with which they convey the depth of emotion required of them in this film is outstanding. To me, this was the best part about the film. It was a little difficult to sit through this one, mostly because it is a movie in which not much happens. Don't mistake this as a comment from someone who loves action-packed movies (although I do sometimes), but rather it plods along and neither has very high highs or very low lows. As such, I drifted in and out of the story and was still able to keep up. It is important story to tell, but I can see how it was potentially better as a play. It is definitely worth seeing, if nothing else for the superb acting."
FENCES,22 May 2017,1/10,"While I love Denzel's acting in other movies, this movie made him seem like a brand new actor looking for any role he can get his hands on. Viola is one of my most hated actresses to begin with, but I did not consider that bias in my opinion of the movie. Williamson (who played Gabriel) was the best actor of them all, giving a heartwarming, bittersweet image to his character. The other actors were mediocre.The plot of the movie was... well, nonexistent, at least for the majority of the film. Due to torturous boredom, I could not withstand the entire film and had to turn it off about 80% through it. Later, I read about the rest of the plot and, to no surprise, found out that it takes an eternity for a little action to occur. Most of the movie is Denzel as some garbageman yammering on in some slang-infested monologue. I'd say about 50% of the movie is his analogies, exaggerated stories and delusions that make absolutely no sense and contribute nothing to the movie. The screenplay seems untouched from the play which makes the movie unbearable. I was, in essence, watching nonstop metaphors in an unintelligible Ebonics dialect. I am not exaggerating when I say that I could not understand a good chunk of what Denzel was saying.To finish this off, I warn potential viewers to not appeal to authority, because that is a logical fallacy. When just under 6,000 white, older male elites determine what is worthy of an Academy Award (probably based on how much they've been bribed), it is not an inherent indicator that the movies they've chosen are actually good. Beware of the Academy and their attempts to make you watch horrible movies."
FENCES,14 November 2017,10/10,"Fences, the late August Wilson play adaptation, is a movie with universal messages about life, love, family, parenting and black identity. It shows the hardship of life in a common Africanamerican family set in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and the margins of society. It carries a universal message about a disappointed father, who wants to protect his teenage son of life disappointments. Haunted by his inner demons, Troy Maxon fails to show real love, instead we see his harsh personality towards his son and his wife. Too many disappointments in the past have led him to shut off his emotions towards his family but still remaining human and adopting his extramarital child. The movie depicts a society put on the social margins, fighting everyday issues and marital problems but giving us a ray of hope about complex family relations and a young generation respecting their parents. The masterful performance of Denzel Washington and Academy awarded Viola Davis brought this universal play to the screen, giving the viewers a real movie gem and a show calling for their emotional responses and a deeper introspective in their own personal relationships."
FENCES,15 May 2018,10/10,Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are truly great actors. They draw you in immediately to the story. Mykelti Williamson too. Great play with the best acting around! Enjoy this film. They are far and few between.
FENCES,20 May 2019,8/10,"The movie was good. It had a couple of boring parts but nothing i couldn't get past. The end was actually shocking seeing as how we all thought his brother was a little crazy. Turns out he might not be as crazy as we thought. I understood why his son felt the need to stand up to him. Troy made it seem like he didn't want his son to succeed because he himself could not do it.What Troy didnt want to understand was the fact that his son had a better chance at playing football than he did playing baseball. Times were different for his son and he was young and healthy. Troy tried to play baseball at an older age which is a reason why he failed other than racism.It seemed like Troy was depressed. Always going to work, not much time to relax because everyone needed him to make the money. Understandable why he was upset. Repeating the same cycle of unhappiness not seeing that times have changed and he could possibly do better. I feel as if Rose made her own earnings their marraige wouldn't have made it but that wasn't the case, thus keeping her stuck to take care of his child while he continue to work. They both made sacrafices to keep their home.It's not suprising that he died when realizing the many parts where he talks about facing death and how he stays ready. If it wasnt for the mother of his child's death i probably wouldn't have felt that bad for him seeing as he was a cheater anyway. When i wonder why Rose stayed it's either because she had no place else to go, or she truly loved him despite saying he's womanless.The lights that shown through the clouds as his brother blew the trumpet was amazing. It was as if he really opened the gate. My face was as shocked as theirs. Great movie."
FENCES,12 March 2017,8/10,"Some may have an issue with the fact that this is more a play, than film. But the same could be said of '12 angry men', 'one flew over the cuckoos nest', or 'to kill a mockingbird'. A classic Gregory peckesque performance by denzel washington. An outrage he didn't win the Oscar. A film that is all about the acting. Superb"
FENCES,9 December 2019,8/10,"Pairing up Denzel Washington and Viola Davis was an exceptional idea. Their chemistry on screen was unmatched. Washington directs as well as stars, in the adaption of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The story unfolds in 1950s Pittsburgh, where Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) a garbage collector lives in a world filled with discrimination and where society places high expectations on him as a father and husband. He was once a gifted athlete, but Troy's life took a dramatic turn and his hopes for playing in the Negro League were gone. His brutal childhood that seemingly affects his sons Lyons and Cory (Jovan Adepo and Russel Hornsby) and wife, Rose (Viola Davis), shows viewers how the ""sins of our fathers"" have imprinted themselves upon Troy.
Fences is not only story-driven but dialogue-driven as well. As an adaptation, this film was very true to the text. The script was almost an exact replica of the screenplay. Though the action did not literally stay in one spot, the film's settings are evident in the way that almost everything takes place in one house, which is similar to the play.
Viola Davis as Rose was absolutely remarkable but I wish she was given more lines. I did not notice the excessive amount lines Troy had until I Washington acting. You would have not noticed that Rose was the only woman in the film. Her portrayal of Rose was so spot on, I don't think anyone could have played Rose, as well as Davis, did. One of my favorite scenes was when she told Troy ""I took all my feelings, my wants, and needs, my dreams ... buried them inside you."" From this scene, I understand why she got an Oscar award for her supporting role, because of her beautiful execution of Rose.
Let's also talk about Bono, Troy's best friend and his iconic line ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in."" Stephen Mckinley Henderson was not who I expected to play Bono. I imagined Bono, as someone was more aggression. However, after watching the film again, I noticed that having a character with similar traits as Troy would have been too overbearing. Bono in the book was depicted similarly to Bono (Henderson) in the film. He was a man of wisdom and Henderson, character was a perfect match.
Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), Troy's injured war veteran brother provided both a comedic and serious tone in the film. Gabe, childlike speech gave a break from the heavy conservations, but it also showed how the impact war has on a person physically and emotionally. However, the ending with Gabe was quite disappointing. It was not the scene I had in my mind or in the book.
When we compare ""Fences"" to Washington's earlier work, we saw more originality and creativity. I honestly wish that Washington strayed away from the text and added more depth to the film. Even though it was fun reading along the lines, at some point during the film I became uninterested with the dialogue.
""Fences"" overall is worth the watch. It dives into the topic of the ""sins of our fathers"" affecting the lives of their children and their link with future generations. This film shows the viewers the importance of having a loving parent and the impact a dysfunction home has on children. Fences, definitely deserve a 4/5.M.F. P.D 3"
FENCES,5 December 2019,8/10,"Fences, based on a playwright by August Wilson released in 1985, follows the life of Troy Maxson as he lives in a world that he seems to have major anger towards and we get to see just how drastically this affects his relationship with his wife and kids
Lyons (Russell Hornsby) and Cory ( Jovan Adepo). It's rare that a movie keeps the authenticity of the book it's written by but Fences does just that. It follows the script and changes nothing that alters the true meaning of the story. Rather it adds more character and emotion keeping the viewer at the edge of their seat. It adds the heartbreaking scene between Troy and Gabe at the mental hospital, the amazing performance by Mykelti Williamson that makes Gabe seem more ill than he is in the book, and the simple fact that the movie adds rain when Troy finds out Alberta died. Things like that adds soul to the movie.
The heart wrenching performance by Viola Davis as Rose makes you want to cry with her. When she states ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom!"" the pain and shame is so powerfully seen. No one does a crying scene quite like her. She plays her character through and through from her weakened moments to her strengths the moment where she states "" From right now, this child's got a mother but you're a womanless man"". You can truly see the moment where enough is enough from Troy. While reading the book it hurts to find out how Troy continually cheats on Rose, but the performance Viola Davis puts on makes you want to crawl into the screen to hug her. To give credit where it's due Denzel Washington does not disappoint. He does the complex character that is Troy justice. Whether it's his undeniable anger, selfishness, Denzel portrays him accurately. It's interesting to see how Denzel can for mere moments make you even feel bad for Troy. But he never fails to bring you right back with his never ending dialogue and captivating anger rants. Denzel as a director never distracts from the true storyline only putting music where it's appropriate and panning shots to see every emotion in each actor's faces. Despite all of this the ending for me was a bit anticlimactic as it was in the book from me. I feel like they could have showed Rose stepping up being a strong woman maybe appreciating Troy for the years he gave her but not completely forgiving him the same goes for Cory they could have showed more of the man he became.
But the story in this movie is timeless we all like Troy struggle to find our place in the world and when we are confronted with the truth on we often look to blame anyone but ourselves. Like Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) states in the movie ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in"" I think we all can relate to that on some level. We all have a natural instinct especially in today's world to protect the ones we love , to keep the bad things out, something Troy definitely struggles with the entire movie and play. I think they both show that we all have the same struggles but it's just up to us on how we deal with it. Although the movie may not rely on heavy animation, moving music, or dramatic effects like today's hits of Frozen, Avengers, Deadpool etc. I think it ends up working in the movie's favor as it shows real and raw acting.In the end, the movie brings the book alive in such a way that it pulls on your heart strings constantly. We see the the raw tears,anger,guilt and shame that the books puts through. That's why the fences is worth the watch it's gives you that and more.M.F.

FENCES,5 December 2019,6/10,"!!SPOILER ALERT!!I think that this movie was phenomenal. Full with emotions amazing acting with great choices in actors such as Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, Viola Davis as Rose Maxson, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Jim Bono, and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel really helped bring the performance together. If you have read and loved the book by August Wilson then you will not be disappointed. Viola Davis' performance really brought her character Rose to life. There is always a difference in reading a play and watching the movie because it's common to assume a situation different from someone else. Denzel as the director and actor did an incredible job taking what he did on a small stage in front of an audience and applying it to the screen. While performing on stage you can't have the scenery changes so seeing multiple different location in the movie versus the play was perfect. In the play everything takes place on a porch versus in the movie you see the porch, the inside of the house, the commissioner's office, and Taylor's.
I know that when I watched the scene when Troy (Denzel) told Rose (Viola) that he was going to be a father to another woman's child it gave me a whole new understanding of her pain. I feel you can never truly have a real understanding until you see it for yourself. Pain and suffering is difficult to portray in a book but on screen it's much easier. When Rose said ""My whole family is half...It's your papa and your mama..."" Viola Davis' performance of betrayal was stunning.
This movie and book even though it was written in the 1980s and is based on the 1950s time period still applies to today. It talks about the struggles of family and being an African American in society and the workplace. Even though Troy was a bit ahead of his time it doesn't mean he shouldn't still try. The unfortunate fact though is that even after the civil rights movement and in today's time there is still a sort of segregation in some work forces. Not necessarily by race but even by gender. While watching this movie you have to process every little thing that is happening. I took what is happening in the movie and applied to my life which allowed me to feel more in sync with the movie as if I was apart of it.
The one thing that disappointed me about the movie was that it had line by line what was already in the play. Even though there was a difference in scenery between the play and movie. However, if there was a change in the script the movie may not have been as predictable. It may have been more interesting.Pd.3 C.H."
FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"Fences is an exceptional film that begs the question: What happens when a person fails to learn from the past and appreciate what they have in the present? It is one of the rare adaptations that succeeds in telling a profound story without changing the source material too much. This, juxtaposed with the spectacular acting of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, make Fences a very enjoyable film.
In Fences, the main character Troy (Washington) is a working-class African-American who tries to raise his family while also coming to terms with his life. Originally, I was skeptical of Denzel Washington playing a character like Troy who is supposed to be a big, hardened man who believes that ""Life don't owe you nothing. You owe it to yourself..."" but as the film went on, Washington was able to perfectly capture the embittered but responsible nature of Troy. Viola Davis is arguably the best part of this film. Though she was considered a Supporting Actress, she, in my opinion, is the heart and soul of the movie. She is able to masterfully capture the pain and grief her character Rose faces as a result of her husband's actions. One of her heaviest lines, ""I took all my feelings, my wants, and needs, my dreams ... buried them inside you."" perfectly captures the grief and pain Rose has experienced and will surely have you invested emotionally.
I must also commend the fact that Denzel Washington is not only the lead actor but also the director. His execution of the original screenplay by August Wilson was great. He barely took out anything from the original play and the things he did add on such as the montage of the aftermath of Troy's revelation adds more depth to the story and the characters. I can also appreciate the added sets Mr. Washington adds such as the indoor of the house, Troy's workplace, and the bar as opposed to just the yard in the play.
One of the best aspects of the film is its relatability. We have those questions about how to deal with our parents' wishes and our own dreams and when to listen to them or follow ourselves. The film teaches the lesson that ""You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child..."" and that we will not always stay in the shadow of our parents.
Another great aspect of the film is the dialogue. As mentioned before, the movie stays very true to the original screenplay and it is amazing. Troy's dialogues convey his tendency to tell tall tales while also fleshing out his character and worldview even more such as when he talks about how all he could offer to the world was his work. Rose's dialogues are even greater and work to show her motivations for staying with Troy and keeping her family together. The way in which Rose (Davis) and Troy (Washington) interact with each other shows a couple who have created a deep love and care for each other but also a sense of fatigue and yearning for more on Troy's part while Rose tries to keep him from straying. Troy's treatment of his son Cory (Jovan Adepo) shows Troy's embittered self and desire to protect his son from failure but also his own ego by refusing to listen to any other points than his own.
Although this movie is a wonderful film adaptation that stays true to the original material and is further strengthened by the magnificent acting of the cast. However, my one criticism of this movie is that it is not that exciting. Some parts of the film were quite boring, especially in the first few minutes of the film. I could barely stand listening to Troy constantly chatter about death and how great he was. I had not even heard of this film until I was introduced to it by a teacher and after I read the play in class. This movie is not one of the blockbusters you would commonly see these days like the MCU films or the Disney animated films. Instead, it flies under the radar and is quiet. Not much time or money is put too much into advertising like the blockbusters and that is fine. Fences is a hidden diamond amongst all the blockbusters we see today.
I consider Fences to be relevant film today. Its message and story are not completely out of touch with people today. The representation is always a plus with the mainly black cast. Even the story itself of familial issues and dealing with our elders who sometimes are so hardened and refuse to accept change or the fact that there are younger generations who could be better than them. Fences tells all of these stories.
Overall, Fences is a very good film. It is by no means that action-packed blockbuster most of us are accustomed to these days nor is it the most exciting, but if you take your time to watch, you will have spent your time very well. It is an interesting family drama brought to life by great acting from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. It is one of those hidden gems that you won't be disappointed with once you encounter it.-JHPD6"
FENCES,6 December 2019,6/10,"Fences is a film about a man named Troy (Denzel Washington) who carries the burden of hardships he faced when he was younger. In trying to isolate himself from the world, he also closes in his loved ones creating an environment where no one can handle him. This film does an amazing job depicting the overall purpose of the book. I'd give this film a solid 6 out of 10 stars.
From all the book based movies I've watched, this particular film stays the most truthful to the book. There were no added scenes that we didn't read in the book nor were there any missing parts. Fences does an amazing job depicting the universal message of life, love, family, and parenting. We really get to see the family reacting to Troy's negative mind and how much his decisions and actions affect the family.
In this film, you get to see two amazing actors come together to create such an outstanding performance. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis made sure to convey the emotion needed for this film. When watching the movie, it all felt real. You could not tell the difference between acting and the actual feeling of dealing with the hardships that family members can bring home. Not only did Denzel Washington play Troy but he was also the director of the film. We really get to see what he is capable of doing behind the scenes and in acting.
Although the film is primarily based on the book there are some primary differences. For example, in the book we never read about Gabe being in the hospital and Troy trying to feed him. The film does an extraordinary job in depicting how much Gabe had changed since we last saw him in the scene. We also get to see how much it affects Troy seeing his brother in the state of mind he is. Another primary difference is the way the actors react when they find out about a certain situation. For example, Troy reacting to Alberta's death, Rose reacting to finding out Troy is going to be a father and the fights between Troy and Cory.
Even though this film was pretty good, there are some things that could have been better There were some things that I was expecting to be in the film that were briefly mentioned in the book. For example, I was expecting to see Alberta or at least the scene of her being in the hospital giving birth. The ending could have also been better. I felt like it ended too casually. It wasn't like a ""oh wow"" I can rewatch this again.K.F Pd.6"
FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"""I done learned my mistake and learned to do what's right by it. You still trying to get something for nothing. Life don't owe you nothing. You owe it to yourself."" - Troy MaxsonFences may be one of the only films that does its book counterpart justice. The two may even go hand and hand. Directed and starring Denzel Washington, as Troy Maxson. Fences is an adaptation of Tony Wilson's play of the same name. Taking place in the late 1950's and early 1960's, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the story follows Troy and his dealings with the hardships of his past, and it is reflected through his stern and emotionless parenting of his son Cory (Jovan Adepo) and his pessimistic and dated view of the world.""I done give you everything I got. Don't tell that lie of me."" Denzel truly gave the audience everything he had, as he delivers one of his best performances yet with his rendition of Troy Maxson. The facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses in dialogue. He performs the role as if he himself lived the life that Troy describes in pieces throughout the play. Dealings of the turmoil and trauma of Troy's adolescence combined with the crippling circumstances of his young adult life; Denzel seems to almost blur the line between himself and the role of Troy Maxson.""Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no way of explaining that."" There is so much great acting in the film that it's almost overwhelming, and it wasn't just from Denzel. Viola Davis (Rose Maxson), is not a supporting character in the film and she wanted that to be known. She delivers a spine-chilling performance. It was as if every argument was directed at you. As if there was no screen, almost every word felt as if it were in person. The amount of dedication shared between Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, to these two characters is truly awe inspiring.The film had a lot of upside and there were some things that happened slightly different in the play. Spoiler alert: such as Bono meeting Troy at Taylor's instead of Troy's front step, as what would be their last conversation before Troy died. As well as the depiction of Troy following Gabe (Mykelti Williamson) around the cemetery. Also, when Rose asks Troy if he is coming home tonight, she goes to his job to ask him, while in the play she asked him once he got home. All the differences are all just slight changes of location, which have no real effect on the overall plot and acting. I just believed them to be interesting alterations. I only really have two criticisms of the film, which are that one they didn't display any of Troy's infidelity with Alberta. There wasn't any depictions of Troy's childhood memories that he relies on in a conversation with Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and Lyons (Russell Hornsby). These moments not being made was kind of a letdown because they could have added more climactic scenes that were missing from the story.The film and play carry a significant amount of importance as it alludes to the importance of not bearing the weight of your parent's decisions and choices and letting it affect your own life and choices. It shows its audiences that they do not have to follow the same path as those before them. This is important and relevant today, where more kids are following their own dreams regardless of what is said to them by their parents. That they can create their own paths and not be bound to the lives that their parents lived. Or let the actions of their parents decide their own actions.

FENCES,5 December 2019,4/10,"The Movie Fences stars many great actors including, Denzel Washington(Troy Maxson), Viola Davis(Rose Maxson), and Jordan Adepo(Cory Maxson). It was thrilling to see how much these characters develop. However, this movie was made for people that have read the play.
Movies staying true to the text is very hard to come by. Directors have to make changes to the original text so that the film makes sense Although is realistic. Although minor, the setting has had a huge impact on the movie. The play is limited the Maxson's back yard. The director, Denzel Washington, uses scenes such as inside their house, the neighborhood, and Troy's job. If you have read the play you would notice the changes and how it makes the movie more natural, but if you haven't read the play you wouldn't think twice about the setting. The endings of the first act and the movie are also different than the original play. At the end of the first act in the play, Troy tells Cory that he has a strike, but in the movie, Troy has a moment where he instructs Cory to put his helmet back on and realize that he had a strike and that he ""shouldn't strike out"". Many scenes are symbolic because of Troy's past and character. He is determined to stop Cory from pursuing sports because he wasn't able to be successful. At the end of the movie, the family gathers around Gabe. Because of his war injury, the family supports Gabe's efforts to ""warn St.Peter to open the gates"" for Troy. The major difference in that scene from the movie and the play is that we see the clouds part and show a bright ray of sunshine that shocks the family into believing that Troy made it into heaven.
Denzel Washington was able to keep the movie true to the text, but this also has many drawbacks. You should only watch the movie if you read the play beforehand. It is very easy to not understand what is going on. The play relies heavily on symbolism to evoke meaning. Troy's character was portrayed well in the movie, but his past had a great deal in his habits. Unless the audience was playing close attention to all of the details, they wouldn't remember those crucial moments that validate Troy's actions. The symbolic aspects of the play would be harder to detect if you didn't read the play first. When Troy tells Cory to not strike out, or when Troy is yelling out to death, It would be hard for the audience to understand that what he really means is for death to leave his family alone.
The overall message of the film and play is the importance of family. We see Rose's perspective on Troy fathering child from another women, Troy's opinion of Cory's aspirations to pursue sports, and Lyons financial instability. The movie's significance is to show us that we shouldn't take what we have for granted. Instead of holding grudges, we should embrace the differences between our family members.
It is expected that movie wouldn't make much in box office profits because most people didn't understand the plot. The film Fences can't be compared to other popular movies. It's an adaptation of a poem, not an action packed superhero film. Although it was great to see some great actors redefine a poem, the movie should have an unbiased director, and much needed work. Better luck next time.

FENCES,9 December 2019,8/10,"""Fences"" is a movie adaptation of a play. Denzel Washington directs a performance driven film while also having to play Troy Maxson, a father of a family with many tribulations. Viola Davis (Rose Maxson) plays alongside Denzel as his wife. Every Friday, which is payday, we see Troy Maxson in his backyard with his two best friends, Bono (Stephen Henderson) and a bottle of gin. Rose will accompany them at times to hear Troy talk everyone's ear off and Lyons (Russel Hornsby) would be there at times as well to collect some of Troy's paycheck. Through the talks in the yard we see how perverted and even miserable Troy is at times. He steers his long winded conversations from what he will do to Rose to how he has ""wrestled with death"". Every routine payday chat brings Troy closer to his actual wrestle with death.
Troy's toxic combination of masculinity, ego, and pain is his undoing as a father and a husband. He subconsciously pushes the pain he felt as a child from his father to his children. Troy will constantly refuse to let Lyons borrow money and the only thing that would change his mind is Rose. At one point in the play his other son Corey (Jovan Adepo) asks him Troy if he likes him. Troy answers with questions such as: ""You got clothes on your back?"", ""You eat everyday?"", ""You got a roof over your head?"". Troy tells Corey that he doesn't have to like him because he has everything he needs. This creates resentment from Corey and is a start to future altercations between him and his father. His undoing as a husband isn't seen until the end of the movie where Viola Davis performs a truly heartfelt scene. Nobody cries on-screen like Viola Davis. The pain from the text in the play is mirrored so well on the screen, I got chills. Speaking of amazing acting, Mykelti Williamson who plays Gabriel should not be overlooked. Gabriel is a disabled war verteran which is not an easy character to play but Mykelti does it perfectly. Mykelti humanizes Gabriel and bring his delusions to life without any form of mockery.
'Fences' is one of the few plays brought to the big screen that wasn't warped because it became too cinematic. Some of the setting and lines were changed for purposes of the movie but the movie is very 'stagey', in a good way. This movie gets a higher rank from me than its 7/10 from IMBD, I would give this movie an 8/10. It would've received a higher rank if Denzel hadn't changed some scenes such as the ending. In the play before Troy's funeral, Gabriel was dancing to the sky after telling God to open his doors for Troy. Gabriel didn't dance in the movie but only showed his gratitude after his horn finally made sound after several attempts. Another fault of the movie also falls into a character category but this the fault is with Lyons. I feel like as if his character in the movie isn't portrayed as importantly as it is in the book. In the book we get the misunderstanding of Troy and his sons as well as their resentment for him but in the movie Lyons in a way is just there, he's just a character without much importance. Aside from the few disliked details, this movie is no epic story such as many other box office movies like Spider-man or Black Panther but it's a story told epically.
Period 3 K.R."
FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"I would rate the movie Fences three and a half out of five stars. In the movie, Denzel Washington who directs and plays Troy Maxson is a former baseball player. Who spends his day on the porch rambling on and drinking liquor with Bono. Rose is troy's stay at home wife which is played by Viola Davis. She has won an Academy Award, Emmy award, and two Tony awards. Watching her act in Fences you could really see why she won all these awards. It goes without saying that no one else can play Rose than Viola Davis. Jim Bono played by Stephen Henderson is Troy's best friend and is around most of the time.When reading the book, I imagine certain things would be different like how I imagine Bono(Stephen Henderson) looking younger than how he does in the book. Also, I thought the porch would be bigger. Instead of a porch, it seems like its taking place in a backyard. In the movie. they added a montage to add to the moment after Troy and Rose's argument. The movie even deletes some scenes from the play. For instead, when Cory was on the phone.What I liked most about the movie was watching everything play out from the book. When you watch Rose(Viola Davis) and Troy(Denzel Washington) act out their parts. You can feel the intense, sadness, and happiness that goes on in the movie. For example when Rose says ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs, and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it was never gonna bloom!"" You could feel more of the emotion when watching instead of just reading it. When watching Jovan Adepo play Cory. I felt like he could have put more effort and emotion in.I never watch a movie with Denzel Washington starred or directed in. Watching the way he pulls together the movie. It was a surprise when I watch the movie and it was basically the same as the book. When Troy says ""All right, Mr. Death. I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take and build me a fence around this yard, see? I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me. And then I want you to stay on the other side."" I like the way the book put it in there. The metaphor for the fence made me have a deeper understanding of it. Denzel did a pretty good job putting this together it made me want to watch more of his movies. I also like how August Wilson the writer added a part when Raynell and Cory are singing together. ""Blue treed a possum out on a limb Blue looked at me and I looked at him grabbed that possum and put him in a sack Blue stayed there till came back old Blue's feet was big and round never allowed a possum to touch the ground."" That moment of them singing makes you realize the impact that Troy has had with them. It kinda seems to bring Cory and Raynell together.Even though the book and movie were good. I believe that the movie and book move quickly. Everything seems to happen fast. I hoped that they would be some flashbacks in the movie. It would have been more interesting seeing Troy past. Troy has an interesting past and the movie could have shown some moment of it.Music can be important to a movie. It can make you feel more of the emotion like how scary movies add certain music to add to the suspense of what's going to happen. In Fences, the music helps add more feelings about what's going on in the movie. Especially during the montage, the music made me realize how they were feeling.When thinking of Fences and comparing it to a blockbuster like Avengers Endgame. To me nothing can compare to Endgame, I grew up watching superhero movies with my father. In Endgame everyone has their own back story. If you follow the series of movies that connect to it you know everyone past and it all seems to connect into one movie which is Endgame. Fences doesn't feel like how a blockbuster feels. It felt more like a play than a movie. Blockbuster movie makes you want to rewatch the movie just so you can experience the movie again. It would keep you excited during the whole movie and wanting to see what comes next. I just don't feel like Fences could be a blockbuster.It wasn't bad to watch and it was kinda interesting. We get to see the character development in all the characters. I thought that the book would have at least more information than the movie. It was a surprise to discover that it was basically the same thing. This movie made me want to watch more movies with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis.SH

FENCES,7 December 2019,5/10,"The 2016 movie ""Fences based off the critically acclaimed play by the same name, proves that not every faithful adaptation can be stellar. With the film's dialogue being shot for shot the same as the dialogue in the screenplay, ""Fences"" proves to be an underwhelming experience at best. What made the screenplay so good was its ability to synthesize a realistic portrayal of an African American family, and managed to cram it into a screenplay without losing authenticity. The issue with the movie is its fear to venture away from the source material. While there were solid instances of this (i.e. the alter call scene, and the scene with gabe in the hospital). I feel as though the movie missed out on several opportunities for a flashback or scenes depicting characters like Alberta and Miss Pearl, who didn't have speaking lines in the play, but it would have been interesting to see.
Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington), his sons Cory (Jovan Adepo) and Lyons (Russell Hornsby), his brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), wife Rose (Viola Davis), and best friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), were all brought to life quite impressively by the actors who portrayed them. However, while the emotion and tension of the play were all present, the delivery of the dialogue felt too piled on at times. A large part of Troy Maxson's character, comes from the fact that he doesn't stop talking. Washington's directing and acting highlighted this point, and then cranked the brightness to 11. There were many times throughout the movie in which Denzel Washington delivered his lines over the lines of other actors. This to me, did not seem in character with Troy Maxson. Maxson may be abrasive and crude, but I don't see him as the impatient type.
The character of Cory Maxson, portrayed by Jovan Adepo, also felt rather lacking. Not only did Adepo lack the physical build of a supposed 17 year old football player, but he also made the character of Cory Maxson feel more weak in comparison to his written counterpart. The scene in which Cory and Troy have an altercation leading to Cory leaving the house, felt like a complete 180 in Cory's character. He went from one second yelling angrily at his father, to the next looking terrified. When Adepo delivered the line ""You crazy! You know that?"" I was expecting a continuation of the unbridled rage that he was exhibiting towards his father, throughout the duration of the discourse. However, what I and the audience were greeted with were a shaken little boy., which felt totally out of place considering not even 10 seconds ago Cory was standing his ground against his father.
Ultimately, the movie, while by no means a masterpiece, was not a complete train wreck. The biggest point it has going for it was it's faithfulness to the source material. But, this could also be seen as the film's greatest flaw. One of the best and most powerful scenes from this movie, Gabe in the mental hospital, wasn't in August Wilson's play. If Washington as a director had expanded upon this scene, and wove a message about how society treats its injured war heroes, then that alone would have improved the movie drastically. Instead, Washington decided to go the ""safe"" approach, barely adding anything new to the narrative, ultimately causing the movie to feel more like a dramatic reading of a play, rather than a 24 million dollar production."
FENCES,6 December 2019,8/10,"""Some people build fences to keep people out... and other people build fences to keep people in"" -Bono. August Wilson wrote ""Fences"" to open people's minds. Denzel Washington took August Wilson's ""Fences"" and built almost an exact replica, giving life to a 1950s/1960s African American family undergoing tension and changes. ""Fences"" is an intriguing movie. Its slight differences from the text allow the carbon copy to become a carefully formed diamond.The story unfolds in Troy's (Denzel Washington) job. We see Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and Troy chatting away as they collect garbage. This differs from the play since the only setting that is prominent in the play is the Maxon household. The subtle change in settings allows the viewer to immerse into Troy's life and experience his metamorphosis. Readers often overlook important events such as how the setting contributes to character development, but with the film, viewers are able to see how being in the kitchen or the living room as opposed to the yard contributes to the overall performance of the characters. For example, Rose (Viola Davis) is usually busy in the kitchen, which gives her something to do rather than just stand around entering and exiting the backyard. This conveys that Rose is a caring character who is attentive to keeping her family well, a prominent part of the story.Denzel Washington, a notable actor and director, manages to capture the intensity of a controlling father upon his family through his acting. Noting Denzel Washington's directing and acting skills in ""The Great Debaters"", he is able to immerse himself into the role of the character, almost becoming one with the film. As Troy Maxon seems to fill up the film, his incessant speech and the way he drowns out the other characters, portrays not only his controlling behavior, and Washington's formidable acting skills, but it also leaves the audience with a dizzying spell, wishing for Troy to stop talking. In the play, Troy's constant chatter is not very noticeable until you actually hear it acted out in the film. This helps develop Troy's character as someone who believes that he is always right, but in reality is just loud so that he can only hear himself while drowning out the changes occurring around him.In a powerful entrance, Viola Davis is able to capture a strong woman, much like in the movie ""The Help"" when she plays a servant in the south struggling to live and take care of her family: Aibeleen Clark. As Aibeleen, Davis suffers through discrimination and ardous treatment from her white ""boss"". Due to previous experience, Viola Davis is able to vividly portray her emotions and struggles to the audience. No wonder one could feel her pent up frustrations and rage spilling out in bitter tears when she claims through frustrated sobs, ""You take and don't even know nobody's giving!"" to Troy's infidelity in ""Fences"". To top it all off, she takes charge of the product of Troy's infidelity, Troy's baby girl, after finding out that Troy's lover, Alberta, died while giving birth. Despite being adamant against having a family where it was about ""your papa and your mama"", like hers was, Rose gathered all the strength within her to take care of Troy's baby because the child was not at fault for the sin of the father. Talk about courage! And who better to play out such courage than Viola Davis, a strong African American female actress.Bono's character was unexpected. I would have never imagined Stephen McKinley Henderson as Bono, but his acting completely engulfs Troy's best friend: someone that looks up to and looks out for his best friend. In the play, I imagined Bono like Troy, but slightly shorter and equal in body figure if not a little bit slimmer. After being able to see his character develop in the film, however, I concluded that McKinley Henderson is a perfect fit to play Bono.Cory (Jovan Adepo), Lyons (Russell Hornsby), and Raynell (Saniyya Sidney), all products from different women, but from the same father, each portray a stage of Troy's life. Lyons is the past, where Troy couldn't be present for his son. Cory is his present, a product of his comfort with Rose. Raynell is his future, the product of an affair. An affair which brought change and uncertainty to Troy's life. Raynell's presence is especially important because it demonstrates forgiveness and innocence.Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) is a form of comedic relief (although it seems incorrect) when he provides a child's point of view, interrupting heavy conversation. One can't help but to feel sorry for Gabriel for what the war did to him. In the play, the stage directions didn't provide as much intell into Gabriel's condition as the movie did. The eerie music as Gabriel shouts ""better get ready for the judgement"" down the street resonates in the viewers' mind and leaves a solemn atmosphere.The Lion King is a movie that, like Fences, provides a sense of importance when it comes to family as well as doing what is right, or the next right decision, much like Rose did for her family. The significance of the film is that when change occurs, some will take responsibility and make something for themselves while others will not. One's decision depends on one's character and willingness to preserve one's family or what one values. In bad times, good morals. The film's ending could have used more detail from the text. I would have liked to see Gabriel dancing. Overall, the film was a great watch, but can only be fully understood if one reads the book first.Pd.3 FZ"
FENCES,6 December 2019,8/10,"""Fences"" is impressive in how closely it sticks true to the text. Denzel Washington does a fantastic job orchestrating an emotional, and relatable film. The direction, cinematography, and music prove Washington is a masterful filmmaker. It is not easy to adapt a stage play to the big screen, but Washington does a sufficient job, with only a few scenes feeling like a filmed stage set.Fences is a close-knit, intimate story detailing Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington)'s hardships and how they influence the way he boxes his family in. ""Some people build fences to keep people out...and other people build fences to keep people in."" - Troy's best friend, Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) describes perfectly how Troy's fence is symbolic of trying to keep his family boxed in. Troy's traumatic past with his father caused him to be cold, unapologetic, and reluctant to let his family - specifically Cory (Jovan Adepo) - pursue anything that is not guaranteed. Troy does not encourage Cory to pursue football due to his past failures with sports. ""You go on and get your book-learning so you can work yourself up in that A&P or learn how to fix cars or build houses or something, get you a trade. That way you have something can't nobody take away from you."" - Troy's reluctance to let Cory pursue his passion speaks volumes on the effects that parenting, or a lack thereof, can have on a person. Troy is imperfect, and Fences highlights this imperfection. Watching Troy deal with infidelity, it is easy to paint Troy as the antagonist of the story. Though, I think many men can see a part of themselves within Troy. Troy also cares a lot about his loved ones, even though he is not about to express it in the best way. In a conversation with Death, Troy states ""Alright...Mr. Death. See now...I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take and build me a fence around this yard. See? I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me. And then I want you to stay on the other side. See? You stay over there until you're ready for me. Then you come on. Bring your army. Bring your sickle."" - Troy would die for his loved ones, and I believe that says a lot about his character. Rose Maxson (Viola Davis) is Troy's wife. Her unwavering loyalty to Troy despite his flaws is representative of her emotional strength. Throughout the film, Rose backs up Troy in circumstances that most other women wouldn't. She is the embodiment of a faithful wife. Some people may see her as weak for staying with Troy, but I see it as more of an indication of how strong she is.Denzel Washington uses minimalist cinematography with no crazy effects or big action, yet still creates a powerful film. The acting in this film is outstanding, and it is its greatest strength. Troy and Rose have incredible chemistry, and I think what stands out the most is that their relationship is relatable. Rose puts up with Troy's buffoonery for almost the entire film, but she eventually erupts in an emotional outburst towards Troy near the final act of the movie, and this is where Viola's acting skills shine the brightest. Her side of the story can definitely be found relatable by many women. The supporting cast is also solid, especially Stephen Henderson's role as Bono, Troy's right-hand man. Bono is a rational side to Troy's temptations with infidelity, and a great friend overall. Mykelti Williamson plays a solid role as Gabriel, properly playing a character that's mentally challenged (as weird as that sounds).The film has more than one setting, contrary to the play which only occurs on the porch of the Maxson household. In the play, I didn't interpret Gabriel as being a burden to anybody, but in the film, Troy is visibly annoyed with Gabriel, sometimes even embarrassed. The emotion is much stronger in the film than in the play, mainly due to the amazing acting. Everyone seems to be doing their best at giving August Wilson's words justice, and their efforts result in one of the most well-acted films I've seen. Fences is different from many general box office hits of today, because there is not much action and extravaganza. Fences is a relatable, emotional story that I feel everyone can find some enjoyment in. For those that enjoy watching good actors perform a well-written script, you will love this film.Period 3, JM"
FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"This movie can be described as underwhelming. Fences (2016) is an adaptation of August Wilson's play Fences. It is very true to the play, almost exactly the same. However, Denzel Washington's acting is not as passionate as I felt it was in the play. Denzel Washington's performance was good, but it felt watered-down compared to Troy in the play. Denzel's acting was not as passionate in this film, as it was in his previous films. As a director, Denzel did a very good job. The scene where Lyons (Russell Hornsby), Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), and Troy where standing and drinking together while Troy talked about his father was an interesting scene. The way the camera spun around the characters made if feel as if the stories were connected, like a cycle.
Viola Davis' acting was amazing and I was thoroughly impressed with her adaptability to different roles. Her acting was passionate and she portrayed Rose perfectly. Every emotion I felt while reading the play, Viola enacted it on the screen. Her performance was jaw-dropping, especially during the scene where Troy told Rose he was having another child. In the play, when Rose expresses how she truly feels to Troy, ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom!"", and ""When your daddy walked through the house he was so big he filled it up. That was my first mistake. Not to make him leave room for me"" was subdued compared to when I watched Davis' performance on the screen. Her cries added so much to the performance and truly brought the script alive especially when she said ""Okay, Troy...you're right. I'll take care of your baby for you...cause...like you say...she's innocent...and you can't visit the sins of the father upon the child. A motherless child has got a hard time. From right now...this child got a mother. But you a womanless man"", adding that devastating feeling to the viewers.
Stephen Henderson as Bono, Jovan Adepo as Cory and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel were all impressive as well. Williamson's performance made Gabriel's lines feel more solemn than I believed they were during the play, but it wasn't a negative thing. Adepo's performance was powerful just like Cory's lines during the play. At the end when he greets Raynell (Saniyya Sydney), Adepo's gentle demeanour as Cory stuck the most with me. Henderson was exactly how I pictured Bono in the play.
Compared to the box office hits of today, Fences shows the imperfect side of families, a taboo topic. The acting is remarkable and it stays very true to the script, unlike many book-to-movie adaptations.bowman

FENCES,7 December 2019,7/10,"This review contains spoilers.Based on August Wilson's 1986 play Fences is a very well put together drama that portrays the life of an African American family living in the 1950's. This film was directed and produced by Denzel Washignton, who also happens to star as the lead role. The overall movie was very entertaining with a great choice of actors like Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, Viola Davis as Rose Maxson, Russell Hornsby as Lyons. With a few minor changes Fences the movie stayed as true to text then most other screenplays that are based off a book.Fences is about a family living in the 1950s with the father Troy Maxson (Denzel Washinton) facing the consequences of his actions while also fighting internally with his past. Rose (Viola Davis) having a very powerful women role and being the only woman in this movie until the end brings more attention to her as the main building block of the family.The movie shows the life of Rose and Troy Maxson and the struggles within their marriage. Troy has two kids Lyons (Russell Hornsby), from a woman before he met Rose and one kid with Rose, Cory (Jovan Adepo). The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother Gabriel and Stephen Mckinely Henderson who plays Troy's best friend Jim Bono. For most of the movie Troy is complaining about how he was never able to have the career he wanted playing baseball because of his race. His son Cory is in high school playing football and is being scouted by colleges because like his father when it comes to sports he exceeds among the rest. Troy constantly tells everyone that Cory should stop playing football because in a white dominated business would never let a black man become successful in sports despite their skill level.We soon find out that Troy has been stepping out on his wife and later impregnated another woman. With this being one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie but it also happens to be my favorite scene because of when Rose tells the story of how her family is quite similar to mine. I connected so well with this scene because she says ""My whole family is half. Everybody got different fathers and mothers... my two sisters and my brother."" With her having such a strong role and showing a more vulnerable side of her life showing how strong she is to even be able to talk about it considering the situation she was just presented with. Later on in the movie the soon to be mother of Troy's child dies during childbirth, leading to Troy coming to Rose asking for help raise the child, Rose says yes because the child is innocent and shouldn't be blamed for the wrong doing of their parents. Even with her saying yes she also makes it clear that ""From right now this child got a mother, but you a womanless man"".With using such well known actors we expect more to come from then on the screen and honestly I wasn't disappointed with their performance. Every time I saw Denzel Washington in the movie it reminded me of his stellar performance in his other movies The Equalizer and Remember the Titans. Viola Davis never disappoints in any of her films and I know that whenever I see her on the screen I would automatically know that this film I was watching would be worth it.The problem that I had with this movie was it tends to jump around and does not follow a constant flow throughout the story with us not always knowing how much time has passed. But other then that I overall enjoyed the movie.I.K. Pd.3"
FENCES,6 December 2019,5/10,"Denzel Washington's interpretation of Fences is poignantly reflected by he and his illustrious supporting cast, but lacks director input in a film that is almost a carbon-copy of the play. The movie's highlight IS the acting. Viola Davis' performance as Rose is spot on, maintaining an appropriately reserved persona for most of the film until her character is broken. Cory (Jovan Adepo) follows suit in an almost forgettable but note-worthy exhibition. Gabriel (Mykelti Willamson) adds an entirely different dynamic to each of his segments, and Lyons (Russell Hornsby) for just a moment stands out above all the rest for what is arguably the best scene in the film, unforgettably telling his father ""If you wanted to change me, you should've been there when I was growing up.""Besides a few memorable scenes, however, the film falls short of impressing the audience with anything besides the acting. As stated before, it copies August Wilson's play almost word for word. I was fortunate enough to have read the play before watching the movie, but would be concerned that for someone who did not, the whole film may, for the most part, go over your head. It should. Many times it will drone on and on through dull dialogues and seemingly pointless narratives, and seldom does anything to keep viewers captivated. When compared to box office hits of today, you could understand where the lack of admiration for the film comes from. Take Avengers: Endgame as an example. It is a film that well balances action, drama, even comedy, to attract the general audience, and perfectly culminates it's preceding films. By comparison, Fences carries on monotonously from scene to scene, without much to make it stand out.Although I am highly critical of this film, and would not recommend viewing if you have not read the play, I will not say it is bad. Although there seem to be many instances when the movie is on the verge of complete disappointment, it is often revitalized by compelling performances and stellar dramatics. These are the moments that drive the film, and keep the audience wanting more. If I could give Denzel credit for one more thing, it would be his mastery in connecting the life of his characters with his viewers. The scenes where we can see each person develop his character stand out. The perfect representation is Cory after standing up to his father time and time again. We can see him go from afeard, to bold, and finally daring. His last stand is just about the final piece of the puzzle to develop his character arc. It goes hand in hand with the universal themes expressed in Wilson's play, that we can step out of our parents shadow and not make their mistakes, and it is delivered flawlessly.Bowman, PD 3, CN"
FENCES,5 December 2019,7/10,"The 2016 adaptation of August Wilson's Fences, directed by Denzel Washington, was everything I expected going from text to screen, nothing more, nothing less, and I received great satisfaction in that. Following the original text practically line for line, we see Troy and Rose Maxson (Denzel Washington and Viola Davis) along with their family Lyons (Russell Hornsby) Cory (Jovan Adepo) Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) Raynell (Saniyya Sidney) and good friend Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) brought to life in their iconic manners. Troys retains his classic hard-headed and stubborn personality as he resists the reality presented by the rest of his family that he is a man stuck in time, the same time he refuses to admit even the mighty Troy Maxson has a limited supply of.
Fences(2016) immediately introduces viewers to a world that is both all too familiar and yet completely new. For those familiar with the written text, this is the universe that the reader longs to see within the book, for those beginning with the movie adaptation, this is the suburban city streets and town that some of us are used to riding our bikes around. The movie does a great job at balancing the introduction of a never before seen world with the original setting of the play, the Maxson household, practically wielding the home as the nucleus of the universe Denzel has developed. Despite introducing the various new settings, Denzel does quite a good job at still ensuring the scenes fit, never taking anything away from the events taking place. Denzel's wise choices of what decisions to omit are put to use right off the bat in the first scene. Choosing to change the setting to the neighborhood streets as well as the time to daytime rather than night, the scene doesn't lose any of the significance that it held within the book, if anything, it makes it more believable.
Denzel Washington's wise directorial decisions are not the only ones he makes for the film. While bringing the role of Troy Maxson to life, Washington makes it his very own, as do all the actors/actresses in the film. The small things, such as smiles and laughter are adopted in places where they're absent in the book, lending itself to the authenticity of the fictional work. While the film follows the book line for line, it uses the characters as a starting point, a frame in which they can elevate their performances past just the pages of the book. Viola Davis' performance as Rose Maxson is a direct representation of the casts ability to do so. Her acting transcends the pages, the screen when Rose receives the news of Troy's unfaithfulness to her. The way the tears roll down her face, the way her voice cracks when reciting the line ""I been standing with you! I been right here with you, Troy. I got a life too. I gave eighteen years of my life to stand in the same spot with you."" forms something in the audience that only the truly greats (both actresses and movies) can: emotion. While today's top films like Avengers: Endgame and Toy Story 4 can appeal to things such as nostalgia with their long standing franchises and generations of viewers, a film such as Fences cannot relate to those factors, Tony Stark's ""I Love You 3000"" just simply hits different than Cory and Raynell's rendition of ""Hear it ring! Hear it ring! I had a dog his name was Blue"", but that makes it that much more impressive that the amount of emotion conveyed within the film can be compared to these modern day juggernauts.
For viewers who watched the film because of their love of the book, their stance on the acting may not be as positive as mine though. I will admit, comparing it strictly to what the book was, I was somewhat let down by the acting. There were times in the film where I wanted to see the hardcore, dark, gritty, Troy Maxson created in the pages of August Wilson's play. The somewhat nonchalant approach to the story of Troy's father was just one instance where that desire wasn't fulfilled. I was expecting there to be much more of a hardened impact in the realization from Troy that the reason ""the devil had never come to get (His Father)...cause he was the devil himself."" Despite my initial reaction not all the differences in portrayals were bad. Gabriel's portrayal was particularly effective as he transformed the mentally slow man created in the play to the mentally ill and delusional person shown on the screen. In my opinion, it is easy to get lost in what the characters were, or are supposed to be if you compare the book and film as a book to film adaptation, but ironically I think that'd make us all like Troy, unable to accept that things are different.
Honestly, I feel as though the movie would have been much more disappointing if it followed the book exactly, at that point it would've been comparable to that of an audio book. The need for live action would be unnecessary if the characters didn't change at all, in fact for the movie specifically change is almost crucial. Since August Wilson wrote Fences, there have been various live action renditions through its intended medium of theatre, however I'd like to think that Fences cannot be conveyed to its fullest potential by doing the same thing over and over. Today we live in a world where what appears on the screen greatly outweighs anything else going on and influences our values. While I can't speak for everyone, I highly doubt that in today's society it is common for many people to go and actually read or watch Fences the play, so its newer movies counterpart is the solution to keeping Fences relevant and modern. With updated, slightly ""modern"" portrayals of the characters, the film does a good job of making the various themes of Fences relatable. Many people can relate to the strained relationship with a father like the one shown between Troy and Cory, Some can relate to Cory in his desire to just receive some sort of positive acknowledgement from their parents, it's one thing to read it, but to see it, to see someone actively portray your feelings, thats a different type of connection. I personally can relate to the internal battle displayed by Corey in the final scene with his need to chase out and deny what's left of Troy Maxson in his life, the need to rid yourself of the ""sins of the father"". Seeing Rose teach Cory how to ""Cut the world down to size"" to fit him and this ""shadow"" he's running from, it personally touched me differently. I wasn't just reading it, I was listening, seeing it. Watching someone talk to and console a character in which you can envision yourself as, it is almost as that character is no more, its you now, it's as the other characters are speaking directly to you, it was almost as if Rose spoke to me herself. The ability of the film to produce such a feeling is what makes it a great movie.
The 2016 film adaptation of Fences does what the written play by August Wilson cannot. The creation of a nostalgic world, and heart touching and authentic performances, Fences can be considered a very well executed book-to-film adaptation.Kyle.Rey."
FENCES,8 December 2019,5/10,"It is the 1950s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Working class Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) works as a garbage man to support his wife Rose (Viola Davis), son Cory (Jovan Adepo), and mentally impaired brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson). Bitter over a denied opportunity as major league baseball player, tensions run high as Troy denies a similar football opportunity for his son Cory. Meanwhile Rose attempts to keep the family together.
I watched this film in class and in short this film just was not for me. It's really just an hour and a half of non stop talking mostly from Troy. I wouldn't have been able to sit still for this entire movie had I not watched this over the span of a week. Just like how ""some build fences to keep people out ... "" this play to on-screen adaptation keeps out any form of creativity in this movie. It strictly follows the play's script word for word with no deviation. Scenes that were not displayed in the play could have easily been added to the film to add more drama but no such content was to be found. Only some few scenes were changed like Gabriel visiting a gravestone, Troy visiting Gabriel in the hospital, and Rose and Troy sleeping in a bed together when the news of Alberta's death is given. This, in my opinion, is the""one time in my life I've got to say no"" to Denzel Washington as a director. Though that said, Washington is a much better actor than a director in the movie.
The acting in this film is outstanding. Viola Davis, Denzel Washington, and Mykelti Williamson stood out to me especially. They acted their characters amazingly, Williamson made Gabriel very lovable. Davis was able to show that she could play any character you gave her and ugly cry like no other. Washington was also able to take on the role of a bitter unlikeable man and execute it perfectly.
Though the setting of the 1950s of the film and play make it seem like ages ago, the main problem still persists today. Troy is a bitter man from his past experiences and because of that he projects his own experiences on to his son Cory. Though many factors stopped Troy from playing in the major league baseball, the only thing that stood out to him was the white man. This stays with him for a long time which we can see when he tells Cory ""the white man ain't gonna let you get nowhere with that football"". Even today parents will be scarred by experiences they had trying to get where they wanted to be and because of it they will in a way shelter their kids from having to experience the negative things they have. This movie/play shows just one example of this aspect of parent-child relationships.

FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"I recently watched the 2016 film ""Fences"" which could be mistaken for your typical drama film but it captures the deeper meaning of failure, family, and forgiveness. Denzel does an astounding job bringing August Wilson's play for the big screen word for word.Taken down the streets of 1950's Pittsburgh to the small home of Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) and his wife Rose (Viola Davis). Within a few minutes of the film you understand why the book was so timeless with themes that relate to our lives today. The film is consistent with this eerie feeling of uneasiness that I couldn't quite capture reading the book. This film wasn't meant to be a big action film but an intimate story that leaves you to evaluate your own life and values.Denzel is known for his infamous roles as Malcom X & Bleek from Mo' Better Blues. I build this love hate feeling for Denzel playing this character Troy; unable to move forward from his trauma as a result hurts his family. He seems to come from a place of love but his actions do more harm than good. Alongside Viola with her impeccable acting of a heart broken mother who bears love. Together their powerful chemistry is undeniable and leaves you wanting more. TParts of this film I found dreading and unnecessary but there are extra scenes that make up for it. Troy screaming at the window to ""Death"" and Troy feeding Gabe (Mykelti Williamson) in the hospital. The camera panning in on the rose dropping and Gabe's trumpet. These tiny elements that bring this movie to life. Every detail means something. That's what I love about these kinds of movies. The line ""fences to keep people in or out"" leads back to the plot of this story. Troy pushes his own son Cory (Jovan Adepdo) away who he was supposed to finish building the fence with. By the end of the film the fence was built up and Troy was the only one left but weirdly brought everyone back in.August Wilson wanted this movie to be directed by someone who was black because no one can understand how to portray it. There's all a black cast but the story is universal. We all have hardships and we should forgive ""the sins of our fathers"" so we don't pass down that same hurt. We're able to break cycles and generational curses as seen with Raynell (Saniyya Sidney) and Cory.I give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I think everyone should read this play and watch this movie once in their lifetime and maybe watch it over to catch some things twice. This film will pierce a hole in your soul.S.G Pd. 6"
FENCES,9 December 2019,9/10,"Recently I have watched the movie Fences, and I honestly believe the movie is outstanding in the way it is ""true to the text"". This movie is based on the book ""Fences"" By August Wilson. About how a man named Troy Maxson who is a Garbage man. A man with two kids and a wife who built a fence to keep his family in, and simultaneously breaks the fence down through his actions.Directed by Denzel Washington, Fences was filled with world class actors who can truly bring out the emotions the book was trying to convey. Set in a small house in 1950's Pittsburgh. With the movies main focus around Denzel Washington, the delusional father and Viola Davis, the strongest women who were the actors who truly conveyed their acting skills so well, you get the feeling that they are the characters themselves.One actor that really shined in the movie was Lyons(Russell Hornsby). Throughout the numerous times he was mentioned in the book, I expected that his conversations with Troy were a little more lax and not so serious. But as we have seen in the movie the conversation where he was arguing with Troy was a lot more serious and really changed how I viewed Lyons as a character.Through the slight changes between the book and the movie (Seeing Troy at the bar/work/inside the house) they bring upon a massive impact on the way the movie feels. When we see Troy(Denzel) At the bar we are able to see the change in how the interactions with other people changes. At the beginning of the play Troy always had Bono(Stephen Henderson) around him. Then after the conflict the separated Rose(Viola) from Troy we are able to see how he is losing the people around him. Sure Bono stops by the bar to check up on him but he leaves immediately without them sharing a single drink. Then when we see Troy at work, Bono also worked with Troy at the beginning and the same thing happened as the bar. He got promoted to a driver and couldn't work with Bono since they kept moving him around from place to place.One of the amazing things about the book and the movie is relatability. The fact that we are able to see what is happening in the book before our eyes, we can get a sense of feel that this is really happening. We know these things could, and most likely did happen in the 1950's. While watching, we are constantly in a state of either confusion and/or suspense of what i going to happen next which made the movie even more enjoyable.Overall the movie was outstanding in the ways it was true to the text. Also of how it was fully able to convey the emotions that were not fully clear within the book. The only thing that my have been slightly disappointing was Troy's interaction with Alberta and how it made him feel ""young and happy."" I wish I was able to get even just a small glimpse of how much he really valued Alberta and further depth of why she was the reason he separated from Rose.

FENCES,8 December 2019,6/10,"Fences is an interesting movie with suspense. Fences main actors are Danzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen McKinley, Mykelti Williamson, Jovan Adepo, and Rusell Hornsby. Danzel Washingston played as Troy, his role was not to be a good father or husband. Troy in a way did play his part of a husband and father to give his family their needs such as shelter, and food. But, he did not give them genuinely love like a husband and father should. Viola Davis played as Rose, her role was to be a Troy's wife and a mom. Rose treated her husband great, but when it would come to stand up for her son's she was not really good at it. Stephen MckKinley plays as Bonnie, his role was to be Troy's closest friend. Mykelti Williamson played as Gabriel, his role was to be Troy's brother, and seemed to be mentally ill. Jovan Adepo plays as Cory, his role was to be the youngest son of Troy and Rose. Cory seemed to be fearful of his dad, but caring for his mom. Rusell Hornsby played as Lyons, his role was to be the oldest son, and older brother. Lyons wasn't around much unless he wanted money. Saniyya Sidney played as Raynell, her role was to be Troy's daughter.There were a few differences between the film and the book. For example, in the book Gabe just seemed to be a calm person but in the film you can tell he is mentally ill. He would start yelling out of nowhere, the cops would stop him because he would be disturbing neighborhoods, and he would hallucinate. In the film Rose went to Troy's job to ask him when he was going to come back home. Rose was trying to say when was he going to start acting like her husband again, in the book Rose did not go to his job. Also, when Rose got the news that Alberta died she told Troy in the bedroom when in the book she told him in the yard.The actors in Fences played their roles very well. There was a lot of intense scenes with Troy, Rose, and Cory. I did not like how in this film, Troy was an ignorant person from the start to end. Troy never came to a realization of his actions and all the emotions he caused his wife and son to have towards him. He did not make up for anything that he did. I also did not like how Rose kept trying to be a good wife to Troy after what he did to her. Rose should've been stronger and left him because she did not deserve that. In a way, she was strong because she kept going even after what happened between them. Rose could've also stand up more for her son, she seemed to be a better wife than a mom. Troy and his son Cory had a very different relationship as a father and son. Cory was afraid of his dad, he did not feel loved by Troy instead he questioned Troy if he even liked and Troy did not even deny instead he started yelling at him.Fences plays a role in our culture, families might relate to fences. There are families that might not have great dad or husband. Some fathers might still be old schooled like Troy that did not believe that black men can succeed in life and be better than what they are. Some parents might tell their kids what they have to do in life, and not let them make their own choices and follow what they want to be. Troy did not want Cory to play football when that could have benefited Cory in his future. Some parents might not even approve their child playing football because of how dangerous it might be. (N.M)"
FENCES,6 December 2019,6/10,"I have read the play first before watching the movie and honestly they stay true to the text but watching it makes it seem like the executions is lack luster. How Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Jovan Adepo, and Mykelti Williamson portrayed their characters leaves a serious tone throughout the movie but it feels like more could be done -maybe in the background or maybe in how the sentences were stated- to have everything flow more easily. Still, all and all I was able to moderately enjoy the movie and applauded a bit when Viola Harris delivered a line in the movie that her character does not in the play that goes on the lines of When the sins of our fathers visit us we do not have to play host. We can banish them with forgiveness..."". Which is essentially the whole premise of the work and a quote by August Wilson, the author of the playbook.In this day and age, with the box office filled with such big name titles with big name actors, it is easy to see how this movie didn't do so well. But What the story teaches is very deep and really pulls at the heart strings. For instance, having to hear a parent say to their child that they don't like them and that everything the parent does for them is because it is a responsibility, makes one who is probably in that form of situation very sympathetic as they have either been in that situation or are currently facing that. in addition to having those who aren't in that type of situation think and understand how lucky they are to have a parent that does not view raising their kid as just another job that needs to get done.All-in-all, the story portrays a father in the 1950s and his struggles to fully get a grip on life and how it is affecting those around him. Having pushed one family out of his life and now still failing to keep hold of his current family. Cheating on his wife who still keeps him in the house as she has put years of her life. How he then gets a daughter and loses a mistress and a wife(Rose{Viola} takes in the daughter to raise but essentially divorces Troy{Denzel}), and then how he even kicks out his second son because he decided to stand up to his father. The movie is all about ups and downs but it is the final scene that drives home the meaning behind the play. That no matter who hurts you, be it your own father, forgive them and you won't face any of their demons.

FENCES,8 December 2019,6/10,"On December 15, 2016, Fences, pg-13 drama film, produced and directed by Denzel Washington, and written by August Wilson hit the big screens. The long awaited film adaptation of the play Fences was here and it did not disappoint.
Fences is about Troy Maxson, a man, living in a time where liberation is in the air. The change from the 1950s to the 1960s turns out to be a difficult one as he is left a ""stranger, angry, and afraid, in a world he never knew and to a wife and son he understands less and less.""With a compelling performances from as Denzel Washington as Troy Maxon, Viola Davis as Rose Maxon, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Jim Bono, Jovan Adepo as Cory, Russell Hornsby as Lyons, ""king of the jungle,"" and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel, a subtle but essential soundtrack, Fences is the rare movie that is better than the book. The attention to detail was well appreciated as it translated into an ending that was powerful and of so much substance. Even the way they showed time pass told a story. Between the sticking tongues out at each other and the meaning behind their looks, there was an unspoken family dynamic that gave the movie some verisimilitude.Just as Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) said, ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in."" That was a message well communicated as Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) built fences both physically and emotionally around himself and his family. He said ""You got to take the crookeds with the straights,"" but didn't take his own advice until it was too late. Luckily for him, Fences is a story about forgiveness and he happens to be the main character.Although the movie was pretty much verbatim, the movie made some changes. The biggest change was the change of scenery that doesn't really happen in the play since every scene was either in the house, on the poarch, or in the backyard. In addition, another difference between the book and the movie is that in the movie you get to see the reactions of neighbors when Gabriel yells ""better get ready for the judgement"" down the street. We also get to see how Gabriel is doing in the Mental Hospital, a moment we don't get in the book.
Fences is different from any other movie that we see today. General box office hits today are movies like Frozen II, Ford v Ferrari, and Joker, movies with fictional stories. Fences, however, is realistic. Fortunately, for me and many others the word realistic is closely associated with the word interesting. In my opinion, a non-fiction story entertains better than a fiction story because its something you don't see everyday.In the end, this movie deserves all the praise it got. Fences is a movie worth watching. However, its only a film worth rewatching if its something your into. This films fatal flaw would be its inability to draw in new audiences because it's a little too realistic. Other than that the film is great. August Wilson would be proud.Period 6 R.O."
FENCES,9 December 2019,8/10,"As I read the play I kept repeating the same thing over and over again to myself, ""this book is soo boringgg."" This play brought immense boredom to me and I would get sleepy every time we read it. I didn't really understand what was going on and there were times where I would stop and ask myself, "" What is truly the message behind Troye acting like this."" I was too focused on getting the book over with that I missed the most important details because I was just so uninterested in the play.
After we finally finished the book, we were finally going to watch the movie ""Fences"" written by August Wilson and directed by Denzel Washington. When the movie first began playing I was a little disappointed on who was playing the role of Troy Maxson because throughout the whole book I had a different image on how Troye looked and his body structure. Whereas the other actors of Fences I believed suited the roles. My favorite actors throughout the whole movie was Viola Davis also known as Rose and Mykelti Williamson, made a perfect match for the role of Gabe. Through the acting of Viola, I was able to feel her pain and betrayal on Troy's behalf. The role of Gabe was a pretty sad role, but Mykelti did a great job playing the role. I was able to truly see the deep affects the injury had on him and the effect it had on Troy's family. The overall production of the film ""Fences"" was truly amazing I believe that Denzel Washington wasn't what many expected to play the role of Troy, but he still played it off amazingly. The scene that has the most meaning to me is when Rose tells Troy ""this child got a mother, but you're a woman less man."" This scene is really empowering on how women should get back on their feet from a betrayal like Troy's. Small details like this I missed when reading the book I felt like nothing was catching my attention and I'm just a person that really likes to see pictures so I believe the film really was fenominal on how it focused on many issues that are not as relevant today, but it was once a part of history.

FENCES,9 June 2021,7/10,"Have you ever missed out on an oppurntinut that could have changed your life? I like the movie ""fences'' because of how the actors portray their characters in the story. The storyline was great and it played out very well. The movie isn't confusing to understand, there's a clear beginning, middle and ending and the actors did a very good job of becoming their character.Troy is a worker at a sanitation company where he puts garbage in the back of the truck but later gets a promotion to actually drive the truck. Troy had always dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player but when they admitted black athletes to play they told Troy he was too old. Troy has a wife named Rose and 3 kids Lyons, Cory, and Raynell. Cory becomes excited with joining football and wants to make it into the league. Troy's anger from getting rejected from the league makes him bitter about Cory joining the football team, causing tension between the family and squashes Cory's chance of meeting a football recruiter.Throughout the whole film the acting performance was good. You knew why the character was feeling a certain way and how they portrayed different emotions throughout the entire film was good. I enjoyed that the lighting in the film affected the atmosphere of the film. It helped with certain scenes, if the scene is a serious moment there wouldn't be bright lights and if it was a happy or exciting scene there would be bright lights making the mood brighter. The movie was interesting. It's a movie that you have to really pay attention to understand, and I also enjoyed the story line and how the film was filmed."
FENCES,13 June 2021,9/10,"""You're too old to play"", have you ever heard that when you wanted to play one of your
favorite sports? Well Troy Maxson has, in the movie fences with Viola Davis, Denzel Washington and Jovan Adepo, we get taken through how lost and broken dreams can impact you and the people around you in many ways. Although the plot sends you through many emotions, the feeling you get left of with a feeling of wholesomeness and a warm heart
Troy Maxson played by Denzel Washington had a passion to play baseball
professionally, however, at the time that he wanted to play professionally the major leagues were not allowing black people to play. When the time came that black people were allowed to play, Troy was then deemed to old. As the movie goes on we can see that this impacts many people in Troys like such as his wife Rose (played by Viola Davis) and especially his son Cory (played by Jovan Adepo). In the movie Troy's son Cory wants to play football and eventually play professionally. One day Cory tells Troy that a college recruiter is looking for him which then angers Troy seeing that his son may become more successful than him. Troy then proceeds to tell his coach he will not be playing anymore so in turn Cory loses his shot. In the end Troy dies and Cory reveals that he does not want to go to his fathers funeral due to their relationship. Also Troys mentally ill brother Gabe comes by with a horn to open up the gates for Troy. At first the horn was not making any noise, but when it did after a few tries the clouds moved away and the sun started to shine. Personally I like how the movie ended, it left my heart feeling warm and I felt it was absolutely beautiful.It is an emotional movie about relationships that will leave you with mixed feelings
throughout. I personally liked the acting in the movie, it provided a sense of realism and it didn't even feel like they were acting. It make you feel like you were apart of the movie watching. The film technique was also amazing. The scenery gave you a sense of what time period the movie was based in right off the bat. I also like how the scenery gave a realistic view of how life was and what life looked like in that time period. The director also did a great job with the camera shots. When it came to a moment in the movie where stuff was intense he zoomed up close to the characters faces so that you could really focus on what they were saying. For example in the fight scene between Troy and his son cory, Troy says ""You ain't gotta say excuse me cause your daddy don't count around here no more is that right?"". At this moment when troy says that it is zoomed into both Cory and Troys face. Now for the story line I felt it was amazing and the plot was well written. It evoked many emotion and left you with the right amount of intensity, per scene. I liked how to the plot was unpredictable in a sense. For example in the beginning you wouldn't expect Troy to have a child as a result of an affair. I didn't even expect an affair at all!To conclude I feel fences was a great movie. It definitely invoked a rollercoaster of
emotions and great feelings of intensity however over all the heart warming feeling you are left with is worth it."
FENCES,14 June 2021,9/10,"Our experiences shape many who we are and the way we perceive the world. In ""Fences"" we see how the past experiences of characters affected them and what decisions they made. This amazing film tells a story that many African-Americans can relate to. It will definitely leave you thinking about your own journey.In the film which was written by August Wilson and directed by Denzel Washington, Troy, (Denzel Washington) is a sanitation worker in 1950s Pittsburg. The film starts off with Troy and his old friend, Bono (Stephen McKinley) on a sanitation truck cracking jokes, and complaining about their jobs. Troy walks back home with Bono, where he is greeted by his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). They all (Troy, Bono, and Rose), sit down and tell jokes. It is made known to the audience that Troy drinks a lot. Eventually Rose and Troy have a conversation about their son, Cory's (Jovan Adepo) football career. Troy makes it clear he doesn't want Cory playing football, and that he's better off fixing cars. Bono tells Troy that Cory would turn out all right if he was athletic in sports as much as Troy was. Troy turns that statement down and reminds Bono and Rose how he didn't get anything out of being one of the best baseball players because of the racial barriers in sports. Rose and Bono let Troy know that ""times have changed"" and ""a lot of colored boys are playing ball now"". Troy doesn't want to hear it. Later on in the film, Troy's toxic behavior to his son Cory, and the affair he has with another woman, who he gets pregnant, is revealed. Throughout the whole film the audience gets to see how Troy's failed baseball career and racial dicrimination negatively affected his family and mental health.This film is a wonderful masterpiece that tells the story of a black man in 1950s Pittsburg struggling to leave his past traumas behind and successfully take care of his family. The background of the beautiful neighborhood skies creates a feeling of hope in many scenes. The close-ups between Troy and Cory reveal tension and emotional abuse. Troy often justifies his abusive actions by saying things like, ""I gave you your life"" and ""I don't got to like you"". During many fighting scenes, Troy blindly blames his traumatic childhood for the way he is. ""Fences"" will leave you feeling optimistic about life and all the experiences that come with it."
FENCES,12 April 2017,10/10,"Thought provoking movie about a poor black family and primarily the fathers (Troy Maxson) work life and the choices he made. Acting is superb and it was interesting to see Troy Maxson make one of the regrettable choices that his father also made. I can relate to this having seen it play out time and time again in many families. The father or mother did this and even though it was horrible, the same horrible behavior is repeated by the victim. Its the life they know, its the life they were taught."
FENCES,1 March 2018,1/10,"I bought this movie only because anything with Viola Davis in it is always a good movie. However, from the very beginning of this movie, Denzel Washington spewed the word *nigga* over a dozen times. It only went downhill from there. After 35 minutes into this pathetic movie and Denzel spewing *nigga* every other word got extremely tiring and most irritating to say the least. Very out of character for him imo . Then to see my grandson (who happens to be BLACK) watching this, forget trying to convince him this word is unacceptable ...... period! Very disappointed!!!"
FENCES,22 March 2017,7/10,There are interesting aspects to this movie but it never felt like a movie. It really seemed like a play. One can appreciate the talent of the actors but the story dragged on too long in certain spots. It never went beyond the limits of a theater drama. This is too bad because it had great potential.
FENCES,13 March 2017,9/10,"Fences follows Troy (Denzel) he works as a garbage collector and spends time with his family and friends telling stories about his past. That is really all that i can say about this film without getting into spoilers. A life story with a lot of details and emotions. A film like this can't be made this well without a talented cast. That is why Fences heavily relies on powerful performances! Viola is extraordinary but Denzel is out of this world... The way they play off each other almost feels like the cameras are rolling on a real married couple whit hopes, dreams and nightmares. The smile, laugh, and fight at every single scene are like a perfect moment. Fences ends up being for me the best picture of the year! Overall, Fences due to its very specific style of storytelling delivers without a doubt a very well-made and rare picture. A incredible well-told and emotionally striking drama that everyone shouldn't miss."
FENCES,2 March 2017,10/10,"Just finished watching a very moving and powerful film Fences . Extraordinary acting by all in this film, to me Fences is a metaphor of the way Troy Maxson was living his life , on the other side of the fence of everybody he knew and made him a loner. Prepared to be glued to your screen about this fascinating gripping story in the backdrop of the 1950's ."
FENCES,3 May 2017,8/10,"This is an extremely good movie. The only problem I had with it was that (whoever wrote it) had Denzel speaking in patois, which my old- fart ears has a hard tome keeping up with, so I missed probably 1/2 of what he was saying. Other than that, I would have to say that this is a movie worth seeing. If you have a teenager than you'll have learned to keep up with the speech. LOL"
FENCES,4 January 2017,10/10,"The number of years encapsulated in this film is dealt out so delicately you barely realize how much time is passing by because the story is so well told.As it should be. When so many films are made relying heavily on computer graphics and animation to make something out of nothing, this film shows that even within a relatively small setting, a home, there is more than enough going on even in a single day to keep any eager eyes and ears busy. This film made me feel as if I were viewing the character's most private moments as a grandchild or great-grandchild who had been allowed to look back on them through a time machine. Well done."
FENCES,21 September 2017,10/10,"The acting in this play adaptation is mesmerizing. It is a story in feel and telling like other great play adaptations; Streetcar, Death of a Salesman, 12 Angry Men. Viola Davis gave one of the great performances by an actor that I have seen, her facial expressions were stunning and her tears were heart breaking."
FENCES,27 June 2018,8/10,"This movie is about relationship questions, the drama lived by a familly in USA in 50's. It has a excellent acting, good script, and characters that you can identify your self or your famillly members."
FENCES,12 March 2017,3/10,"This movie was very disappointing. It's Academy Awards wins pumped it up to be more than it really was and the Red Carpet reviews among fellow actors/actresses pumped it up even more than it's value, if that value was to be judged solely by it's Oscar nominations alone.The screenplay adaptation was just plain awful! It felt more like a very long cold-read at a very bad audition. It's no wonder ""Manchester by the Sea"" beat it at the Academy Awards. And, rightly so.It was basically 2 whole hours of pretty much non-stop monotonous dialogue to set up a 10-minute ""cheating man"" montage, followed by another 10 minutes of the only part of the movie worth seeing — the funeral scene, which was the only part of the movie that didn't have Denzel Washington showing off a showcase of monologues calling himself, his family, his friends and just about every other black person in existence, the ""N"" word."
FENCES,20 February 2017,2/10,"I love both Denzel Washington and Viola Davis and was so excited to see this film but 30 minutes in, I was really concerned that this was going nowhere fast. Davis' performance is the only thing that got me through the entire movie but it was not easy. It was long and drawn out with no real point at all. Oh my gosh, it was painful. And the ending! Ugh. There was no story to be told here."
FENCES,21 October 2019,6/10,"Great performances all around, and a really solid story - but this still feels like a high budget made-for-TV film. Not bad, but in the hands of a more visually interesting director, could have been loads better."
FENCES,14 May 2017,2/10,"Another totally believable, full of life's problems, the motion picture. At this pluses end. Watch it do not recommend, despite the fact that she won so many awards and nominated for an Oscar. There was a time when she was relevant and a good play, but it is in the past. Therefore will briefly describe the plot, so you do not waste time. 50 years in America, racism is still alive, when the black is allowed to be a garbage man, but not the driver of the garbage truck. The story tells about the life of Troy, a black man over forty, who is barely making ends meet to feed his family consisting of his wife and son. Yet Troy has a son from a previous marriage, who sometimes visited by the father with the intent to ask for money. Troy is unhappy with her sons, constantly teaches their lives, for good or bad. In my opinion, he is a bad father. He has no emotional warmth and love to their children. Troy from the category of people that think: if I conceived my son, I already gave him a lot. But if I still and contained, then I the Holy Martyr. In the end, he gets the response ratio of children to himself. This asshole instead of having to take care of his family and buy a home the television, gets a mistress, explaining that he saw this as another chance in life. The Troy family is falling apart, the wife was very hurt, son despises. And what Troy was waiting for? Applause? The mistress dies in childbirth, leaving Troy's daughter. Troy never shows his feelings, keeping it to himself. But what's inside it can't be called good, it's more like constant anger and resentment. In the end, the newborn daughter he hangs on the shoulders of his wife. His wife is the most positive image of this picture. Why the fence? Troy very long built for his wife the fence near the house and eventually built it. One sees that the fence symbolizes protection from death Troy. She didn't protect, because at the end of the film Troy died. One sees that the fence symbolizes the removal of Troy from his son and wife. Someone ViDi, this fence symbolizes that Troy's wife is able to protect from the ills of life for his family. I think all these versions are nonsense."
FENCES,28 October 2018,9/10,"I've had a rough childhood. experienced all the ups and downs that can ever happen to anyone and I would never forget that one time when I was on a bus with my dad goin back home on a four hour trip . Inwas just 13 and it wasnthe first time I see him tear up . he always made us feel secure . but I knew that he wasbfed up with this life that he slipped a tear .
This movie reminded me of all those memories . and being a dad myself now it really touched my heart. and made me wanna see my wife and son, hug them and tell them how much I love them . this is a must see for all them dad's out there struggling with life!"
FENCES,8 January 2017,1/10,"This film is so boring. Love denzel washington but this as got his worst film. Great acting as usual but the film is boring, defo not a 7.8 rating. A lot of fast talking and shouting but thats about as good as it gets #yawn. If you stay awake alway through this movie you deserve a medal. I don't recommend it to anyone. Probably the worst movie i have ever seen which is ashame really because i do love denzel Washington. If you do want to see it i would wait until it comes out on netflix or sky movies. Don't waste your money at the cinema you will probably be disappointed. The movie takes part mainly in his house and back garden."
FENCES,25 February 2017,8/10,"I think the most beautiful thing in this movie is the performance acting for all cast especially Viola Davis, Denzel Washington and Stephen Henderson and I can say firmly that Viola Davis deserved Oscar nomination and worthy of the award well-deserved also Denzel Washington was able to make me hate Troy Maxson character and sympathize with his family so that suffer because of him which means success dramatically in his the performance about the movie the Dialogue was very high-class with a lot of beautiful meanings especially in the first ten minutes of the movie, which deals with the life of Troy.although my enjoyment of the movie but I found it a bit long and not delightfully and I can not watch it again in the near term, also I felt it had a lot of content in Depression, which certainly reflected the your mood after watching the movie. in short, I loved performance acting and I'm not hope to see this movie again in the near term."
FENCES,19 January 2017,10/10,"Not just Denzel, each and every one of the actors in this film is so incredibly beautiful in this movie. I find it a piece of music. The first long dialogue, I had a smile from ear to ear. It has been quit some time since I have seen a movie in which the roles are really leading and in which acting is so convincing and melodious as in this film. Amazing, honest, complex, simple and ugly too, somewhat at the same time; a total beauty. I am native Dutch, I know a lot more words in my country with which I could give more nuance to my blessing to this movie. Denzel, also as the director: what a masterpiece. Thank you all."
FENCES,6 December 2019,7/10,"Based on August Wilson's 1986 play Fences is an intriguing drama that portrays the life of an African American family living in the 1950's. This film was directed and produced by Denzel Washignton, who also happens to star as the lead role. While this movie does deliver some outstanding performances by its actors and is a refreshing break from all of the superhero films hollywood is currently pumping out, I believe that it will leave the viewer wanting more.The movie follows the life of Troy Maxson(Denzel Washington) who is a sanitation worker married to Rose (Viola Davis). He has a kid from a previous relationship, Lyons (Russell harnsby), and one kid with Rose: Cory (Jovan Adepo). The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother Gabriel and Stephen Mckinely Henderson who plays Troy's best friend Jim Bono.Troy is a former baseball player, who spends most of the movie mourning the baseball career he could have had, but was prevented from having because of his race. He believes that Cory should stop playing football because a majority white society would never let a black man become successful in sports despite their skill level. Troy creates Tension when he prevents Cory from meeting with a recruiter for a college team. When Rose tells Troy about the recruiter, he just shrugs it off saying, ""It ain't going to get him nowhere"". When Cory confronts Troy about calling off the recruiter, Troy says, ""Like you? What law is there to say I got to like you?"", in response to Cory asking Troy why he doesn't like him.The character of Troy Maxson is a selfish, foul-mouthed, drunk, that cares little for the feelings of the people around them, and doesn't realize how his actions hurt them. This is displayed even further when it is revealed that Troy has impregnated another woman. Rose is completely heartbroken by this; later on when the baby's mother dies during childbirth, Troy comes to Rose asking for Rose to help raise the child. Rose, being the compassionate individual she is, says yes but puts Troy in his place telling him ""From right now this child got a mother, but you a womanless man"". We also find out later in the movie that Troy checked Gabe into the hospital, just so that he can receive a cut of his brother's checks. Even though he protested institutionalizing Gabe earlier in the film.Despite Troy being a despicable human, Denzel Washington's portrayal of him is absolutely stellar and when this amazing performance is paired with the acting skills of Viola Davis it makes for some great scenes. Rose is one of the most caring characters I have ever seen and Viola Davis plays her perfectly.The main gripe I have with this film is that it does not adhere to the conventions of basic storytelling. There is no real conflict and resolution, or protagonist and antagonist. The closest thing there is to an antagonist is Troy Maxson, and he's the main character. There is no one to root for so in the end you will be left feeling unfulfilled.For everyone that is a fan of the book fences this movie is perfect for you. This is by far the most accurate adaptation of literature into film. Only minor changes were made, but these changes are necessary to make the film more enjoyable. One example of this is when we see Troy in the hospital feeding Gabriel, without this scene Troy will be almost unredeemable and it would be hard to forgive him in the end.If you liked Denzel Washington in Flight or Remember the Titans than this movie is for you. Denzel pulled off another stellar performance that is on par with the other great movies he has starred in. Overall I will give this movie 3.5/5 stars. The acting is great, but the plot feels almost nonexistent.

FENCES,24 February 2017,6/10,"Their is a reason why the Oscars has an award for best adapted screenplay. Adapting a story from one piece of media to the next is an art in it of itself. The writer has to take the story, that was based around the limitations of the media it told, and put it in a new media that different set of challenges. What happens if the writer simply copies word by word from one platform to the next, you get Fences. The main problem with fences is that there is just there is just too much information being told per scene. Characters have so much dialogue that it is hard to keep up with the story. Audiences will get so overwhelmed by the dialogue, that they're bound to miss some information and that information can be important to the plot.This will might cause confusion. The play can get with all this because the actors are speaking directly to the audience and the audience is actually seeing the actors. This means that audience will have a better sense of the emotional context of the story and dialogue, but in a movie that context is lost by the fact that they're staring at a screen. This is too bad because everything else in movie is fantastic. This movie has some of the best acting I have scene in cinema. The set design really makes audiences feel a sense of lost hope. Even objects have character based on what they represent on the story. The movie seems to love symbolism and it is certainly powerful.I just wish their were more setting in this movie. The majority of the movie only takes place in one house. That can get boring because while the set is interesting it is only one set, and that can lose its charm. If you like great acting and willing to put up paragraphs of dialogue then see this movie, but if can't put up the long,unnatural ,and fast dialogue with less than four setting then don't see this move."
FENCES,17 July 2017,1/10,Denzel hardly took a breath in the first 15-20 minutes of this movie...non-stop talking bull. It was so irritating I turned it off. No clue how this one had such good reviews. Zookeeper's Wife 10x better. I need five lines for this review to be submitted-great rule. No wonder people write so much.
FENCES,2 January 2017,9/10,This film is astonishing. The actors are very realistic and Rose is a very good dramatic actress. I mean all of the actors and actresses are very good at their art but Viola is a great technical actress. Denzel Washington is one of the best directors that is both on screen and off screen. If you are out to find a movie to learn technique from this is definitely an A+ movie to watch. You will defiantly have a blast watching this film. Troy or Denzel Washington had a great way to put this true story on the big screen. I give him major props for directing and being in the film. If any movie shows the cons of having to grow up quickly this is definitely the movie you can learn real life problems. MUST WATCH MOVIE!
FENCES,2 January 2017,7/10,"The cast of the movie is great from bottom to--almost the top. Viola Davis is her usual amazing self, Stephen Henderson is terrific as Jim Bono. Watch his facial expressions and the work he does when he's not the focus of the camera shot. I just didn't buy Denzel Washington as this character. Perhaps the lead role/director combo made a difference, but I felt a lot of the depth of the character could have been better explored on film. That said, the movie is a very interesting look into the changing world of the 1950s, even for those who didn't think their world was changing fast enough. It is possible to hear the ""live stage"" flow of the language, which can bog it down a bit, but the foibles are far outweighed by strong performances and a captivating story."
FENCES,26 December 2016,7/10,"This is an adult themed movie. Took our 16 year old and she was bored 1/2 the time and she likes dramas. My wife and I enjoyed it but felt the movie could have had the same impact if it were 25 minutes shorter. I felt that the acting was excellent, only a couple of moments I felt Denzel went over the top, but not enough to lose the point he was trying to make. It's one of those movies that I probably could have waited to watch at home, but was still a good date movie, if you've been married or in a relationship for years. The movie takes place in the 50's and It definitely felt that way throughout the movie. There are times when the use if the ""N"" word is frequently used, but it is not too excessive as it fits to the characters. I would recommend it, if you enjoy movies that involve coping with the racial issues of the 50's."
FENCES,12 January 2017,10/10,"In addition to the acting, the overall production is seamless. Each scene fits well with the previous one even though one scene may be emotional and then the next scene it is subdued. As I watched this, I thought of how it accurately depicted real life and circumstances I have faced in the past.  The film was true to how day to day life works.  Washington was so fully into this character that I really had a hard time imagining him being a different person in real life. With some actors, you remember their celebrity status when you see them on screen, and therefore have a hard time really believing their character. I enjoyed the movie a lot, this was one of the movies where people in the theater applauded at the conclusion, and rightfully so."
FENCES,27 December 2016,1/10,"This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not sure who thought it would be a good idea to take this play and turn it into a movie, but they were wrong. There really was no story, no change of scenery and no message. This movie simply invites you into the lives of 5 miserable people living depressing, miserable lives. Who wants to watch that? Yes the actors were believable and did a good job portraying their characters, but that was the only redeeming thing about this film. I left feeling uninspired, bored and drained of all happiness. I truly would have preferred to sit and look at a blank screen for 2 hours then to have to watch this. Do yourself a favor and go see ANYTHING else."
FENCES,28 December 2016,1/10,"I saw this movie with my husband, his uncle, and cousin. All 4 of us hated it. People in the theater were literally saying how bad it was. I didn't think it would ever end. The man next to my husband snored loudly for about 2/3 of the movie. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. I don't like action movies or anything like that, but dear god couldn't ANYTHING have happened during the nearly 2 and a half hours it took this movie to end?! Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Also, disregard the good reviews for this movie. It was obviously just nomination hunting. Over the top acting, and no real plot. Omg I just can't even handle how bad it was. omg"
FENCES,30 December 2016,1/10,"This movie was boring, drawn out, slow, and overall terrible! Half way through I was wondering about the point of the movie and where the movie was headed. By the end I realized it was pointless and went nowhere, it was an absolute waste of nearly three hours. I have no idea how it has got any positive feedback. Every single person in the theater was saying how awful it was. If I wasn't full of coffee and soda I would have been snoring. There was non-stop dialogue. The only reason people could be attracted to this movie is because of Denzel but he clearly is not a ""director"". It was full of stereotypical dialogue and behavior. I do not understand why an African American would volunteer to represent such despicable behavior depicted in this film. Save your money."
FENCES,9 January 2017,10/10,"Great movie! Dialogs too long sometimes. In my opinion it was a taker (Troy Maxson) vs a giver (Rose). While the movie is ""all"" about Troy, the best part of it (in my opinion) is the dialog between Toy and Rose after a moment that many marriages go through: ""What about my dreams!"" Rose said to Troy. That is the line that is the key of the movie for me.Troy is the kind of ""man"" that says :Do as I say not as I do"" when it comes to be the man to a woman.A lesson from the 50's but as old as the world and as new as the 21st century.Great movie but not for everybody.Can't wait for the Blue-ray, I'll go to watch it this week again!"
FENCES,28 January 2017,3/10,"Terrible story line....changed out of nowhere and took me by surprise. Quickly it became a fast moving locomotive veering off the right track. The best acting I've seen though. However, the movie exaggerates and highlights the union of the wounded soul of many black men, and, the broken spirit of many black women, of which, was more prevalent throughout that era and the previous. The result is broken children forever struggling to know what true love is, and the meaning of true self respect. With so many good reviews, it is very interesting to see how people are dismissive and/or disregard the immorality of Denzel's character, especially in light of how he is seen for the first half of the movie to be seemingly in love with his wife. Almost as if he was bi- polar, his attitude in regards to his position in the family and responsibility seemed to have vanished. Actually, it was the bi-polar script which really was just not good, in my opinion. However, an Oscar and Emmy award are due to Denzel and Viola."
FENCES,30 January 2017,1/10,"Where to start ? Let's see the acting is terrible, plot is terrible, directing is terrible and cinematography terrible. With Viola Davis & Denzel Washington- this should have been better. What happened - ? First movie in quite a while that I was tempted to cut my losses and leave. I kept thinking this has to get better - possibly there is a point to the movie ?? Can't imagine anyone providing positive feedback, let alone actually enjoying this film. I am not the only one as the local theaters have it down to one showing per day. Should have built a FENCE around the theater to keep everyone away. Alas, save your money to watch another movie..."
FENCES,13 February 2017,10/10,"The movie is a well done filmed play. It is about the human struggle to find beauty or reason in the human's limitations: mistakes, society's barriers, emotional weaknesses... The characters are far away from their great moments of their past that brought them only spiritual glory and no material support. It is called Fences but it contains only one material fence which is an extraordinary metaphor of how hard it is to isolate your self from your human nature(it can be interpreted in many other ways). The other fences, the immaterial ones, are the ones built in the people's mind. I believe this is the goal of the story; to prove how easy a human builds useless fences and how hard it is to isolate yourself from your weaknesses. There is also an interesting approach about the perspective of future reflected in the mind of the characters, but I will let you discover this one. However the story brings up a lot of things to think about."
FENCES,23 February 2017,8/10,"Fences is very realistic. However there are a number of glaring errors that must be addressed. First and foremost is the lengthy scene where Rose confronts Troy over his infidelity in the backyard. No one and I do mean no one would discuss such intensely private matters out in the semi-public space of their back yard but only inside behind closed doors. Second there were never any neighbors on the porches or in the yards of nearby houses. This is just not true to life. Also the painted backdrop of the city skyline of Pittsburgh was clearly not a photo but a painting. Furthermore it was ludicrous to have only two smokestacks spouting smoke on the horizon. In those days in the ""Steel City"" as Pittsburgh was known once, there would have been scores of steel mills running full blast and smoke pouring from their chimneys causing smog all over the city. Another major quibble is the fact that Troy did not have a blood test done to determine if the baby whose mother was the ""wild woman"" he had been ""messing with"" was actually his or another man's. In real life of course that would have been first before he agreed to take the baby and raise her. Another minor thing was the fact that the wooden fence was only completed on one side of the house lot back yard instead of the three open sides as Troy kept saying he was going to do. This was barely 1/3rd of the projected project completed. Last, the two pictures by the kitchen door of JFK and MLK were not true to life. Their pictures would have been hung in a place of honor in the living room as they were in hundreds of thousands of Black homes across America. These issues aside it was a very well done movie, well acted and well written. We need more true to life stories like this instead of all the junk that is in the movie theaters nowadays."
FENCES,5 March 2017,2/10,"We have only ever got up a walked out of one movie before (that was ""Joan of Arc"" years ago) But 15 minutes into this one, and almost all of that being an unconvincing monologue from Denzil, I checked with my wife and she was relieved to hear me ask ""shall we leave?"" We went to the next screen and enjoyed the excellent ""United Kingdom"". The afternoon of movie going was spectacularly rescued!"
FENCES,22 March 2018,4/10,I gave it 4 stars and it was just because the increedible vioa davisI think this movie worths it just to see it once
FENCES,1 April 2017,9/10,"Denzel Washington and Viola Davis deserved co-Best Actor Awards for Wilson's 21st Century companion piece to Miller's Death of a Salesman. Troy and Willy are counterparts, both hoping for good results from bad practices; both flawed, but trying to love in their broken, misguided ways; both irreparably flawed, but going down fighting. Viola Davis is magnificent in her role as Rose, a woman who chooses again and again to sacrificially love, and yet to stand strong and beautiful in her suffering. She sees what no one else, except perhaps Troy's best friend Bono (Stephen Henderson) sees, and she chooses over and over to do the ""right"" or righteous thing. The story is as much about her, a magnificent human being, nearly perfect in her ways, who maintains her dignity, who earns the respect of her children, and who wears a cross around her neck without hypocrisy. Mykelti Williamson's portrayal of Gabriel was excellent. He plays the role of the blind prophet, the wise fool, the unknowing fortune teller with an accuracy and a sweetness that at times nearly steals the scenes in which he plays. The partial shot of him, sitting with his back to the camera, saying, ""I'm ready for my sandwich now!"" is both comical and moving. When he stands between Troy and Rose after Troy reveals his infidelity, his presence creates a gut-wrenching fugue of dissonance that deepens Rose's agony, and silences Troy's excuses. Williams becomes Gabriel. The ending, though a little ""out there"" is touching to the point of astounding as Gabriel's horn finally reaches the heavens. I loved this movie, and I cried with Cory (Jovan Adepo), as he struggled with the inner demons who were driving him to hate his father in the same way his father hated his father. I found hope in this story, and grace, and mercy. Oh! Troy and Rose's backyard, unlike the Loman backyard, was growing plants, and by the end of the story, even a rose bush was blooming. August Wilson's hopeful symbolism profoundly touched me, and gave me hope. Highly Recommended."
FENCES,17 March 2019,1/10,"I have sat through 1 hour 35 mins of this film and despite the fact that I hate giving up on films, I really couldn't stand any more!!I felt that I just wanted to punch the unbearably loud, aggressive, self-centred character that Denzil Washington plays!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY OR ENERGY ON THIS...."
FENCES,6 December 2019,8/10,"*This review may contain spoilers*
Fences is a phenomenal movie with a cast of very strong actors. Denzel Washington who directs and plays Troy Maxson along with Viola Davis outdid themselves in these roles. They were able to bring out the best of the book onto the silver screen.
The movie follows Troy Maxson a 50 something year old african american man, who struggles to provide for his family, and all of the injustice he receives from a young age.
After Troy commits a serious mistake we start to see his family life tumble, and we start to see an end to his familial and friendship relationships.
Rose (Troy's Wife) who was played by Viola Davis plays such an iconic role in this play. Her most iconic line in the movie was ""From right now...this child got a mother. But you a womanless man"", this line is able to showcase the strength that the character Rose contains. Viola Davis was able to act this line flawlessly and show that the piece of hope Rose had, had vanished. Viola Davis was able to display Rose's character with such intense emotion that I couldn't help but get sucked into the movie, her acting was able to really grasp my attention.
Something I felt that was a bit odd in the movie even though it was a minor detail,was that Troy said that the fence was done towards the end of thge movie, if you really focus is the background you can see that it is not done. So the significance the fence played in the movie was thrown off. The fence was meant to display that Troy wasn't able to keep death out of his yard, and once the fence was finished that death would only come after him, which is why he finally able to die. But in the movie at the end if it when Bono tells Troy that he finally bought Lucille her fridge, we can see that the fence really wasn't finished.
Another iconic part in the movie was when Gabe(Troys' brother) played by Mykelti Williamson says "" Hey Rose. It's time. It's time to tell St. Peter to open the gates. Troy, you ready? I'm gonna tell St. Peter to open the gates. You get ready now."" and then he blows his trumpet with the mouthpiece missing. Even though the trumpet shouldn't be able to make any noise, once the gates of heaven are ""opened"", the trumpet is able to make a sound without the mouthpiece. This signifies that Troy was able to go to heaven despite all of his mistakes his ""sins"".
These ""sins"" played a part in getting the message of the book across to the readers and society as a whole. These sins that burdened Cory should not have burdened him in the first place, as what Troy experienced didn't necessarily mean that Cory was going to or had to go through the same things Troy did. A parent's ""sins"" shouldn't be passed onto their children, the racism that Troy faced didn't mean that Cory was also going to face a huge bout of racism too. This is the significance of this movie that what a parent experiences shouldn't hold back your loved ones because of fear, this something that today's society has to hear as most parents will push this fear onto their offspring..
Also considering Fences isn't part of a mainstream series, it did pretty well, but Fences compared to the box office hit of today ""Infinity War"", did poorly. Fences was only able to make 3 times of what was used in the budget, meanwhile Infinity War was able to rake in about 6 times that amount.
All in all, this is an excellent adaptation of the book, as it stayed very true to to it. This movie is highly recommended."
FENCES,2 May 2017,1/10,"I totally agree with some of the previous comments, 2h of watching a self-centered man being insufferable to everyone around him in his backyard. Only the character of the wife (Viola Davis) makes the movie remotely interesting.I particularly disliked the moment when Troy (Denzel Washington) talks to his nephew about how hard life was for him and that he should be grateful for what he's got in a moralizing way. A speech as empty as it was cringey."
FENCES,5 June 2017,2/10,"This movie is very slow moving, boring, nearly pointless, and is painfully low budget with the exception of Denzel Washington's fees. From start to finish we just kept waiting for a story to unravel, but it's like nothing happens. 99% of the scenes take place at their run down house, and most of the time Denzel Washington acts like a bitter racist jerk, he dies, and then it ends. There's just not enough content to justify a movie here. What content there was is on the depressing and disturbing side. Not much of interest takes place, nothing uplifting or inspirational, it's not complex, or entertaining to follow. It just plods along, then ends. It was reasonably well acted, but there's just not enough substance to go around. The leading lady did a fine job with what she was given, but isn't attractive enough to add appeal given the lack of content. It's a boring, slow, uninteresting movie that I felt was pretty much a waste of two hours."
FENCES,7 July 2017,1/10,"I love heartfelt type flicks, & I guess this was one of those (I guess????). But what a looong drawn out, gets nowhere, waste of time. People got paid to make this film?? And other people liked it to the point of it being up for awards??? That must've been some kind of Kool-aid. *This is the first movie review I've ever written, publicly, and I just felt so compelled to make an account on here & say my piece, because it was really that bad. Sorry."
FENCES,8 March 2017,8/10,"It's really very well scripted movie with a fantastic performances by the lead actors Denzel,Viola and Troy's brother's role played by Mykelti just complements the movie with a nice touch at the end. one of my favorite actors Denzel and am glad that his own direction as well. Bravo!!"
FENCES,15 December 2017,8/10,This movie really hit so many points that I can identify with without exaggeration. I appreciate the honesty the actors brought to their characters.
FENCES,3 January 2018,5/10,"I wouldn't recommend this film. There's just no plot at all, even though the acting is phenomenal. Call me odd, but I think there ought to be a moral or lesson to be learnt from films, and the only thing I learnt from Fences is that abysmal screenwriting can be rescued by exceptional actors. (Well, just about.) The first hour of the movie features a drunken Denzel Washington staggering around his house, talking. At first, I tried to figure out how his outbursts might be significant to the plot, but before long I realised that Troy just liked the sound of his own voice. Needless to say, I was bored. In between wanting to become a truck-driver, and selling furniture to Satan, Troy cheats on his wife and then things get a bit more interesting. Mostly because of Viola Davis' brilliant performance, but also because Troy dies and we don't have to deal with his monologue-ing anymore.Overall, it's noisy, talkative, and rather pointless. Go watch something else."
FENCES,1 October 2018,1/10,This is not film! This is just recorded theatre!If you want to sit through a play with non existent cinematography watch this. But if you want to see a film don't watch this because this has zero cinematography foundations.
FENCES,2 October 2018,10/10,"I have nothing but praise: yes it was a long one, but that's a good thing, when the quality is as high as this, and the story so compelling. To me, the movie was everything it said it was! Even though some people that praised the movie, found the main character unlikeable, i felt drawn in from the start. The acting is remarkable, and especially the main characters shine, through Denzel and Viola. Of course the focus is on them, but to me it was magnificent. It's quite rare for me to 'forget' i am watching a movie, especially when watching a drama, but that is what happened here. When the movie was done, i immediately felt compelled to check the IMDB rating, and see if others were as impressed. Then seeing those amazingly bad reviews, which to my knowledge have no merit at all, i felt it my duty to make an account, and post a sincere review. If not to counter some of the in my opinion ridiculously bad reviews, at least to up the rating a bit, to reflect a score it actually deserves...So if your looking for drama, great acting and a compelling story, packed in a 'slice of life' type of experience, then please do yourself a favor, and watch this movie. Completely Oscar-worthy."
FENCES,3 October 2018,3/10,"Great act work, but so damn boring. Endless scenes, and the entire film is being anected at one place."
FENCES,23 October 2018,1/10,How is it possible that this movie had a $24 million dollar budget?
FENCES,6 December 2019,8/10,"If not exposed to much literature, many will be oblivious to ever knowing how the movie ""Fences"" came to be. A play by August Wilson became a piece of literature that is good enough to be taught in schools. However, those who have had the luxury of reading August Wilson's work may fail to see the truth behind it without seeing the movie as well.
As I read the play, I was enveloped with immense boredom and confusion. It was hard for me to interpret what Wilson was trying to convey. I frequently found myself looking over much of the play, missing the little things that in the end made a world of difference. I didn't understand the deeper implications of lines like ""You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child,"" ""You're living with a full count. Don't you strike out,"" and the song about the dog named Blue.
""Fences"" was first brought to life as a play. From there it took off, eventually becoming a movie. Unlike when I was reading, I became infatuated with the going ons of the movie as I watched. Instead of looking over what was happening, I was zeroing in on it, taking it for what it was meant to be. Lines like ""Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner"" and ""Some build fences to keep people out. Others, to keep us in"" started to resonate.
Actors like Denzel Washington (Troy Maxson), Viola Davis (Rose Maxson), Jovan Adepo (Cory), and Mykelti Williamson (Gabe) make the movie more enjoyable. The way they are able to portray their characters drove the movie by leaps and bounds. I was able to feel the pain and betrayal Rose felt. I was able to see the difficulties Cory went through. I was able to see the true depth behind Gabe's mental state. I was able to hate Troy. It was through the direction of Denzel Washington and the amazing actors in this movie that this was possible. As the movie played out, I noticed slight differences from the play. As the director, Washington must have done them purposely. For example, Troy making Cory put on his helmet when having a conversation about how many strikes he has, Rose telling Troy about Alberta and the baby in the bedroom rather than in the yard, and showing Troy visiting Gabe in the hospital. I asked myself why did he decide to do this? By doing all of this, Denzel emphasized these scenes, making me look deeper into them.
I've always been the type of person to take in account the title of a piece of literature as I read. Constantly asking myself why this title? Why is it significant? The most important part of this whole endeavor was, in the end, being able to interpret the meaning of the fence throughout the story. When Cory says, ""Tell Mama I'll be back for my things"" and Troy responds with, ""They'll be on the other side of the fence"" was the moment I realized its truth.
""Fences"" gives an inside look into the world of an African American family and strived to bring out the point that like any other family, we want to protect our own. Like many movies today featuring a predominantly African American cast, ""Fences"" did extremely well in the box office. When compared to recent movies, the conflicts discussed in ""Fences"" are quite different, but still relevant. If it weren't for the movie, I may have never been able to look back and enjoy the play.af6."
