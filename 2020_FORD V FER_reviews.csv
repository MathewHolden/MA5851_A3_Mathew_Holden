FORD V FERRARI,8 May 2020,6/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a film that has a very high overall score of 8.1...meaning that folks love the movie. As for me, I don't share this same level of enthusiasm. To me, it's an okay film with some nice driving sequences. I prefer films like ""Le Mans"" or ""Grand Prix""...mostly because the ending isn't as obvious and fore-ordained. In other words, if you know about the history of the famed Ford GT, you KNOW how well it did in the race that takes up almost half of this film. Still, the driving sequences are nice (not done with CGI) and the actors try their best....although the script occasionally (or more than occasionally) plays fast and loose with a few of the facts. Overall, very watchable but not a great history lesson and a film where you KNOW that the GT will eventually prove better than the Ferrari...otherwise, what would be the point of this film?!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,9/10,"After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10"
FORD V FERRARI,3 October 2020,6/10,"FORD V FERRARI wasn't exactly a film which the prospect of watching filled me with joy; I'm no sports fan in general and motor racing films generally leave me cold. Still, this one works well thanks to the quality pairing of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who immediately establish a strong rapport which holds the movie together. I wasn't sure about Bale's accent as it veers a little too close to caricature for me, but he does win you over with his exuberance and charisma here so it's all okay. The rest takes the form of a traditional biopic with the expected white-knuckle racing sequences, which look a little too CGI-ey at times for me, but otherwise this works well."
FORD V FERRARI,24 February 2020,8/10,Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie.
FORD V FERRARI,29 August 2020,,"I love Christian Bale. For each of his roles. But , in this case, I adore him. Because he is real great. Because the""chemistry "" between him and Matt Damon is perfect. But the film gives more . An admirable portrait of Enzo Ferrari by Remo Girone,fine job of Noah Jupe , Tracy Letts proposing a great Henry Ford II and each scene being admirable crafted. A film about race, family and passion. A special one, in high measure, in profound sense."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,6/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a new American/French co-production that is mostly in the English language and this could be one of the big players this award season. The director is James Mangold and with ""Walk the Line"" being a personal favorite (also because of the subject) and ""Logan"" that I also really enjoyed, I was definitely looking forward to his newest project. Mangold was not part of the writing team here this time, but it was nonetheless three people, namely the Butterworth Brothers and Jason Keller. But while none of them are rookies amymore, the only really experienced one here is the older Butterworth. Still looking at the film's massive running time of 2.5 hours, slightly over even, it is not too surprising that there are three writers credited. Must have been a really long script. Now as for the cast, it is basically two names only: Oscar winners Christian Bale and Matt Damon. There are experienced supporting actors in here too and you will maybe recognize their faces such as Bernthal, McKinnon or Letts (plus surprisingly familiar faces from NCIS and Prettly Little Liars in minor roles), but nobody comes remotely close to the star potential of the two in the lead. But they are both Team Ford here and not one of them Ferrari as you could have guessed from the title. Now this is major car racing movie, perhaps the biggest since Rush from over half a decade ago and if you liked that one, then probably you will like this one here as well. However, we are not inside Formula One this time, but instead the focus is on a competitive racing occasion mostly that is probably more famous in the United States and less famous here in Germany. I am talking about Le Mans or (if you want the long version) the 24 Hours of Le Mans, even if there are references to other races too like the one Bale's character needs to win in order to be allowed into Le Mans by Mr. Ford.So the movie is packed with racing references. However, there are other subjects too like family life, company policies and also the fact that riding sports cars will always be linked very closely to danger, maybe life-threatening danger even. Well certainly the latter. Even today, it is a dangerous sport and back then, it was even more the case. There is that memorable reference on several occasions that as long as you are getting out of the car you are fine. Otherwise... But lets not include further spoilers. Let me just say that the film of course stayed close to reality, so they had to include these developments at the end and certain other parts as well, even if a lot in here was fictitious and added for drama purposes. Which is okay. I knew I was not watching a documentary. For example, while Leo Beebe is not fictitious, but also based on a real person, I genuinely wonder how much about him in here was actually exactly like they showed it. If I was from his family, I probably would not be too happy about the way they depicted things. Aside from that, I thought it was slightly shallow and not too inspired how they depicted him as the antagonist, also with his sucking-up to Mr. Ford for example. The idea behind how he manages to ""steal"" Bale's character his glory was good though and nice not to have a really happy ending.Now let me also add a few words on the two central characters: As for acting and depth, it is really all about Bale, much more than about Damon. We do not even find out about Damon's family backgrounds and really the only thing we do find out about his background is very early on that he was a successful driver as well, but had to end his career because of health concerns and went into engineering then. And all his baitier scenes are basically also empowered by other characters like the carte blanche moment. It's not a too well-written character and I don't think Damon will get a lot of awards recognition here. If any at all. As for Bale, he may get more because he definitely has the better material and there is no denying he is also the more gifted actor. However, he is as always walking the fine line between really going all in and creating something great and going over-the-top and maybe for his character here he tried to make him too special. But maybe it was just my perception. Or the writing. For example when they are telling the guy about how it is not against the rules to change the brakes, it was a bit painful to watch how Bale was acting in that scene. But he has good moments too no denying and I don't think many actors would have played the part better. Still I did not find him (or Damon's character) as likable as they wanted me to.So all in all, I enjoyed the watch here. The film does not get close to Mangold's (what I mentioned early on), Bale's or Damon's best, but this is just because their best is so amazing and not because this one here would be bad or anything. On the contrary. It is fairly decent and felt shorter than 150 minutes. I give this film a thumbs-up, albeit not a 100% enthusiastic one. Go watch if you like the subject or either of the two lead actors or both would be even better. I am writing this as somebody who does not care too much about racing anymore and never cared about Le Mans, so you definitely don't have to in order to appreciate this film. It has from beginning to end some really nice attention to detail (just wanna mention one scene near the end when Mr. Ferrari briefly pays his respect to Bale's character and there are many other scenes, also slight fun moments like the stopwatch etc.) that makes it certainly worth checking out. Go for it."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,6/10,"Ford v Ferrari sees Christian Bale channeling his inner Nigel Mansell. He plays the racer Ken Mills, a war hero from Sutton Coldfield who became a maverick race driver for the fledgeling Ford racing team.Mills is recruited by former racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who has been hired by the Ford Motor Company to turn around the company's fortunes by making their cars look hip. To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Of course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here. The racing division is championed by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) but the fly in the ointment is Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) a square peg in a round hole.In their sights is Ferrari, who themselves are struggling financially and have the temerity to object to being bought out by Ford. In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.Ford v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well. I did find the portrayal of Beebe as the token villain to be facile. He was there to give the film unnecessary tension.The best performance is from Bale who leaves Damon behind."
FORD V FERRARI,15 June 2020,8/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is an engaging action film based on a true story, when the American manufacturer Ford decided to build the racing car Ford GT40 to defeat the Italian Ferrari at the ""24 Hours of Le Mans"" in 1966. The plot is dramatic, funny, highly entertaining and not historically accurate (in accordance with those that are fans of car racing), with Matt Damon and the magnificent Christian Bale in the lead roles. But the film never disappoints the fans of a great action film.Christian Bale was nominated in the Golden Globe in the category Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama and ""Ford v Ferrari"" was Oscar Winner in the Best Achievement in Film Editing and Sound Editing and nominated to the Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Mixing. These awards and nominations would suffice to indicate how good this film is and the viewer does not need to be a car racing fan to like and enjoy it. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ford vs Ferrari"" (""Ford v Ferrari"")"
FORD V FERRARI,16 August 2020,,"For its stars, significant budget, and historical basis, Le Mans '66 is essentially a sports genre film that does more or less what you expect. This is not a criticism of it, but I admit approaching it thinking it would be a much stronger film that it was (in certain areas), although I still found it very entertaining. The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by former driver Shelby and his 'difficult' British driver Miles, who are dispatched by Ford Motor Company to build the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.In terms of drama, it is solidly constructed, but it is a bit practical and direct in what it is doing. The talented cast help the characters and scenes come to life more than they could have done, and generally they do more than enough to keep the viewer engaged and entertained between what are the main selling points of the film - the sports action. The races are excellent in how they are delivered and how they translate the tension and experience to the audience - I've gone off motor racing over the years but was easily into this as it played out. The dedicated to detail and correctness in the main events of the story telling also help, and it feels like a satisfyingly solid film. The production design adds immensely to the quality feel of the film - the sense of period and place is there in all the detail.It should be approached as a sports genre film, because that is what it is, but it is a very strong and well-crafted one throughout."
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2019,8/10,"The film opens introducing three characters. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) only America to win Le Mans is forced from racing because of his heart. He is selling cars. Ken Miles (Christian Bale ) is a savvy independent race car driver with an attitude and no sponsors. The IRS just took his garage. Lee Iococca (Jon Bernthal) is attempting to convince Henry Ford II that if Ford can win Le Mans, it will sell cars. The three of them come together to try to make it happen.A well acted film with the right blend of drama, comedy, and action."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2021,9/10,"Bale is one of my all time favourite actors, this film shows exactly why that is, he is absolutely incredible, and he is in great company, Damon is equally spot on in the role, as are the supporting cast.I'm not what you'd call a racing fan, but this story is captivating, and as well as the amazing acting and storyline, you are treated to some fabulous music, jaw dropping effects, and some character engagement that I've not seen in a film for some time.This was genuinely brilliant, you don't need to be a racing fan to enjoy, just someone that likes amazing movies. For the many average movies I've seen of late, this is what the film industry should be about. 9/10."
FORD V FERRARI,24 March 2020,10/10,"I have to admit, I never thought that a movie about cars/racing would get to me, the way this movie did. And it is a testament not just to the actors, but the script and the directing and so many other things that make this quite the experience to watch.Bale is quite the actor - I should have known or rather remembered he's British, but I really had forgotten about it, especially with his ability to blend his American accent so good, you just can't tell. But it is not just about accents, it is about gravitas and even more surprisingly about humor! The movie is way funnier than I expected it to be, with one liners coming at you at the speed of ... well you get it.And yes there are cliches and some things surely are exaggerated for good measure and to heighten certain things, but overall this is quite enchanting and quite a great movie. With not just one battlefield, if you'll excuse the use of that word, but multiple ones our main characters have to endure and maybe even prevail (?) - if you are aware of history, you know what's up, I didn't"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,8/10,"You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic ""Le Mans"" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world's longest endurance test. ""Le Mans"" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn't embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a 'spin' in a car under development. If there's any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford's race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him."
FORD V FERRARI,5 July 2020,8/10,"Since I'm not into car racing, James Mangold's Oscar-winning ""Ford v Ferrari"" was all the more impressive. This look at the US car company's efforts to unseat the Italian one as the champion of Le Mans feels energized even when not on the racetrack. We get looks at the inner workings of the car companies, as well as the personal lives of the drivers. It's a tour de force from start to finish. I recommend it."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,8/10,"In America this movie is titled Ford vs. Ferrari, that is essentially the big hook of the film, film critic Mark Kermode said in his review that this is very similar to Rush, in that the characters come first, and the cars come second (or some people say the other way around). From the trailer I saw I was definitely going to watch it at the cinema, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day, Logan). Basically, in1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari in order to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) walks away from the deal, after Fiat offer a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain his ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Henry II is furious and orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner and retired racing driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), he won Le Mans in 1959, he was forced to stop due to his heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Golden Globe nominated Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, finding all its design flaws and making the necessary improvements until it is ready to race. Ford do not see Miles as their ideal driver, due to his abrasive attitude, they opt to send Phil Hill (James Tyler Paulson) and Bruce McLaren (Benjamin Rigby) to the 1964 Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Ford vehicles finish the race. While Henry II sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains that the GT40 reached higher speeds than Ferrari, instilling fear in them on the Mulsanne straight, before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) takes over the racing division and intends again to continue the program without Miles. But Shelby gives Henry II a ride in the car and wages his own company on the line to convince him that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the limit, resulting in him winning the race. At the 1966 Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, team engineer Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) fixes the door, bashing it with a mallet. Miles catches up with the Ferraris and begins to set lap records. His wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (A Quiet Place's Noah Jupe) watch and listen to the action as it unfolds.
Miles. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini (Francesco Bauco), Miles experiences another brake failure, but the system is replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces the race officials that the brake change is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight, but Bandini's engine blows, and Ferrari are completely eliminated from the race. With three Ford teams in the top-three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, as one of their cars crossed the finish line just ahead. Although devastated by this decision, Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Two months after Le Mans, Miles is testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles experiences another brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' family a visit, Mollie watches as he gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford would continue its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969, becoming the only American manufacturer to win the prestigious race. Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. Also starring JJ Field as Roy Lunn, Jack McMullen as Charlie Agapiou, Benjamin Rigby as Bruce McLaren, Alex Gurney as Dan Gurney (playing his own father) and Ben Collins (formerly The Stig in Top Gear) as Denny Hulme. Damon as the man putting everything into making the winning vehicle and Bale as the loose cannon British racer unafraid to say whatever he thinks are both perfectly cast. It is most interesting true story, corporate company Ford wanting to regain their mojo by winning the 24-hour race, conflicting with the maverick petrolheads, fantastic chalk-and-cheese characters. You grow to like the characters in the slower moments, then you go to breakneck speed in the twists and turns of the racetracks, the race sequences are indeed fast paced with nail-biting crashes, all fantastically edited and with terrific sound design, overall it is an exciting and most enjoyable sports drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Sound Mixing, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and Best Sound. Very good!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 November 2019,8/10,"I'm no petrolhead. What little knowledge I have of classic cars I gleaned from playing Top Trumps as a kid. I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.In the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).Matt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).A classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.The legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!)."
FORD V FERRARI,3 March 2020,,"My wife and i watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Excellent picture and realistic racing sounds, but no extras on the disc.While it is based on a historically accurate story many of the scenes and dialog had to be invented but the filmmakers did a superb job to make it interesting. While the movie is long at about 2.5 hours it is never dull. Much credit goes to the two actors in key roles, Damon and Bale who are at the top of their acting games.By the 1960s Ford was established as an automotive giant but Henry Ford II wanted to defeat Ferrari on the tracks. Willing to spend almost unlimited funds he turned to Carroll Shelby, racer and designer who in 1959 became the only second American to win the 24-hour race at Le Mans.Aside from fighting the excessive layers of Ford corporate management, much of the movie regards the relationship between Carroll Shelby (Damon, sounding like a young Tommy Lee Jones) and driver Ken Miles (Bale). Together they accomplished the tasks and propelled Ford racing cars to international fame.A really good movie, an excellent chapter in auto racing and an interestingly told story. For those who want to learn more about the controversial finish in 1966 do a web search for ""Foul play in Ford 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour photo finish?"" to find interesting articles.Also the 2016 documentary called ""24 Hour War"" covers the same subject but with a different focus, including the history of each company and direct input from many who were involved in Ford's project 50 years earlier. Worth a watch if you can find it.As an aside, this movie includes the introduction of the Ford Mustang in the 1960s. That brought back nice memories as my college graduation gift was a gently used 1965 Mustang, red with three black racing stripes down the middle, and with the 289 CI motor with 4-barrel carbs and a 4-on-the-floor shifter. Man that was a nice running car."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,8/10,"This is made by the filmmaker who previously did a lot to inspire Walk Hard, so it may be redundant to say that this biopic about the Men Who Raced Hard in the 60s has conventional moving parts and mechanisms in its plot and certain (ok most) characters.Aside from an ending that isn't a surprise or shock given how clearly (or blatantly) it's set up in the three-point Set-up/Reminder/Pay-off style in conventional screenwriting, this even has the kid who is there so that some of the grown-ups can explain things involving making some of the turns and, oh, being set on fire and surviving (not to say that this guy Ken Miles didn't have a son I'm sure he did that's not what I'm saying I'm talking about the TEXT of the story for pete's sake). Id even say Josh Lucas is only here because the writers think the stakes of a 24 hour race aren't enough so one needs the Corporate Suit Who Is Against Our Rebel Batman-Driver (and not to say there weren't pencil-pushing hacks at Ford then, I wasn't there and neither were you, but it's a total cliche thru and thru).....YET, There's two things. First, to make a car analogy again because it's fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for ""Pizzazz"" with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.Second, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won't say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now ""owned"" by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he's been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a ""Good"" beat, where it's almost like the movie is saying, ""yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you."" But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn't hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.I don't know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.Oh, and it's a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,,"I have no interest in racing, yet I was still entranced by the captivating races. The film is not just about speed, but about brotherhood, determination and conscience. It's about telling a great story that makes you root for the character in question. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, even though I am not a racing fan at all."
FORD V FERRARI,18 August 2020,10/10,I like the bit where he drove in front of all them people and they honked the horn at him. In also like the bit where they had a punch up and punched the lid of the trash can.
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"This is just great! Bale and Damon are really convincing as a pair of ""individuals"" who design and build - with the help of some wooden door wedges - a magnificent feat of motor engineering despite their own personal demons; corporate America - exemplified by a thoroughly odious Josh Lucas and the pretty horrible French weather. Noah Jupe, who plays Bale's son Peter is also superb. The race photography and sound are wonderful - you really do get sucked into the exhilaration of it all. The only thing missing is the smell of the petrol fumes. I was slightly dubious that I could ever want a Ford (think: box, square, dull, Henry Fonda) to defeat a Ferrari (think: sleek. red, classy, James Dean) but in the end, I sort of did. 2½ hours just flies by. Interestingly, there is a distinct paucity of swearing in this film, too. Big screen/sound essential."

FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is an amazing movie, the cinematography is stunning and the acting is so well done. The plot is based off the true story of how Ford motor company enlisted Carroll Shelby to build a racecar capable of beating a Ferrari. Matt Damon and Christian Bale have great chemistry as Shelby and racer Ken Miles. The storyline flows beautifully, the race scenes have stunning visuals and the characters are well played. Thoroughly enjoyable even for non racing enthusiasts."
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2020,8/10,"It is the early-1960s and Ford Motor Corporation's fortunes are at a low ebb. In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.I did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.Director James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 ½ hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.Not perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.Overall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,". . . in graphically documenting another sad chapter in the saga of America's Most Fiendish Family. Edsel's whelp (Hank #2) stands in as FORD V FERRARI's most hiss-worthy villain, as he viciously drives beloved World Racing Champ ""Ken"" to a premature, fiery death in a faulty Ford car. Perhaps it's a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1's gun thugs patrolling the world's first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter's infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel's Revenge, when Hank One's favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever. However, what FORD V FERRARI actually DOES put up on the screen should be enough to convince anyone (beyond the demonically-possessed ditto-head Pachyderm core supporters) NEVER to get behind the wheel of a fraudulent Ford!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 January 2020,5/10,"Blech, did Ron Howard direct this thing, or is James Mangold just trying to trick us into thinking he did?Look, I'm not at all into cars or car racing, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this. But I'm also not into diamonds or the diamond business, and I thought ""Uncut Gems"" was one of the best films of the year. I don't have to be ""into"" a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.""Ford v Ferrari"" is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what's the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you're going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it's set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It's the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It's the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It's full of a certain American attitude I simply can't stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I'm not sure what the movie's point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.Matt Damon's good ol' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he's used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don't want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time. The best moment in the movie belongs to Tracey Letts.Grade: C"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as ""a Ford man"", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,7/10,"This long movie is quite involving and the races are exciting. The in the driver's seat point of view makes the races exciting and the David v Goliath thing always gets you rooting for the underdog. Enjoyable even for non race car enthusiasts. The actors are good from main to supporting. Bale is convincing as the driver. Damon looks suitably tired and puffy as the ex driver turned designer.Some faults - Some scenes could have been cut. The wife's hissy fit could have been cut. Josh Lucas' mini nasty character was over done for the sake of having a villain, Jez Butterworth the screen writer wrote plays that have made it to Broadway and are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long. Don't understand some of the strong accents of Christian Bale and his wife. The movie should have ended right after Le Mans. Less of a downer if they had."
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2020,8/10,"James Mangold directs this historic visit to the 1960s, using the script written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and the result is a heart-pounding series of fast car racing events that surface as an entertaining film due to the presence of some very fine actors. Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!Briefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).But towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life. The film is overly long and at times self indulgent, but for fans of fast cars - and racing history - this film will more than satisfy."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Love and hate for this movie, and I understand. If you aren't into cars or racing then this isn't your thing to watch, simple as that. But for the muscle car lovers and espescially the Ford Mustang lover Shelby will ring a bell.Simply said, this is the story about Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. Their love for cars and starting a battle against Ferrari to build a faster car. And that's what it's all about. Cars, cars and cars and the friendship bewteen the two and their fight against Ford to get started building the GT40.Excellent performance from Bale and Damon as from the rest two which are perfectly chosen for their characters. And the British accent of Bale, so nice.Full of action and suspense and of course the death of Miles. A must see for all geeks for cars.

FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,8/10,"A must watch of the 2019 movie year. What works for Ford vs Ferrari takes us to the World War 2 generation. In Ford vs Ferrari, we see a world of Alpha males who spar off in the corporate world and race track. Ford is belittled by Mr Ferrari and the Ford vs Ferrari feud begins. We see a corporate world of sharks with harsh words and a struggle to survive. On the race track, there is Damon (Shelby) and Bale (Miles) two alpha males who get into a fight but still are friends. Miles' Wife explains to Miles in one line: you survived W W 2 in a tank on D day all the way to the end of the war, after that experience nothing else scares Miles. Driving 220 miles was nothing, but an adrenaline rush. Shelby bet his company so Miles can drive. Era of risk takers with dirty tricks on the race track, mixed with guts and determination.
Ford vs Ferrari is a movie about a generation who pushed, and risked at a different time before safe spaces and the twitter mob. 8 stars."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2020,8/10,"I can't say I'm a fan of racing events, neither of cars in general, but I really did enjoy this movie so you don't necessarily have to be an automobile buff to appreciate Ford versus Ferrari. It won two Oscars, one for film best editing and another for best sound editing, and it deserves both of them. Visually it was all very good. The story, based on true events, is entertaining. The races add a nice little tension and suspense what makes this movie stand out from the rest. The cast was great, with Matt Damon and Christian Bale in the leading roles. Christian Bale was excellent, probably his best performance yet, and Matt Damon just never disappoints. Ford versus Ferrari is a long movie but it doesn't feel long, with no boring moments at all, one of the better movies from 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,5 March 2020,,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a film about speed. And yet somehow, the filmmakers seem clueless about pacing and holding an audience's attention. With a run time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film seemed interminable due to the long, padded scenes stuffed between the race car sequences.The main problem with the film was in the character developments, which were one-dimensional and lifeless. A chorus of executives at the Ford Motor Company were an indistinguishable set of cookie-cutters. Incredibly, the visionary Lee Iococca blended in with the others, and it was never explained to viewers the genius of Iococca in the development of one of Ford's all-time best products, the Mustang. The one-note authoritarian dimension of Henry Ford II wore thin after his first scene, where he berates assembly line works and dismisses them for the day.The two principal race car drivers were also a sorry lot. Matt Damon dials in his performance of Carroll Shelby, a washed-up driver with a bum sticker, who is the liaison between the Ford executives and the world of the speedway. Christian Bale plays the role of driver Ken Miles as a down-on-his-luck schlub with an attitude. The maudlin scenes between Miles and his kid were a pathetic showcase of parenting, wherein the values taught to the little boy are that being a reckless hothead in life somehow pays off.The sappy dialogue of Miles and his long-suffering wife and the smarmy banter of the Ford executives bog the film down. Even the racing scenes were not as good as those crafted for ""The Art of Racing in the Rain."" From start to finish, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a snoozefest and one of the most overrated films of 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,,"""It isn't about speed."" Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal).Just as that statement from the world-class car designer is a poignant reminder of the complexity in car racing of the mid '6o's, so too is it about the newest car-racing thriller, Ford V Ferrari. The film combines some of the best racing ever seen on screen with the best of buddy adventures.It is now my favorite (I previously favored Steve McQueen's Le Mans), reminding me of a great Western mixed with a great duo, such as Paul Newman and Robert Redford from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There's even a scene of the two heroes facing off the suits like a Western gunfight about to happen.Matt Damon as Shelby is at his best cajoling Christian Bale, consummate actor, as legendary driver Ken Miles. Together they fight and joke accompanying their goal of beating the Ferrari juggernaut at the 24 hour Le Mans of 1966.With Tracy Letts playing an imperious but insightful Henry Ford II (""This isn't the first time Ford Motors' gone to war. We know how to do more than push papers. Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.""), the cast is incomparable, forwarding the suspense inherent in the testy cars and power races behind investors and manufacturers. Director James Mangold and the successful writing team keep the 2/12 hours moving thrillingly with a consistent sense of humor and manic competition between Italy and the US and driver versus driver.Ford V Ferrari is the best character-driven action of the year and my favorite race car film of all time.""We're lighter, we're faster, and if that don't work, we're nastier."" ShelbyIf that doesn't sound like a snarly, character-driven Western, then you've never seen The Magnificent Seven."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a well done and in depth long drawn out biography that does give good focus to the auto industry and how power and greed intersect with it. As it tells the true story of the legendary race in which Ford challenged Ferrari and would come out on top as an automotive leader.The scenes are tense and heart pounding often gripping with tension as the gear shifts on the lane, yet things also shift in life for industry and the characters involved. As showcased are the power struggles and corporate problems of industry like greed and doubt however when the Ford GT is developed it breaks the company free to win around the curb of the tracks!Most compelling and interesting is seeing the friendship form between car designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and hotshot race driver Ken Miles(Christian Bale) as despite the drama and thrill of the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1966 a bond and lasting and listening friendship is formed between the polar opposites! Overall good touching film of showing how fast speed won over many with love and friendship the film was really paced well and mixed with fun and drama for a near perfect finish lap!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 May 2020,5/10,"I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie ""Mine is Bigger."" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.Not recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,6/10,"Well-made movie all around. christian bale is amazing. damon impressed me as well. i don't have any issues with it. just not a fan of based-on-true-story bio-pics (1 viewing, 2/14/2020)"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"'Le Mans '66 (2019)', known simply as 'Ford V Ferrari' in America, is a sports biopic that aims to tell the story of the two men who forged Ford's first racing car. While it initially seems as though it's going to get lost in the corporate politics of car manufacturing, it soon becomes clear that it's far more concerned with its two leads and their strained-but-loving dynamic. By doing this, it skirts the usual biopic issue of cramming a hundred-and-one life events into a two-hour run-time whether they're really relevant or not. Basically, it crafts a compelling narrative from its 'real life' story, adapting things in a very satisfying way. The lead performances are up there with the best of the year, a chalk-and-cheese duo who light up the screen whenever they're on it. Bale, especially, is fantastic, sporting an accent and a slimmer frame in his typical chameleon way. Another star is director Mangold, whose assured direction makes for an engaging experience both on and off the race-track. The racing scenes are the thing's highlight, though; they're fast, suspenseful and technically sound. The piece manages to get you invested in the inner workings of such driving, and such cars, even if you've never given it a thought before. This allows everyone to be on the same page for the stunning finale, which is certainly an edge-or-your-seat sequence. The affair makes a point to take a step back now and again, slowing down for often overlooked character moments and rumination on the hidden beauty of racing. Indeed, it feels like a car fan's dream, dipping into the intricacies of bespoke car manufacturing while featuring a bevy of sleek vehicles, to boot. It isn't exclusively for this crowd, however. The story is resonant and the characters are well-rounded. It is a bit straight white male centric, having only one female character and relegating any people of colour to background roles. It feels old-fashioned in that sense, like a film from the period in which it's set. While better representation would be appreciated, its absence doesn't feel like a product of malice so much as an attempt to convey some sort of 'period realism'. Its plot does feel rather 'us v them', primarily because it associates Ford with America and Ferrari with Italy. Ford, the man, even seems to have a racial motivation, although this could be an unintended result of an early xenophobic comment. Really, though, the decision to position a massive corporation as an underdog is simply to fuel better drama. Still, these are pretty much the picture's only major flaws. It's a good movie that fans of its focal sport should get even more out of than I do. 7/10"
FORD V FERRARI,26 January 2020,9/10,"The one thing that Hollywood is really good at is competition which you might find surprising since Hollywood is a far-arsed, monied town and you would think 'competing' wouldn't even enter into their vocabulary, (except, of course, during Awards Season), yet when Hollywood sets its mind to it and makes a film about competing, (think ""Rocky"", think ""Aliens""), they are unbeatable. Their latest competitive movie is ""Ford v Ferrari"" and it's a contemporary classic in which every single piece fits perfectly into place just like the pieces of the classic cars on display. In this country it's called ""Le Mans '66"" so even if you didn't know it was about the car companies Ford and Ferrari you would still know what it's about and when it takes place.Starting off with a superb screenplay from playwright Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller. terrific performances from the likes of Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas and Caitriona Balfe, brilliant editing, luminous photography all under the guiding hand of James Mangold this is a crowd-pleaser of the first magnitude and you don't even have to like cars to enjoy it, (though it helps). What you do have to like, however, is competing and who doesn't get an adrenelin rush from competing? It also helps if you like Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Bale's character may not be the most likeable bloke in the world but but this faultless actor is terrific in the role while Damon is fast becoming the go to actor of choice when it comes to playing craggy, steel-jawed heroes of a certain age, (surely his Oscar is just around the corner). The ending may be a tad predictable but the journey to it is one hell of a ride."
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2021,8/10,"At the beginning I was thinking like ""Omg, it's going to be that ordinary, boring movie about racing and nothing else"" but after watching first 30minutes I've eniterely changed my mind. The first word I can think after watching this movie is Quality. Where that quality comes from? First of all, actors did amazing job, they were very convincing, there was no place for bad acting. After that, views,images,CGI, cars looked so good that I wanted to touch them in real life. And the strongest point was plot. It started with low force with strong middle and finishing very dramatic. For real, I can't even remember if I've seen better movie about racing. I would recommend to watch it for all action lovers(of course racing lovers too). It stands strong in 9 place in my best movies of 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,8/10,"Often times this time of year it's tough to find a crowd pleasing film. The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a ""downer"" or more ""thought-provoking"" than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point. In all, Mangold has another win on his hands with one of the best films of the year. Here's hoping it's honored during awards season!8.9/10"
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2020,7/10,"I doubt auto racing can be made to be any more engaging to me than in this, which is to say I'm not fascinated by men in sports cars driving around in circles, but ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a ripsnorting ride. Despite its two-and-a-half-hours runtime, it's never dull, and the whiplash cutting and vroom-vroom sounds are wholly deserving of their Oscars. Casting two of the most likable actors around, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both of who try on different accents, in the leads helps, too. The title, ""Ford v Ferrari,"" winds up being rather misleading, though, as the picture shifts gears more along the lines of Ford suites v Ford gearheads. That at one turn, Henry Ford II frightfully weeps as a passenger in a race car suggests where the movie's sympathies rest in that competition. The pissing competition between two bosses of car manufacturers takes a backseat to this inter-corporate one-upmanship and even that is of less interest than chasing the adrenaline junkies speeding around corners and risking death for glory. Rather simplistic for a Best Picture Oscar nominee, although not for its technically splendid production, but it's undeniably popularly entertaining."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,,"From the director of Logan comes a full-throttled, high-octane & adrenaline-fuelled sports drama that recounts the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans endurance race in 1966. Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66) is no doubt stylishly filmed & furiously paced but it also travels a rather safe route for the most part and isn't as memorable as its genre's finest offerings.Directed by James Mangold, the film centres its plot on Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles while rivalry between two big corporations plays second fiddle to their stories. The racing segments are plentiful and are shot with kinetic flair. But the attempt to make the drama all macho & cool does not always deliver the best results as it dilutes the seriousness the film was aiming for, and appears as if it's trying too hard to grab our attention.Nevertheless, the relation between man & machine is captured with purity, and that bonding remains intact from start to finish. Instead of two corporations battling it out for supremacy in endurance racing, the story derives its conflict from disagreements that arise within Ford's racing crew & corporate executives. This element does keep the interest alive but the dramatic portions do not pack the same grip & punch that the racing scenes do.Matt Damon & Christian Bale are brilliant in their respective roles of Shelby & Miles, both individually & when sharing screen together. Damon is focused in his rendition while Bale embodies his role in ways only he can, thus adding another terrific input to his résumé. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a competently crafted & technically polished biopic that narrates the real-life events with gusto and is fun, thrilling & entertaining enough to satisfy both racing enthusiasts & casual filmgoers. Certainly worth a shot."
FORD V FERRARI,21 December 2019,7/10,"I didn't know anything about Ford's history with 24 Hours of Le Man, really, but Ford v Ferrari does a good job of conveying of how important it was to those involved. Christian Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is particularly impressive, making him both aggravating and sympathetic at the same time. This film is educational, engaging and it gives us the epic Batman vs. Jason Bourne fight scene we've all been waiting for."
FORD V FERRARI,28 August 2021,9/10,"I haven't seen this movie in the cinema, I don't remember why. I wish I had watched it in the cinema. It was great movie. Performances were also excellent. The car scenes were very good. I like this movie very much."
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.Some say that ""Ford v Ferrari"" (2019) is a must watch for all who are ""motor-head"". I personal do not think so - i think it is a must watch for all who love great and involving cinema. I do not like car sports personally, but when i see movies like ""Rush"" or now ""Ford v Ferrari"" i kinda wish would like it more.""Ford v Ferrari"" is a great movie. It is superbly directed, write, acted, edited and crafted from start till finish. Running time 2 h 30 min ran like a wind because this movie was amazingly involving and paced. I did not know this story, therefore for me everything here was a surprise (story wise), but even more i was surprised after i realized that this might have been the best movie that director James Mangold has ever done, and i loved his ""Logan"".Overall, whether you like car sport or not, this movie is for everyone. It is stupendously involving from start till finish. Definitely one of the best movies of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"Its a marvellous film about crazy speeding car pilots, humungous bright shining cars and cooporate power in the business of car driving, the two main actors give some of their best performances ever. its filmed in an orange glow that is almost surtain a viewer magnet.. the special effects are extremely well embroidered into the action, and the quotes of wisdome are very short and sober.the grumpy old man liked ''herbie'' and some of the other classics from the 70's, but this is even bigger. if you like cars, and speed and motor noise do take my recommendations and have a look, its a marvel"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,10/10,"One of the best films of the year! Great enlightenment of incredible acting and magic in editing! Christian Bale's performance is a spark of excellence as always, he's one of the best actors in this generation. If I had one complaint it'd be that Matt Damon chews way to much gum but part of me thinks that added on his glorious performance. I really hope Ford Vs. Ferrari gets Oscar praise, it deserves every bit of love."
FORD V FERRARI,17 December 2019,4/10,This is really not have very good movie. It is really sad. The story line is not that good. It is not an 8.3. It is a 4. Come on now I can watch new and see car crash. It is not that good really.
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,9/10,"I just got out of Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari)I'll admit, right off, I do not like racing movies for two reasons 1, I have no interest in motor racing and 2, the movies always have the same problem, boredom (the cars go round and round) and predictability (the hero wins) but i'd heard good things about this one and it's James Mangold (Copland, Logan, Walk The Line) so I went to see it.First off, it is not really about the company of Ford versus the company of Ferrari, maybe that's why it is called Le Mans '66 in the UK. Carol Shelby (Damon) is hired to create a car to win Le Mans '66 by Ford, he insists on having Ken Miles (Bale) help him and be the driver. The suits at Ford do not want Miles driving and attempt to drop or undermine him every chance they get, as Shelby and Mild try to design said car in 90 days en route to Le Man's '66. So really it's Shelby & Miles versus the suits of Ford, whilst Ford wants to beat Ferrari.I loved the performances, Bale and Damon are both great, Bale just steals every scene, he is the heart of the movie, you root for him, he is the underdog, because Ford don't want him as the face of the company!! You never root for Ford, truthfully, I never cared about the Ford V Ferrari thing at all. I just wanted Bale and Damon to succeed. Despite being nasty to the Americans at the beginning, at least Enzo Ferrari cared about what he was doing and the sport of motor racing and he had some honour. Henry Ford didn't care about the car or the sport. He just wanted to turn around decking sales and was mad at Ferrari over an insult.I think I enjoyed it so much as it didn't really focus on the racing aspect, if you are expecting a racing movie, you will be disappointed. It focused more on the making of the car and the various relationships. You don't need to know about racing to enjoy this movie, it's about the characters.Everyone knocks it out of the park!! Not just the main actors the supporting actors too, Josh Lucas is in this and of course he is a d*ck, isn't he always!! I mean I really hated him, I couldn't wait to see him get knocked out!! Ray McKinnon is great too, every time he was on screen, I was trying to place him, an IMDB search reveals he was Bradley in A Perfect World.If I had one complaint, and it's only minor it's Jon Bernthal, he is great, it is his idea for Ford to enter the world of racing, he chose and is Damon's biggest supporter and then he just disappears or is relegated to the background or if he is in shot not speaking , he is an important part of the first half of the movie then he doesn't speak for the second!!Top 5 movie of the year for me."
FORD V FERRARI,11 March 2020,7/10,"Firstly, very good casting choices, so hats off to the casting department! The entire cast is perfect in their respective roles. I really enjoyed Christian Bale here. I think he was fantastic.The film doesn't have the flashy visuals one would expect from a film of this genre. It's not overdone like some of the Fast & the Furious films. It doesn't have endless show motion imagery. Instead, this is a straight-forward, well made film where pretty much what you see is what you get. And I loved that! The action scenes were very realistic. During all the action/racing scenes, the film also dished up a good dose of drama and suspense - and I loved the subtle humor, too! There are no comic relief characters, no slapstick humor; just very funny one-liners and incidents. There's also only the required amount of characters.This is an interesting film that will appeal to a wide audience, and is not primarily aimed at car or racing enthusiasts. The film offers so much more. The father-son relationship was beautiful and touching. It also offers a good insight into Ford Motor Company's history. The editing is quick, as you'd expect from a film that revolves around speed. The finale is really great. I enjoyed this film."
FORD V FERRARI,20 July 2020,7/10,"The best part of this film was Christian Bale acting as the brash and short-tempered Ken Miles. His performance was excellent and compelling. The cinematography, editing, effects and soundtrack all made the whole film flow smoothly. The story was engaging all the way, though it was quite long. The racing scenes were exciting and well made."
FORD V FERRARI,19 February 2020,8/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a Biography - Action movie in which we watch how Ford motor company was entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race in 1966 with Ford GT40 Mk I. We also watch the American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build this outstanding car for Ford in order to defeat Enzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars which were the dominants in the mid-1960s motorsport world.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events, it has many great scenes and much of suspense too. I enjoyed the direction which was made by James Mangold and he did a great job. The interpretations of Christian Bale who played as Ken Miles and Matt Damon who played as Carroll Shelby were simply outstanding . Some other great interpretations that have to be mentioned were Caitriona Balfe's who played as Mollie Miles (wife of Ken Miles), Noah Jupe who played as Peter Miles (son of Ken Miles) and Josh Lucas who played as Leo Beebe.To sum up, I have to say that ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a great movie to watch with much of suspense, great interpretations and many good scenes that will leave you speechless. I recommend this movie to everyone because I am sure that you will like it and if you are a fan of motorsports then I am definitely sure that you will love it."
FORD V FERRARI,13 February 2020,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari (5 out of 5 stars).Ford v Ferrari is an awesome sports drama film that delivered on the racing scenes that puts you right in the drivers wheel. And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding.The plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari.It is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling.The direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by. Or right in the driver side of the car puts you right into the race.Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered the performances. They are awesome playing the characters.Overall, Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of the year. It is exciting. The direction, script, and actors did great with the movie. The racing sequences is one of the best put together action scenes. That will leave you on the edge of your seat."
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,9/10,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"Who would've thought that the year's most purely enjoyable cinematic delight would come to us in the form of what on paper appears to be a petrol heads delight?Low and behold though, James Mangold's magnificently filmed, scripted and acted true life tale of motorsport legends Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is not only a cracking biopic accessible to those of all ages but one of the year's best filmed big screen treats that is sure to be a major player at the upcoming awards season.Stepping behind the camera for the first time since he delivered big results with Logan in 2017, Mangold maintains the form he found with the well-respected comic book adaptation to give Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66 in many territories) a consistent energy and heart that maintains an almost flawless ability across its two and a half hour run-time to keep us glued to the screen throughout.Mixing both character beats and high-octane spectacle, the race sequences in Ford v Ferrari are a site to behold, Mangold's managed to do what Ron Howard did with Rush a few years ago and make a car film for everyone as those seeking 4-wheeled action will be happy just as those that are seeking out character beats and focus will be.Working off a genuinely funny and heartfelt script by Jez and John-Henry Buttersworth and Jason Keller, Mangold's exploration of the typical American hero Shelby and the deadest driven and wild Ken Miles work with Ford in 1966 to create a machine that could take down Ferrari's reign as Le Mans champion may follow a formula we've come to expect from such a film but it does so in such a fun, energetic and soulful way that Ford v Ferrari feels fresh and new, with two killer central performances to boot.Teaming up for the first time in their varied career, Matt Damon as Shelby and Christian Bale as Miles create one of the year's most memorable double bills, an on screen relationship that will make you laugh, fist pump and possibly even shed a tear or two as the two motor racing geniuses battle against the odds, a bunch of Ford suit and ties and themselves to achieve their goals.We've come to expect a certain standard from these two performers but both Damon and Bale excel here, with Bale in particular delivering another awards worthy turn as Miles, who in the wrong hands could've become downright unlikeable but here comes out as a man we can't help but respect and admire. While its unlikely Bale will walk away with any significant silverware in such a crowded year for male performances of note, there's a good chance his turn here will be fondly remembered as one of his best.With these two fantastic lead turns front and centre throughout and a raft of memorable supporting performances from the likes of the always great Jon Bernthal, the slick Josh Lucas and a scene stealing Tracey Letts as Henry Ford 2, Ford v Ferrari is the all-round package, a trial against the odds underdog story that is a film everyone should check out, not just those already in the know about this wonderful true life tale.Final Say -A winning delivery of a tried and true formula makes Ford v Ferrari a ride worth taking, further enhanced by some immaculate direction and some wondrously entertaining performances, James Mangolds racing epic is one of the year's most memorable big screen events.4 ½ ruined bags of groceries out of 5"
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,8/10,"Outstanding performances - Bale was perfect, but this film was and felt too long. Some scenes weren't needed and others could've been trimmed down to make this film more inviting for the entire ride. The father-son relationship took up way too much of the films time as it really was pointless to be that relevant when nothing really came out from it. Pacing could've also been better in most of the non-relevant scenes. Production value, sets and era cars were outstanding, the score/soundtrack very fitting, and the cinematography incredible. Great biopic story that needed to be told. It's an 8/10 from me"
FORD V FERRARI,26 March 2020,5/10,"Review: As I'm not a massive racing car fan, I wasn't over-excited about this movie, but the cast was impressive and the story was intriguing. The director portrayed the 60's period well, and the cars were amazing, but the whole racing car theme became a bit tedious after a while. All of the technical jargon went straight over my head, but the attention to detail, in terms of the cars and the tracks, was on point. The acting from Christian Bale (Ken Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) seemed average in my eyes, mainly because I didn't know the real-life characters that they were portraying, so I didn't know how accurate it was. With that aside, the chemistry between the characters was great, and there were some scenes, which didn't have anything to do with racing, which was enjoyable, but the main core of the movie seemed a bit too safe to me. There weren't any standout moments that stood out, and I wasn't left feeling that I wanted to find out more about the characters. I know that the' race is an important part of American history that will always be remembered, but I personally lost interest once Carroll and Ken joined forces. I did feel the intensity during the races, which made me stick with the two and a half hour movie, and I did find the ending quite shocking, but it's not the type of movie that I will be watching again. That's not to say that it's a bad film because it does exactly what it says on the tin, but it's just not my cup of tea. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by James Mangold, who also brought you Heavy in 1995, Copland, Girl Interrupted, Kate & Leopold, Identity, Walk The Line, 3:10 to Yuma, Knight & Day, The Wolverine and Logan. He's due to direct 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo and the new Indiana Jones project, but with the Coronavirus in our midst, no one really knows what's going to happen to the upcoming projects that are in pre-production. Judging by his filmography, he has made some impressive movies to date, and with this movie going down well with critics worldwide, the only way is up for this established director. The only reason why I wasn't that impressed with this film was because of the subject matter, but it's well made and the box office takings prove that it was enjoyed by many.Budget: $97.6million Worldwide Gross: $225.5millionGenre: Action, Biography, Drama, Sport Cast: Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Tracy Letts, Remo Girone, Ray McKinnon, JJ Feild and Jack McMullen. 5/10"
FORD V FERRARI,27 September 2020,5/10,"I had my hopes up for ""Ford v Ferrari"" but I should have know better. Christian Bale is in it. Bale is the kiss of death. I've seen a bunch of Bale's movies. Only two of them are worth a second viewing (""Treasure Island"" and ""Hostiles""). Most aren't even worth the first viewing. Great actors are the ones you don't notice acting. You always notice Bale. The rest of ""Ford v Ferrari"" just kind of lays there. As the story went on, I cared less and less. Matt Damon does a nice job but it's a wasted effort. ""Ford v Ferrari"" gets a pretty big yawn from me."
FORD V FERRARI,30 March 2020,7/10,It always amazes me when a producer/director can pack so much quality film into a mere two and a half hours with so much gusto and still maintain the gist of a historical and inspirational true story. Great cinematography combined with pitch perfect (location shoots in Italy) LeMans style car racing and an audio sound that makes you feel like you are at the track side with the roar of the engines and the squeal of rubber burning.It stars a great cast and the film is over almost as quick as one lap of the LeMans race track. Vrooom Vroooom Vroooom
FORD V FERRARI,22 August 2020,8/10,"Great characters drive this movie.The car parts of the movie work well and provide much of the action of the film, however its what goes into the cars that makes this move so enjoyable. Blood, sweat, tears, joy money, hope, pride, you name it, this movies makes use of all of them.You can easily invest in the characters, their passion and the challenges they all face.
A longish movie, never feels slow or boring. It is fantastic."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,5/10,"I wont dinied ford v ferrari has quality in it which is hard not to have when mangold is director and damon and bale stars and it will be great watch for some,but to me it wasnt,i was never fan of cars and racing so i coudnt invest myself in story and at some points it became for me boring and to long,ford v ferrari will probably win some awards and for that i say it deserves,but at the end i myself would rather watch something else"
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,8/10,"Victorious story about American car racing, with a brilliant acting performance by Christian Bale.The story is about the friendship between 2 total car fanatics, who live and breath cars all their lives (Matt Damon and Christian Bale). Together they achieved something never done before (or since) in American racing history: they won the biggest European racing championship called Le Mans, 4 times in a row!Not only suited for car fanatics, because there is a certain victorious feel to this movie and a long life friendship, that is undeniably attractive to watch for anybody.Any bad? It's not groundbreaking in any way. It's simply a car movie. A great, victorious one though, with excellent acting. Really enjoyed it."
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,2/10,"Is it watchable movie that has zero street cred.
Just another Hollywood phony re-work of the truth.Is it entertaining?
Yes.But little is based in reality.AND we learn that Bale is the real actor. Damon is less than a light weight."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,7/10,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale star in this 2019 drama based on true events. This takes place in the 1960's and Damon (The Martian) plays racecar driver turned designer, Carroll Shelby who works for the Ford Motor company. He tries to save the business from taking a nosedive from competing company, Ferrari by designing a new, faster Ford model with help from his mechanic friend, Ken Miles (Bale) who not only agrees, but wants to drive it as well. When the corporate execs disapprove of Miles, Shelby puts his job on the line to help his friend be the first to drive the car and win the La Mans race. This is a good bio drama with humorous, dramatic and thrilling moments, Damon & Bale are great in it and together. I recommend this."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,7/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" (2019 release; 152 min.) brings the true story of the showdown at the 24 hrs of LeMans in 1966. As the movie opens, we see Carroll Shelby in a flashback win the 1959 LeMans. We then go forward a few years when Henry Ford II address the Ford factory floor asking for some good new ideas. Up-and-coming executive Lee Iacocca suggests buying the struggling Ferrari car manufacturer but the deal fails. In a parallel story, we get to know rebel driver Ken Miles.... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
FORD V FERRARI,20 December 2019,6/10,"I must confess that sports car racing is probably at the bottom of my list when it comes to the type of spectator sports I like to watch. Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children? (as in the case of one of the protagonists here, Ken Miles, played quite effectively by Christian Bale).
What's more, most of the glory seems to go to the companies that put up the money for these spectacles. So in this case, we're asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.
In looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari's dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).
Ferrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he's about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.
Meanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that's ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can't stomach such a ""politically incorrect"" character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.
A cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe's push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.
There's more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis's innate knowledge of car mechanics-there's a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.
While Damon's part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe's approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 ""tune-up"" and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.
All the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned ""loose cannon"" Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.
The aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There's a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.
Less successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I'm thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.
Ultimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari ""drama"" is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that ""believable"" however, on the other hand).
The racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).
The film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,4/10,"The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.The film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.The biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"A must see for all car lovers, It's a legendary tale of the Ford GT40.
The film could not have asks for a finer ensemble cast. You got Damon you got Bale. That dude who played the Punisher. A whole bunch of other people doing a terrific job.
It's a great story filled with humor and excitement.
Plus it's a bonafide sports film. It's a great example of true sportsmanship.
Worth the imax ticket."
FORD V FERRARI,11 September 2021,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres. The storyline follows Mr. Shelby when he's hired by Ford to take on the infamous Italians in a European race. Shelby looks to dodge the politics, overcome physics and manage the emotions of his best friend and driver to accomplish his mission. This movie is directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line) and stars Matt Damon (The Departed), Christian Bale (The Dark Knight), Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead), Josh Lucas (Glory Road), Caitriona Balfe (Escape Plan) and Noah June (A Quiet Place). The storyline for this film contains so many elements and dynamic subplots - from enguiniety, to friendship, to parenthood to determination and grit. The acting in this is out of this world. Everyone in the cast is excellent. The circumstances, race scenes and action sequences are perfect. The evolution and depiction of all the storylines in this film concludes well and this is definitely an American classic and depicts so many nuances of our culture. This will likely become an underrated American film classic that is definitely a 10/10 must see."
FORD V FERRARI,10 July 2021,9/10,"Designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) develop a racing program for Ford that is designed to challenge the formidable Ferrari team at the legendary '24 Hours of Le Mans'. Mid-sixties sports-car racing is vividly recreated with a minimum of CGI (although see goofs section for authoritative nit-picking), so the film is a vintage-car fan's dream (needless to say though, most of the 'action' shots use replica cars). Damon is fine as the hard-driven Shelby and Bale is excellent as the tetchy but talented driver. The film-makers take some liberties with history, most notably in having Miles listen to the 1965 Le Mans race on the radio rather than competing (as he did, retiring when his early GT40 blew its gearbox). The screenwriter also invented the scene in which a high-speed ride in the GT40 scares Henry Ford II to blubbering tears (a scene so stupid that it almost put me off the film when I saw it in the early trailers). I know that most films are entertainment rather than video-lectures but I still wish that Hollywood (and its rivals) would more closely adhere to the truth, especially when it can be stranger than fiction, as is the case with the ending of the 1966 Le Mans race. Good, noisy fun, just like the real thing (lacking only the manly stench of hot rubber and oil)."
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,10/10,"Not every time you put two actors together and they'll click. But Matt Damon and Christian Bale surprisingly clicked on camera, to the point you'll forget there actors.Takes place in the 1960's, in the world of racing, a former race car driving(Matt Damon) and a british race car driver(Christian Bale) join forces to make history in the world of racing, by making a fast car for Ford auto. Hoping to keep big business from getting in the way.
An enjoyable racing film, also has a great 1960's setting. Racing scenes are also well shot, makes you feel you are in car. But it's Matt Damon and Christian Bales performances that really makes the movie, having Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Josh Lucas is also good."
FORD V FERRARI,13 May 2020,,"Supercharged sports drama based on the true story of revered, retired American racer-turned-entrepreneur Carroll Shelby along with fearless, confrontational British driver and mechanic Ken Miles who are employed by Henry Ford II and tasked with ""going to war"" against auto magnate Enzo Ferrari, who in the 1960s refuses to concede his position as the dominant manufacturer with the 24 Hours of Le Mans fast approaching. Fittingly, the relationship between Shelby and Miles escalates through a series of masterfully shot, white-knuckled racing scenes. With the duo of Damon and Bale you get fire and ice, and director Mangold's staging of the high-octane competition is remarkably good, but this is also a very personal story that explores the behind-the-scenes world of motorsports in ways you wouldn't quite expect. The length of the picture makes it hard to maintain a consistent level of adrenaline-pumping excitement, and yet it's quite a ride nonetheless, and as an added bonus gives the talented Damon another opportunity to employ a Texas drawl, and the inimitable Bale to once again be transformative onscreen. ***"

FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,7/10,"I saw ""Ford v Ferrari"", starring Matt Damon-Thor:Ragnarok, True Grit_2010, Christian Bale-Vice, 3:10 to Yuma_2007; Jon Bernthal-The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Punisher_tv and Josh Lucas-The Lincoln Lawyer, Hulk.
This movie is based on a true story about the fierce rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari. Ferrari had been winning the 24 hour race in Le Mans for years in the 1960's and Ford decided that it had been long enough. They hired Matt-playing Carroll Shelby-to build them a fast car to beat Ferrari. Jon-playing Lee Iacocca-is a negotiator for Ford. Josh is a Ford executive that does not like Matt's pick for a driver, Christian-playing Ken Miles. It is an interesting story of an American car designer trying to beat the European champions.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and peril and has a running time of 2 hours & 32 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,7/10,"The (mostly) true story of two passionate gear-heads and their tireless quest to unseat mighty Team Ferrari at the grueling 24-hour Le Mans endurance race. Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.Christian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.Several of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder."

FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,"My family are big motor sport fans so I had to see Le Mans 66 or as it is mainly known Ford V Ferrari and this film was an experience and one of my favourite films of recent memory. The premise of the film sees two ambitous drivers try to create a Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hour Le Mans race. Christian Bale plays the lead in the film and he is fantastic in this film, he is so charismatic and charming and you truly care about his character in the film. An Oscar Nomination is waiting for him for sure, his chemistry with Matt Damon is brilliant and one of the best duos in recent memory. As said Matt Damon is great in the film too, he compliments Bale so well and his loud personality really works for this film and there is most definitley an Oscar nomination ready for him. Jon Bernthal is in this film and also does a great job, he is pretty likeable in the film and I felt like he was a character we were meant to like and sympathise with. The rest of the cast also do a great job, they all fit there roles brilliantly and feel like they fit into the movie flawlessly. The story is fascinating, seeing these two companies go to war over building a car is great, and seeing the different personalities clashing, it feels real and like these people are working on something that really matters. The script is great, a true mix of humour and drama, it makes everybody in the film feel very realy and interesting. The style of the film is breathtaking, the race scenes keep you on the edge of your seat and build the tension superbly, the film never really slows down and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Overall this is a pretty amazing film that needs to be seen by all film fans and will be remembered as a classic."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,10/10,I saw this only because I always see the films nominated for best picture. I don't drive and I know almost nothing about Motorsports. I still managed to be thoroughly entertained by the film. The film deftly blends a story of corporate skulduggery with the racing stuff and manages to tell human interest story about both Miles and Shelby. With so many balls in the air the editor and writers manage to keep the film straightforward and *moving.* This is one the best paced films of the year and the racing stuff is just fantastic as actions scenes.My only real problem with the film is that Beebe's animosity towards Miles is underdeveloped. They have one scene where they butt heads but it propels a lot of the tension of the story. I didn't realize how critical the butting heads scene was until after the movie was long over. It is the only part of the film that wasn't top notch.Bale is the best part. Miles is a great prickly underdog. And Bale hasn't every been this endearing in ages. The film ends up having a bittersweet ending and Bale's choices really help the ending land with emotional power. This was a very good film.
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2020,2/10,"This film start with a car racer ""Carroll"" burn by the fire while racing, and the introduction of a car mechanic ""Ken"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Carroll recruit Ken to contend with Ferrari at Le Mans endurance race under Carroll and Ford company! Entire film quite slow and not intense! The conversation in the film also quite bored! The director keep overuse the radio broadcast scene and overuse of the close up face scene also make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Carroll and Ken fighting at Ken house and Ken's wife(Mollie) watching them! At the end, Ken idiotically slow down his car to let another two Ford's car won alongside him at the finish line! He eventually finish second place! Ken kill by a car accident! That's it! Another disappointed film! The high rate quite fake!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 September 2020,7/10,"Ex Le Mans winner and car maker Shelby (Damon) agrees to take on Ferrari for Ford by winning the 1966 Le Mans 24 hour car race. He agreed provided he can use the best driver Ken Miles (Bale) who the Ford people aren't keen on.Very exciting - the driving scenes are terrific, but it is the performances and interplay between the 2 leads that makes the film. It is also the strength of the supporting cast - not one bum note that add immeasurably, particularly Letts as Henry Ford and Balfe as Miles' wife."
FORD V FERRARI,14 December 2019,10/10,"(Flash Review)All cinematic facets were hitting on all cylinders. Ferrari had been winning the 24 Hour of Le Man's race again and again and again. Enzo Ferrari rejected Ford's offer to merge companies which angered Henry Ford II and he decided to challenge Ferrari's Le Mans dominance by building a better racecar. Carrol Shelby was put in charge of building and designing the car and racing program with the help of Ken Miles as driver/engineer. Watch as they battle it out on track and in the garage. Can the American behemoth snatch victory from the innovative Ferrari? This film nailed the engine and racing sounds and had very good racing effects although I feel Rush was a bit better. Complimenting that with deep character emotions made for a well-rounded film. Christian Bale was dialed in as quirky and unrefined Ken Miles, which the film emotionally hinged around, and Damon was pure Matt Damon and able to tease out genuine feelings; enough that a tear was shed. Even the supporting characters had genuine emotional moments. All in all, this was top notch with a briskly paced story."
FORD V FERRARI,29 May 2020,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari is a sports drama movie directed by James Mangold and stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Caitriona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe and Ray McKinnon in the leads.If you are fan of racing movies then you should watch the movie, if you are not a fan of racing movie still you should watch this movie.I totally loved and enjoyed the movie. The movie is gripping and intense. The racing scenes are probably one of the finest scenes that we have seen in the recent times. Screenplay keeps you glued to the screen and the cinematography on the edge of your seats.Acting is superb and the equation between the two male leads is something to be appreciated. The racing scenes are shot very beautifully and keep your adrenaline going.In order to conclude one of the finest racing and biographical movie I have seen in recent times and a total entertainer. A must watch."
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,6/10,"Entertaining, informational and fun to watch with great acting. I am sure this will be nominated for a lot of stuff. At two and half hours I just got bored with it."
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2020,7/10,"I've never been a big fan of Matt Damon, but I have to admit, he turns in a quite good performance in this film, as does Christian Bale, who I didn't even recognize. Overall, this is a pretty good historical drama, and a pretty good auto racing flick. Worth checking out."
FORD V FERRARI,9 March 2020,10/10,"One of the most favorite genres of film has always been the sports film. Inevitably those films almost always revolve around the struggle of the little guy against the giant, be it the favorite team to win or the corporation trying to stomp out the individual. One of the least popular sub genres in this category has been the racing film. Only a handful have been successful. To that list we must now add FORD V FERRARI.The film opens with driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) winning the Le Mans in France in 1959. Due to health issues he can no longer drive and sets up his own car company, Shelby American. Years go by and at Ford's owner Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is upset because Ford has yet to come up with a successful sports car. Prompted to push for something new Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) suggest they look at the youth marker which appreciates foreign cars.Ford attempts to buy out the now bankrupt Ferrari but it's merely a ploy for Ferrari to raise their value before selling to Fiat and insulting Ford. This pushes Ford II to appoint a team to create a new car to race on the circuit, especially at Le Mans. The man Iacocca suggests lead that team is Shelby.But Shelby has people to bring along as well. One of those is Ken Miles (Christian Bale), perhaps the best driver in the world but one with a reputation for being difficult to work with. Early on we see this when the two have a disagreement. But if anyone can pull the best out of Miles it's Shelby.They go to work, assemble the best there is at designing their new car and find themselves butting heads with the Ford team at the start. This team uses computers and gadgets to measure things. Shelby and Mile's team knows their car, inside and out. A bit of ribbon and duct tape and they can prove the point they want to make as opposed to scouring through hours of computer data. This results in them all working together towards a common goal.This team creates the first major racing car for Ford, the GT40 Mk I. But not everyone at Ford headquarters is on the same page. Executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is more concerned about advancing his career and does what he can to throw a wrench in the works figuratively. He convinces Ford to not include Miles on the team. Miles predicts that none of the Fords in competition at Le Mans will win and his prediction comes true.When Shelby is called on the carpet by Ford to explain why they lost to Ferrari, he explains in no uncertain terms that it wasn't the car that was the problem as much as not having the right driver. To prove his point he makes a deal with Ford. Let them continue to work on the car and if Miles can't win the race at Daytona, he'll sign over his entire company to Ford.Miles does win and it looks like everything is a go for both Shelby American, Ford and Miles. But once again Beebe inserts himself in a position he knows nothing about. He's wrangles his way into the head of the foreign racing team for Ford and seems bound and determined to put Miles in his place rather than allow the team to succeed.It all boils down to the second year at Le Mans with the new Ford GT40 Mk I and Miles onboard as one of the drivers. The 24 hour race commences and it isn't long until Beebe tries to derail the team. This time though Shelby refuses to bow down and keeps things moving properly. Now it's up to the team and Miles to make Ford a name to be reckoned with in the racing world.Racing fans will know the outcome of the film. Not being a race fan I came at the film from a different perspective. What I walked away with was having watched a movie that was amazing from start to finish. The film might include some amazing race photography but it doesn't focus only on that like many racing films do. Instead it tells the story of two men and their struggles to achieve a united goal of winning Le Mans in a car that they were responsible for creating.Both Damon and Bale add two more roles to their already long list of accomplishments. How neither won for their performances here is beyond me. The heart and soul of these two men is on display here in the film and it draws the viewer in rooting for them until the final moments of the film.I missed this one in the theaters, not really wanting to see it that bad. They should have promoted it more. It was truly one of the best films of the year and deserved more attention. With it available on disc now is your chance. This should be the one you look for this weekend."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,9/10,"I really, really liked ""Ford v Ferrari."" I'm not a car nor racing enthusiast, but my god does the movie make me want to be one. There's a lot of precision and heart put into this, and Christian Bale nails the role of Ken Miles as perfect as a smooth drift. Yes, it's a long one, but the runtime complements its storytelling.It has the best car sequences I've ever seen in any movie, and one that employs a mixture of stress and exhilaration. The cinematography is used as a tool and not just an aesthetic what with its well-calculated sequences especially during the race scenes.""Ford v Ferrari"" also features the best sound design and score that I've heard in a long time since ""The Social Network."" Every minute is carefully paired along with its corresponding music, making it look and feel a little more expressive and resonant.It's such an awesome experience sitting through ""Ford v Ferrari,"" something I'd like to relive again and again.I'm not a car guy, i don't understand the engineering of race cars, or anything like that, but this movie might change that. Loved it...."
FORD V FERRARI,28 October 2020,10/10,"This movie has everything you want in a movie, the meaning of friendship, incredible racing action, tension, revenge,Heart break, heroics, oscar performances all around!! Christian bale was incredible, it's so hard to get you to feel like you're embracing the car, that you are experiencing what he is, he made me feel this movie like I was involved in the story. This should have won best picture bands down, Christian bale was with out a doubt the oscar winner and matt damon was best supporting actor!!! Watch this movie now if you haven't yet and if you have watch it again and see what i mean about Christian bale, WOW!!!! Now THAT'S a movie!!!!!!!!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,9/10,"Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.This gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.The actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.The story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.In the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre."
FORD V FERRARI,10 April 2020,5/10,"Surprisingly funny and well acted racing movie. Racing scenes are well done, acting is superb especially by Christian Bale. But other than that, it's long and it feels. I can't say it's spectacular or anything eihter."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"BANGSYATTT!!! Christian Bale. Matt Damon. PURE TALENT. This movie isnt just for race fans, its funny and thrilling. Great to know its based on true story. 100% memorable. Probably my fav race type film."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2019,10/10,"James Mangold's (Logan/3:10 to Yuma remake) latest is a fun tale of the rivalry between the Ford car company & Ferrari on who's vehicle would win the infamous 24 hour LeMans race back in the 1960's. Ford enlisted Carrol Shelby, played by Matt Damon, to solve their dilemma which in turn caused Shelby to recruit his best friend/enemy Ken Myles (returning Yuma star Christian Bale) as his driver. Both mavericks in their own fields, Shelby the car maker/seller & Myles the perfectionist racer used their combined talents (& embattled histories) to take on the illustrious task of dethroning the mighty Italian carmaker (who at that point in history made beautiful cars but was in debt). Easy job, you think? You'd be wrong since Ford's underlings & marketing gurus may have had the right ideas on how to make a car look pretty (the '64 launch of their immortal Mustang is featured) but their know how on what made a engine tick properly was lost on them which fuels the constant fire between Ford & Shelby who wanted final say so on the men to race their cars (Miles was pegged as a problematic lone wolf) while Shelby knew he had the right man for the job. Never taking the Cliffs' notes approach to the material but savvy enough to make the car jargon fun & inclusive, this film fires on every cylinder (forgive my car punniage!) staying entertaining & even riveting when we know from history who wins the race. All the actors are in fine mettle including Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Ray McKinnon, Caitriona Balfe (from Starz's Outlander) & a special mention to Tracy Letts (playwright of Osage County) for his hilarious portrayal of Henry Ford II."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,8/10,This is feel good movie with great racing shots. Bale and Damon are awesome but I don't think they have any chance at Oscars.
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,8/10,This is feel good movie with great racing shots. Bale and Damon are awesome but I don't think they have any chance at Oscars. I was on the edge of my seat the whole second act.
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"Part of me wonders if I have stronger connection, a deeper investment to this film and the material as a born and raised Michigander that grew up immersed in automotive culture despite never really being a car person. Ford isn't just some company, it was a cornerstone of our economy and even our cultural identity. I say this because I got a legitimate rush out of this movie and when Ford is battling Ferrari I find myself wanting to get up and cheer them on.Furthermore, Bale and Damon should be in more movies together. The chemistry and the performances they deliver are exceptional. That's not to say the rest of the cast isn't pulling their weight, there are good, convincing performances all around, which does wonders for the immersion into this story.Also aiding in the immersion is the cinematography. Auto racing bores me in the real world and yet while watching this movie I found myself gripping the arm rests around the hairpin turns. As far as I'm concerned, that's an achievement of this movie, that it really draws me into what's going on.The only real drawback is in the ""villain"" who, at times is just extra awful. Aside from that though, I loved this. Definitely recommend it and, more than that, I absolutely think it's worth seeing in theaters for the full experience."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Inspiring, fantastically acted, and wonderfully approached, Ford v Ferrari gives the true life story the fuel it needs to truly become the one of a kind racing tale it could be. Christian Bale is obviously the largest standout of the films high end cast, giving another brilliant performance. Matt Damon is maybe only second best in the film, but he does a great job asd well, and provides for a perfect match for Bale's take on the character and its personality. The film is wonderfully shot, with breathtaking views, and fueled with an often pulse of excitement that truly grabs your attention the way a movie should. The film does seem to start slow, but as with cars, as it goes on longer it begins to pick up speed, making for an exciting ride. The soundtrack is also a particular standout, with an original score that fits its material better than most films this year, and a sound in general that isn't too loud or obnoxious for a racing flick. In the end, Ford v Ferrari is not perfect, but it is a car film like no other and certainly earns a chance in this years Oscar race, as if it didn't have one already.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2021,4/10,Lacking and forgettable. This film is based on a true and interesting story however it fails to deliver. The acting is done well but hurt by poorly written dialogue. The race scenes are hurt by below average CGI. I would recommend not watching this film and just saving your time.
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,8/10,"You can't beat a good old racing car movie . Ever since movies began there have been films about racing . I think they are popular because it's a very uncomplicated format and it's easy for the audience to get caught up in the excitement of what's happening on screen and that's certainly the case with this movie .This is the story of American car designer Carroll Shelby and the fearless British-born driver Ken Miles , who together battled corporate interference, the laws of physics, and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford Motor Company and take on the dominating race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.This is an incredibly enjoyable movie . It looks and sounds fantastic and the two lead performances from Damon and Bale are great .
I loved the side show battle with the suits at Ford . Although obviously exaggerated for dramatic effect , the interference from these corporate idiots is almost as much fun as the racing .For some stupid reason this movie has two titles . In America it's called Ford Vs Ferrari and in the rest of the world it's called Le Mans ' 66 . The director , James Mangold says it's for legal reasons but the consensus is that it was changed because most of the American public have not heard of Le Mans.
I find that hard to believe."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,10/10,"Ford v. Ferrari isn't only the best racing movie of the decade, it's also one of 2019s years strongest films, and I'm just as surprised as you are reading that. I went in with relatively high expectations just due to the director, and I came out with a whole new appreciation for the sport. Mangold puts you front and forward in the action, with some really impressive shots, the technical aspects alone make this one worth watching. But at its core this is a character driven piece with two career best performances from Bale and Damon as Shelby and Miles, who not only have their own issues to deal with, but also that of the big Ford corporation, and a race they are not willing to lose. This film has a bit of everything, from the personal tolls this project has on Miles and his wife and kid, to the exciting 24 hour race, or the inner workings of big business and what crooks they can be, Ford v. Ferrari is a perfect crowd pleasing movie, and overall one that I personally can't wait to watch again.I give Ford v. Ferrari 5 stars out of 5"
FORD V FERRARI,30 June 2020,6/10,For those lovers of racing cars this movie has some great photography and action scenes.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we'd all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.One of the great true stories is that of Ferrari's snubbing of Henry Ford II's attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari's company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.Ford winning LeMans, It's a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.These two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it's these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you'd imagine the real man was like in a kind of ""beyond acting"" if you will. Engrossing.Speaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is an incredible and thrilling racing drama and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year. Christian Bale and Matt Damon both give incredible performances and they have perfect chemistry, although Christian Bale does steal every scene he is in. Jon Bernthal and Tracy Letts are both great. The pacing is incredible as it does not feel as long as it is. The music by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is amazing. James Mangold's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed, resulting in genuinely thrilling racing sequences throughout. It's also surprisingly very funny in certain parts and emotional in others."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,9/10,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the best actors of our generation. Former is car designer whiz Carroll Shelby and Latter is WWII English Driver Ken MilesShelby is the brain and Miles the brawn. Ferrari keeps beating Ford in races and money. And need to find a driver along with keeping Ford in business and not sending thousands out of work.Miles may be a likable jerk but loves his wife and son and would do anything for them despite his car shop closing down over taxes and poor people skills. Also that is when Shelby comes on in as he has better people skills.Despite Ken's faults, Carroll offers Miles the chance to drive the car and save his family's making ends meet and Ford despite big wigs jumping down their throats.Great supporting cast also by Josh Lucas as a jerk auto exec while Jon Bernthal is the sympathetic exec to save Ford. It will get some Oscar nods. But really think Bale and Damon are two of the greatest actors of our generation.It will have a bittersweet ending for sure. Won't spoil it for ya."
FORD V FERRARI,26 January 2020,9/10,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A terrific sports film expertly crafted and a highly entertaining moviegoing experience.JIM'S REVIEW: Hollywood's fascination with the race car genre can be seen with varying degrees of success. Famous actors have felt the need for speed in their careers starting with James Garner in the Oscar-winning Grand Prix (1966), Paul Newman in Winning (1969), Steve McQueen in Le Mans (1971), Burt Reynolds in The Cannonball Run (1981), Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder (1990) and Chris Hemsworth in Rush (2013),...not to mention, the highly profitable The Fast and Furious series. Even The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, revved up in some of his crowd-pleasing movies. Yes, it's definitely a man's world and the testosterone runs high. Now we can add James Mangold's exhilarating joy ride of a movie, Ford v Ferrari, to the list. His film is one of the best sport action films about racing ever made. Gentlemen, start your engines!Ford v Ferrari shows the competitive world of auto racing. Based on a true story, Mr. Mangold sticks mostly to the facts, although he spins his tale a bit to heighten the tension between two racing mavericks, Carroll Shelley, (Matt Damon) a former driver and car designer, and hot-headed British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and the suits at the Ford Motor Company and their interferences with them as their sponsors. Everyone's goal is to beat the No. 1 foreign sports carmaker, Ferrari, and put Ford on the map as a major competitive force in the global market.The story is not your strictly race car movie with fast cars circling lap after lap. The plot does adhere to a predictable formula although the results aren't always that telling. The screenwriting team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller fashion a tried-and-true tale of underdogs fighting against the system, a them vs. us story that works. They wisely do not just rely on the action scenes and take the time to build characters and relationships in between the many terrific racing sequences: the family dynamics of Carroll's wife and son, the budding bromance between Carroll and Ken, the racer and his pit crew, the white collar executives in contrast to the blue collared working man, American know-how vs. European elitism, the psychology and engineering that is involved with this sport. The film tackles bigger issues than most sport movies aspire.Actually, what added to my enjoyment of the film was my lack of knowledge about the real life events and the people involved. Far from being a race car enthusiast, my expectations about the movie were low and I was pleasantly surprised by this film's visually sweep. Credit the strong production values, fine acting, and masterful direction by Mr. Mangold.Foremost is the incredible editing by Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland. (Their cross-cutting of race car action and personal drama is a glorious showcase of intense images seamlessly crafted, especially the nearly half hour climactic sequence of the 1966 Le Mans race.) Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is stunning in every angle, François Audouy's period production design is spot-on, and the sound by Donald Sylvester, Paul Massey, David Giammarco and Steven A. Morrow brings tension and the needed authenticity to the movie. Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' music score heightens the suspense most effectively. This is technically superior filmmaking, a well-made sports movie about the love of the sport.Mr. Mangold's direction is solid if underrated. He crafts his film with style and substance. He also assembles a wonderful cast. Some may not be physically right for their roles but they deliver convincing performances throughout the movie. The chemistry with the two leads is a wonderful mix of contrasting personalities. Mr. Damon uses his likable screen persona and throws in some subtle angst and frustration to his character. Mr. Bale has the showier role but really excels in the film's quieter moments between him and his family. Both are excellent. Caitonia Balfe and Noah Jupe play Carroll's loyal wife, Mollie, and his adoring son, Peter, and they ably provide the human drama. Josh Lucas makes a very compelling villain. Rounding out the ensemble are Ray McKinnon, Remo Girone, JJ Feild, and Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca. Tracy Letts has a memorable spin as the tyrannical Henry Ford II in one of the film's best scenes.Buckle up, moviegoers! Ford v Ferrari is an action-packed thrill ride and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,4/10,"My Rating : 4/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me. The story also has been embellished to confuse the facts for cinematic effect. A real downer!I am not 'H-A-P-P-Y' after watching it - that's for sure!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"When it comes to cars we like them fast and furious, or at least for many that is the dream as handling the monster speed can be overwhelming. So that's where racing comes in, a means to extend one's self into the faceless visage of a Nascar or Formula One in hopes of seeing their heroes win. Yet, what goes into a racecar? For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:Movie: Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019)LIKES:Surprisingly Decent Pace
Funny
Plenty Of Character Integration
Seeing the Rivalry From Many Sides
The Technical Jargon Mixed Well
The Musical Score
The Sound Effects
The Heart
The Finale Of RacingDISLIKES:The Predictability
Loudness
The Drama Vs. Reality
A Little More Integration Of The Wife
The Ending After The RaceSUMMARY:Biography dramas usually don't run at a pace that entertains me fully, but Ford Vs. Ferrari succeeded in this endeavor and put the pedal to the medal in storytelling. The elements of describing the business deals, politics and even development of the car are all a carefully blended together to be engaging without being overbearing for this reviewer. It finds a way to make all this business jargon funny, putting just enough spite, attitude, and stubbornness to work and masterfully relieving the dialog heavy plot. What impressed me even more though was seeing the character integration into this film, finding ways to make characters I care about and how I hoped the policies would not shoot them in the foot, which is key to helping me stay invested in a drama. Bale in particular was my focal point, his character having the most lines cast out and the central engine that drove this car. He plays the part well, adds that charm he brings to many of his roles, and then melds with the rest of the teams. Throw in all the dialogue filled with the jargon and you had me feeling like I was part of each group in the decision to battle the big boys.
However, despite all the heart of the film, most fans are going to want to know how the special effects department works in this film. Good news, for America's love of making things loud, bold, and powerful continues on this look back into the past. For guys like me, the musical score at times amps up the elements with its background noise augmenting the scene and making my skin goosebumps rise in that emotional way. Now add the layer of the sound editing and effects and you get the major effect of this movie. Those who love to listen to their engines roar as they fly down the street, or identify the clicks of the perfect transition to the next gear are going to love this movie. All those elements brought together with the theater sound drop you into the driver seat and gets the blood pumping. Finally, combine that with the visuals and you've got yourself a movie that somehow takes what many consider a dry sport of turning left and instead give you the dynamic element of being in this life or death thrall. When combined with the story, it's magic and gives a purpose to remain entertaining, which can be very difficult in a racing movie without gimmicks (comedy of the Love bug or action of the Fast and Furious).Despite the realistic nature of this film though, it still has some elements I would have liked to see curbed. One, the predictability of the film is still there from the foreshadowing alone, though if you know the history of this movie's plot you'll of course predict the ending (which I didn't). Despite the appreciation for the special effects, yours truly has sensitive ears, so the full volume of the engine roaring can be a little painful/ingratiating if not careful. These minor components aside, the movie's constant question of drama vs reality comes into question, and I feel there was a lot of magic integrated into the film compared to the reality. It adds entertainment, but I wonder just how much of this was true to paint the characters a little more notably, more so Matt Damon's character or the arrogant vice president. In terms of further character integration, I would have liked a little more of the wife, who though was involved throughout the film, felt there was a little more she could have had in here to really pull the film to full circle. My biggest dislike though was the last twenty minutes of the film, which I will not spoil. The film had another point that I felt would have been better to end, and while I understand why they did the last part in terms of closure, the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited down where I think the true story ended, wrapped up with a nice information card montage they do. It's times like these where the last piece is placed that sometimes throw me the wrong way, but I will of course recognize the honor and work they did do in those final moments.The VERDICT:Overall, Ford Vs. Ferrari delivered what I expected and more. It was a drama/biography that was not boring to watch, with a pace that like the car continued to work and immersed you into many aspects of the war between these two. A fantastic balance of story with technical prowess is going to be the entertaining factor for much of the audience and looking at the people around me during my showing should impress the target audience. Sure, it's predictable, a little time bloated, and loud, but the only factors are potentially the movie magic blowing things out of proportion and the potential ending that really had me bugging. Otherwise, outside of not being the most original idea or the most dynamic telling of a story it works for a trip to the theater.My scores are:Drama/Biography/Sports: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,8/10,"Really great movie! Acting is great, and the story is really entertaining. This was a really enjoyable, entertaining movie the whole way through."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,7/10,"Christian Bale is one of the most ironclad, reliable actors on the planet. You pair him with the equally reliable Matt Damon and the well cast, sleazeball-ing Josh Lucas and you get a spot-on, co-starring team. Damon and Bale don accents and trade torque/throttle in Ford v Ferrari (my latest review).Ford v Ferrari's true story goes like this: A car designer named Carroll Shelby (Damon) and a hard-edged race car driver named Ken Miles (Bale), try to best Enzo Ferrari's souped-up automobiles via the 1966 Le Mans. In truth, Ford v Ferrari is a longing film that ends on a down note but it's not without a touch of energy and the almighty whimsical.Ford v Ferrari's running time flies by even at 152 minutes. Most of these minutes involve mild emotion undercut with some heart-pounding, endurance race sequences. If you like a superior sense of time and place, then Ford v Ferrari will give you your mid 60s fix. And if you wanna see a more sophisticated version of say, Days of Thunder, then Ford v Ferrari will make you forget about that commercialized, Tom Cruise vehicle (no pun intended).Directed by New Yorker James Mangold with its vroom vroom scenes shot at ground level, Ford v Ferrari is the type of flick that needs to be seen with the best movie theater sound system possible. Mangold knows how to film racing action no doubt. He avoids all the Fast & Furious BS and instead opts for minimal flash and loads of stash. Yup, it's about the clamor here. You can hear the fuel burning, the tires screeching, the engine humming, the studs spinning, and the racers rubbing. It's decibel, ear orgasmic.Now Ford v Ferrari does fail to fully flesh out its 2-3 main characters (that's rare for a 2 and a half hour pic). And yeah, the film's first half has a lot more collared, dramatic momentum. Still, with smooth direction by James Mangold, some capable editing by Michael McCusker, some sleek rides, and a bleached out, beach blanket be-bop look, Ford v Ferrari provides the viewer with an old-world night at the cineplex. Call it ""stampede for speed"". Rating: 3 stars."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.Ferrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.Beneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.We all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.Ford V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.I recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language. Even if you're not a race car fanatic, there's a good chance you'll love this film. I happily give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is easily one of my favorites of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2020,8/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is a truly exciting film, one that delivers an experience. While it contains plenty of technical car or racing jargon it is enough to follow to be taken along for the ride. Suspense is built up nicely and we got to experience a rush at key moments. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are great and literally take this film all the way to the finish line. You don't need to be a car enthusiast to appreciate this decent film. One can honestly appreciate the history, classic rivalry and heart that goes into something. A great experience and well made film. 8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,12 November 2019,7/10,"Fresh off directing Logan and making waves with Walk the Line, James Mangold has created a car racing epic that is much better than Rush."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,7/10,"An excellent biopic, similar to Rush, it has great racing scenes and cars. Excellent acting and story. I recommend this film."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2019,8/10,"Matt Damon has to be one of the most underrated Hollywood actors of his time, yet, time and again, he gives exceptional performances, whether they be as quirky characters, the butt of a joke or a straight up dramatic role. This film is no exception. The way he and Christian Bale play off against each other is remarkable to watch. You don't have to be a car fan to like this movie but if you can imagine yourself sitting in the seat of these exceptional machines you will ride every curve and straightway of this movie. It is fun. It is well performed. It is well written. It is great personal drama. I give this movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {True Life Drama}"
FORD V FERRARI,26 May 2021,8/10,But the problem with this kind of movie is too predictable but either way I really loved this movie to was nostalgic.
FORD V FERRARI,6 May 2020,7/10,"... but are some things or careers or professions worth paying the ultimate price for?So often the case, then as now, the team makes the difference and the paymasters do their best to scupper it through folly and ignorance."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,8/10,"Driven by a high-speed bromance between two of Hollywood's finest (Bale and Damon), Ford v Ferrari is a fantastic film both on counts of character development and racing set-pieces. The writers (the Butterworths and Jason Keller) set the film between 1963 and 1966, giving the characters of Caroll Shelby (Damon), Ken Miles (Bale), Mollie Miles (Balfe), Peter Miles (Jupe), Iacocca (Bernthal), and Henry Ford II (Letts) sufficient time, screen-space, and dialogues to be built from the ground up.Even for viewers who aren't into automobiles, Ford v Ferrari will be an enjoyable watch owing to Mangold's energetic direction and the screen chemistry between Damon and Bale. Their friendship has been written and portrayed with the kind of warmth that everyone is bound to find engaging. There are differences in tastes and opinions, but when the duo gets down to the racing business, it's all respect for each other. Shelby, a notable (former) race car driver and automotive designer, is the DRIVING FORCE and Miles, a World War II veteran is the DRIVER here. The dynamics between them are brilliant and truly a sight to see on the screen.Ford v Ferrari also succeeds in building up great supporting acts - a tongue-in-cheek Iacocca, a concerned wife in Mollie, a somewhat adorable Petey, a no-nonsense Henry Ford II, a cunning Leo Beebe, and a seething Enzo Ferrari. As much as the film is about the rivalry between the two automobile giants, it's about the drama (a.k.a the little things) too. Like, Miles having a moment with his wife and kid, Shelby contemplating his career, a funny-as-hell tussle between Shelby and Miles, and sleepless nights before the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Speaking of Le Mans, it does make sense for the viewer to have some context on this form of endurance racing to truly know what racers (in this case, Ken Miles) ought to have gone through.Ford v Ferrari has a thrilling final hour with one of the best-ever racing set-pieces to be captured on film. Mangold truly lets the cars burn the tarmac when they should, in a finale that looks every bit authentic with little to no CGI. This may also be why every crash-and-burn shot feels a lot more concerning than otherwise. There's also the scene set ten minutes before the commencement of Le Mans, with Miles walking into the arena with a teacup in hand to a packed house, Shelby next to him; the duo watch the cars being set-up, the Ferraris pass them by, Enzo's looking down at them from the stands; the tensive mood pervading the entire arena is conveyed beautifully. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting memory.This is a film that makes you want to look up more of the Le Mans if you haven't already. And that, by default, makes Ford v Ferrari a raging win in my books."
FORD V FERRARI,5 November 2019,8/10,"Le Mans '66I saw this at the Cineworld secret screening and my heart sank having already condemned it from the trailer. I loath movies about racing cars and I hate Christian Bale with a vengeance. Well despite these ""minor"" prejudices this was a really great movie.Centering on a biopic of Ken Miles life as a racing car driving, played by Bale, and his friend Carroll Shelby, played by Damon. These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale's diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.The elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60's.With regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them. Ditto for best movie."
FORD V FERRARI,13 January 2021,8/10,"What I enjoyed the most about this film is the way in which the film manages to present both the intellectual and emotional aspects of the story with such a clear vision. At no point do anything ever felt confused. In terms of the car design process and the racing it is perfectly clear what is happening and why. Then in terms of the corporate politics that are at play in the offices that too is written in such a way as to make it easy for the viewer to follow. This film is based on a true story, about which I knew nothing. One of the things I like is watching how much ego and marketing is almost sabotaging the project from the inside. When it comes to building and presenting a Ford racing car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, it's clear that everybody wants to win. It's just that too many people had different opinions about how best to achieve that goal; and whether winning the race is indeed the ultimate goal. As previously alluded to Ford Jr is a proud man, who cares about the company having a reliable image. Shelby and Miles didn't care so much about image. They just wanted to build and race the best possible car they could. This internal power struggle is interesting.
The film is carry by strong performances, particularly those of the co-leads Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon's Carroll Shelby had the incredibly difficult task of having to play the game, managing not only Miles and the car design, but also be the middle man dealing with Ford himself. I feel like Damon nailed this role, demonstrating his great mix of dramatic and comedic chops. Bale's Ken Miles had to balance his passion for racing with his commitment to supporting his family; and it's that aspect of his character that I think makes the performance so impressive. Together I thought their friendship was excellent. The rest of the supporting casts provide good support. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a well-put movie."
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,2/10,"Couldn't get past a few minutes. Just seemed stupid. Damon is a pain to watch. He's such a below average type guy. He seems like the butt of every joke whenever he's in the room. Bale just keeps playing the same character over and over from The Fighter. This was a really corny one. It transformed Los Angeles, but I just lost interest quickly. It's like a Disney movie almost. Might be good, but not my type of movie.2 stars"
FORD V FERRARI,24 June 2020,8/10,Awesome real story between two car racers...the story is good and manu goosebumb moments in that movie...really i dont like those car race movies but in this case i like this movie and i interested to watch this flick...
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,8/10,"Yet another example that the adjective ""Hollywood"" is not always a pejorative. This movie had all of the elements of a big Hollywood blockbuster: a noble goal, two attractive protagonists fighting against the odds, an evil power-broker, and a wrench. The wrench part only makes sense if you've seen the movie, although I wouldn't classify this as a spoiler.It's based on a true story, but there probably isn't any more history to back this up than there was for the Star Wars movies, but we get it. As facile and cliché as this was at times, there were some great performances and just enough solid drama and humor to pull it off. Like so many films these days, I thought it was a bit long at 2 hours and 32 minutes, but it wasn't intolerable."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"Automotive geniuses sell their soul to corporate bureaucracy in effort to develop killer endurance race car. Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,,"FORD V FERRARIThe battle between Ford and Ferrari has not gone down as one of the previous century's most important or serious, but, it does provide a nice backdrop for this entertaining drama.
FORD V FERRARI focuses on Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a one-time Le Mans champion race car driver (1959) who was forced into retirement. He helps design new vehicles including hot-headed journeyman driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale). When the Ford motor company contacts Shelby in 1964 with the idea of helping them design a car that can beat the vaunted Ferrari line of winners at Le Mans and it's charismatic owner Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Shelby enlists Miles and his band of mechanics and friends to take on the task.
Of course, working for the huge Ford corporation means also dealing with corporate interference. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is portrayed as the benign intermediary between Shelby and The Man -- Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts). VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is the 'heavy' -- the kiss ass in the company who only looks out for himself. The company politics angle could have been interesting, but Ford and, especially, Beebe are cartoonish villains. Letts and Lucas do the best they can, but, just come off as buffoons more appropriate for a sit-com than the big screen.
Fortunately, when the action sticks to the racetrack, the movie mostly hums. Francois Audouy's Production Design is sharp and captured well by Phedon Papamichael's cinematography (although, like with NEBRASKA one wishes he'd tone down the digital 'grain'). It's a well-done physical and aural (David Giammarco's sound design is aces) production all around. The large cast acquits itself well. Damon is very effective as the driven but level-headed Shelby. Bale gets the showier role and relishes it. Caitriona Balfe brings some perk to the stock role of Miles' patient wife.
James Mangold Directs with a sure hand. His insistence on accuracy (for the most part) and actual vehicles and locations rather than a surfeit of CGI gives the movie some grit and verve that helps make up for the 'sports film' cliches which hamper the screenplay (three writers). Mangold is a pretty strong writer himself (LOGAN, COP LAND), so it's unfortunate he apparently didn't have much input there. The epilogue is surprisingly melancholy and lifts the movie from the standard -- Rah! Rah! straight to the credits finale -- most sports films settle for. The maturity only highlights how lite much of the rest of the movie is. FORD V FERRARI is the kind of A List big budgeted drama that is rarely seen any more. It's enjoyable, but, a mediocre script keeps it from finishing higher."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,7/10,"I'll come right out and say that cars are one of the least interesting things in the world to me (perhaps only behind The Royal Family, fashion, and reality TV). If a car has four wheels, starts, and can maintain the speed limit: I'm happy. So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.On the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.So the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.Give it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen."
FORD V FERRARI,11 August 2021,6/10,"I'm not sure there's one original thing in Ford v Ferrari. It's as though they took a basic biopic script outline and plugged in all the information that was pertinent to the 1966 Le Mans race. The only reason this movie ranks reasonably well for me and not bottom of the barrel is the fact that I like biopics like this one. Even though I can predict every single beat before it happens, I enjoy the ride. It makes me smile at the right moments, and makes me sad at the right moments. I will note that it never once made me cry, though. I think I could see the strings being pulled a bit too clearly, so the movie became a somewhat mechanical experience and not one that impacted me with any deep emotions. The cast were all solid in their roles, there were moments that made me chuckle, and I do feel like I learned a bit more about this particular race than I originally knew. Ford v Ferrari is a movie that is perfectly acceptable, but never more than that. Perhaps, I've reached that cynical older age where the Hollywood machine can't churn out a movie that tells history in a way that feels ""real"" to me, because I've seen so many others do it the same way before. Inevitably I find myself thinking, ""Maybe this would be better as a documentary."""
FORD V FERRARI,9 April 2020,8/10,"'Ford v Ferrari', or 'Le Mans '66' as it is titled here in the UK, is a very enjoyable and extremely well-made racing drama film. It gets the balance between storytelling and action just about right, ensuring it is both entertaining and informative/educational as a true story and biography piece.My knowledge of racing and cars in general is rather limited, and I certainly had no prior knowledge of Ken Miles before watching this film, but 'Ford v Ferrari' does a great job at being accessible to all audiences rather than just those with an interest in this area. It's easy to follow and you need very little knowledge of motoring to understand what's going on.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are excellent in their roles. Bale in particular impressed me with his accurate Brummie accent, which can't have been easy to pull off. 'Ford v Ferrari' is great - recommended for everybody, but for racing fans it is definitely a must-see."
FORD V FERRARI,22 December 2020,8/10,"Even though I'm more into motorcycles myself I am not completely uninterested in cars and racing; I wouldn't watch a race but I did find the topic exciting. However, considering the writing, editing, and acting I am pretty sure this is a crowd pleaser even if you have zero interest in cars. And if you are into this, you can add another star to my rating as this will blow you away!"
FORD V FERRARI,1 January 2021,5/10,"Although actors look confident, cool, and immersed into film, and movie is based on serious and realistic topic - sports, competition - and motivates us to become better either in cars, or any sports, or anything even unrelated, I did not like this movie so much. It is too much subjective, based on luck and probability, too egoistic, and motivates us in a bad way, that is to drive recklessly. Also too long and not focused on any specific strategy, lesson, point, but luck and randomness. Motivates us at least to improve in some skill, even if unrelated to cars. There are much better and more interesting movies of Matt Daemon. Maybe only good for males or sports lovers. Also motivates video game lovers to play such video games as Need for Speed."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2020,7/10,"Motor racing films always ooze swagger. I hate motor sport, but the films a la baseball always deliver. James Mangold has a good back catalogue, and i feel he has a decent stab at this.Le Mans '66 is an exploration of this odd-couple relationship, fascinated with ideas of masculinity. And if you can get past Bale's odd 'Brummie' accent it mostly works. The spectre of death lingers in every frame. The racing scenes are anxiety-inducing, with the camera keeping low to the ground bringing smashed-up cars careening into view.Yet the film's greatest trick is saved for the final reel. For much of its running time, you're fooled into thinking Mangold had made a grand sporting ode to the American dream. And then the rug is pulled right out from underneath your feet. Le Mans '66 may revel in the high life, but its finale feels devastatingly hollow."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,Whilst very different along with the joker this is by far my joint favourite film of the year the first racing film I can remember seeing in a long time I felt like I was living and breathing the car scenes as the driver with the emotional oomph added by a simply sublime Damon and Bale made this flawless on every level. A real must watch!
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,"This is why I love going to big screen cinemas.
Larger than life and immersive theatre. What an amazing experience. A petrolhead's dream movie.Bale is fantastic as always, Damon solid and the rest of the cast good.The racing is extraordinary. Such fantastic cinematography.If you love cars, history, or just a good movie, this is for you!"
FORD V FERRARI,30 June 2020,10/10,"You get Matt and Christian so right there we are running straight, hot and normal. As for the movie, well how do you like your adrenaline? Here it comes in waves, stops and starts, slow then rush and when a time out comes you take it! What a ride (pun intended). I don't follow this sport but now that I know what is behind so much of what I have seen and head about race cars, tracks, engines and the like I can see why others choose this for their past-time and pleasure. Racing scenes are up to par and presented realistically and one can only imagine the real thing. Keep in mind that only the crème del la crème reaches the top in any sports field and then they surround themselves with other like-minded pros and a professional competitive sports team is formed. This is the case here and aptly demonstrated. There are scenes where brakes turn red hot I mean who can imagine that? The closest we come is riding brakes downhill but they don't turn hot even though I have seen big rigs pull-over because there was smoke/smell coming from their brakes and tires. Also I never knew what Daytona was all about or Le mans either. And stop think about this. Building machines that can move so fast that we measure the speed via RPM's on a dial because we cannot track it any other way. I mean you can normally drive your car for approx 400k miles and 30 years and just replace parts here and there. These boys race a car into its useful life in one big race necessitating replacement of everything after race is over. Amazing pushing of the limits here. Recommend popcorn or sunflower or pumpkin seeds less you fingers make their way to your mouth and you chew nails for some scenes. Include a tasty drink too. Oh, and fasten your seat-belt....LOL"
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,"This is the story of how Ford took on Ferrari at the Lemons 24 hour race.This film is unlike most modern films I have seen in the last few years in that it didn't try to dazzle me with effects, subvert my expectations, throw in twenty plot twists, rectify social inequalities, push agendas or try and be more clever than it is.It just tells a good story with great characters and then, ends.
This seems such a rare thing now days.The race scenes are exhilarating, the humorous parts made me smile and the emotional scenes were touching.
The film wrapped up in under two hours and left me feeling entertained. (edit: sorry, this film is well over two hours - it sure didn't feel like it.)It has some petrol-head talk in it but anything important was simplified to a level even I could understand.Now I doubt the film, despite being based on a true story, matches reality that closely but I enjoyed it so much I don't care enough to check.A great move that won't blow your mind but will leave you entertained."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,4/10,"There is some really good acting from all the principals in this film, but the direction is slow and shoddy and the script itself calls for too many shots of people changing gears, cars moving around the track, etc. Equally disappointing is the failure to once mention the Corvette, the raison d'etra for the Mustang in the first place."
FORD V FERRARI,9 March 2020,9/10,"How did this not win more awards?I am stupefied. This was an amazing tour de force of a movie.Bale & Damon knock it out of the racetrack.When they get to fisticuffs and Mollie brings out a chair & beer to watch. Gold simply gold!Whether completely true or not, this movie does not shine a good light on Ford or BeeBee. If their true actions were anything close to portrayed in the movie - they deserved every bit.Great movie. If I had more time - I would have watched it again!"
FORD V FERRARI,14 April 2021,9/10,"Pretty good story of how Ford's big money could buy and make build the top car of the end of 60s. We follow Ken Miles, Carroll Shelby and his team to achieve it and battle against the corporate team with the same car. Hilarious and high adrenaline."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,7/10,"With an amazing production, great acting overall and a story filled with punches for those that don't know what happened (like me), it gets the job done and creates a very entertaining movie.
But I do think the story is too big or epic for its own good.
It feels not long enough to tell the whole thing, but also too long with boring moments or elements. Pass of time is poorly managed and it bothered me quite a few times.The races are perfect though. Visually stunning. And with together with all the car related stuff, made up for the best part of the movie in the perfect second act.
The acting, awesome. But is Bale, who gets the flashier role, that steals the show.
The movie is also quite funny, although not constantly. But when it makes a joke, it lands.I still think is a bit overrated though, because almost none of the emotional plots landed for me, and at times it felt a bit clichéd."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"I love a good film based on historical events. I knew I had to see this in IMAX format as soon as I heard about it. I'm not the biggest gear head but I do know the talent of the cast involved and the director involved so I knew we would be getting something worth watching. Having seen this in IMAX now, I will say that this film needs to be seen in that type of high quality to feel the rush, intensity, and thrill of the races. This film is a bit long in the tooth but a great watch.The film is about the real life events of Caroll Shelby working with Henry Ford the Second to build a fast race car that would beat the best Ferrari has to offer. Shelby has a limited time frame to work with and enlists the help of hot headed Ken Miles, an exceptional race car driver who is initially at odds with the Ford company. The film follows their bond and their progress as they not only build the car but go head to head with Ferrari during the 1966 Le Mans race.The film's racing sequences are some of the best in a car themed movie I have ever seen. Heightened by the theater experience everything was eye catching and intense. On top of that you have two extremely charismatic leads who do very well in their roles. The film also has humor here and there. Its a very interesting and inspiring story and you don't have to be a car fanatic tot enjoy the film. James Mangold's quality behind the camera shows with every detail captured.My main complaint for the film comes from its running length. its a long 2 and a half hours and at times feels its length. I couldn't help but think a good half an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor. Its a one time watch through and through but a great effort. I think the film will be up for some of the more technical aspect Academy Award nominations. If you are a film lover, you need to see what is arguably the best racing movie ever.8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2021,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari (Le Mans '66) is a film I wanted to watch at the cinema but couldn't find the time, fast forward to 2021 I finally got the opportunity to watch and experience James Mangold's spectacular viewing experience, I just wish I saw it at the cinema. It's an incredible movie.The film is written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. It tells the story of the 1960s rivalry between Ford and Ferrari at the Le Mans auto race and Shelby's friendship with legendary race car driver Ken Miles.The film stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale in the lead roles with Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone and Ray McKinnon in supporting roles. Matt Damon portrays Carroll Shelby whilst Christian Bale portrays Ken Miles, both of them gave terrific performances and did the people whom they portrayed justice, regarding mannerism and such. They steal the spotlight in every scene they're in, one other actor who I want to praise is Jon Bernthal who portrays Lee Iacocca.The racing sequences are just breathtaking, so well done and makes me who aren't super interested in racing interested. It's engaging and suspenseful, it's cinematic as well. Mangold's direction and the editing is a huge part of it and it doesn't stop there. The direction, editing, sound editing and music is all award worthy, the same with the performances. Marco Beltrami continues to amaze me with his musical score, it's perfect. It's also a very nice looking film, the sets are marvelous and so is the cinematography.It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the ten best films of 2019, and I have to agree. Ford v Ferrari (Le Mans 66) is a great historical drama, incredible and stunning to look at. Masterpiece."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"Peacefully gazing into the dusk sky, racer savant Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, lies on the race track next to his son Peter, played by innocently radiant Noah Jupe. Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: ""Everything slows down"". Ken says introspectively, ""You see everything."" That's the freedom and joy of doing what you love.Director James Mangold's ""Ford v Ferrari"" tells the story of Ford Motor Company's challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll's volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.Carroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he's the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don't appreciate his art, his love.In the movie's opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He's in the zone. His epiphany, ""The only question that really matters: Who are you?"" As much as ""Ford v Ferrari"" is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.Christian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James's ""Ford V Ferrari"", 'racing' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances. They're both Oscar worthy.At the 'dog and pony show' for Ford's unveiling of their Mustang car, Matt's Carroll accepts Ford's job to engineer a car to win at Le Mans. Charismatic Matt recalls the wisdom of Carroll's Father, who advised to do what you love, then ""it's no longer a job"". Matt poignantly says, ""Find what you have to do..."" Amen.Carroll sees the best in Christian's Ken. Ken is the 45 year-old World War II Hero, who's broke, and running his own automotive repair shop. His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.Although, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he's the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.Predictably, Leo's egomania tests Carroll's loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.Phedon Papmichael's cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian's visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.My favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian's Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That's ""the perfect lap"". Peter asks, what if you can't race ""the perfect lap"". Ken smiles, ""You keep trying."" Because that's what you do for what you love. That's what makes ""Ford v Ferrari"" so very special too."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,9/10,"Full disclosure: I'm not a ""car guy."" Sure, my education was in Mechanical Engineering, and I can appreciate well-crafted machines, but I see cars as mere tools to get from point A to point B. Consequently, I don't have much interest in car racing and didn't initially want to see Ford v Ferrari (2019). Luckily for me, this film was chosen as one of this year's nominees for Best Picture. After watching it, I can clearly see why. For someone who isn't into cars or racing, I was completely enthralled and entertained by Ford v Ferrari.This movie is a tour de force when it comes to several filmmaking aspects. It expertly used its sound design, music, and cinematography to give the raw tension of racing highly-engineered machines meant for one thing only: to go fast. In fact, I only had two qualms with this movie on the whole. First, the ""marketing guy antagonist"" seemed a little cliché, even if I'm sure there was plenty of truth in what happened. Second, there are only so many racing sequences I can take before they all start looking the same. I understand there were a lot of individual races-many of which lasted for an eye-watering 24 hours-but it almost becomes tedious to see the same portions of the racetrack again and again.As for the acting, I felt Christian Bale and Matt Damon hit it out of the park with their performances. I felt emotional connections to their motivations and their frustrations with being unable to accomplish the impossible. Overall, the story is gripping and intense, with a fantastic twist near the end that I won't give away because it was such a gut punch. I'm glad that I had the chance to see this movie in the theater just for the pure spectacle of it on the big screen with the power of the sound system bringing every rumbling engine to life.An almost perfect movie about the synergy of competitive man and engineered machine, I give Ford v Ferrari 4.5 stars out of 5."
FORD V FERRARI,23 September 2021,9/10,"For a film based on events based on a true story, James Mangold brings racing and cars to the heart, making the audience care and want to know more about Ford v Ferrari. Matt Damon does a fine job playing Carroll Shelby (inventor of the Shelby Mustang) and the winner of the 1959 Le Mans. Christian Bale plays Ken Miles, the British driver brought in by Shelby to race in the late 60s Le Mans races. Bale was great in the role, better than his Batman days.For fans of racing films and racing in general, you will really enjoy the story and the direction that Mangold gives. And for those on the fence about Matt Damon, I have to say I really enjoyed watching him in this film, probably one of his best roles in years. He and Bale played very well off one another, and it made for a very enjoyable film."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a biopic about American car designer, Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) & race car driver, Ken Miles(Christian Bale). Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles have to fight against interruptions from the corporate higher-ups, deal with their personal problems & the various nitty-gritties of physics, to build a near-perfect race car for Ford to go up against Ferrari, at the 24 Hours Le Mans race of 1966.Ford v Ferrari is a mind-blowing film. Director James Mangold has given us a movie, that perfectly showcases the lives & friendship between Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles. The emotional scenes & the intense scenes have been perfectly balanced with generous doses of comedy, throughout. The racing set pieces are the highlight of the film. You actually feel like you're in the driver's seat, with all the race car drivers. The experience is just absolutely edge of the seat & mesmerizing! Matt Damon is outstanding as Carroll Shelby. Christian Bale is spectacular as Ken Miles. Damon & Bale share this effortless bonhomie & camaraderie, throughout. Jon Bernthal is brilliant as Lee Iacocca. Caitriona Balfe is excellent as Mollie Miles. Josh Lucas is fantastic as Leo Beebe. Noah Jupe is adorable & perfect as Peter Miles. Tracy Letts is superb as Henry Ford II. The supporting cast is great. Ford v Ferrari is a must watch. Race to a theater near you, as soon as possible!"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,9/10,"Most people are attending - or staying away from - the new James Mangold film, FORD v FERRARI because it is a ""race car flick"". But to label it as just that is doing a disservice to this film, so if that is what is keeping you away from this movie, think again, for this film is much more than a race car film.It is, at it's core, a film about friendship and loyalty in the face of adversity and is a very serious contender for multiple awards this Oscar season.A long gestating film project (Director Mangold first came across this property in 2010), FORD v FERRARI tells the tale of the Ford Motor Company's attempt to unseat the Italian car company, Ferrari, as an elite race car producer by defeating it on it's own turf - the 24 hour race at LeMans.Entrusted to make this dream a reality by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is (now) legendary race car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who turns to his reckless friend - and top race car driver - Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help put this project over the top.Will this duo succeed? Will Ford topple Ferrari? Can Shelby help smooth the rough waters that the temperamental Miles will, inevitably, create? What do you think?But it is the journey - and not the destination - that is the joy of this film, for under the watchful, steady eye of veteran Director Mangold (WALK THE LINE) this film is much, much more than the cliched journey of a maverick bucking the system to, ultimately, prevail. It is a study of friendship and loyalty under intense pressure and Mangold finds the right balance between showing hardcore racing and the friendship and camaraderie of Miles and Shelby.Mangold, of course, smartly knew that the success (or failure) of this film will rest on the chemistry between the two leads of this film - and he cast them well. Matt Damon brings his usual charm and easy-going attitude to Carroll Shelby, making him the heart and anchor of this film - we see the events unfold through his eyes - and he is a an easy stand-in for the audience during the proceedings and is someone that we are happy, and comfortable, to spend the 2 1/2 hours of this film with.This is good, for he is strongly complimented - and challenged - by the hard intensity that Christian Bale brings to his portrayal of Ken Miles. This real-life racing car legend is driven (pun intended) to excellence, and does not suffer fools gladly. We spend a good amount of time in this film with Miles staring intently out the window of his race car and no one does smoldering, staring intensity better than Bale. This is another Oscar-worthy performance by an actor who has made a career of Oscar-worthy performances and has me asking - is he the finest actor working today? He certainly is in the conversation.Bale and Damon play off each other very well, their chemistry seems real and we believe that these are 2 old friends working together. This is the first pairing of these two, and based on these results, I would guess that we'll be seeing these two in a film together again.They are joined by strong supporting work by the likes of Letts, Jon Bernthal (portraying Lee Iacocca) and Caitriona Balfe (as Miles wife, Mollie). Only Josh Lucas (as the a-hole antagonist of the film) fares less well as his character is written in one note and Lucas just plays that note.The racing scenes are well done - giving us the visceral intensity of what it must be like in the car, and in the pits, of a major race experience. But it is the friendship between Miles and Shelby that really is the engine that drives this film.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
FORD V FERRARI,13 July 2020,8/10,"I'm another who is not a racing car enthusiast. In fact my better half was the prime mover in us seeing Ford V Ferrari, James Mangold's clearly, fairly true story of Ford's attempts to achieve dominance over perennial podium finishers, the Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. This surprisingly entertaining and thrilling story is told through the eyes of Ford's chief contracted hirelings, Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, and his preferred driver, the abrasive, but extremely talented Ken Miles. Shelby, an ex race car driver and Le Mans winner, will build the race car, whilst Miles, a failed small businessman, will hopefully achieve the desired result on the track. The story, as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller, essentially sees Shelby and Miles, facing Ferrari on the track, but at the same time, having to wage war with powerful Ford executives, to insure the project remains their creation, rather than become some manipulated corporate play thing.This is essentially the plot, though just like any good drive, there are plenty of twists and turns along the journey to the waved checkered flag at the end of the big race. As the 2 leads, Matt Damon (Shelby) and Christian Bale (Miles) are excellent, with Bale. especially shining as the idiosyncratic, volatile Miles, who only ever appears to fully let his guard down, when in the company of his beloved wife and son. The chameleon like Bale, for once coming close to speaking in his natural English dialect, delivers yet another vivid characterization along the lines of his Oscar-winning performance as the broken ex-boxer Dicky in The Fighter. In what transparently is very much a ""boys with big toys"" movie, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, succeeds in stamping a lasting, if only moderate, female presence in a narrative. peopled mainly by men battling to establish, corporate, sporting and at times social superiority over their rivals and perceived enemies. As a contrast, Shelby (who sounds like he had one hell of a private/domestic life ... married 7 times I think) deliberately remains a cypher domestically in Ford v Ferrari.Visually and technically the film looks and sounds fantastic, really adding to the experience and adrenaline rush of an elite motorsport film. Kudos of course to the extensive list of stunt drivers, who make it all happen. But the transitions between actors and professional drivers are seamless. By the time the admittedly engrossing climactic stretch rolls around after an arguably overlong 2+ hours, Ford v Ferrari has certainly confirmed its place as a solid reality - based drama that will undoubtedly fare best among car buffs, but can be very much appreciated by confirmed passengers like myself."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,,"You can't but help but root for Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles ... they're kind of the real racing die-hards being used like pawns by Ford management of the time. The movie leads up to the dramatic 1966 24-hour endurance racing event in Le Mans, France.What a great story! It brings together luminaries of the time like Enzo Ferrari, Henry Ford and Carroll Shelby in a fascinating true historical event. We also learn of a name that should be honored in like, namely Ken Miles. The movie has great characters, action, suspense and an amazing ending.For me, one of the coolest scenes in the movie is when Henry Ford II takes a ride with Shelby in the GT race car. He is overwhelmed with awe of what cars have become since his grandfather's time. The GT is no model-T.The 2.5 hour run time breezes and it's hard not to be glued to the screen the whole time. The movie's a winner in my book."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,7/10,There seem to have been a lot of movies in 2019 based on factual events. This movie looks at Ford motor company's attempt to conquer the motor racing awards in the 1960's. The company was in need of some good PR in order to restore it's reputation. As with all fact based movies you are always left wondering which parts are true and which are artistic license.The movie tells the story of how the Ford team try to beat the all powerful Ferrari team. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby who heads up the team. His friend and lead driver is the rather unlikable Ken Miles played by Christian Bale. I've always been a big fan of Christian Bale and he's on form again here.This is a great racing movie and well worth a watch.
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,7/10,"The trailers for ""Ford v Ferrari"" are very stylish. I thought the entire film would be as stylish and that I'd like it, even though I knew it was mostly a guy flick about cars. Well, not so much.""Ford v Ferrari"" is a lot of vroom vroom, men with motor oil on their faces, guys punching each other, guys clapping each other on the back, guys bonding over car guts, guys drinking beer, guys giving each other death stares, guys insulting each other, guys daring and double daring each other, guys modifying car hoods, car brakes, car doors, and car weights, and some more, a lot more, vroom vroom.There is a woman - just one - and she mostly stands off to the sidelines looking fondly, proudly, and tearfully at her man. Yeah, I got bored, but I woke myself up for the final stretch.""Ford v Ferrari"" depicts Henry Ford II's effort to defeat Enzo Ferrari's cars at the 24-hour Le Mans race in France during the 1960s. Christian Bale gives a fun performance as Ken Miles, the WW II veteran and race car driver who drove the Ford car at Le Mans. Matt Damon is rather bland as Carroll Shelby, former racer, engineer, and Ken Miles wrangler. Tracy Letts, the playwright who wrote ""August Osage County,"" gives an understated but arresting performance as Henry Ford II.Josh Lucas, who was so good as the romantic lead in ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" plays a villain version of Leo Beebe, a Ford executive. I knew nothing about Beebe but I found his depiction in the movie to be cartoonish. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a story headlined ""Philly Friends Of Leo Beebe Say 'Ford V Ferrari' Gets The Ford Exec Wrong."" The article quotes a slew of people who knew Beebe and who say he was a great guy. Shame on ""Ford v Ferrari"" for turning him into a cartoon bad guy in what may be the only movie to feature him as a character. And please make Josh Lucas a romantic lead again.Overall, a good movie, but not so good that it could keep me, not a car lover, fully engaged. The lengthy scenes of Bale as Miles driving for 24 hours around the track at Le Mans gave me a sense of why racers enjoy what they do."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"I'm not a big car racing fan when my wife dragged me to see Ford. But with all the personalities involved, I was hooked shortly into the movie, which never let me go.
Sure, the car racing action is top-notch. But what got me super interested in this were all the different characters portrayed, from Ken Miles, the iconoclastic driver/mechanic, to Carroll Shelby, the race car innovator, to yes, even the villain of the movie, Leo Beebe, Ford's marketing executive. All the gears meshed perfectly to create a palate of memorable players fighting against and with each other to achieve different goals.
Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
FORD V FERRARI,10 September 2019,9/10,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"My Review - Ford V Ferrari
Mr rating. 8.5 /10I don't have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.Ford V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken MilesThe bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West's 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.The story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.For me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes
Matt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it's Christian Bale that steals the film he's a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn't suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he'll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.Matt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he's not a ""Ford Man.""
Henry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .Ken Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.I thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it's one of the best movies of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,8/10,"I cant help but have a soft spot fore these kind of movies. post war engineering is just something incredible. its very much like ""First Man"" but the cinematography is a little less sublime. this movie makes up for that with some better writing.8/10: great"
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,8/10,"The first act is like a rushed, convoluted mess; the rest of the film is almost Rush-like!Side-note : Christian Bale definitely deserved to be nominated for best leading role just like De Niro.(8/10)"
FORD V FERRARI,1 January 2020,8/10,"F you didn't know who Carroll Shelby was, you don't know about car racing or about automotive performance, period. I didn't know who Kenneth Henry Miles (Ken Miles) was before this movie, so that makes me almost as poor and would-be connoisseur as you, almost. Anyway, this movie is for us racing enthusiasts and also for those who enjoy a good movie, in that the performances of the actors, the script, the direction and technical aspects mesh so well that you get immersed in the story, fictional or not; this movie was not fictional, but almost mythical if you revere the sport of car racing. It still is an awesome movie if you're not a sports car buff, because it shines in depicting human personality and character.The days when grand prix racing and endurance racing was as much about the iconic drivers as it was about the machines, and both made newspaper headlines, those days have changed. Rarely do either make headlines anymore, other than in specialty magazines. I can't say things have changed that much since the 60's with respect to the drivers but they sure were more demanding on them in that time in history than they are today; thanks to people like Jackie Stewart, the sport is driver safety aware where it was all about the speed and winning years ago.That emotional drive to win was consuming for the rare few who were at the top of their game and that is what transpired for me in this movie. You'll see two men, Shelby and Miles, played respectively by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who became best friends because they shared one thing that set both of them apart from others, even though their personalities were different, they were true professionals and the best. Movies are not made about people who aren't exceptional and this movie proves that point as much as it shows exceptional people are also very ordinary and like you and me in all other manners except for that thing which makes them exceptional.A good movie should take you on an emotional ride, pun very much intended, and this one will do that. As movie reviews go, there are also best ones, and for that sort of review of 'Ford v Ferrari' check out Movie Reviews from the Dark by IMDb's own ferguson-6."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"Drama - Racing movie based on actual events.Follows the rivalry in 1960's between two iconic car manufacturers.Ford wants to improve its image, so enlists Carrol Shelby to design a new sports car and gives him 90days, the objective is to beat Ferrari at Le Mans.There's great chemistry between the level-headed designer Carroll Shelby and his unpredictable, very hothead driver Ken Miles.Very exciting racing scenes with very little CGI that delivers realistic driver's perspectives, passenger perspectives, track-side perspectives and crowd perspectives.Highly recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2020,8/10,"I personally have never really had any interest in either cars or racing, before watching this movie I didn't even know what Le Mans was. I initially took an interest in the movie when I saw it stared (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) I went into this movie on a complete whim that it might be worth watching. Admittedly I was a little lost during the first thirty minutes of the movie but after getting familiar with the characters aswell as the cars I easily settled into the movies storyline and awesome looking fast paced driving.I didn't expect this movie to explain how race cars are built or explain anything on a technical level. I was honestly hoping this movie would give a little history on Le Mans and showcase the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari with some fast paced driving scene's that get the adrenaline pumping. Le Mans '66 delivered everything I expected and more not only do we get some beautifully shot driving scenes that look amazing we also get a real heartfelt story of two men who put their heart and soul into making a beautiful car capable of winning Le Mans and all for a company that showed them little to no respect but they still continued to do what they loved building and racing uniquely built cars with a purpose.The performances from lead actors (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) are Oscar worthy the passion they put into their unique performances is arguably some of their best work on screen in years. The supporting cast also do a great job of bringing the movie to life every actor and actress is a perfect fit for their role in the movie both the big roles and the smalls roles are perfectly cast.The one and only complaint I have about this movie is Christian Bales absolutely awful ""British"" accent that he has throughout the entire movie I think he was going for a classic Cockney accent but instead he sounds like an American trying to imitate a 18th century London chimney sweep. Other than that Bales performance is brilliant.I recommend giving this movie a chance even if you have no interest in cars and racing there's still plenty to enjoy and plenty you can learn from it's story I certainly felt like I knew more about racing and Le Mans than I did before going into the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,9/10,"What a Ride what An exhilarating and emotional ride, Great script, great Directing, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"I never expected a sports film, let alone one based on a true story, to impress me so damn much. James Mangold offers one of the best, if not the best sports movie ever. With award-worthy performances from both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, Ford v Ferrari (aka Le Mans '66) has characters so exceptionally-written and so emotionally compelling that I felt like crying by the end of the film. The races are riveting and entertaining, but it's the beautiful screenplay that gets me. Definitely, one of the movies of the year!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,7/10,"An old-fashioned Hollywood movie with great performances and exciting racing sequences.Them testing the car and clashing with Ford executives is fine, but the movie really is at its best when it focuses on racing. Even then, the performances from Bale and Damon are so good that they make even the rockiest parts of movie watchable.The third act is so much fun it mostly makes up for many problems I might have had with the build-up.It feels like the movie is a big allegory for movie studio interference and how it can prevent greatness. I like that, even if even comes with the cost of makong the Ford and Ferrari execs feel like cartoon villains, but then again, old-fashioned Hollywood movie.This was a lot fun."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,6/10,"How (sort of) the gigantic Ford Motor Company bought itself victory over the tiny Italian company Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966. Heroic warrior/engineer/designer/entrepreneur/drivers Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby (and Miles' wife, who would seem from this to be an android) struggle, mainly with corporate interference, to put one - well, four - over on the Italians. And while it's a stirring tale, they don't play fair, truth be told.But hey, winning is everything, isn't it. Isn't it?It says that 15,000 jobs were provided by the production, meaning that the credits are slower than Ken Miles' Le Mans lap record.To look at the film, 99.9% of those jobs were to white males - well, it was the 1960's. FvsF isn't interested in any socio-economic truths from the 1960's that would get in the way of a nostalgia-fest. (That makes it very old-fashioned).Not only FvsF a convincing recreation of nearly 60-year-old scenery, venery (look it up) and machinery, it's a convincing recreation of early 1960's corporate and environmental laissez-faire as though that was a really good thing.Well it was a good thing if you were one of the entitled then, and are so now. I hope you don't watch this film and not realize that times have changed; this is not a story of noble aspirations, it's a story of American industrial might post WWII (and Korea and during Vietnam) trying to recapture the buzz of liberating Europe.It's a 'good movie', but unimaginative, conservative and derivative. Essentially an uncritical tribute, made by today's equivalent of an industrial behemoth, to a golden age of industrial behemoths that was dying when these events happened. Watch once, don't be indoctrinated, and forget."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"A very nice old fashioned type of filme - one of those big Studio movies the Studios don't do that much anymore. One that really concentrates and cares for their characters and takes time to develope them. It was both storywise and also technical wise a true winner. The Performances were great. Christian Bale was just phenomenal. Especially if you consider that just last year at the same time he was playing a totally different character in ""Vice"", physically and also Motivation wise. Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal.
James Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss. Sound and editing were pitch perfect. The final race was one of the most exciting Moments in Cinema we had this year. And in the end it even almost brought me to Tears. A true winner Picture."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"The stage curtains open ...""Ford v Ferrari"" is exactly the movie it is billed to be. Movie magic that is a blast from the past with excellent performances by the entire cast. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. Sometimes, when you watch a preview, you can tell that you've just seen all the best parts of the movie. Not so with this one. It delivers.The biopic starts with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) receiving the bad news that he can no longer race since it would put too much strain on his heart and steer him to an early grave. So, he pairs up with race car driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and together they form a friendship while remaining on the racing circuit and designing cars. When Ford Motors sales begin to plummet, Henry Ford II turns to Lee Iacocca for advice. Iacocca recommends that they purchase the now bankrupt Ferarri company. This plan is turned down by Enzo Ferarri who agrees to sell to Fiat instead. Enter Shelby and Miles as they team up with Ford to design a car that will put Ford back on the map by winning the famed Le Manz, a 24-hour endurance race.I absolutely love this movie. It really is why we go to the theaters. The production values were second to none, the cinematography engaging, the racing stunts eye popping, the acting believable and the story involving. The only reason it doesn't get a full 10 stars from me is because it does run a little long. But, even so, you are so invested into the film, it goes by at a very good pace.I highly recommend ""Ford v Ferarri"". I have plans to go see it at least one more time before it leaves the big screen. We're heading into December now, but it is easily one of my favorite films of the year. If you love a good story with enough action to keep you smiling, this is a great one for you. 9 stars out of 10."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari (titled Le Mans '66 in the UK and other territories) is a biographical American drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. It stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Caitriona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remus Girone and Ray McKinnon appearing in supporting roles.In 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible purchase. Conversations were unilaterally interrupted by Ferrari when Enzo realized that the deal included the purchase of Ferrari's racing program, a program that won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1958 and every year from 1960 to 1965. Le Mans is the most The world's oldest sports car endurance race, held annually since 1923. Troubled by being rejected, Henry Ford II drove his racing division to build a car to beat the Scuderia Ferrari.The film tells how automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles lead a team of American Ford engineers and designers to build a race car that can beat the legendary Ferrari. Finally, they produce the Ford GT40 for a 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour showdown.Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the pure thrill of racing - 'a body moving in space and time', as one character put it - and is compelling enough in those moments to argue that nothing beats the thrill of competition.Matt and Bale stand out in their performances by becoming a duo and I remembered the movie Fast and Furious from the characters of actor Vin and Paul. And so my movie grade is 8 out of 10."
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.In 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.With its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.Director James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.Christian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.Overall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.I rate it 8.5/10"
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,9/10,"You don't have to care about cars in the slightest to enjoy this fast-paced story about competition. The film is expertly crafted with thrilling race sequences, but balanced out well by compelling human drama and humor. Christian Bale is excellent and followed closely by his co-star Matt Damon. The 2.5 hour runtime zooms by and keeps you wanting more. Ford v Ferrari is a wild ride and one of the most purely enjoyable films of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,8/10,"While I'm going to have a couple of complaints from the script later, I want to highlight that it really does a great job developing 3 of the central characters to the film. Carroll Shelby is painted as driven but realistic, one eye on the prize and the other at keeping his team in line. He's passionate about his work but he's learned the hard way that his time in the driver's seat might have passed. I liked that he wasn't just a starry eyed dreamer and was fairly savvy about the challenges ahead and what doing business with Ford meant. Miles has similar traits, he loves to drive but reality hasn't always been kind to him either. He's very animated next to Shelby, both in his expression and his body language. But he has a deep knowledge of automotive work (makes sense, he's working as a mechanic when he's not racing) and a will to keep going. Miles and Shelby make a fantastic team, they form almost a yin and yang bond. I also thought Mollie Miles was a refreshing character. She's more active in the story than just a bystander, her love for her husband and her understanding of how amazing her husband's work was drawn with a light touch and I found their relationship to be genuinely sweet. The core players in this movie aren't just types (unfortunately that doesn't bleed over to the supporting characters... more on that later) and I think James Mangold and the screenwriters (Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, Jason Keller) did a good job presenting them as flawed but realistic people.You're going to want the drama when watching a racing movie. Its inherent in the risk of the sport and there's plenty of it here. But you're also going to want to watch some racing sequences. This movie has lots of tense and tightly filmed scenes with the cars and they lived up to the billing in that respect. They're exciting and they also do great job weaving them in to service the plot (the scene where Shelby drive Henry Ford around to show him how dangerous racing can be was a favourite). There's the triumphant moments but there are also bits that underline the gravity and there's some big wrecks that also serve their purpose. The set decoration, the costuming and the cinematography are all on par and nicely put together (consistent with a big budget production) and I have nothing but praise for Ford v Ferrari for its visuals and the actionThere's not only 1 A-list talent in the lead here but you have 2 of the best actors working in this movie and like I implied in the title, their performances hum along like the cars in the movie. Bale is the more expressive of the two, he's a fantastic actor and he completely throws himself into this role. He's known for being fully committed and the movie benefits from Bale's on screen antics. There are plenty of funny moments with Miles but Bale also knows how to grit his teeth and scowl just right when his character is pushing for that extra second off his time. Matt Damon is just a as good as Carroll Shelby, w0hile Bale walks the line between effective and overdoing it, he's more understated. But he's charming, his accent is on point and he's a compelling performer. I hadn't seen Caitriona Balfe in anything else but she absolutely held her own next to Bale and Damon. She's the most underrated performer in this and I was very impressed with her work. I liked Jon Bernthal, Noah Jupe and Tracy Letts in their respective supporting parts as well.Ford v Ferrari performs like a car right off the assembly line but it did have a couple of minor issues that could have required a pit stop. I'll admit that the movie got me with an ending twist but otherwise the overall arc of the script is pretty predictable. You get the expected highs and lows, it never really shocked me or shifted into the next gear if you will. I can't get angry at a movie for being too well executed for what it wants to be but I could have used a couple of decisions that would have taken it off the beaten path. This also applies to the supporting characters. Leo Beebe has no dimension other than being a power hungry sycophant, Henry Ford II does nothing but scowl and growl and Peter Miles has little other to do than be concerned about his dad. For a movie that has so much put into it, it also would have benefited from a little extra added to those characters to flesh them out a little.Ford v Ferrari crosses the finish line and it does so in style. All the facets of being a great sports movie are there with the acting, the camera work and the character development are all on point. I think it could have gone even farther but it is a good execution of a film in this genre and I can't fault it for that. I would actually grade this out at somewhere between a 8-9/10 but I have to round down in this case. I would definitely recommend seeing this on the big screen, it would add a lot to the action and help you enjoy the cinematography just that much more."
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,8/10,"Damon did Damon things, and Bale did Bale things. More importantly, this movie managed to be sports-y and non-sports-y all at once. You still get all the adrenaline and polish of a giant victory rally, but you also get the kind of character-driven drama that's typically reserved for awards season. Let's be clear: this is a dad movie, and I am the target dad. But I have never cared about race cars or watched people turn left on TV...and I absolutely loved all 150 minutes of this story. Movies are supposed to help you forget real life and remember real life all at once. That's just what this one did."
FORD V FERRARI,13 July 2021,10/10,"Great Film Awesome Cast. Josh Lucas in this Film was Fantastic at Playing that Big Shoot Ford Man. He was such a Slim Ball he was such a BIGGIT AND HE PLAYED THE PART WELL. NOT that I Agreed with him BUT VERY SURPRISED THAT NOBODY BARED HIM. Oh my God and so was his Father. The Man that was Hired to RACE THE CAR WAS THE BEST. And he wanted him FIRED THE VERY FIRST DAY. I Loved how the Driver PLAYED bye Always took his little son for Rides in his Race Car after he Won. I just Loved How Bale NEVER really went bye the rules. I also Loved his Voice and when his Wife asked him after a Fight with his Boss would you like a Drink. He said Yup a ""Sizzling Pop Please"" so his Wife brought him a Coke. Lol Sizzling Pop Awesome name then he asked for a Bowl of Ice Cream. He must of asked for that a few times in the Film. Sizzling Pop and Ice Cream. Just that accent in his Voice. But one Hell of a Racer. Great Film."
FORD V FERRARI,13 February 2020,10/10,"I actually agree with some of the other comments, especially the one that says something along the lines of this movie putting my faith in the movie business again. I expected bad acting on at least one of the two star actors parts (Damon, Bale), but this movie is good. A little slow in the beginning, but that's my only complaint (I literally fell asleep during the beginning and woke up and watched the rest of this great movie).The race at the end is good, but moreso from an emotional standpoint than an action packed standpoint. I feel like they could've had a few extra scenes to ""wow"" us at the end."
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,9/10,"This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!"
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,10/10,"First off I really cant stand Christian Bale or his acting. Ive never been a fan on anything hes done. I will be honest, he did an outstanding job and was clearly the right person to play this character. Even Matt Damon killed it and they both played off each other perfect. I really cant find any flaws in the story, the acting, the directing or anything that goes along in movies. It was almost a perfect movie for me and easily makes my top ten movies of all time. The way they filmed it and created the story is really top notch. If you haven't seen this no question it is worthy of your time and money. Ive probably watched it now 20 times and it has officially been added to my ""goto comfort list"".
Such a great movie..."
FORD V FERRARI,7 January 2020,6/10,"This seems to have been made only for car race/sports fans.
Cannot imagine how worst it'd have been if the 2 main characters would've played by someone else than Christian Bale & Matt Damon.
Although this is purely a biographical make, it had some stunning race sequences but it didn't please me much, maybe because I expected a lot and maybe the addition of commercial elements could've been a good engagement factor but there seemed to be nothing except a clash with the executive on a decent note."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"James Mangold is a great director and has given us amazing films like Walk the Line and his last film Logan which has impressed us immensely. His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.Ford v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.This movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.The acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.The film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.I have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind. Hats off to everyone who worked on the movie as they gave it their all."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2020,8/10,"A new movie had a bad start. At first I was so bored that it lasted half of the movie, then the movie improved dramatically. The movie was great among all the cast. The story is excellent. I loved the father-son relationship, the director and producer in the movie, it was excellent. Music in the movie was good. If it were a shorter movie it would have been much better"
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,9/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is that old school Hollywood drama that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. This movie reminded me of some excellent films that I have watched long ago. Ford v Ferrari definitely is included in those excellent list of movies now. This movie gives us the chills and adrenaline pumps not only in the racing scenes but most of the other scenes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were so good as the leading pair as expected. This project started as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the leading roles but I couldn't think of anyone other than Matt and Christian for these roles. The movie has drama, comedy, great chills we expect from a racing movie, father son relationship, friendship, wife husband etc. The chances of this movie winning the best picture at Oscar's is few but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year and one of the two best racing drama's I have ever seen. P. S. Rush is the other one."
FORD V FERRARI,24 October 2020,8/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a excellent film. The story of the Ford company competing in the La Mun race to beat the famous Ferrari is a wonderful story that comes to life. Matt Damon and Christian Bale team up for this awesome experience. All cars sequences are beautiful and well shot. Every close up and detail is beautifully made. What I most enjoyed was the chemistry between Bale and Damon's characters, how they've known each other for a while and need to trust one another to win the race. I also really loved the cars sequences and the whole buildup to the final moment of the movie. James Mangold has done a wonderful job and this film should have won more prizes other than technical prizes at the academy awards, it just deserves more appreciation."
FORD V FERRARI,26 August 2020,9/10,This is one of those movies where it's easy to overlook just how excellent it is or to forget a key component of what makes it so excellent. The central theme of the tension between vision and collaboration plays central to what makes this movie so great. It has staked out a philosophical position and sets about defending that position within the context of an engaging movie plot. I immediately think of Ghostbusters (1984) as having that philosophy as an easily overlooked component to what makes the movie so great. Fine performances all around and solid pacing sell this point of view while making sure it never overwhelms the movie and becomes preachy. Great movie. it'll be neat to see how it's reputation fares as the years and decades begin piling up. Don't have to be a racing fan to love this.
FORD V FERRARI,29 July 2020,8/10,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,7/10,"There is a lot to love and a lot to be frustrated about in Ford v Ferrari, which seems to be becoming a trend in Mangold movies (except The Wolverine - there's truly nothing to love in that horribly misguided movie). It is certainly an exhilarating car movie and underdog sports movie at its core, and the racing scenes are gorgeous and put the audience right into the driver's seat. It's a tight script which particularly shines in its dialogues between Shelby and the Ford execs or Ken. Bale is absolutely amazing, stealing every scene and injecting joy into all of the racing scenes.The biggest flaw of the movie is its apparent disinterest in its characters. Shelby is a great example of this - with the background we get early, I wanted some allusion or discussion of how he's devastated he can no longer race but loves being a part of the journey with Ken. None of that was ever implied, and that also gets at a larger and apparently controversial take: Damon's performance was disappointing. He was completely opaque and detached, never successfully selling me the anger with Ford or the love for working with the cars the way Bale did. Some lens into the psychology of the main characters and why racing meant so much to them would've been great. The race ending was fine in showing executive duplicity, but would've been better if we knew anything about the other Ford racers (and truthfully many explanations were left unsaid about how the process worked). The ending, while completely fitting in script, was rushed and sudden, making it less impactful than it deserved.It's still fun as a sports movie, leaving no moments of boredom while it flies through it's 2:32 runtime, but for a movie that tries to hit emotional notes and focus on its character interactions, I'm perplexed at how no investigation of their characters or themes of dedication to a lifelong passion existed whatsoever. A fun and good movie, but should've been a great one."
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2020,9/10,"Wow, well I didn't expect that one bit. It's a brilliant film.
I'll be honest, when I saw what the story was about I wasn't sold hence why I have only watched now. But I'll admit when I'm wrong and I am very wrong. It's a incredibly interesting story that had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happened next. I think for a true story it did really well to keep the audience intrigued and kept the suspense well.I am a big fan of racing and cars so this was up my alley so I could be speaking a little bias, but I do think that this works well even if you don't have a keen interest in it.Beyond all that the acting is fantastic and I think this is well worth watching. Does it need to be as long as it is? Probably not, but I don't think it overly dragged at any stage. But yeah, give it a watch if you haven't seen already."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2021,9/10,I loved this movie. I was already excited when Bale and Damon joined the cast but to have Mangold tell this story was a cherry on top. I am not much of a car person but this had me invested and I did not look up what happened in history so I could be surprised by the story. The sound design for the cars are great and there are definitely some intense moments.
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Ford is failing as a company and in a last ditch effort to drive sales back up, they decide to expand their racing division. Rather than spending years and untold millions perfecting their own racecars, they decide to buy out Ferrari, but all they get are manipulations and insults, starting the infamous rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II. In retaliation, Ford enlist the help of Carroll Shelby to build them a car that can blow Ferrari's out of the water. And so was born the GT40. But a racecar is only half of it, they need a driver too, and Shelby's choice in Ken Miles is too hard a sell for the Ford executives.So which suits better, Ford v Ferrari or Le Mans '66? Honestly there isn't much of a movie without either. The Ford/Ferrari rivalry is what drives the first half of the movie, while preparation for Le Mans is what drives the second half. Throughout it's more of a Ken Miles biopic. I guess ""Ken Miles: The True Story"" wouldn't have sold many tickets though. And while Carroll Shelby does appear a lot, he's not explored as a character anywhere near as deeply as Ken Miles is. We don't learn anything about his home life, we don't get to see him wrestle with his demons, and the film's coda almost entirely revolves around Miles' affect on everyone around him.Ken Miles is the star of the movie, there's no doubt about that, and Christian Bale is unsurprisingly great in the role, slipping in like a chameleon, like he does with every character he plays. He's a down-on-his-luck auto-mechanic who can't even pay the bills, and despite his good connections in Shelby and his unmatched skill as a racing driver, his quick temper and difficulty to work with keeps him rooted in the amateur circuit. That is, of course, until Shelby gets the offer from Ford to give them the Le Mans win. It takes one failed year at the race for Shelby to convince the higher-ups at Ford that they need an expert driver who has hands-on experience with the GT40 in building and testing to really get them the win.Acting is fairly top-notch across the board, and it's hard to say Bale stole the show when almost everyone else keeps up so well. Matt Damon offers no surprises as Shelby, with his strongest scenes at the very end. Jon Bernthal gets a little shafted in the second half as Lee Iacocca, but he gets plenty of time to shine before then, particularly in the negotiations with Ferrari. Josh Lucas is deliciously punchable as Leo Beebe, the Ford suit put in charge of the racing division, who is portrayed here as having no clue about racing, is constantly against Ken Miles' involvement, and even costs him the win at the end in the name of a photo opportunity. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife, who takes no crap from her husband, and supports him wherever she can. Tracy Letts is also pretty good as the no-nonsense, stoic Henry Ford II, with his stand-out scene being in a GT40 prototype crying his eyes out. At first you think it's due to pure fear of the speeds he's experienced, but then you realise they're happy tears having restored faith in his racing project, and then they evolve again into sadness and regret that his father, Henry Ford senior, was no longer alive to experience such a pinnacle achievement in automotive machinery. It becomes a surprisingly emotive scene purely thanks to Letts' performance.Le Mans '66 also has merits in the technical department. It's like crack to a driving junkie, particularly anyone with even a passing interest in 60s sportscars or the racing scene. I've always had a passing interest in cars thanks to my mum and dad both being rally drivers in their younger years, so Le Mans '66 definitely struck a chord with me. The roar of the engines is palpable and infectious, and seeing all sorts of snazzy classic cars driving around was a delight. As I understand it a lot of the GT40s, Shelbys, and Ferraris, including 330 P3 and 275 GTB used in the movie were real, only employing CGI and dummies for crashes, giving the whole experience a feeling of authenticity.The only criticism I particularly have revolves around the film's coda, showing Ken Miles' death and the effect it had on some of the characters. It felt unnecessary and meant the film ended on a considerable downer. It would be like if Bohemian Rhapsody followed up the LiveAid performance with Freddie Mercury's death and the various members of Queen reacting to it. The ending of the Le Mans race was enough of a downer for Ken, having the victory stolen from him thanks to a technicality in a publicity stunt, and then the next scene they kill him off on a test track in front of his son. Sure, he died doing what he loved, but it felt like a bit too much of a one-two punch. Ending it just after the race as he graciously accepts second place would have sufficed. This is really more of a niggle and personal taste more than anything though. It might work for you.In all Le Mans '66 was an enjoyable cinema experience. It hit all the right notes for a casual car fan in myself, and I'm sure it'll hit them all for fanatics who lived through it like my parents. But for those without any interest in cars, there's still plenty here for you. The acting is fantastic, the story never lags, and the race sequences are thrilling from beginning to end. I give Le Mans '66 a solid 8/10."
FORD V FERRARI,26 May 2021,10/10,"This is a masterpiece that goes way beyond your average racing movie. Ford v Ferrari is a film that is so engaging that you cant help but feel you cannot look away, its phenomenal to say the least, the really know how to please an audience.Both lead actors (Damon & Bale) were so great in this, finally a movie that portrays incredible Oscar worthy performances by two actors I happen to love, I didnt think I'd see these two together in a film and it was indeed a masterpiece. I've not seen acting this good in a very long time, if you're looking to have faith in movies again look no further!The best part about this story is that it's a true one, I feel when true stories are the plot to the film its always executed perfectly (from what I've seen as far as true stories are concerned) this was a great watch. I'm a massive fan of Matt Damon, he goes way beyond Jason Bourne and I think he's very entertaining to watch at the best of times.I highly recommend watching this movie, its so beautifully crafted and the acting is spot on!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 October 2020,9/10,"I must say I have no interest in cars, I don't even drive so I really really have no interest in cars, but Matt Damon and Christian Bale were enough to make me watch Le Mans '66, and I'm very glad I did!The story was surprisingly gripping and intense, and despite having no knowledge of cars, motor racing etc, I was hooked and so invested in the story and the characters. At its heart this film is a story of perseverance, of belief, of friendship, of teamwork, of dedication. So whether you like cars or not, you'll be able to relate to the key themes and messages of Le Mans '66. It's a great film. It really is a great story, with the fantastic characters of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles at the heart of it, two very interesting men who were well portrayed and explored. I loved the script as well, despite the fact that I didn't understand a word of all the car mumbo jumbo, I was still transfixed during those scenes, lapping it all up. There were some brilliant injections of humour in the script too, which worked so well and really added to the film.A large part of the success of this film comes from the performances which were great. Not surprising really as I've never once seen Christian Bale slip up in a performance - he's surely one of the finest actors working today. He really was the standout and it was hard not to enjoy his character and performance. Equally Matt Damon was fantastic, one of the better performances I've seen him in of late. The two of them had great chemistry together on screen and I'd love to see them working together again.The film also just had such a great vibe. That probably sounds a little vague, but its the best way of describing it. The direction was very slick, the camera work during the race scenes, the score and sound, and the overall tone of the film, all of them were spot on for me. Not to mention that it flew by considering the two and a half hour runtime. Always a sign that a film has nailed it pacing and flow and is edited to perfection!If like me you have no interest in cars, don't let that put you off a fantastic drama which ticks all the boxes. Le Mans '66 is a great film with a fantastic story, which will surely get you hooked from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,6/10,A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.Nowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans.
FORD V FERRARI,6 January 2020,8/10,"This has become my favorite car movie as there are no distracting sub-plots about love or whatever.
This is a straight forward car movie based on real events and the 2 and a half hours went by as if the movie was going 7000 RPMAmazing acting throughout8.2"
FORD V FERRARI,21 February 2021,7/10,"This was a fantastic film and I highly recommend this to movie fans, make an effort to see it. The script was tightly written, with entertaining dialogue. The cinematography was engaging, the acting was phenomenal and the direction was so well done that I was literally rooting for Ken Miles to win!Ford vs Ferrari is based on a true story and had me googling facts put to us in the film. It depicts the real life determination of Henry Ford II to beat Ferrari at Le Mans after Ferrari had one it 6 times in a row going bankrupt in the process and then mocking Ford's serious offer to buy Ferrari's company, while using his offer to get Fiat to make a better offer. In his determination to beat Ferrari at Le Mons, Ford engineer turned executive Lee Iacocca convinces Ford to let him put together a team of the best, which is how Carroll Shelby (the only American to have won at La Mons) and British born driver/engineer Ken Miles come to be working on the Ford Racing Team...and the rest as they say is history.The film does an excellent job building the characters and getting you to invest emotionally in the outcome. I have never been a racing fan...but I was right there on the edge of my seat rooting Ken Miles on! There is also an excellent villain developed in the Ford Executive Leo Beebe. It sounds like he really did rob Ken Miles out of the triple crown. I really hope there is a special place in hell.I want to give a special thank you for the depiction of Ken Miles' wife, Mollie. Often racing movies depict the females as bimbos or so weak-hearted that they are always trying to talk their man out of racing because it is dangerous. Mollie Miles was portrayed as a solid wife and mother, who not only knew a little something about cars but was supportive of her husband and a stand up individual.I never thought I would see the day that I would be googling and reading articles about auto-racing. True fact Mario Andretti and my Dad are the same age, who knew!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 April 2020,7/10,"I did not receive the gene that fires interest in cars. I do not drive; I have no passion, not one iota for cars and engines and mechanics. I don't understand them and don't particularly want to do so. Which is why this film had little attraction for me.But it was Easter weekend, and it was on cheap to rent, and at wife's recommendation (who had seen it in the cinema), we watched it. I still have no interest in cars and engines, having watched it. There were parts of the dialogue I didn't understand a word of - or more correctly, I understood most of the words, but not the order they were used in. Those parts of the script I did understand seemed often to be lazy and far too much on the nose. Christian Bale's performance is odd to the point of being unintentionally laughable; replete with Mary Poppins-like Britishisms which sound out of place even coming from this British actor, whose accent in this film is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, Matt Damon is quietly brilliant, very possibly his best performance in many years; unshowy, subtle and investing his character with a depth the script never reaches.There remain other inadequacies in the film: a ludicrous brawl between the two lead characters, and a pathetic reduction of women to roles which support or prop-up the men, peering through curtains, fetching drinks, adorning visuals. Why are cars always referred to in the feminine? It became more obvious to me here; because it enables the men who drive them and build them to continue to exploit them and shape them around their needs the way they do with women in their lives.In the end, this is little more than a genre sports film, following all of the standard story beats of sports films to a conclusion I knew was coming as a sports fan with only a very passing knowledge of motorsport. It's a true story, but no less generic for it. But it does work - motorsports are the most cinematic of sports, not least because we have much of the film grammar of them drilled into us by car chases and the like. The racing scenes are adrenalised, gripping and alarming - the louder your sound system and the larger your screen, the more you'll enjoy them. They are beautifully directed; and throughout the whole film, the cinematography is subtle but strikingly beautiful. There's much to enjoy and entertain, perfect for a holiday weekend. But it will fade from the memory quickly, the only lingering question being why it garnered so much attention on cinematic release at the expense of far superior films from female directors."
FORD V FERRARI,11 March 2020,6/10,"So for all who love cars, this is your thing. When men drive in circles with fast machines. In times of climate changes it looks funny to see and hear all this loud motors. And maybe that's the best of the movie: the great sound design.Christian Bales acting is wonderful but really close to The fighter fro 2010 and director David O. Russell - which brought him an Oscar."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"Remember how much fun FAST AND FURIOUS was when it started and was about the cars with no CGI and lots of interpersonal dynamics and whatnot? That is this -- a movie for car people. I have raced and went with another car racer -- we loved it. The history, the speed, the cars, you could almost smell the gasoline. The performances are outstanding. The race scenes are breathtaking. This is a great movie! Lot of history here about Carrol Shelby I didn't know about. Fun!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 May 2020,8/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"", based on the 2009 book ""Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans"", is adrenaline-fueled entertainment, not just for a for racing fans but non-racing fans too. What makes this movie so great are the performances of all the cast, but especially M. Demon and C. Bale - who gives a rock-solid performance that shows the intensity and determination of his character. Damon as - a quite memorable character too, is superb as - 'Caroll Shelby' as he fights for what he believes. But actually, what really makes this film even better is the chemistry that Demon and Bale create together. It feels like they've been friends for life. If the film has a fault, it's that it stops short of showing us what exactly drives both men. The racing scenes are superbly realized, kinetic and thrilling, although there's often a little too much fast-cutting pedal-shots. No mater, the crowning achievement of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is its portrayal of the Les Mans race in 1966 with quite emotional climax. Ultimately, film doesn't disappoint and is highly recommendable.Rating: 8-"
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,7/10,The titular battle is the most poorly executed aspect of the film with not enough reasons given to like one and dislike the other (Shelby's cheating doesn't help). The main duo vs. the suits is more engaging but it still feels a bit generic when it's not centered on Bale's passionate Ken Miles-it's that infectious turn (along with the strong music and technical elements) that steers the film away from mediocrity; every scene in which he takes the wheel (in both senses) shines.
FORD V FERRARI,3 April 2020,10/10,"Le Mans 66'Le Mans 66' or 'Ford Vs Ferrari' depending on where you are from is up there with the best racing car movies.
James Mangold delivers an exciting movie for those who like all things petrol powered and also for those who want to be invested in a gripping story.
The script is tightly bolted down and accelerated by two charismatic lead performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon.
The story tells of how the Ford motor company took the fight to Ferrari at Le Mans after a business deal went sour.
Ford where on the cusp of acquiring the Italian sports car maker but after negotiations broke down they decided to take on the impossible task of beating Ferrari at their own game.
Damon plays legendary driver and car maker Carol Shelby who is tasked with building a credible machine whilst Bale is sublime as the man who will drive it, the straight talking race hero Ken Miles.
As aforementioned the script is good but it's the chemistry of the two leads that will captivate the audience.
Director James Mangold is coming from a high note after the excellent 'Logan' and the action scenes in 'Le Mans 66' have the same razor sharp precision as his last blockbuster.
The car racing sequences are handled expertly and never become 'Fast & Furious' unbelievable.
They're grounded in reality making the danger all the more apparent.In terms of audio and visual quality 'Le Mans 66' is delicious in Ultra High Definition.
It may not always be 4K crisp. There's a vintage feel to the picture quality.
The onscreen image is packed full of detail with High Dynamic Range helping the motor masterpieces sparkle. Yet there's still a little film grain to convey that this movie is set in the past.
Audio is also splendid.
Bass is thunderous as the cars race through your listening environment.
This is a film worthy of a good home theatre set up.
Each speaker getting plenty to do with sound effects and musical score coming to the forefront.'Le Mans 66' is a must for fans of the genre but it's also just a plain good old movie all round.
Mangold has blended the drama with the dynamics to deliver a solid piece of movie making."
FORD V FERRARI,30 October 2019,4/10,"Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud. Scenes are often contrived, sometimes exasperingly so, such as when Ken Miles (Christian Bale) explaiins the details of the Le Mans circuit to his son (Noah Jupe), or Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) demonstrates the need for a first-rate driver to Henry Ford II (excellent Tracy Letts). Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling. The story that surrounds it, interesting though it is, inevitably seems tame by comparison."

FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,,The racing sequences are simply thrilling and intense. The cinematography and editing are just crazy. The script is well written. There are plenty of twists and turns. The ending is beyond everyone's expectation.Bale and Damon are marvelous. Bale's British accent makes him totally unrecognizable. Mangold proves again that he is brilliant in directing an action thriller.
FORD V FERRARI,1 November 2019,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Before his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He'd make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He'd plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.
Mangold's back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You've probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can't get.
It's the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.
Iacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.
Even if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold's Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team's journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.
Mangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call ""speed."" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver's seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Bale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can't help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He's conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles' contributions, and I'd shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.
Under Mangold's watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold's precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it."
FORD V FERRARI,1 June 2020,9/10,"Sometimes I really admire Hollywood. In fact, the story of this movie can be said to be a typical negative energy case where enthusiasm loses money and sports spirit loses to business operations. Half an hour! I haven't moved my eyes, and I don't think the various foreshadowings are superfluous (the competition part is actually more than half an hour). It's a very satisfying commercial movie experience."
FORD V FERRARI,15 May 2021,6/10,"Great rivalries make for pretty good films, and 'Ford v Ferrari' is no exception. Between the high octane racing and the hotheaded personalities competing for the spotligh, there's plenty of adrenaline to go around.Even though the title would suggest the main course on the confrontation menu is between the most storied automaker in American history and the pride of Italia, it becomes clear that the power struggle between Carroll Shelby's crew and Detroit's finest is the true story here, particularly between Shelby (Matt Damon) and executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). Christian Bale's Ken Miles is the most interesting character here, as he has to fight off the IRS and be a responsible dad and husband while risking his life on the racetrack. If it wasn't for Miles, this story wouldn't have been possible.'FvF' is successful because it is a shining example of American achievement that came at a time when the country really needed it. It's an exciting (true) underdog story and the people at the center of the events are interesting to say the least. One of the only problems with 'FvF' is its runtime, which probably could have shaved off ~30 minutes and still been a powerful film. It also feels like it was filmed knowing it would be a contender for best picture, which almost makes it come off feeling a little entitled.Still, 'Ford v Ferrari' is a portrait of what hard work, dedication and a leap of faith can translate into, and for that, it should be celebrated."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,10/10,Ford V Ferrari staring Christian Bale and Matt Damon is a must see movie for everyone. This film had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,7/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" juggles enough fast cars, heart and fine performances to entertain you all the way through.
.
In this sports drama based on a true story, a team of determined engineers make it a mission to build a Ford vehicle fast enough to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
.
Running a little over two and a half hours, ""Ford v Ferrari"" can be tighter, but the film overall is a fun ride and a solid underdog story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a dynamic duo and offer viewers two whole-hearted and grand performances. Director James Mangold (""Walk The Line"") makes you feel like you're on that race track and also makes you want to stand up and cheer. An entertaining piece of automotive history that not many people know about and well worth the watch."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,10/10,"Great Story, Great Acting and Great Flick!
Well done!"
FORD V FERRARI,27 February 2020,9/10,"I never cared much about racing competitions, and yet this movie pushed me to some researches on Le Mans competition on 1966, the year when Ford won for the first time the race.Technically speaking is amazing, racing scenes are amazingly directed, you can feel the tension after every curve, during every overtaking and on every duel. This is how car racing scenes are supposed to be done. The photography is extremely dynamic and immersive, you feel part of the competition. For sure one of the most successful direction of 2019.The movie tells the story of the creation of the car that will beat Ferrari in Le Man, showing the whole process, and it does so in an original and inspired way. Two hours and a half flew away. It was a satisfying experience. Characters are really well developed and you can easily bound with them. Every one has the right space on screen.""Ford v. Ferrari"" is for sure one of the best movie of its category from the last year and I really liked how Christian Bale and Matt Damon portrayed the friendship between Shelby and Miles."
FORD V FERRARI,27 August 2020,7/10,"It is a good movie with a very good performance by Christian Bale, also you can learn more about the car history."
FORD V FERRARI,25 June 2020,8/10,"Performances by Christian Bale and Josh Lucas, who REALLY pulls off the smarmy jerk well, make this film better than expected. Racing scenes are varied and well-filmed enough to keep one interested through their length."
FORD V FERRARI,18 March 2020,7/10,"It looks and sounds great. Nice story with some exaggerated details but overall an enjoyable movie. Will it be the car movie that changed car movies forever? No. The underdog achieving what seemed impossible at the begging, is hardly an innovative formula. It won't be the last movie that does this because we all like it.Shelby and Ford team up to beat the ""unbeatable"" Ferrari in 1966."
FORD V FERRARI,12 May 2020,9/10,"It has been a long since we got a car movie, let alone a good car movie. Watching Ford V Ferrari is a blast for car enthusiasts. You can tell the screenwriters knew everything about a car's anatomy, which I appreciate, as it really immerses you into the story. Everything in Ford V Ferrari is flawless, the acting, the cinematography, the tension, and the screenplay. It's entertaining and emotional, it has the best of both worlds.The script was written extremely well; it pulls you into the story and you become emotionally attached to the characters. You feel uncertain every time Ken Miles races because racing is so unpredictable, and you don't want anything to happen to Ken because Ken was developed so greatly as a character. Although Ford V Ferrari is a very long movie, it's never boring because the pacing is great and you know exactly where the story is taking you. The story is constantly building up, so the final race is insanely intense. Another thing I like about the script is how the antagonist isn't Ferrari, but Leo Beebe, a Ford corporate. This makes the movie have a constant rivalry between the protagonist and antagonist; it also makes Ford V Ferrari more original.The acting was solid all around. Christian Bale's performance was amazing; he makes Ken Miles so relatable, and when Ken Miles eventually dies, it's heart wrenching because you know it's coming. The delivery of the lines by Christian Bale just sells the character, and he delivers the line like a real person would in such a competitive atmosphere. All the characters were written with actual thought put into them. That's why the rivalry between Beebe and Miles is so authentic; they think differently although they're on the same side. I like how a lot of the runtime is spent with Miles' family, making you more emotionally attached to Ken and his family.The sound editing was top notch. You hear the engine, the gears switch, the tires screech, and the brakes clenching. It's mixed together so well and it makes the experience way more realistic. It's so satisfying hearing everything work together so perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful, and it highlights the beauty of the cars and the landscapes that surround the vehicles. What's so crucial to making a film feel like it's in a specific time period is the color palette and atmosphere. Ford V Ferrari captures the atmosphere of the 60's perfectly, and it gives you the nostalgia of it's time period, even if you weren't around during the 60's.Overall, Ford V Ferrari was fantastic, and it will go down as one of the best racing movies of all time for me. I loved every bit of it, it's a true homage to the sport and people who risk their lives to be the best. Ford V Ferrari is a must watch for car enthusiasts, and even though some people don't care about cars, Ford V Ferrari can still entertain you by the tension and great storytelling."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"'Ford v Ferrari' - underwhelming title, but exceptionally put-together sports biopic about the 24-hour endurance Le Mans motor race in 1966. If that puts you off, the good news is that the film's not all about racing - probably only ~30% - with much of the focus on Shelby (Damon), Miles (Bale) and Miles' wife, Mollie (Balfe) and son, Peter (Jupe). There's also the tension with Ferrari, where Ford executives Iacocca (Bernthal), Beebe (Lucas) and Ford (Letts) are trying to take the racing crown from Ferrari (Girone) and Agnelli (Cirfiera)It's nice to hear Bale using his actual English accent and the rapport he has with Damon carries the film. All the actors are good, but their relationship is what has you caring about what happens, rather than just the cars. The pacing is quick and it feels faster (pardon the pun) than 2.5 hours. This would be as good as, if not better than, 'Rush' and 'Senna'.Great directing from Mangold (coming off 'Logan') throughout, with a nice balance of family time, racing scenes and the car politics. The fact the 24-hour race is condensed to less than 20min and feels both quick and like it's been a marathon is a true feat. If you don't know the story, don't Google it and let the ending be a surprise. There's good editing, cinematography, authentic 60s cars and soundtrack throughout."
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,9/10,No clue on races but I must say I followed it easy and enjoyed movie sadly we all know the end as true story but grt all the same
FORD V FERRARI,1 April 2020,9/10,"It's been a long time since I saw such a great movie. The two starring actors are actors I particularly like. The characters portrayed by Bell are so good. The characters stand up soon after appearance. The look, tone, acting skills are really explosive, and Matt is also very good. I guess it is a change in history. I guess Bell will die, but I do n't know when it is, so I watched in the second half. I was afraid he would hang up without paying attention. Fortunately, after running the game, although it was best to compromise, it was also very good. His wife said that he had matured, and the carnival before he slowed down was probably the last time he was presumptuous before he matured. At that time, I believe he knew the pressure of his life and his wife and children to raise. Enjoyed great glory and became a great driver, but he still chose to do his duty as an ordinary father and husband, keep the job and support his family. Although he was put together in the end and did not win the championship, it didn't matter, at least all Everyone knows that he is the first. A person who does n't like the racing theme very much, it looks good, looks good, looks good!"
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2020,7/10,"But decent enough entertainment, though for me ""Grand Prix"" is still the best of this genre.However an interesting watch though some of the english accents were in an out, acting wise Bale is always watchable and a decent supporting role by Caitriona Balfe."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,1/10,"Really low effort, made-by-committee fare with no soul here, sorry.Absolutely hated Christian Bale's character and his family. Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."
FORD V FERRARI,24 June 2020,1/10,"Every scene is fake and over acted like they're worshipping the story instead of living it, and can never live up to it. Every scene is about being ""better than"" the other person (superiority complex) - no soul, no character, no real people.It became such a joke I started skipping through it, then finally gave up."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"Le Mans '66 is a new sports biography directed by James Mangold, director of Logan and Walk the Line.In the film, the American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is asked by car company Ford if he wants to make a racing car for the company, so that they can participate in car racing so that they can also sponsor their company in this car world. Ford also hopes to be able to compete more with the Ferrari car company. They try to do this during the 24-hour Le Mans race. To have a good chance against Ferrari, they also have to find a suitable driver. Carroll proposes to ask British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to race for Ford. Ken Miles has a passion for cars and racing, but is also somewhat rebellious. For example, he does not seem the right driver to promote Ford in a positive way with their brand and new racing cars. Shelby and his race crew see that Ken is the only one who has a real chance to successfully drive the Ford race car and a real chance to win the race. Shelby and his crew now have to decide to stay true to Ford's rules with another driver, or to keep the race with Ken Miles as a driver, so they have a chance to win the 24-hour Le Mans race.
For a true story, James Mangold knows how to tell the film in an interesting way. You also don't need to have any knowledge about car racing or the true events of Le Mans '66 to be able to follow and understand the story. You will receive the necessary information in the film. If you are familiar with all or a few of these things, there is more to enjoy in the film, because there are enough jokes and comical references in the film for the connoisseurs. The race scenes are also filmed as if you were in the car as a driver or passenger as a viewer. Thanks to the sound effects of the racing cars, it also feels as if you are actually watching a race or you are actually participating in the scenes in the car.The film is not really about the battle between car companies Ford and Ferrari. This is part of the film, but the film is more about the fight that the car designer and racer have against the company's board members, which they must keep satisfied. This film shows so beautifully how people sometimes have to choose to continue to follow their passion and own thinking. Or that they neatly follow the rules of the company and the manager, even if they have to put aside their passion and their own ideas. Apart from the race, they also know how to create excitement in the film with the different choices that the characters face. As a viewer you usually do not know which choice is the best and which is ultimately taken by the characters. The film also shows how heavy people are who are slightly different from society due to poor health or a developmental disorder such as PTSD. Despite In the face of these handicaps, they still have to follow certain rules of society, which is not always easy for them.The acting is also good and credible in the film. Christian Bale steals the film as Ken Miles a car and racing enthusiast, who looks with critical eyes at how others treat their cars or drive their racing. He knows how to share his critical opinion in comical ways with the other characters in the film. For this role he deserves to be nominated for various film prizes such as an Oscar. Matt Damon also does good acting as a car designer and later as the boss of a racing crew, trying to keep both the rebellious driver and the strict Ford board members happy. For this, he must choose one of the two, which often leads to conflicts. Although the two sometimes go against each other, they still have good chemistry thanks to their shared passion for cars and racing. The rest of the cast such as Josh Lucas, John Bernthal and Ray McKinnon also provide appropriate acting as members of the race crew or corporate management."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,5/10,"It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"The plot is given straight away with Henry Ford II insulted by Ferrari and vowing to win the Le Mans race by building a race car. But what makes this movie amazing is the narrative and performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale that makes you feel you are in the driver seat. The scenes where the culture at Ford affects the innovation and Shellby's pitch to put Ken Miles behind the wheels are wonderful and makes the movie realistic. The narrative is very engaging and doesn't bore you a bit. Special kudos to the sound effects team as their work reminds you of the movie when you hear the 'vroom' sound in the lanes. Finally, its worth 7000 RPM!! Go like hell!!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 October 2020,9/10,"I saw that title in another review. So, thanks to that individual for such a clever title.Rarely, am I pulled by a movie at 10:25 pm at night, in which it causes me to stay up until 1 am.This movie has an amazing story line that exudes beautiful character.The cast (Matt, Christian, Tracy, Remo, Noah, Ray, James, and more) was spectacular. The crew did an unbelievable job in this cinema. The edits were beautiful, music was captivating, and angels were powerful.I rated this 9 stars because it deserves 9 stars. A story I'll treasure for a long time - I don't know much about racing either. But the greatest stories break barriers of knowing and transcend into tugging at one's heartstrings through amazing storytelling. Cheers and thank you for making this cast/crew."
FORD V FERRARI,18 September 2021,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is based off the true story of a determined team of American and British engineers and designers, led a automotive designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and his head driver, Ken Miles(Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II to build the Ford GT40, a new racing car in effort to defeat the Italian racing team Scuderia Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Despite the premise it's the type of film that has not been seen now a days just a good old basic racing film. No blown out over the top fast car chase extravaganza like fast and the furious. The focus is more on the characters and the process to achieving the race. What really drives the movie is the connection between Damon and Bale you can tell both of these guys don't really like each other at first but they both have something to gain and lose. As. They talk more their very similar to another each with their own goals and dreams to accomplish. And you see the process that they go through across this film trying to achieve the impossible. Really focused more on how to get to that goal rather than just making the car just immediately cutting into the race. While the race most definitely is the highlight finale of the film is very fast pace and really entitled to you and actually get you on the edge of the sea is Miles has to push beyond the boundaries not knowing the car will give out or turn over and crash it's really intense. It's the characters that sale this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"This is a great film in its own right and even as fiction would be superb but as a true story it is truly compelling watching. When I saw the length of the film I thought I bet there is 20 minutes they could have cut out but I was wrong, the film goes by like it's 10 minutes long with not a minute wasted.Damon and Bale are brilliant in their roles, both should be up for oscars, Bale in particular really makes the character and is almost unrecognisable. The CGI is great while not getting in the way of the film and even the sound is fantastic.Is it the greatest motor racing film of all time? It has to be in with a shout and I can't wait to see it again."
FORD V FERRARI,14 June 2020,8/10,"I thought it was a simple story of speed and passion. After watching it, I found that the movie was more wonderful than hot-blooded racing. I also saw the brotherhood with common goals and mutual encouragement. It also highlights the admirable qualities of both characters, especially Ken Miles, that Christian has so brilliantly portrayed, and that the death of the character at the end will always be remembered with respect.As a biographical film, the picture composition is aesthetic but not distracting. The editing is smooth. The second half of the racing scene is full of blood and there is no waste of two and a half hours."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Wow! Great directing, love all the race scene! I was kept fully attention the whole time. Very exciting to watch. Very inspiring movie as well."
FORD V FERRARI,21 June 2020,10/10,"Well I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was pleasantly surprised, it's brilliant...interesting, gripping, appealing, well crafted, seamless...
I enjoyed it from the opening credits to the end.
Fascinating stuff.."
FORD V FERRARI,15 August 2020,7/10,"A great story featuring (in my opinion) some of the best looking cars ever built, they really new how to design cars in those days, function + beauty.Well acted with great special effects and editing, highly enjoyable.I just developed this really annoying daydream of being very wealthy and buying a GT40."
FORD V FERRARI,5 June 2021,8/10,"B e a u t i f u l, Though it should not have been named Ford vs. Ferrari, because there is hardly anything from the Ferrari side. It's only about Ford and how they took up the challenge to Ferrari after being humiliated. Sure, the script-writers have taken liberties regarding events and timelines. But the movie tells the tale of what transpired overall while keeping us entertained throughout. Basically the whole Ferrari take over bid by Ford which precipitated a chain of events leading to the showdown at Le Mans. Sure Ford had enormous resources in comparison to Ferrari. But certain aspects of a large corporation approach to motor racing served to hinder than help their Le Mans Campaign. The script does shine a light on that side of the narrative.Motor racing is a lot about egos & the human spirit. This movie demonstrates that pretty darn well. It's also a great reminder of the 'mechanical' era that is now behind us. One can literally feel the purity of those cars as they drive on the track. Some of the visuals are breathtaking - the shots of the Ford & Ferrari side by side on the long straight made my heart skip a beat. Equally, you are reminded of how far cars have come.Cinematography is the backbone of any racing movie and Ford vs Ferrari bucks the trend with some exiting & breathtaking shots all around. Director James Mangold gives his best shot at racing after Ron Howard's brilliance in Rush. At 152 minutes, the movie is long, but the editing department's work ensures smoothness. Production design, costumes and makeup oozes quality. Background score ably enhances the on screen visuals and is soft on our ears. Sound design is terrific. Christian Bale is simply fantastic, like always. Matt Damon was his usual self, although I don't think he did ""Shelby"" too well, as per the things I have read about him over the years.Overall, These are the types of movies where you take the entire families along to enjoy the adrenaline rush and get immersed in the thrills weaved on screen. I am sure even non car/racing people too will love the movie. When one watches it for the 2nd time, you would pick a lot of finer details that you miss in the first watch. And the best part of the movie, ""There's a point at 7,000 RPMs where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space, and time. At 7,000 RPM, that's where you meet it. That's where it waits for you."" 8.1 stars out of 10 for the thundering roar of those engines. Highly Recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,8/10,"Everything is beautiful about this movie, the cast, the direction, the story line (though might be a little twisted from reality) in short everything.
Christian Bale, with the weight loss and british accent, wonderful acting. Matt Damon being at his best.
Must watch, with friends, family or even alone. It does not matter."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,8/10,"The biggest contender for an Oscar award in my opinion. It deserves all of it's praise, it is the most amazing movie I've seen this year, I never expected to be so touched by an original story about an american car company which evolved into something way more. Demon and Bale are freaking amazing, both of them are outstanding actors that made this movie good as it is, they leak emotion, quality, professionality and talent. The ending was so sad and emotional that it made me wanna come back in time and change the circumstances and the outcome of the story....One of the best movie ever played by both of them."
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,9/10,"Henry Ford II offered to buy the Ferrari company. Founder and owner Enzo Ferrari turns Ford down at the last minute. Unable to take this lightly and vowing revenge, Ford II decides to use his considerable resources to defeat Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race. And a legend was born. ""Ford v Ferrari"" is the highly watchable cinematic depiction of the greatest rivalry in car racing history. Matt Damon portrays the calm and collected car designer Carroll Shelby who oversees the operation to win the race for Ford at Le Mans. Christian Bale plays the cocky and outspoken race car driver Ken Miles whose challenging personality stood out as much as his skill in driving. Together their tense relationship forms the heart of the story as their interaction covers the range of combative to genuine friendship as they make auto racing history. Of course, there's the races, where the high speed rush of the best cars of their time try to outspeed each other in fully charged blasts zooming to the finish line. One of the most notable bioflicks and a highlight in a year that has proven to be one of the best in cinema history, this is one that will turn out to be a fave among many fans of the silver screen."
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,6/10,"Since, the trailer, I didn't have high expectation on this movie, it felt like another bland movie about patriotism and success, and this is exactly what it was, I wasn't invested the story like in Rush because there wasn't much rivalry between the racers. However, it does well in term of sound and more practical effects, I have heard that this movie is really accurate to cars of that time, and I believe that if you are a car fan, you will like this movie.But as I said this movie is not very intelligent and well-written, it is just entertaining when you watch it whit you brain-off."
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,7/10,"This film is definitely worth a go. It's based on a true story and this film will keep you glued to your seat because of its awesome racing scenes.
I have given 7 because I am not that fond of or fascinated with cars or else the film definitely deserves more."
FORD V FERRARI,7 May 2020,10/10,"I don't know anything about car races. I know some name of races and racers. But I watch this film with joy, I was really interested in story. Firstly, the plot is based on real story but it tells masterly and it really cathes viewer. Secondly, the cast is awesome, Christian Bale and Matt Daymon shown amazing duet of friends and true professionals. Thirdly, the races arr shown very natural.
So, it' one of the best film of 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,8/10,"I didn't think that I liked race car driving... until I saw this! The first half of the movie is interesting, but not as gripping as the second half. The first half focuses more on the business aspects of how Ford wanted to remake their image and ended up in an intense rivalry with Ferrari to make the best race car (and win an acclaimed 24 hour race). The second half feels more like a traditional sports movie, with the emotional pay-offs and suspense and heartache and twists and turns. You don't have to be into sports cars or be a fan of race car driving (I'm not) to appreciate this movie. The performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale were superb as usual."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,7/10,"Long film at 2 1/2 hours, but enjoyable for the most part. Damon is brilliant in the role but Bale overacts. Best to see the film in a theater with a larger than life screen."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,6/10,"When you see ""v"" or ""vs"" in the title of the movie you naturally assume that it would be about a rivalry between the two of the main heroes and this movie can disappoint a lot considering it's absolutely not about that. But if you put aside a misleading title you can have a lot of fun along the way. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a hell of a team and you enjoy every second of their truly outstanding performances. Bale delivering his lines in his native British accent nails it perfectly whereas Damon's attempts at southern accent executed not always flawlessly but still very good; overall the movie feels really unimportant, with no clear meaning behind it - it is a part of the big company's history and not much of a story in my opinion. We don't see the characters grow, their backgrounds don't change; the only thing that's impressive besides the two main actors are race car sequences but we can watch the sports channel for that which makes this all in all good movie absolutely unnecessary to watch."
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,8/10,"A film that centers around the two central characters and their two central performances: Matt Damon's Caroll Shelby and Christian Bale's Ken Miles. As such, these were the two performances that the entire film would rest on, fortunately, Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give wonderful performances in this biopic. Ford v ferrari had these brilliant performances as well as an interesting story that is at its core about two men who are fighting for their passion being warped into the 'dick measuring contest' between two large corporate car manufacturers.
As such, the film is brilliantly titled as to reflect the fact that at the end, the story that is recorded will always be the competition between Ford and Ferrari, overlooking the true heroes of the story, Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby. Ford v Ferrari does a great job introducing audiences who may not be familiar with the subject into the world of cars, not over explaining but, simplifying and focusing on what is important making is a very easy viewing. Overall, Ford v ferrari had two memorable performances and was an emotional and insightful ride into the story of these two men."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"Good ride! That's the best summary. Ford v Ferrari is a good drama about the Ford company wanting to out-top Ferrari in the race tracks. It tells the story of Chelby and Miles and their crusade to win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Damon and Bale are top-notch here. Great acting, great scenes. Might make you even cry.Soundtrack is good and keeps the tone of the movie.Movie kinda drags for a while sometimes... it could be a little shorter. Sometimes it's just some drama filler to build up for what we are waiting for: the Le Mans race.Nothing to say on the events credibility because I'm not familiar with the real facts, and that doesn't bother me as well. It's supposed to be someone's take on the story, and that's ok by me!Overall, I'd recommend it if you like racing and drama combined."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,9/10,"A few reviews on here giving this movie less than 5 stars which is simply pathetic on their part, this movie deserves 5 stars just for the cinematography, I gave it an extra 4 stars for the acting alone, its not a perfect 10 but had they concentrated more on telling the story from shelby & miles perspective it certainly would have been 10/10.
Reviewers giving this low marks obviously missed the point of the movie or more so they didn't understand that this movie was telling the story of shelby & miles, the Ford vs ferrari story is just the background story, a story that is firmly cemented in the annals of history.
Matt Damon & Christian bale are fantastic as the lead characters in a movie about two incredible people."
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2019,7/10,"Going in, I knew this film had no shot of being a 10/10 for me. I am about as far from a gearhead or racing fan as one can be. With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari."
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,9/10,"This is based upon a true storyIn the 1960s, Ford wanted to merge with Farrari, but that didn't happen. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to get some revenge on Farrari (whose cars dominate the La Mans race in France) now wants to build a race car to beat Farrari in the Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is contacted to build that race car. Shelby did win the LeMans race, but health reasons now keep him from racing. He is also a car designer. Shelby's best driver and racing engineer is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and both he and Shelby build that car, a GT40 Mk 1 high performance racing car.This is a very complete racing story, and probably one of the best ever. Of course, politics enter into this and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) the Head of Ford Racing wants his own drivers to do the racing and not Ken Miles who Beebe feels is not Ford quality material. Shelby has no choice in this until Ford loses some races and he confronts Henry Ford II and gets his way. Or so we think as that almost changes later on too, but Shelby makes a very high risk bet with Henry Ford II in order to get his way.The first meeting scene with Carroll Shelby and Henry Ford II is pure gold. Listen carefully.We see a lot of very fast racing and - to be honest - a lot of this racing rivals the racing in some of the Fast and Furious movies. Kudos. Keep in mind the editing is a very big part of any racing movie and the editing here is spot on. More Kudos.We also see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964. It really wasn't talked about or even mentioned, but Lee Iacocca was the person that put Ford in the minds of young drivers who were the sons of World War II vets and this went a long way improving sales to rival Chevrolet.Notables: Catherine Baife as Mollie Miles, Ken Mile's wife; Noah Jupe as Peter Miles, son of Ken and Mollie; Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Shelby's Sales/ Auto Manager; Remo Girone as Enzo Farrari, Joe Bernthal as Lee Iacocca.A very good scene is when Ken punches Shelby who is trying to apologize for not taking Ken to France the first time because Leo Beeble wanted his drivers and not Ken. After the punch Shelby counters and they go at it until they become so tired they just rest there fully exhausted. All this time Mollie was watching the fight and goes into the house and gets both a cold drink.All in all a very enjoyable and complete racing story. The movie was nominated for Best Picture. It did receive the Oscar for Best Film Editing (told ya) and for Best Sound Editing.Stay tuned at the end to see what happened to Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. (9/10)Violence: No.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.

FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"Is not the best sports biographi movie, but this one definitely be on top list of all time. christian bale and matt damon shows us what a perfect Chemistry can impact to a movie. and bale? bale doing an incredible act performance.for you who are a motorhead this movie can speak to you in a way you'll never expect. i mean i come to watch a good movie, and shock by how good they tell ""how does it feel to drive"" damn. every scene where that exhaust were roar can give you a goosebumps.And yeah, don't worry ken, the world knows you're the true triple Crown winner"
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2020,10/10,"I've been saying this for years, but making a cine biography isn't easy. I know movies aren't an exact science, but most of the time I watch a biography, I found myself giving something around 7, when it's just an ok movie, or even lower. However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like ""I, Tonya"" or ""Darkest Hour"". And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.The most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That's me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.Anyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.The score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.To sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed."
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,5/10,"Typically if you show me a decent trailer involving actors of the calibre of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I will be at least interested in seeing more. Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing's core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans '66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the ""God-driven, hard-working"" Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.Carroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.This is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari's orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn't it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that ""only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race"", and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.The driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn't really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn't focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be ""visualising"" his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.I wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature."
FORD V FERRARI,28 June 2020,6/10,"I can only imagine how much better it could have been had Damon actually done research into Carroll Shelby and what he was really about.Not to mention, Damon is about 1 1/2 feet below the height of Shelby, and his mannerisms are completely off.Also worth noting, there's absolutely no verifiable proof to even remotely suggest Leo Beebe was even close to the villain portrayed here. I understand how protagonists/antagonists work in film, but for sobbing out loud, 'invent' that character, DO NOT drag a good mans name through the mud for the sake of theater."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,8/10,"Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."
FORD V FERRARI,27 May 2020,7/10,"The structure is neat, the rhythm is steady, the whole film is completed in one go, the racing part is even more breathtaking, and the ending is sigh and sigh. Adapted from real-life events, it tells the story of Ford Motor Company entering the racing market in cooperation with a car designer and a British race driver. The film can hardly be faulted. From the filming of the director to the acting of the actors, it can be said that everything is comprehensive. It is a very good biographical film. P.S. Junk Party A is not human! ! ! How can this be done! ! I'm furious! ! !"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,7/10,"Got to admit that this film was one of my personal most anticipated films of the year. The story itself which I only knew very few details about sounded really interesting, a David vs Goliath type of story. James Mangold's name was also a major attraction to the film, a seasoned film maker with some really good films. However the biggest draw of all was the cast and in particular Christian Bale...........who I will admit is my favourite actor of all time...............and oh yeah Matt Damon isn't bad too!I'm gonna be completely honest straight up I strangely didn't like this film as much as I thought I was going to..............maybe my expectations were too high?? However I am in some way surprise with how the film turned out, its a much more character driven film than I thought it was going to be!!! Le Mans only takes up the last 45-30 mins of the film which is not a lot, but I don't think that is a criticism at all.James Mangold has made as good as looking a film as I thought he would, from start to finish it is beautiful to watch. He manages to really immerse you in the time period almost straight away and makes you buy into the characters right from the get go. The film does show that Mangold really did do his research, the amount of care and attention the detail really shines through in the races. The more impressive part of the film is the good balance between the fast paced racing and the more slow character driven parts of the film, both of which complement each other really nicely. The tension in the race scenes really works because they are built upon really good character development and also development of their relationships, which is best shown between Bale and Damon. You care about them.Bale and Damon are both fantastic actors in my opinion so it is no surprise that they are really really good in the film.........Oscar worthy I'm not so sure but did it need to be.........No. Their on screen chemistry really shows that the actors must have had fun on set because they seem to have a really good connection during the film, its like watching two friends. Other shoutouts Tracey Letts, Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas all really strong performances. I think the best part is the pit crew and the close relationship they have with Bale and Damon is a real gem of the film.The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and simply put you in the drivers seat, some real nail biting racing that is a pure joy to watch. Considering that I didn't know how the story was going to end it really was..........heart pounding!!The film for me almost got an 8 out of 10 because the ending has such emotional punch, which is extremely effective. The fact that Miles didn't win the race and the death of Ken Miles so it was a complete surprise to me when they happened................the film handled the death really well and actually the final scene was a really nice close to the film. However the only thing stopping me from giving it an 8 is the re-watchabilty of the film, for some strange reason I don't see myself itching to watch it again straight away.........maybe its because its a long film and it is a slow paced film for the most part.Overall even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, its still a really good film 75% out of 100, its almost at 80% but not quite. Definitely recommend it just for the story of Shelby and Miles even if you don't like racing or cars..........this is a much more character driven film than you'd think!"
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,"Just awesome and exceptional. We hardly see good movies like this nowadays. Great performances from Bale and Damon, immersed car sounds to make you feel you are there. This movie is a must watch for racing and history enthusiasts, really enjoyed it. 👍🏾👌🏾"
FORD V FERRARI,19 February 2021,9/10,Can only result in a great movie. And that Istrien even if you are not a racing fan..
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,10/10,"I really can't think of any other racing movie of the 2010s decade or the 21st century as a whole that was so much fun and as riveting as this one. Christian Bale is brilliant at playing the true character of Ken Miles and his unsung story which has been known by very little people until now of how Ford were able to construct the perfect racing machine to rival Ferrari's perfect winning streak on the 24 hour Le Mans circuitOne of the best things I like the most about the movie is that not just how the racing action is directed and how the vehicle is shown, but also how it feels. The audio of the engine in this movie is impeccable on just how much pressure and stress Miles is putting on the engine and throttle at any given time, and just how he is able to perfectly stress the engine and sustain it for maximum endurance and figuring out just the right moment to push it just a little bit further for maximum performance. I really loved that touch that this movie has and I hope future racing movies learn from it. I also love how Miles explains this in many scenes, especially in one where he explains it perfectly to his son (did I also mention that the writing is impeccable)Matt Damon as Carrol Shelby is also an amazing supporting character and Christian and Damon bounce off eachother very well and have an equal presence in the movie. Bale's acting is great as always.I also love the cinematography and look of the movie. The directing of the racing action is incredible. The film visually is dripping with soul and atmosphere of the racing period where you can almost smell the fuming petrol and hot dripping sweat of the drives on the blistering Le Mans day and the cold dripping rain in the following storm.Overall I think it's a perfect racing flick and it's going to take a long while for another one to tell as great as a story as this one did and also being this much fun to watch all the way through"
FORD V FERRARI,19 October 2019,6/10,"Nothing really surprising or deep here, by the numbers script, showing the all-american cliches: manly American men, each more charismatic and talented than a hundred Italian men, their loving and hot American housewives, great professionals at wonderful Ford, etc. You know: USA Is No. 1. Yaaawn."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2021,7/10,"Solid, yet uninspiring story and narrative. Direction is serviceable. Strong performances but forgettable as a package with no real character moments. Exposition heavy. Unearned emotional moments."
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,10/10,"Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.
5/5"
FORD V FERRARI,18 July 2020,9/10,"I did NOT think I'd like this so much! I love to watch races, but I dont know much about cars or their history, so I sort of dreaded watching this. But whoa! This was a thrill ride of a movie! Bale and Damon have such chemistry and I really, really enjoyed watching them together. I even laughed out loud at times!The plotline is pretty good and I felt invested in watching them build the fastest car they could. The characters felt real and I was invested in them, too.Overall, if you're looking for a good time, watch this!!"
FORD V FERRARI,28 April 2020,10/10,"Oh man what a movie, this film was just perfect from start to finish with its perfectly written story and very strong acting, i really loved it"
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,8/10,"This is a very good film about the battle between ford vs ferrai leading up to Le Mans in 1966. It also is about the evolving friendship of Caroll Shellby played really well by Matt Damon and the great Ken Miles played brilliantly by Christian Bale. This film has some great racing scenes in it but it is more about the board room scenes and how companies battle each other. There are some thrilling scenes, great acting and dialogue and great music. Damon and Bale really played well off each other and this was a very entertaining film. I do recommend it. I think it will be remembered come Oscar time"
FORD V FERRARI,24 July 2021,3/10,"This is quite and ambitious and expensive production; visually not so bad, historically quite inaccurate, a little over the top acting here and there, and if you make it to the end, well, it just doesn't hit the mark....fails to actually showcase the significance and impact of the events.With that said, bale is simply over the top-not that ken miles was a well known personality, but his inconsistant portrayal gives not a revealing glimpse into the man, the driver, the husband and father that it purports to show, nor does damon do much more than chew gum, and, its just possible, truly possible, that given the script and the writing and the dialogue thrown out there, a couple of unknowns or barely knowns might have been way more effective (so much is expected from top actors like damon and bale that they are set up to fail from the beginning, as they are a major distraction from the events as they supposedly unfolded {see ToraToraTora}...)
then theres the cinematography...and one must wonder if cinematography is itself so boring these days that cinematographers have to find a way to be part of the story by shooting dizzying sequences one finds confusing, murky and dark. What ever happened to simply setting a camera up, bring it into focus and let the action happen within the marks?Thanks but no thanks..shelby and miles and iaccoca and henry the 2nd and enzo were pretty interesting characters in their own right, as was the ford gt itself...
and, what was the point of the tussle between miles and shelby?"
FORD V FERRARI,5 February 2020,10/10,"Really fine acting here. Some great camera work throughout the movie. And some exciting action scenes with great cars at play. The sound in the movie is awsome.
The way they say ""Ford"" :-D
Just fantastic.And its a real story guys!
Check it out"
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2020,8/10,"This film is not just for gearheads. It's not just for race fans or car geeks. This is a solid, well scripted, well directed, biography/drama with some of the most exhilarating race sequences on film that I've seen in a very long time. Everyone will enjoy this film whether they know of the history of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles or not. With such a simple title as ""Ford vs Ferrari"", you'd think that it's all about the cars and true, to some extent it is, but its also about the strengths and vulnerabilities of two unique individuals who were determined to develop an American made race car (the Ford GT40) to win the 24 hours of Le Mans race in 1966. It goes through their personal struggles, their triumph, and ultimately the fate and the effects of their actions on the racing scene as we know it. The combination of Matt Damon, as Shelby, and Christian Bale, as Ken Miles, was perfect. Absolutely perfect. No other actors could have taken on these roles and so profoundly brought them to the big screen. This is a film that will go down in history as a masterpiece of film-making."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2020,10/10,I missed getting to see this in the theater which I wish I had for the sound and experience but I rented it today on Prime and wow this is a great movie! If you grew up loving American muscle cars and cars in general you will love this movie. Legends these guys are! Watch it today!
FORD V FERRARI,2 October 2021,8/10,"The true story of when Ford took on the might of Ferrari in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1966.The cast is top notch led by Matt Damon and Christian Bale.I love the script and the subject matter but the film is too long. The first half of the movie is really good, but I think the actual Le Mans race (in the second half) is the weaker part of the movie. I also think the excellent racing film 'Rush' was better than this.However, definitely worth a watch, particularly for fans of racing."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"Just back from the theater after seeing Ford vs. Ferrari and it's totally enjoyable. It never dragged and never really felt rushed either. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the most watchable moviestars we have on hand these days, and their interaction can easily be seen as the bedrock of the movie.The racing scenes? We get pretty well all you could wish from the famous 1966 races at Daytona and LeMans where the Ford GT Mk II made its mark in racing history. I think in screen time they add up to almost an hour's worth of the 2:32 runtime of the movie, and they're filmed as well as (or better than) any other racing movie I can think of. Full disclosure here though: I personally think auto racing is obscene most of all because of its flagrant waste of fossil fuels, and anyone who argues that it's responsible for all kinds of auto design improvements is just blowing smoke. If and when this whole sport dies its inevitable death, good riddance.But OK, this is a movie review -- how about the cast? Matt Damon is just fine as always. He doesn't exactly have ""range"" -- he just plays himself in any movie (like Tom Cruise) -- but that's just fine. I have no idea if Carrol Shelby is really like that, but Damon is so comfortable and engaging in whatever he does that it always works. Christian Bale is much more of a technician, a method actor, and I'm sure he worked hard to nail the eccentric Ken Miles, the race driver and engineer/mechanic who values the pure experience of the business on absolute terms. It's fascinating to see him work.Two or three of the minor parts stand out. Catriona Balfe (best known for ""Outlander"") plays Miles' wife and gives her some depth -- much more than just a placeholder. And Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II), Jon Bernthal (as a young Lee Iacocca) and Josh Lucas (as the smarmy, vindictive corporate suit Leo Beebe) are all good. I don't have any idea how much of the infighting and scheming within the Ford corporation shown here is realistic, though I suspect much of it must be fictionalized to amp up the drama. But it makes for an engaging night out. Have fun!"
FORD V FERRARI,6 January 2020,5/10,"Movie is super primitive, cliche driven and as unoriginal as it gets. it totally holds on actors performances! script is brain dead. they did succeed with tear jerking goal, but boy everything else feels so artificial. re-watch it and you will come to the same understanding. cheesy dialog , poor camera, poor script."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,8/10,"Christian Bale and Matt Damon co-star in this vigorously-executed depiction of Ford Motor Company's full-on attempt to compete with Ferrari in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1966. This race is expertly recaptured in some of the most well-executed race car scenes in history. Along with exceptional period detail, there is also a riveting soundtrack to help the pacing.Bale gives a feral performance as Ken Miles, the combustible British race car driver who test-drove and helped develop the first Ford vehicle that could go head-to-head with Ferrari in Le Mans. Matt Damon gives a down-to-earth performance as Carroll Shelby, the retired race car driver who worked together with Miles and Ford on the groundbreaking race car. Tracy Letts is an authoritative presence as Henry Ford II, who was initially reluctant to get involved in the race car enterprise but eventually saw a new opening for the automaking giant.The film's narrative is guided by the sure hand of James Mangold's direction. Although the film proceeds initially at a deliberate pace, you gradually become invested and develop a firm rooting interest. Bale and Damon play well off each other and become a heroic duo fighting for both American interests abroad and against corporate chicanery within the Ford Motor Company. All in all, the film will take your breath away. It is proof that sometimes good old-fashioned storytelling aided by strong performances are all you need. Enthusiastically recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,8/10,It's a movie with power packed performances by great actors. Bale is as always getting inyo skin of the role completely. The story is amazing and the way both matt and christian handled it is impressive. The car racing shown is entertaining. Really enjoyed it.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,"Ford V Ferrari is about Ford wanting to win the le moz race. To do this they hire some of the best in the business, but to win the race they go through many problems.Since I found out about this film over the summer, I have been really looking forward to it. I couldn't contain my self since the first trailer came out. It is a movie with Christian Bale and Matt Damon. When I walked out of the theatre was happy with what I got. It wasn't a perfect film, but I still was happy and enjoyed my time in the theatre. The acting was the best part of the film. You obviously know that a film with Matt Damon AND Christian Bale is going to be really good. Those two are a great pair and should work with each other in many more movies.
The cinematography was surprisingly good. They had some tough tasks and they executed them really well. The race scene were spectacular. James Mangold nailed these scenes. The last two races were real nail biters. They got your heart pounding for the whole time. In the last race James Mangold decided to put some comedic relief. I am glad he did that because my heart would have came out of my chest if he didn't! The only flaw I saw with the film was the first act. It felt like it could have been made better. It dragged a little bit and it just wasn't as solid as the rest of the movie. It wasn't terrible it just couldn't hold up from how good the rest of the movie was.Overall, Ford V Ferrari was a great film I would recommend in theaters for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2020,8/10,"Carol Shelby and Ken Miles getting together to build a car, racing car for Ford to beat Ferrari in Le'Mans. It shows if you know your thing, you can actually turn that into gold. Using knowledge of physics, cars, driving; these two do build the car, and a great one too.
It also shows Ken Miles' journey from the short tempered and loner to a team player and fan favourite."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"I must say .I'm not big fan of cars, especially sport cars . But I must say I feel the adrenaline in me when I was watching the movie on big screen. Christian Bale is just perfect,you can feel that very well ,just brilliant . I love the times also ,no internet,no smartphones,no plastic packing. The best taste of Coca-Cola is from glass bottle and printed label on it xxx"
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,8/10,"What a great movie! Great plot, great acting by Matt Demon and Christian Bale. One of the best scene ever i watched in the history of Hollywood and it is in the end of this movie when Kem miles wants to end the lap together and later discovers that he was betrayed and after knowing that he still doesn't get sad or take any action because he knows that who is the real winner and he knows that he the champion.When i saw that trailer, i had thought it would be like creation of Ferrari and Ford cars and had thought it would be race between Matt and Bale but it was totally beyond my thoughts.Climax of this movie was pretty impressive."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,9/10,"After a slightly glacial exposition into the history of the stories behind motor companies Ford and Ferrari, the film goes into full on over-drive with one of the most pulsating second halves in a film you're sure to see all year. The film is a technical marvel with top-notch editing, sound design and direction - almost a lock to get nominations (and probably wins) in those categories and then some. Bale and Damon are simply stupendous, showing a real sensitivity in the more dramatic moments while showcasing their charisma and comedic chops in performances that rank among the year's best. F v. F is an exhilarating, exciting and emotional ride to be in the driver's seat for and undoubtedly one of this year's best."
FORD V FERRARI,14 September 2020,9/10,I enjoyed the racing scenes but it was the strong characterisation that was at the heart of this film. I think the husband and wife and father and son and mother and son scenes were all very good indeed - really natural (apart from Bale's walkabout accent) and the Damon and Bale scenes were a lot of fun.
FORD V FERRARI,11 August 2021,8/10,"I couldn't help but notice that those rating this movie highly were more or less equally divided between lovers of autos and motor sports (like me) and quite a few lovers of good acting and movies who couldn't care any less about this subject matter. While the plot of why and how Ford took on Ferrari in the '60s at the legendary LeMans racetrack in France is a well-known tale within that former group, it also proves to be an interesting ""based-on-a-true story,"" with several compelling characters involved, for the other group. While there's nothing wrong at all with Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby (he really did talk with just that accent!), it's his co-star, Christian Bale, playing the part of the racing driver and race-car engineer Ken Miles, who has the juicier role with the most layers to it. And he's up to the task, as are the supporting actors playing his wildly worried and yet still very proud wife and son. Not since John Frankenheimer's 1966 film ""Grand Prix,"" starring James Garner, has there been an (arguably) better movie about the bizarre and potentially deadly world of automobile racing. (Ron Howard's movie ""Rush"" in 2013 was a good portrait of two very different types of drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, but wasn't as good a movie, overall, as this one is.)"
FORD V FERRARI,13 April 2020,8/10,Very good film but at the same time very sad story I lost it at the final scene
FORD V FERRARI,11 November 2019,10/10,"Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.Shelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen ""co-driver"".The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.Although I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Wow. What a roller-coaster ride. Go in with a hesitant mind cause I not a fan of car racing. But this movie will bring u into the amphophere.Brillant acting, script, sound and director.The engine sound bring banquet feast to your ears. Most of the historical is correct with a little correction to make the movie interesting but that no bother me. Recommend watch this movie with a good sound system cinema!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be although I had some issues that held this film from being really good. The first 30-45 minutes were just uninteresting to me. It was well acted but there was nothing that was keeping me interested. Once we get to the point where they are modifying the car, it gets pretty great. Christian Bale and Matt Damon do great jobs but Bale steals the show. Bale is perfectly cast and is fantastic as this angry race car driver. Both Damon and Bale have perfect chemistry and play off well with each other thanks to a pretty good script although not a perfect one. Most of the other actors did a pretty good job also. There is also some good chemistry between Bale and Noah Jupe who plays Bale's son. They also have some genuinely touching moments together. The only character I didn't like was Jon Bernthal's character. I thought he was extremely one dimensional and irritating. I thought the racing sequences in the film were fantastic. They are incredibly well shot and paced. Even though the film is based on true events, I still felt exhilarated and was on the edge of my seat. The Le Mans sequence was one of the best sequences in film that I saw so far this year. The sound mixing is pretty great also. It immerses you within the races which makes those sequences so much better. I felt the last 10 minutes of the film was pointless. I thought the film was gonna end after this desert scene that I won't spoil but it kept going on. The music was also pretty bland. Even after just seeing the film, I don't remember any of the music. Some of the other technical aspects that I liked was the cinematography. During the racing scenes, it was great and during the rest of the film, it was pretty good. The film has a couple visual effects scenes that I thought looked pretty good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a pretty good film with great racing sequences, great acting, and some good cinematography even if the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were generally uninteresting."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,9/10,"This film is about people. The cars are secondary. I don't think I need to say much more. There is only one scene in this movie that is worthy of eye-rolling. In one particular scene, Mollie Myles drove the car recklessly in a pointless scene to give her ""character"". If it was historically accurate, then the rest of her portrayal was not. Either way, there was something odd about Mollie's portrayal.
Otherwise, this movie is excellent."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"I don't think this movie is gonna be groundbreaking or anything, but every single thing it does, it does it extremely well. From the acting, to the story, to the directing, etc. Everything in this movie is awesome. It feels much shorter than its runtime, it's exciting and also very emotional when it needs to be. I loved every second of it. Oh and the sound was amazing in the theater I went to, definitely watch it in theaters, maybe IMAX if you get the chance!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 August 2020,9/10,"This film does for Le Mans, what Rush did for Formula 1! Not only is it an incredible true story, but it is delivered in an incredibly compelling manner, and is a joy from start to finish!Christian Bale is absolutely fantastic as racing driver Ken Miles, delivering another career high performance, and Matt Damon is brilliant as car designer Carroll Shelby.It's worth saying that the supporting actors are also on top of their game, whether it be the smarmy Ford executives, or the savvy race engineers and mechanics...everyone character seems perfectly cast and placed in the movie.These two are the anchor of the film, and in no way is that boring, whether it be their personal relationship or their working relationship when they're trying to win the 1966 Le Mans for Ford...The cinematography is impeccable bringing you right into the action, and the use of real cars during a lot of the racing scenes makes them a lot more effective, it's a joy to see these beautiful cars in all their glory.All car enthusiasts will love this film, but it is a stunning movie that will be very much enjoyed by everyone!"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,9/10,"This is a very well made film, from the writing all the way to makeup, hair, and wardrobe. What stands out for me is the writing, which is crucial. There's very nice character development which introduces us to the 2 leads and shows us who they are. Rather than just ""getting into it"" with no introduction, we get to really like the leads and want to join them on their journey and want them to succeed. Without this, all you have are pretty faces, production value, vfx, chase scenes, and gun play.The icing on the cake is an epic moment that punctuates the one leads character arc. It's a moment that almost elicits tears.If you want to watch a great movie, which are few and far between, this is it."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"I've had a mild obsession with the GT40 since I got to see the winning car up close in 1966, just a few days after the race, so I am not an impartial viewer. Giving such a movie 10 stars may seem excessive, but for this type of film I think it's perfect. The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix. Side note: the sound systems in modern theaters have often caused me enough discomfort to cause me to put in ear plugs, but the sound of a full-race 427 at high rpm didn't bother me at all."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,3/10,"Okay, where do I begin ? I personally think the movie is bad, I mean really bad. That was torture."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,6/10,"The challenge of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which gets reduced to an unparsimonious Two Hours and 32 Minutes of Le Movie, is that you have to go fast, really fast, as fast as you can and for 24 hours on an uneven, treacherous track, sometimes at night, sometimes in the rain, all while not destroying the automobile itself, and also not the drivers. Occasionally, you become One with Le Car, somewhere right around 7,000rpm, and you either ascend into pure energy, or you blow a rod shifting into a bonus gear.There are a few chances for Ford v Ferrari to be a more socially meaningful film, maybe more openings for more clever statements about the stuffiness of businessmen and suited executives versus the life-loving, individualistic visionaries who make the businessmen jealous because they do not have the creativity or talent to do much beyond monetizing other people's excellences. On the other hand, the movie does a good job of instilling the adrenaline rush of setting new lap records, none of which feels very safe.If we all were to make a list of stuff to do for exactly 24 hours, speed racing is not likely to appear on many of our lists. Thankfully, most activities can be achieved in under three hours."
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2020,7/10,"My wife and I both did genuinely enjoy this movie. The story is great, acting is good, and you really do feel for the characters. My main recommendation is to watch it with the subtitles on as the accents make it challenging to follow at times. Also, someone who appreciates cars a bit more than myself may find themselves even more invested in the film."
FORD V FERRARI,17 April 2020,8/10,Undoubtedly one of the best film of 2019 Ford v Ferrari is a sports drama based on true story as stated in premise. The film showcases the perfect blend of thrill whether it's the race track or the corporate clashes. Racing scenes are all that one can anticipate but the sound and performance by Christian Bale makes those parts of the story very much likable. On the other side the part which I personally liked was the Corporate side of the story that how it all started with simple negotiation with Ferrari ended in humiliation and how it motivates Ford to built its own fastest sports car and in that journey how men in Suits exploits their power with their nonsensible ideas to please their Bosses at the cost of compromising the sheer talent and their due credit. Matt Demon Aced his role as balancing the Corporate and field business and has given proper support as an empathetic friend to Bale to which I say both actually complimented each others role which helped them to pull off the emotional drama which makes this movie an entertaining yet emotional sports drama
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction."
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,9/10,"The acting, casting, and writing are superb. I enjoyed this film from credits to credits. I could write about all of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. Why waste time when all you need to know is the writing and acting make this film feel organic and authentic. The pace is perfect too.If you watch this film you will not be disappointed."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"James Mangold fires a dart and hits the mark once again in his unique style and vision of the facts. A perfect film, exciting and with incredible energy. Perfect cast, from Jon Bernthal to Matt Damon, from Remo Girone to, of course, Mr. Christian Bale, the one who steals the scene and certainly in one of the strongest and most expressive interpretations of his career. Film that tells the story of the American dream in the racing circus and of the indomitable Ferrari. Flawless, beautiful and risky: perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,6/10,"There's nothing really new here, a pretty safe sports biopic like you're used to seeing, but this one still manages to milk the formulaic into something at times engaging, even while it's familiar. If nothing else, at least it's pretty damn good-looking and the racing scenes are shot and edited in a pretty high-octane way. Apart from that, it's cozily predictable (compulsory oft-repeated family melodrama and all), whether you know the history or not, but mercifully not in an enraging way like most movies of this type. A passable companion piece to Ron Howard's 'Rush'. I give it 5.5/10."
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2019,9/10,"Batman v Superman, Freddy vs. Jason and Kramer vs. Kramer, there's been plenty of battles of the heavyweights depicted before in Hollywood however, none of them have been as fast or as furious as Ford v Ferrari (or Le Mans '66 as titled here in the UK), an adrenaline fuelled race to be the best from director James Mangold.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle against the corporation and themselves to build a revolutionary racing car for Ford to challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.Le Mans '66 does what every great sports film should do in making you care about the characters first and foremost while the sport actually takes more of a backseat. The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.When the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.Coming to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.What makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is of a type. A certain brand of mainstream, middle America, crowd-pleasing movie about people that audiences love and critics begrudgingly accept. Movies of this type used to come around a few times a year, and they'd end up at the top of the box office at years end. That concept is completely foreign to an industry held hostage by giant TV series, custom made for a devoted but niche group of fans. We've forgotten that big blockbuster movies can be for everyone. Because for all the gibes about it being a ""Dad Movie"", Ford v Ferrari has the well-rounded, old-fashioned, slick, star-driven Hollywood entertainment that goes down smooth for anybody.It makes an almost too perfect comparison with the movie's star car, the Ford GT40. Somewhere between its impersonal factory-made cohorts and its sophisticated and refined rivals is a solid, powerhouse machine built with rugged American drive and ingenuity.From the acting, including one of Christian Bale's best ever performances and a series of surprisingly charismatic supporting work, to some of the most sensational racing scenes I've seen, Ford v Ferrari is strong filmmaking all the way through. Granted, mainstream Hollywood stuff like this inevitably smooths over a lot with cliche. We get a fair share of dopey dialogue and a particularly annoying child actor, but director James Mangold is too good to let the film succumb to its formula.This is red-blooded, American, alpha-male excitement, of the kind we've come to forget even exists anymore. It's heartfelt enough, smart enough, and fun enough to make its standard issue underdog trappings feel genuine. And just like that, a huge swath of ignored audiences across America are heard again. Give us more movies like this!85/100"
FORD V FERRARI,5 November 2019,9/10,"Ford V Ferrari (Director. James Mangold)James Magild once again delivers us another bloody great film. Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.At 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting.
Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing.
Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well.
Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.Overall Rating: A-"
FORD V FERRARI,17 March 2020,7/10,"There's a piont at 7000 RPM.Where everything fades.The machine becomes weightless.Just disappears.And all that left is a body moving through space and time.7000 RPM,that's where you meet it.You feel it coming.It creeps up on you,close in your ear,and ask you a question.The only question that matters."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,7/10,"When you see this movie, do not expect it to be high octane action or a fast and furious movie. This is about making history. Just being part of the journey. Seeing their passion about the car, speed, the feeling of it. Matt Damon And Christian Bale puts on their best performance. This is a slow burn of a movie. Learning about what works and what does not. They face challenges, setbacks, and problems. This movie is living the dream and fighting to get it. The problem of this movie, it has certain scenes where it can be cut short. Also sometimes I hear a lot of mumbling. I can't hear their words clearly. I don't know, maybe it's me. The point I am making is, it's great but I don't know if I want to watch it again. I probably forget about it in a couple days. Because it's not memorable. You may disagree. But that's my opinion."
FORD V FERRARI,13 April 2020,10/10,"This film is ALL about Ken Miles, who tragically passed away, shown briefly near the end of the film.
It is an injustice to name this film ""Ford vs Ferrari"". The film depicts Ken Miles, without whom, perhaps, none of the wins would ever have been made by Ford.
Now, I'm not an avid car enthusiast. That said, I do recall, from my relatively advanced age, that cars from that era, from Ford and other US car-makers, were not that well made. Because of this, later, the Japanese imports had much better fit & finish than US cars did. This is hilariously brought out in this film -- where the Ken Miles character cannot get his race car door to close! Then, one of the pit crew comes over with a Big Hammer (almost like Thor's) and Closes the door!
Yes, OK, there is some in the film about Ford vs Ferrari; but there is more about the Big Shots at Ford wanting to do things ""Their Way"", rather than the Correct Way -- purported by Miles & Shelby.This is what big corporations always do. Then when there is a success, based on the skills of others, they cannot pat themselves on the back enough!The fact that I really don't see myself as a race car or even a sports car enthusiast, and that I've rated the movie a ""10"", should tell you something. This life is NOT about corporations; it IS about People! For this film, that Person is Ken Miles. OK, certainly Carol Shelby too. Kind of like an Earp&Holiday-esque sort of thing with heavy emphasis on Ken Miles.
Oh, you want some description of the acting, do you? Well, I'll just say that the acting was so good, it never got in the way of telling the Ken Miles story. That should be enough praise for the actors. Look Ken Miles up on Wiki."
FORD V FERRARI,17 March 2020,8/10,"Overall, this is a well produced and well acted biopic. The historic story of how Ford was motivated to take on the 24-hour endurance racing circuit is very interesting, especially given how Ford came from nowhere to not just enter the circuit, but almost immediately dominate it for the four years they competed.Those details of how Carol Shelby and his chief driver Ken Miles teamed up to produce an historic pairing is well told, with one glaring exception. There is a decided effort to portray the Ford executives as clueless and entirely lacking in human attachment. Worse, most of those scenes are entirely contrived, and plain wrong.There is one very nice scene of Henry Ford II speaking with Shelby about how it wasn't the first time that Ford went to war in Europe. The rest of the portrayals of Team Ford takes on a predictably negative and entirely stereotypical formula.Apart from that, the interactions of the rest of the cast is both interesting and faithful to the truth. Ken Miles was robbed of an historic first of sweeping the big three of the endurance races in a single year, and this film shows how that went down.The end scene between Shelby and Miles' son was especially poignant and worthy of the film. Add in highly effective editing and musical score that achieved a high degree of synergistic power in portraying the ""perfect lap,"" and that alone makes this film highly worth watching."
FORD V FERRARI,12 April 2021,10/10,In Ford vs Ferrari (2019) there is everything I believe and think about life.I saw it 3 times in a row (7 hour).
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari absolutely deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Film. I think it is one of the best movies of Mangold. Just loved that movie, it has an amazing visuality and sound editing. Bale and Damon made great jobs too. I wish Bale would nominated for Oscar. He deserves, such a talented actor."
FORD V FERRARI,22 June 2020,7/10,"I know I'm the bad guy when I say this, but I honestly thought it was just fine. Not great, but fine.I liked all aspects of the movie except the script. I'm a shelby Cobra/GT fan, I like cars, I like racing, I even like Le Mans specifically so I'm a sucker for this kind of thing.That said there many times in the film where they really amp up the sports drama cliches so much that by the end of I was starting to get irritated.There's a part where Ken Miles says something to effect of ""We have to dump the engine, it's no good if we can't break"" and his wife in the background goes ""but isn't the whole point of it the power?"" and I actually groaned out loud. Not so much that his wife isn't an expert, but that the director felt like his audience was too stupid to be following along at this point...and that kinda thing happens throughout the whole movie. There's many times where the same line gets repeated a couple times to make sure the audience understands whats happening I guess, but I feel like they aren't giving the audience enough credit.They also included an unnecessary mustache twirling villain that comes in every few minutes to try to foil the plans of the heroes, but it doesn't really make any sense because it's in his best interest for them to succeed. He's literally being paid to make sure they win. It gets pretty hokey at times.Despite both Damon and Bale being all kinds of great, Bale morphs into Ken Miles near perfectly, I can't give it an 8/10 because, while its a cool time waster and especially nice to see the cars on screen, I thought as whole it was just fine. Not great, but just fine."
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,7/10,The ending sucked. And what happened before the ending sucked. Most movies that are based on real life ends up in a bad way
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
FORD V FERRARI,4 April 2020,8/10,"Fantastic movie.
Best of 2020 for me.
Loved it.
The political side of it was not nice, but a sad reality in every sport."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2020,,"The movie is very well done: excellent interpretations, high quality from a technical point of view... The plot is perhaps a bit easy and unsurprising, with pat conflict between the Ford executives and Ferrari, and between those same executives and the car designer and pilot. It tries to be an underdog story, but it didn't quite work for me that way, given that Ford had more money than Ferrari and that their executives are kind of assholes.Still, they succeeded in making the two main characters interesting, helped by the good interpretations, and it was always entertaining. The more than 150 minutes did not drag the movie down."
FORD V FERRARI,16 January 2020,8/10,This movie is so energy-filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant performance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Cool film great acting awesome cars brilliant story ........!!!!!!!! Christian Bale never fails to act his socks off also Matt Damon was his cool self and the supporting cast all played there part , cool film i would defo reccommend .....!!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2020,6/10,"Ken miles acts pretty good. Carrol Shelby acts soso. A little biased. Guess American made a movie because they seldomly win races. Also, ugly Ford executives."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,7/10,Both the lead actors of Ford V Ferrari are some of the finest actors of this generation who have been struggling to find a hit since 2015. But this film has given them a much needed hit and potential Oscar nominations. Mangold has delivered a very good follow up after the blockbuster Logan. This film scores high on production values compared to other action / racing films which is a huge plus point
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2019,10/10,"I love racing history, the old races, the grit of the track. This film exceeded my expectations, since most productions coming out of Hollywood have to add the political correctness aspects. Thankful for a straight-up story of racing history without the in your face propaganda. Excellent film, highly recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Directors can kill a good script, or the movie can be spectacularly well done like this one.I kept marveling at the wonderful sets that made the movie feel like it was the 1960's.There was well placed humor throughout.The CGI was also quite well done.It's been a long time since I've watched a movie as well done as this one."
FORD V FERRARI,30 August 2020,5/10,"It's disappointing but expected nowadays that this middle-quality film would get a 92 RT rating. With the exception perhaps of Matt Damon's character, every role is predictable and flat. It's one of those films that's seemingly suspenseful but is mildly boring, at least after a while of it. I never could understand the appeal of car crash scenes that viewers have seen a thousand times before. The rivalries -- between the US and Italy, the corporate goons and the free spirits, the free spirits and the race officials -- are written in the ham-handed, ""we have no respect for the audience so we'll shove it down their throats"" way you'd expect. Ninety minutes might have worked but it just gets tiresome."
FORD V FERRARI,2 January 2020,10/10,"It just felt like the 60s when I was a kid. Uncomplicated and risky. But it was fun. And this movie reminded me exactly of the attitudes of the times. For me this was just such a rare and treasured experience. I watched the movie from start to finish and every time I had to leave it for a minute, I had to rush back to make sure I didn't miss anything. How can I explain what I was seeing? Enjoyable action performed by masterful actors woven into a meaningful story. Friendship, challenge and trust all displayed in a way that I could enjoy. Trial and error engineering before computers took over the decision process ... wow what a magical time to be alive. The Le Mans wins by the Ford GT40 on 66, 67, 68 and 69 ... epic effort and akin to the first Moon landing as far as motor sports is concerned. In this current political landscape, I can imagine that people who weren't alive then, being dismissive of this story. But for me it was a magical experience and I am grateful that this movie was created."
FORD V FERRARI,10 October 2021,9/10,"One of the best car racing\documentry movies I've seen, the awesome duo Matt and Bale gave us their best to role the originals and carried the movie to be an oscar winner of two awards of many other nominations, must watch !"
FORD V FERRARI,10 March 2020,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari this reminded me of how great are biographical movies are, i don't know where to start but in my views this doesn't lack in anything for me, the story of the movie gets us back to the life of many racers that wrote history, well i needed 30 minutes to get into the movies atmosphere till i know Who is who? What are they doing? When the structure was completely built, what i liked most is you don't get lost with the movie it can express itself easily such a well done editing the movie just kept me alive and i was linked to it really, there was really a tug of war between the two great characters (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) Christian really outshines Matt, i didn't know how i flew over time because a two and half hour movie is long, ending felt so sad to me situations really changed from first to last, i like cars but am not into racing cars but i am glad i got knowledge more on them how things are going on, highly recommended even if you are not into cars, 10/10⭐"
FORD V FERRARI,9 March 2020,9/10,"So often the movie well tell the facts and how it went. This is the case.It's a great movie, 2hr 30 minutes but you can follow it breathless.Some good actors and again the history that repeats itself...I don't want to spoil it. Watch it. It's a great movie."
FORD V FERRARI,6 July 2020,8/10,"Yes, it's slow, yes the film is long, did I care no.This is history you're watching, and the fact you get to relive this epic journey from the comfort of your sofa, was brilliant.I was pleasantly surprised by Bale's accent and portrail of Ken Miles.
I will say one thing, lately it almost seems as though Matt Damon has a clause in his contracts, that states he has to be eating or chewing something, because just like the Martian, he's doing it again in this.
Very good film though, thoroughly enjoyed it."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,9/10,"As far as movie goes its really good, wish i could say the same about this shamefull (true) story. robbed of his victory by damn bureaucrats, so sad."
FORD V FERRARI,29 March 2020,8/10,Good story telling. Gute Unterhaltung.(gute Unterhaltung)
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,6/10,"This movie has thrilled to a lot of people, in case, I saw a good movie, but not good enough, normal, I am so sure i will not see it again, i must admit it has a great edition and music"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,9/10,"In the era of EVs with the fancy names like Roadster or Cybertruck, it's like looking back at the dinosaur age of cars! A bit of overacting was there, but the movie making was fantastic. A classic Hollywood novel."
FORD V FERRARI,23 March 2020,8/10,"A good movie I watched in 2020 is also the best racing and sports movie I have seen in recent years. From the very beginning of the movie, Ken's respect for the game, his understanding of the car, and his grasp of every corner, all showed the highest professional quality of the athletes. I saw the supremacy of sports in him, but it was very helpless. Sports is a game between pure capital. In the eyes of capitalists, sometimes winning or losing is not the key. The most important thing is how to use means to ensure the maximum benefit. There is no winning or losing. Only the pros and cons are completely contrary to the spirit of sports. Ken also made several psychological struggles in the car on the last lap. At such a fast speed, he still had to make a choice of thoughts. He was really helpless in tears. On the other hand, in order to compete with absolute speed, even if the vehicle is out of control, Enzo Ferrari is basically on the scene throughout the game. The Italians themselves are worthy of respect;"
FORD V FERRARI,2 April 2020,7/10,"But pobably even better if you're really into cars, but good anyway. There is a lot of technical car stuff, I wonder what someone with a true understanding of racing and car engineering thinks/feels watching this movie, how much is on point? Beacuse it's some technical talk going on and stuff like that, about cars and racing. I personally don't know anything about it, I like racing video games but don't actually know that much about cars. But there is some beautiful cars in this movie, really mesmerizing. Acting is good too, on most accounts, especially Bale off course, but he already proven to be a great method character actor by this point, it will be intresting to see what he does next in his career. The story is off course very predictable if you already know the true story, which I actually did, but it was very good watch anyway, inspiring and tragic. Cinematography and sound outstanding. Also some humor and drama which both worked.But the most beautiful parts of this movie, that I will carry with and that I didn't know that it would actually have a good impact, is the brotherly friendship between Miles and Shelby. Also their passion and drive. And the comment: ""you can't win a race with a committee."" Amazing and true about so many things, too many opinions of too many people that want to control a thing to what they want it to be, never works. It usually does the opposite of what it is set out to do.Anyway, beside the big tragedy of Ken Miles, a real character and a genius it seems he was a tale of victory and success. All in all, a very good movie. I think it's even better if you truly know car stuff though, but it's good either way. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2020,9/10,"Too bad I couldn't see this film in the cinema, it's incredible! Damon and Bale have such good chemistry that they make you like the movie more, and all the racing scenes are awesome!You definitely have to see it."
FORD V FERRARI,21 February 2020,9/10,"One of the best movie that I have seen, the racing of the cars was awesome."
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,10/10,"Yes I love car racing, but I am impressed by how the story is crafted. It's not Ford vs Ferrari, but it's more about real people like (Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby) against corporate micromanagers who just want obedient corporate-slaves (aka ""team-players"") instead of value-adding (and a bit protruding) individuals. the history has been so perfectly portrayed in this movie. the emotion of Ken Miles at the end just before he slows down the car, it's an excellent scene... such an unforgettable hero.. and it's great that this movie reminds us once again about the ""bad"" people (i.e. Leo Beebe) in this world. nobody applauses this loser right?"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,8/10,Great to see a well done movie that isn't based on a comic book-keep them coming Hollywood. Thanks.
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,6/10,Well F v F is better than 1917 or Parasite but it's still a very ordinary movie. Worth watching but worthy of no awards. What a poor year for the film industry.
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,5/10,"I'm an hour in and all I can think is why this is up for oscars. Nothing stands out at all and it's a little dull. It's all been done before. Watch cool runnings, Eddie the eagle. It just didn't draw me in. No real stand out performances from what I can see and a story which is liberal with the truth.I'll say it again. Oscar nominated? I think the oscar panel got a lot of free gifts from the studio.Watch Senna instead. Me or my partner are not racing fans but both loved that."
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,"Being a hardcore fan of Christian Bale, I rarely miss any of his movies. But his portrayal of the legendary racer and racing car developer Ken 'Bulldog' Miles in 'Ford vs Ferrari' has simply swept me off my feet. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days rivalry between the car giants Ford and Ferrari where corporate egos of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari changed the complexion of the motorcar racing in the days to come. Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk.
P. S- I am not an F1 freak, yet I loved every frame of it. Such is the power of this movie..."
FORD V FERRARI,1 July 2020,9/10,"It's not my favorite theme, but the story is very good. Maybe not satisfactory, but that's the way life is. It's the story itself that counts and Christian Bale were the best for the leading role. As if that were not enough, it's based on real events."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Well who'd of thought it?
Take a true mondern day great (bale as ken miles) and a gifted actor as damon playing the legend of carol shelby
Give them a good story of mostly true events and wow you've a GREAT. FilmNow who would of guest that?????In this day and age of monster films dominating the box office this adult orientated movie is a gemIt also looks like the two main actors really had a blast making this film"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,8/10,Very impressive movie! Beautifully directed by James Mangold with some amazing performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The racing parts felt like Gran Tourismo and were very enjoyable. Definitely a Golden Globe contender if not an Oscar contender.
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2020,8/10,"Fantastic movie. I know nothing about cars yet this film captured me and held me 'til the end. I found myself feeling the tension and adrenaline of the races. The characters are easy to root for, they feel authentic, real and, most of all, imperfect. The conflict comes mostly from the inside of Ford, which was very interesting to me. Ferrari is a secondary source of conflict, way behind the own suit men of Ford.The only things I'd change are very small. Sometimes, we got intercuts from the adrenaline of the races to Miles' wife and son at home listening to the radio. This was frustrating to me. I wanted to see the races, where the action was, and I felt there were a little too many of these intercuts. Also, Miles' arc felt slightly unmotivated to me. I never understood what made him decide to actually accept and tie the race with the other two Ford cars. Even Carroll Shelby's petition wasn't a very intense one, as to make Miles change his whole personality for it.All and all, this is a fantastic movie, with a great script and great performances, and it definitely is worth a watch."
FORD V FERRARI,2 August 2020,8/10,"The movie is heavily entertaining, however, can sometimes feel stretched out, it is almost like it could be 15 minutes shorter! Looking past this, the movie can still be recommended as the beginning and ends are action-packed."
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,8/10,"SYNOPSIS:
The true story based on the Le Mans race in 1966 following former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) striving to make Ford a serious contender to Ferrari. However, problems arise when his driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) may not have the image Ford wants.REVIEW:
James Mangold does here what very few Directors can do and that's make me interested in something I have no interest in. Everything this film was screamed ""YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, JOHN!"" I've never been one to care about cars, or racing and definitely not films focused on that, but wow this film was executed damn near perfectly. Mansgold creates an intriguing conflict and dialogue. To no surprise we also get superb acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Then you have an amazing supporting cast with the likes of Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts. Josh Lucas played the perfect ""douche bag who thinks he's too good for everyone and everything"" and has a very punchable face which made the ending to this film relatively bitter-sweet (if you've seen this film you know what I mean). I was so afraid of this film being what every film with cars is and that's ""turn left, then turn right, then turn left, reverse and do a 180, turn left again"" and I can't even begin to explain how much that irks me, but this film is beautifully paced and is edited so well that I was actually on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the outcome would be.CONCLUSION:
What I tell everyone is that this is the ""Green Book"" of 2019. Obviously, very different subject matter, however, the very well made, emotional, warm, sad, happy and crowd pleasing type of film worthy of an Oscar nomination. So, regardless if you're a fan of cars or racing I recommend this to everyone. 8.7/10."
FORD V FERRARI,3 March 2020,9/10,"A popular film among audiences and winner of 2 Academy Awards, Ford v Ferrari appears to be a sleeper hit of 2019. It tells the true story of Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they work to get the Ford Motor Company a seemingly impossible victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The performances from Damon and Bale are very good, giving us two easily likeable characters. It has these two determined men as they face opposition not only from the demand of making the fastest car in the world, but also from executives from the Ford Motor Company. Despite what the title may think, Ford is made out as a villain of sorts, even more than Ferrari. This isn't as much the story of Ford's upset of Ferrari as much as it is Shelby and Miles' upset of Ferrari.What's best about this film is that it isn't as much a Rocky-esque underdog story as it is a story of passion. Ken Miles was satisfied with the outcome of Le Mans, even though he got cheated out of his rightful place at #1. He got his chance, he knew in his heart that he won, and that's what matters to him. Not only that, but there's the passion of Shelby to make the car to win the race while the corporate people at Ford just want the glory associated with winning. It's as much ""Shelby and Miles v Ford"" as it is ""Ford v Ferrari.""The racing sequences are practically perfect, even from the perspective of someone who doesn't watch car racing. They're intense, fun to watch, and show excellent camera work. Most importantly, they capture the thrill of the race, aided through the movie's editing, which is as fast paced as the cars themselves. The film's editing is perfect. It didn't get the Oscar for nothing. Speaking of Oscars, it also won one for Sound Editing, which was also well deserved. The sounds of the race do their part to add to the thrill, a perfect combination of flawless editing.Ford v Ferrari is an excellent film that serves as one of the most satisfying films of recent years. It's a perfect blend of story, character, and fantastic racing sequences. This is a must watch for car buffs, but also a definite recommend for anyone."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2021,6/10,"A movie to show its a thriller. But its not. The story had a lot of potential. Bale and Damon play their roles fairly average. That""s they got nothing to do."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"I had zero interest in this movie. It didn't look bad but it didn't seem too interesting to me. Main reason I had little interest was because it was directed by James Mangold(I've never been disappointed in his movies, especially with logan) and this was amazing. Great acting and chemistry between the two leads. Bale and Damon were amazing together. Had a very interesting story as well. Great racing scenes throughout. At 152 minutes the movie was never slow or boring, and always pulling the viewer in. Didn't feel long at all. Very sad ending. Makes me want to know more about this event. Mangold's best film , besides Logan. Really great film. Hope it gets some oscar noms."
FORD V FERRARI,14 March 2020,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film ""Logan"" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.Firstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled ""Ford v Ferrari"" the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.I do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason.Other than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,7/10,"This is the type of movie about how the little guys show up the big boys on the race track and prove to everyone that they're right and the nabobs are all wrong. I had some real emotional moments watching the racing (it's almost inevitable if you watch beginning to end) and I found this movie reasonably entertaining.It's a masculine tale beginning to end - the only female character of note is Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) as racer Ken Mile's wife, who for the most part seems to be in the movie as an afterthought. This movie treads a well-worn path as it unfolds almost exactly like every other car racing movie ever made, from ""Grand Prix"" (1966) to ""Days of Thunder"" (1990) while still managing to set itself apart from all of those, even if only in some minor details. Damon (as Carroll Shelby) manages to be a rock steady influence throughout the entire movie, applying his good-old American know-how to temper the hot-headed but brilliant racer Ken Miles (Bale). This movie has few or no surprises, but still manages to be a good watch from beginning to end.If you happen to be a fan of car racing, this is probably a must-see movie. For most of us it is a good, solid ""little guy vs. the establishment"" tale told mostly from behind the wheel (and under the hood)."
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,8/10,"Beautiful film, kind of same old same old but adds its own depth. The performances of the cast is phenomenal, beautiful chemistry and look the film has. Great for the family. I hope Matt Damon gets nominated for an Oscar for his performance too. Christian Bale got a nom for the golden globes so I'm sure he's getting one too. Script is fine, director did great solid 8"
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,7/10,"Ford v Ferrari, or 'le Mans 66' as it's called here, is a decent above average based on a true story movie. It's very pretty to look at. It has very good actors being watchable and charming as mavericks to root for, and suits who are charmingly smarmy and inept. It has beautiful cars doing what beautiful cars should be doing, being driven photogenically.There's nothing to complain about. It's 2.5hr run-time doesn't drag at all, it swishes by as amiably as a Sunday drive through familiar countryside in good company. Bale does Bale. Damon does Damon. The GT40 is the prettiest race car ever. Things are as they should be.It's just not particularly memorable either."
FORD V FERRARI,5 February 2020,10/10,"Never have I given a film a 10 without an ending that was satisfying and worth the wait, but this is a real film made with real film. That raises the enjoyment of it so dramatically that I made an exception. It is true to the original story based on several biographies. Matt Damon and Christian Bale look and sound like the real characters. The acting of everyone is superb. You can watch it for the acting and most of the story alone or you can admire the beautiful look of real film: the rich color we took for granted in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Most movies since the 90s look terrible. It is unfortunate so many have gotten used to bad looking films. For example take the Seth Rogan film ""50/50"" as an example of how worthless good stories are with the dystopic glare and bright, diffused white light of video. They are colorless. ""Sex and the City"" is another good example. In that 2008 film the ocean is a dirty brown in one romantic scene!This film is for everyone: car or racing lover, or not. I am neither, but was enthralled from start to finish. It was not just the beauty of the color using real film and genius photography, it was an amazing script. It is a good story but
the end of the real life hero Ken Miles is sad and weighs the film down."

📜 Plot : American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Ford vs Ferrari is period drama set in 1960s. Matt Damon as Shelby and Bale as Ken Miles share chemistry which elevates the experience of the movie. Brillant performances by the leads and a true story fined tuned to perfection (arguably). Bale as Ken Miles is absorbed in the character and delivers praiseworthy performance. Matt On the other hand has provided amazing support. The Screenplay and Direction of James Mangold has brushed excellence in this one. Emotions are realistic and genuine. All in all sports dramas are long but still non Automotive enthusiasts stick to the screens because of the amazing leads at helm.
.
.
👍 Goods : Christian Bale as Ken Miles and Matt Damon as Shelby's Chemistry is infectious and natural . Brilliant Cinematography to reflect times of 1960 with great action sequences of races.

FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,9/10,"Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen."
FORD V FERRARI,7 October 2021,7/10,"I put off watching this as I'm not that interested in cars but the reviews were so high I eventually felt like I had to and it was much, much better than I thought it would be. The direction and epic scale of the movie really bring to life a captivating story that amazingly seems to be mostly true. For me it's a little long (2h 32m) but the driving sequences are spectacular and the human element keeps the movie interesting even if it feel's like real life has been smoothed out quite a bit with broad brushstrokes to keep things black and white."
FORD V FERRARI,3 May 2021,10/10,"An incredible yet devastating true story brought to the screen. Hooking performances from both Bale and Damon. Visually mesmerising, yet dramatically moving, with engaging depth."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,6/10,"For what it was, well done, but didn't have much drama, excitement, or emotion and there is two and a half hours of it.I'm well versed in the story having and viewed material about it many times over the years.Was worth a watch but can't recommend it for your average viewer. There's just not enough there for your average viewer. If your a car person, specifically car history it's possibly more your speed.I've fallowed Ferrari and the GT40 as far as Ford is concerned; but I'll probably never watch this one again.Good n then for getting it make but there's not much here for most people."
FORD V FERRARI,11 March 2020,10/10,"There's a reason why this was nominated for best picture. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both amazing in this movie.For once Ford is the villain and not the hero. I had no idea who Ken Burns was before watching this movie I can honestly say that the guy was amazing. Christian Bale does a fantastic job portraying him and Matt Damon does an amazing job as Shelby.The story is great, the script is Great Bend even though this movie is close to two hours, maybe even a little over oh, it really doesn't feel like it and is Thoroughly entertaining and amazing. You are not regret renting or buying this flick."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"What a great movie from the moment it starts, the chemistry between Christian Bale & Matt Damon is just excellent!Everything was great with this movie, a fantastic true story, cinematography, lots of heart and high adrenaline, totally transfixed whole way through, great seeing it on iMAX screen!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 March 2020,10/10,"Perfect acting, perfect story, perfect directing. Everything about this movie is perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,22 December 2019,10/10,"Wow! What a thrilling and a worthy for best picture nomination is this movie. The story is so thrilling, literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. Christian Bell, and Matt Damon are superb!!! Adrenaline runs through it watching it. This is the best car race movie ever. The race scenes and the sound mixing is just fantastic. Really, at the end of the movie, it makes you sigh and say ""What a ride""
It has been a great year in films and at this point not sure which movie will get the best picture of the year. For sure F Vs F is one of the best."
FORD V FERRARI,31 May 2020,10/10,"American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. Because Ford is biggest company's, they have struggling due to the company's image and the business issue like those. You should watch this with IMAX4D. Surrounded in 4D sounds, you can feel the coolest engine sound from all over you. At least, you have to be surrounded in great audio systems."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,10/10,"James Mangold directs as Tracy Letts, playing rich dickhead Henry Ford II in Le Mans '66, (Ford v Ferrari), throws a spanner in the works, and tells his staff to come up with an answer to falling sales, or walk. And Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca puts his wheel nuts on the line, and tells Ford that no one aspires to buy a Ford. James Bond, (that degenerate), does not drive a Ford! Hell they all want Ferraris. Because they are thoroughbred sports cars winning the Le Mans 24 hour race. And Henry, thank god for Lee, actually thinks it's a good idea. So armed with a cheque book and pen, Lee flies to Italy to make Ferrari an offer. Maybe Remo Girone's Enzo played them, because he accepts another inflated Fiat offer. Not sure if it was already on the table, it would appear not. But with Ferrari in play Fiat took a swipe. And by the way Henry Ford is a fat pig Enzo tells Lee, as a parting shot. Who then repeats what he said to Henry. Rightly pissed Henry decides that Ford Motor Cars are going to build their own sports cars. And beat Ferrari at their own endurance race game.But how? Well with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby for a start. And the winner of the 1959 Le Mans has form. Retired due to a heart problem, in 1966 he's now building AC Cobras. Such a beautiful car. But to build a car to take on Ferrari is a different animal. And needs a pure racer, in the form of mouthy mechanic Christian Bale's Ken Miles, who's looking for the perfect lap. A wrench may be the sum of their abiding brotherly love for each other.I cannot say I'm a fan of motor-racing, but Le Mans '66 had me on the edge of my seat, with definitely no drag in the 150 minute run time. But Ken Miles was not Ford's first choice of driver for their new GT40. Josh Lucas is the nasty Leo Beebe, soon to be Ford Racing Director, and determined to keep him off the team. He and Ken get off to a bad start with the unveiling of the new Ford Mustang. And Ken does have the sort of temperament to say anything on camera. That makes the Ford suits a little uneasy! But you have to love Christian Bales's bluntness. I feel sure this is another Oscar worthy performance from Bale, among a very talented cast. And he spars well with wife Mollie, played by Catriona Balfe, and Noah Jupe is his adoring son. But Ken has to drive because it's in his blood. Fuelled by British tea. And he has the courage to drive a car at 218mph in the Le Mans Mulsanne Straight. The GT40's top speed, as Ferrari looked on. Let's just hope the car can hold it together, with a throaty engine shoehorned in. And pray the brakes don't give out. As Shelby says, at 7,000 revs man becomes machine, and James Mangold makes you feel every one of them.But Ford's entry into Le Mans was not without disaster. And when Henry Ford II is idling in the slow lane on the track with Shelby one day, he puts his money where his mouth is. And through the tears, tells Shelby to go to war. The driving seat is now 48 year old former tank driver Ken's to lose. But first he has to win the 24 Hour Daytona.I cannot pretend to know much about the technology of the car, but I thought Ray McKinnon's Phil Remington adding go faster strips was great fun. They were really for the aerodynamics of the car! But what a rocket blast. Behind the scenes below explains better with Christian Bale.With cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, amazing photography and a cracking storyline, James Mangold proves that a driving based film can have massive appeal to all. A terrific job."
FORD V FERRARI,12 November 2021,6/10,"Really enjoyable film to watch, excellent production with high octane sequences and energy. Not long after watching it though, I find myself struggling to remember all the much about it. Im not sure the film taught me anything, and that is essential to being a complete film. 'Good"" would be an appropriate word. But not great."

FORD V FERRARI,25 January 2021,9/10,"The film also known as 'Le Mans 66' provides us with a warming story centred around Ford's desperate push to beat Ferrari in racing. 'Ford v Ferrari' prepared the roles of the joint protagonists to be Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, however, a change in casting saw Christian Bale portray Ken Miles, an English race car driver and mechanic - and Matt Damon play Carroll Shelby, an automotive designer and former driver himself. The film, lasting for 152 minutes, begins in 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the very beginning, we see Matt Damon's character driving in Le Mans, struggling to cope with his heart condition, despite going on to win the 24 hour tournament. Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II share very similar ambitions and in their attitude are very alike. Both capitalists in their business, thriving for profit and greed, Enzo's success with Ferrari makes Henry envious, and displays a sharp, harsh nature towards his workers. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motors and Henry Ford. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, who as mentioned won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Ken wears his heart on his sleeve, has a passion for driving and expresses his loves his wife and son, his race car driving, combined with his work as a mechanic at his garage, wasn't supplying enough money for his family, and his financial situation was worsening. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car, leaving the Ford owner overwhelmed, and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Miles' humorous nature makes him appear to lack etiquette and profession in the eyes of Ford, knowing that this is one of the biggest tasks that they have ever attempted, they are unsure if the British driver has what it takes. Ken is influenced by his family and the choices he makes are for them, despite saying his racing days were over, he found out how much he would be payed if he'd joined Ford and took part in Le Mans, knowing it would be enough to help the family cope financially. His son plays an underrated part in the film, Peter watches his Dad in every occasion, and shares a love for driving, aspiring to be like his Dad one day. Following the brakes-failure, witnessed by Peter, he fears for his Father, worried that the door may not open next time when a fire breaks out. Shelby saw something in Miles that not many saw, knowing his driving ability, he is convinced that Ken is the right man to take on Le Mans. Shelby is like Ken, an intelligent man who also shares an inclination to driving. His past experiences in driving and being made to retire early adds to his attitude, reasoning why he is very rarely happy, inferring he still wishes he was out on the track racing again. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 RPM, and he wins the race, jubilation for Shelby and Miles and a foolish-looking Beebe reports back the news to Henry Ford II. On the night before Le Mans, Miles shares a scene with Shelby on the track, Carroll seemed to be reminiscing on his victory not too long ago, Miles shows no signs of nerves, more excitement to show what he's capable of. If there's one person to coach and manage you throughout a 24 hour race, it's someone who has done it before, not only had Shelby raced Le Mans, but to win it, makes him the best man to coach the team. At the 1966 24 hours of Le Mans, Miles struggled during the first lap with a faulty door, but after team engineer Phil Remington fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferrari's. the fast-paced sequence of tiredly racing, Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini - whilst piloting Ferrari's new prototype 330 P3 - Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With the three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Ford cars to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Shelby reluctant to tell Miles, but commanded by Beebe, explains the situation to Ken, who is initially against the decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap, slowing down to allow the other two cars to catch up, as ordered by Beebe. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, because in the sprint start to the car, his car was further behind Miles', but, the British driver is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans, Shelby comforts Miles and with regret, states he shouldn't have told him (about Beebe's idea), the two walk away from the Ford celebration arms around each other. Le Mans 66 may not have been won by Ken Miles, but he certainly dominated it, breaking track record after track record and being the English man he is, stereotypically enjoying a cup of tea during pit stops. His mastery in race car driving was apparent throughout the famous French race, and rather than dwelling on the end result, he followed orders and did what Ford wanted, knowing that there is more important things in life, a smile didn't leave his face. The clips from Le Mans would go over and show Miles' son and wife listening in on the race with. When the family were informed by the race commentary that Ken had slowed down, Peter was confused and questions what his dad was doing, his mother smiled in pride, knowing that he had already won the race, and was doing what he had to do. Two months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside international Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure, with his son watching on, the feature heads into slow motion as Ken doesn't appear to exit the vehicle, he was killed in the resulting crash... ""Sometimes the door doesn't open"". Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and Peter a visit, and gives Peter a wrench that Miles through at him in an argument before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford continued its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Ken Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. The sports drama film portrayed the life of an ordinary race car driver, who was happy doing something he loved, despite a bust up with Shelby following his short release by Ford, it was great to see the pair reunite not only as workers, but as friends, and that friendship is exemplified in the emotion shown by Shelby thinking about his Ken latter his death. The film doesn't show Ford in a good light, rather pointing out its capitalist order and focusing on the Le Mans victory being all about the company, rather than the success of an individual. The photo attached shows the man who did what many thought he couldn't do, a racing legend."
FORD V FERRARI,20 June 2021,10/10,"A superb film. Bale and Damon are outstanding in the lead roles. There are far too many phonies in the world. Although they may be successful at the time, time catches up with them and history judges them more objectively -- and harshly. There is a lengthy article about Ken Miles in Wikipedia. There is no listing at all for Leo Beebe. I rest my case."
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,10/10,"Bale and Damon are great together. Bale's character was complex and he wore it like an old shoe.It was great to see Matt Damon in this serious role. He should be proud of this work.The rest of the cast were great. From Ford, to Iacocca. Well done.The focus was narrow enough to really capture the story.It reminds me of cinema past.Whether you are a car or car racing fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. It strikes a great balance for a wider audience.Well done."
FORD V FERRARI,6 July 2020,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari is anything but your typical racing movie. Not only is it full of adrenaline, but it's an inspiring story about friendship and partnership. By the end, the winner of Le Mans is less important that the relationships made along the way."
FORD V FERRARI,2 January 2021,6/10,"I came into this movie not knowing the history of Shelby's involvement with Ford regards to racing, and I found it to be an interesting story. I also found it to be full of Hollywood cliches' right down to the music that didn't surprise me at all, but it lowered my enjoyment of the movie. What really needs to be done is a documentary be produced about the relationship between Carrol Shelby and Ken Miles focusing on the development of the cars. The outcome of LeMans was a surprise and the fact that it was true was very interesting.Reading other reviews amused me when they said Bale's accent was awfulThe movie is watchable and would have gotten higher marks with just a little more creativity with the storyline. ."
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,7/10,A pretty solid car racing movie. No real weak parts though perhaps a tad long for such a film. Not in the same class as 'Rush' which had such good characters and story-line.A standout performance from Christian Bale. The backstory developments worked well.WHY are there two titles going around for this film! Most annoying.
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,9/10,"Well first off before i saw this movie i realized the following things, first off the movies i like are action and horror/slasher, so clearly after seeing the trailer i realized that it wasn't going to be that which is OK because i can actually watch anything if i feel like it so i gave it a chance especially since it got awards so i was saying it has to be good. Also i realized there are many good actors in this like Mat Damon, Christian Bale and more and that made me want to see it more, plus it was something different for a change and also its based on a true story which is OK in my book. Well now after watching it i realized that it was pretty long considering it was 2 and a half hours which is pretty long but in the end it was OK. So after seeing it i actually liked it, and a few hours later it started to grow on me and i liked it even more. At the beginning it starts off pretty confusing and i lot to take in and i lot to keep track of but at the last 30-45 minutes it gets real good and thats what makes me like it the most. The racing shots are well shot and also the settings are very cool and look awesome as well all some good shots. In a way i guess the movie did deserve the awards given but i feel like it was OK the was it was. The lesson is always try new things."
FORD V FERRARI,2 March 2021,10/10,"One among the list of special movies ever made, imo. One of the best of 2019. My favourite of 2019. Watched my fav scenes over and over again. But still can't get over it. It's amazing how well this movie is made. I mean, i can't point out a single mistake in it. Not even a single one. These are the kind of movies that maintains biographical movie's legacy.What an incredible performances by Christian & Matt. It's Indescribable. If this movie hadn't received at least one Academy Award, then there's no point of award giving. Because this movie is like one in a 1000. I don't know why Christian and Matt received a nomination rather than an award.I don't think there's none who didn't burst into tears after seen this movie. Brilliant direction. Spectacular visuals. Incredible performances. Uncontrollable emotions. My rating : 10/10"
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,7/10,"As a big Christian Bale fan, once more I cannot find words that describe this man's acting skills and the effort he puts in each role he performsBale is as always amazing, and clearly a snub for this year's Oscars as a nomination was absolutely deserved, taking Phoenix (Joker) out of the equation, this was by far the best performance of the yearWith that being said, this is the only reason I gave a somehow a good review score, that, and the friendship / chemistry with Matt Damon's character.
Their story is emotional and although I am not a fan of the theme, I've seen plenty movies that depict areas that are none of my interest, but they still deliverThis wasn't the case, it is suppose to convey the message of how corporations interfere with humanity, but you still gasp some BS nationalism and patriotism, which I have always found ridiculous, specially when it comes to big companiesThank you Bale for another delivery, hopefully I will be seeing you collaborating in the future with Nolan once again so that your acting matches his out of this world movies!"
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2020,8/10,"I knew nothing about the real history behind this story. I didn't even want to watch this film, but someone else asked me to go see it, and I'm definitely glad I did. Thoroughly fun from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,17 September 2020,10/10,"When 2.5 hours of a movie fly by and has left you wanting for more then its a true classic. This movie tells the thrilling true story of Ken Miles and Carroll Shelbys struggle to win Le Mans in 1966 for the Ford Motor Company.Ford v Ferrari it maybe but its all about Ken and Carroll.Excellent performances from Damon and Bale along with a great supporting cast make this a complete joy to experience.
Luscious sets and wonderful cgi bring the 1966 setting to life. The build up to the race is truly engaging and the race itself is edge of the seat stuff.
Le Mans 66 is unmissable and my film of the year.
Don't miss this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"Not just for Enzo Ferrari, but also for Henry Ford II, Shelby, the cars, the tracks, and especially, the star of the show, not-a-people-person Ken ""Bulldog"" Miles. I learn so many deep lessons from it. Like the race itself, every shot, every act, every background music was delivered with vision, ambition, courage, hope, and willingness to take and overcome any kind of risk and challenges on its path. Matt Damon delivers it, Christian Bale kills it (not the british accent tho, it's a little bit weird) and the ending..... the ending, !! it broke my heart, but what can I say other than reality (sometimes) sucks? Every movie fan would like it, every race car lover would love it, and there's me, who enjoy every second of two and a half hours of it, from title to the end credits."
FORD V FERRARI,3 May 2020,9/10,"The story and fiction of the movie is perfect. You watch the movie without getting bored for a moment. Especially sounds and music were used in their places. The successful placement of the cameras puts you in the race, as if you are in the race and you are racing. We could only want the end differently. It is a bit annoying but it should not be forgotten that it was adapted from a real story. My friend, who looks at the comments for wondering what the movie is like, don't waste any more time, open and watch the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,16 December 2019,8/10,"If you know car history, then the ending of this docudrama movie is never in doubt. Damon and Bales deliver excellent performances, but this is a car movie and the cars are the stars. For viewers of a certain age, seeing Shelby Cobras, Ford GTs, Ferraris, Corvette Stingrays, and other iconic racing cars (or their computerized recreations) from the 1960s chew up the tracks feels like putting on old, comfortable shoes. The cinematography and what has to be a ton of CGI (verified in the credits) plus the pounding, distorted, absolutely perfect guitar music really make this movie for me. I remember seeing the movie ""Gran Prix"" in the 1960s. It set the bar for car-racing movies. This movie attains the same level of gritty realism. The theme song for this movie is a gritty, instrumental version of ""Poke Salad Annie"" and it too is perfect for the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,7/10,"This should have been named MY DAD DROVE THE FORD GT40 or KEN & CARROLL - BROMANCE AT Le MANS. If you are a Ferrari fan, this film is not for you as there's not much Ferrari to be found here. Great performance as expected from Christian Bale, Matt Damon.......meh. I rank this film with Tucker: The Man and His Dream."
FORD V FERRARI,11 March 2020,10/10,"I watched this again for the second time on Amazon (first time in theater) and loved it. I'd say there are two scenes in particular that really stood out to me as meaningful and unexpected reactions See if you can figure out what they are, one included fighting and a lawn chair, another included a grown man crying. Highly recommend"
FORD V FERRARI,20 February 2020,9/10,I'm not a fan of Christian Bale but this movie was much better than I was expecting. It's a classic tale of wild free spirited independent thinkers vs Managerail Idiocy No wonder Detroit was wiped out by the Japanese in the 80's and after
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,10/10,"Based on a true story, ""Ford v. Ferrari"" is a highly entertaining thrill ride even if you, like me, are not a racing fan or auto aficionado. During the driving scenes at Daytona and Le Mans, I felt like I was in the car! While many action movies today rely heavily on CGI razzle dazzle and outrageous surrealism, this movie gives you action in a more realistic, gritty depiction. You feel how dangerous this sport is, particularly in the '60s. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give terrific, multidimensional performances as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, respectively. Great chemistry between them. They're flawed, realistic characters, passionate about their work and very likable. You root for them. Go see this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,8/10,"Ford V Ferrari is the type of movie that we just don't get anymore. It's thrilling, straightforward, and crowd pleasing. A lot of movies these days are so cynical, which is why its refreshing to see an old school, inspirational sports movie. This movie also has great performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Also, the racing scenes are absolutely fun to watch. I'm sad that I didn't watch this in IMAX."
FORD V FERRARI,5 March 2020,6/10,It's just another dramatic portrayal of an already interesting story. The movie is entertaining but you can get more out of reading Wikipedia. I sound cynical but there is more to film than this.
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"This was all round a really good movie, it was funny, emotional, exciting and interesting all at once. The characters felt real and managed to capture genuine human interactions and it all built to provide a very emotional ending.The sets were great and really gave you a feeling of being back in the 60's and there were some very interesting little tidbits thrown in showing how ww2 had left its scar on many people. It did this while maintaining a careful view of its priorities, it wasnt there to tell you what the 60's were but to use it as a backdrop for a real story.The acting was superb throughout, Damon really gave a strong performance and Bale really managed to convey well the good and bad character traits with real respect for the person he was representing. Also, although Caitriona Balfe was playing a supporting role I think her performance really needs to be called out. Caitriona managed to portray real strength and respect in a female character, she never went around screaming she was better than men, she instead portrayed real emotions, real reactions and genuine heart. I felt her supporting role was very well done too.Overall this felt like a movie which had some respect for its audiences intelligence and managed to really provide both genuine escapism and tell a very interesting and engaging story. Highly recommended viewing."
FORD V FERRARI,16 August 2020,9/10,"Great cinematic by James Mangold that is not just for motorsport fans. The convincing actors, the furious racing sequences and great sound effects make for an exciting and authentic film.

FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,10/10,"But boy am I glad I watched it. I did not give it a 10/10 out of impulse, this movies deserves an off the scale rating - 2:30 - not one minute was boring. Loved it!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,7/10,"""Ford v Ferrari"" isn't as much about the battle between the two mega-corporations in the title as much as it is about the fight between bureaucracy and action, calculations and instinct or faith and palpability. It involves internal struggles as much as external ones and carried superbly by its two leads, Matt Damon and Christian Bale--whose performance is Oscar-worthy--is one of the most likable, satisfying and entertaining movies of the year.The plot heads towards an epic culmination at the 1966 24-hour Le Mans race in France and it involves the years in which Ford created the now legendary GT40 to finally beat Ferrari who has been dominating the racing realm of motoring for years. It follows car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they deal with the technical ins and outs, corporate interference and media standards navigating their vagaries to get to success. The movie is as old-school macho as its central characters. Shelby was an American maverick, always dressing like the boss he is, always determined to get the job done, but he was understanding of the business side. Miles, on the other hand, is as complicated as he is a brilliant driver. His approach to the world is stripped of formality, his driving is his religion and people should be as real as he is otherwise they become fodder for his unfiltered words.James Mangold knew he was entering a world with high potential in entertainment when he approached this story. Whenever attempting to encompass American history, one tends to sensationalize through patriotism and venerate the people it contains. And indeed they are worthy of veneration. This plays out like standard Hollywood fare, the dream factory working its magic perfectly. But it's also very male-centric. Not only its characters look like they were made in a car factory, the women are also hysterical. A particular scene in which Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) has a nervous breakdown during an argument with Ken about him hiding his plan to work on the new GT40 is a bit exaggerated. As they are in their family car, she starts driving erratically and dangerously, the scene playing like an interrogation scene. ""I thought we loved this stuff!""--she yells until Ken spits everything out. Yet in the end, she is fine with it, she just wished he hadn't lied. Her worries are understandable and called for, but her over-the-top reaction Mangold decided upon is obsolete as representation for women--even if this was the 1960s.In the end, though, ""Ford v Ferrari"" finishes with just the right amount of satisfaction. While both characters are likable and Bale's performance rules, Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby is what really made me up this movie's grade. He is perfect as men who try to get the job done but also not upset anyone too much. His approach to Ford's CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) on why he should get a second chance after losing in 1965's Le Mans is as elegant as it is harsh and true. Even if ""Ford v Ferrari"" seems a bit outdated it is nonetheless a movie which really wants to be liked--not only by car people, but by everyone. Well, it succeeded."
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,7/10,"This was a good sports movie . I won't watch it again and I won't be recommending it out .I like the underdog story , the relationship of miles to his family as well as miles to Shelby . I was captivated most of the movie , found it visually appealing . The story itself is Inherently interesting and I learned quite a bit on a topic I knew very little about .I didn't feel deeply based on the cinematic elements .. I didn't leave with any specific moment or quote that I can take home and say "" that applies to me "" no fantastic scenes .. good acting but nothing mind blowing . I found it to be entertaining . The acting was good. I left without inspiration to do or change anything specific .it was too long with too many driving scens.Overall I would say to watch but it didn't deserve a picture of the year nomination. It's a quality picture but will lot change your life :)"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"ZERO woke. Just pure beautiful entertainment.Not even a racing fan, but I am a movie fan, and I've never seen such incredible racing scenes.Highly recommend seeing it in IMAX/Dolby. Hits you like a ton of bricks.So freakin good! 😭👍👍👍👍"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"Here's my review of Ford v Ferrari . So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,7/10,"James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari' is a fun two-and-a-half hour ride down memory lane, circling the lives of legendary race car driver Ken Miles and equally esteemed car designer Carroll Shelby.The film gets off to an uninspiring start, introducing the main characters using quick-hitting scenes that turn each into an eye-rolling archetype. Shelby is the inspired engineer. Miles is the irascible wildcard. Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry ... and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.The second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging. Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts. Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful ""shaky camera effect"" that some filmmakers would've used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.Given that the '24 Hours of Le Mans' race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"I went to see this film thinking that having Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sure not to disappoint - and I am glad to say I was right. I also wanted to see the legendary story of Ford vs Ferrari, as it happened, on the big screen and got more than I hoped for.
The drama, characters, excellent music, and everything else that makes for a great film can be found here. I loved boh the performances of ALL actors as well as the life-like race cars and how they are driven and how they behave in different situations. If you are not a racing fan, there will be plenty to enjoy, but knowing a thing or two about cars, gearboxes and RPMs helps.
The only thing that I didn't care for were few minor historically innacurrate details, which were added for entertainment value, I imagine. One, here or there, I could live with, but when they are piled up, and don't help the story, they should be left out.
Other than those minor complaints, which is why I give it 9 instead of 10 stars, the film is as close to perfect as one can get."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,8/10,"Kick it into 7000 rpm and enjoy a brief ride through history when considering watching this solid film, Ford Versus Ferrari. The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.As failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.Put two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap."
FORD V FERRARI,20 April 2020,8/10,"It 's not a god, but it 's a movie I love so much emotionally. The Ken Miles shaped by Bell is such a perfect character, is a master of thoughts, and the loss of the world will not pollute him. He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone."

24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs. Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes acting was good.
Mollie miles - caitronia balfe

Charlie agapiou - jack McMullenClimax - You promised me the drive. Not the win.""
Bale is the real focus here and he should be with his amazing believable performance but Damon also does a pretty convincing job as the friend and his knowledge of cars along with Bale's love for them.Now, let's talk about cinematography. The movie gives absolutely stunning experience with it's sound effects and visuals. The movie though was shot under expert guidance, feels more legit.Overall, THIS IS A MUST SEE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 April 2021,8/10,"Some wonderful performances from the exceptional Christian Bale and Matt Damon lifted this satisfactory script really up. Their friendship looks absolutely real and chemistry intense. Based on the real story of Ford motor company's pursuit of establishing its name in the racing world, this movie covered the nuances of corporate world and glamour of the racing world quite sublimely.There aren't much dialogues in the movie but they're good(one of them is so good that it's repeated twice in the film)- as you can expect with a racing movie, quite a lot of screentime is consumed by racing cars. And no one could have played such a role(of Ken Miles) better than Christian Bale. His expressions makes up for the lesser dialogues and makes you feel connected with the character at all times.The brilliant cinematography and scores just adds up to the performances and makes it a beautiful and emotional watch!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2021,8/10,"A slickly made and dynamically shot movie. Christian Bale and Matt Damn give excellent performances, conveying their character's need for speed and playing off one another well. The racing photography is fantastic, putting you right there on the track among some gorgeous cars and the period setting of 1966 is captured beautifully.There are elements of the classic underdog story here but the real-life events being portrayed are more poignant and realistic, elevating the film's quality immensely.I found myself thoroughly entertained throughout, and as someone who isn't overly interested in cars or racing, I'd say that's a big thumbs up!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 March 2020,7/10,"The movie is good and I enjoyed, but I feel that if it wasn't for this great cast the people wouldn't care about it that much and it was them alongside with the great production that capitalized it, not the story itself. Still a great movie with cool scenes and a good
overall picture"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"This is not just the usually sportcar movie. It's about do what you most passionate with in life and in this case it's about Cars.
This film has a message, don't let the more powerful people let you down and do what you heart beats for!"
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,10/10,"I was expecting a good movie about cars and races... and yes it was that but.... it was much more, this movie reminds me Rush ( i really loved this one) with a better scenario, a better acting, some great racing sequence, and a lot of emotions, i was so high that i couldn't believe that this movie was a 2 and half hours, we need more of this movies where humans and relationship between son and dad, boss and workers, friends.... are more important than the CGI! Damon and Bale are on another level that deserves some oscar nominations at least, for sure this is one of my favorite 2019 movies!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Top notch performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. This movie is very entertaining from beginning to end. Lets be real Christian Bale stole the show and has become one of my favorite actors. Don't miss out watching this in the theatre, you won't be disappointed."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,Incredible well made. Beautifully shot and and surprisingly emotional. Loved every second of it. Hope it does well in the awards season.
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,9/10,"Ford V Ferrari is an excellent biopic movie into the lives of Ken miles and Carroll Shelby. The film is able to beautifully weave their tales without showing anything unnecessary to us and making us truly care for their characters and their race to beat Ferrari. Both Chrisitian Bale & Matt Damon give excellent performances that bring their characters to life. The racing scenes as well are understandably very good giving alot of tension and action to the movie. This is truly a movie to watch and trust me on this, even if you are not a big car fan (like me), you will still enjoy this. I guarantee it."
FORD V FERRARI,15 September 2020,9/10,"I was entertained from start to finish.
A very entertaining and interesting story, wether you're a racing fan or not. And the acting is top notch. Matt Damon is as good as ever but Christian Bale is just in a league of his own. The rest of the cast does very well to."
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,8/10,"Shellby is leading the Le Mans where he is focused, determined and one could easily hear his heartbeat and hot breath in a fading raving engine sound mastered by a genius sound editing. The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era. The tragedy of Miles losing his life was not the awful end to such a great picture but how weak dialogue and script diluted an already bubbling 120mins of great acting and powerful zoom-ins."
FORD V FERRARI,24 December 2020,10/10,"This is absolutely a great film. I'll leave it to others to dig into the details.This is top tier for (1) story; (2) character development; (3) acting; (4) technical presentation; and (5) immersion in the total experience.I couldn't stop watching. Love this film. It really stands out.One last comment. This film, secondarily, teaches a lot about the American auto business --- and what's wrong with it: How Ford could have been a real standout, long-term winner --- but literally chose not to be (in the long run). The story depicted represented a real win and technical advance for Ford, as a global automaker, but also reveals why Ford couldn't stay at it and keep winning into the future, whereas Ferrari could come back and carry on.It's a lesson in business that Tom Peters wouldn't be ashamed to teach, in brief: ""Don't do what Ford did --- except for one brief shining moment (when Ford broke its own rules and succeeded against all odds)!"""
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is terrific. An old-fashioned movie but in a good way. A crowd pleaser. This is exactly the film movie studios don't make anymore. The race car scenes are authentic and exhilarating. The acting by Damon and Bale is spectacular and the friendship that grows between the two characters throughout the movie, going from competitors to friends, is enjoyable to watch. Movies like this are being released in theatres less and less so it's nice to see a drama aimed at adults in a movie theatre."
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2020,9/10,"The Ford Motor Company is said to be masters in taking up challenges. In its giant plant, Willow Plant with its one-mile-long assembling line, the company managed to produce B-24 Liberator bombers at the rate of one plane per hour. This was their contribution to the World War 2 efforts to liberate the American soil and their European cousins from tyranny. The company established a reputation for themselves as ""the arsenal of democracy"" by transforming their production lines to make aeroplanes, tanks and trucks for the armies that defeated Adolf Hitler. They were a pioneer of sorts as women worked in the assembly line and were paid equal wages with men. It, wittingly or unwittingly, to also become ""the arsenal of fascism."" for its substantial business deals in Nazi Germany. But that is another story for another time.By the end of WW2, Henry Ford's grandson, Henry Ford II had taken over Ford Motors. He adopted an aggressive business style. When his bid to buy over Ferrari met a dead end, he went ballistic. He made his personal mission to show his dominance in the motor industry.In the early sixties, Ferrari was overrunning the racing tracks. For six years, back to back, from 1960 to 1965, it won the Le Mans 24 hours endurance race.Ford II, through his agents, went on a headhunt to recruit the best racers to beat Ferrari in Le Mans and show them who the boss was. That is where this film fits in. It narrates the story of two American racers - Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby- in a dramatic twist which saw Ford Motor Company finish the Le Man Race in a podium finish.
This film is not just a run-of-mill offering that depicts the expected David vs Goliath scenario where David comes out tops despite all the disadvantages, and everybody is happy. It offers much more than that. The characters are rich. The chemistry between Miles, a war veteran British émigré who is a lowly mechanic because of his short fuse, and Shelby, a sports car salesman who himself was a race winner, is phenomenal.What makes it more interesting is the controversy surrounding the final outcome of the race and the mystery surrounding Miles' crash during practice at the end of the film.They say jealousy and greed are unfavourable traits. Clearly, this is not always the case. Many innovative inventions and groundbreaking feats have been achieved through our rapacious desire to dominate and tower over our fellow brothers."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,6/10,"If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2021,9/10,"I put off watching this as I thought it would be all about cars, racing and so on. The write up really paints this as more of a docudrama, not my cup of tea. But finding myself at a loose end, gave it a go. And I was really surprised. It is a fascinating story that has car racing as a backdrop. I would not be surprised if a lot of people have given this a miss because it looks to be all about cars. If you like a decent drama about strong characters then give it a go."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"This was a good story well-executed. The casting choice of Lee Iacocca was strange to me, but acted well. Finally, finally, a viscerally good balanced story."
FORD V FERRARI,11 December 2019,9/10,"The Ford vs. Ferrari story is amazingly accurate for a Hollywood made movie. Like many others, I ran to Wikipedia to look up Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. Miles was a great car racer but not well known outside of car racing circles.The movie lovingly recreates that era and throws in a first rate cast headlined by Damon and Bales, but the rest of the characters ring true. The race car scenes which grab you by the throat are realistic as hell and heart pounding. The scenes showing the introduction of the new Ford Mustang, I remember very well. There were huge crowds at the Ford dealers and the demand for the cars was tremendous. Car racing back in the 1960's was a deadly dangerous sport with very few of the safety features incorporated in today's race cars. The Ford GT 40 really was fast and could hit 220 mph on the straightaways which is what today's Indy cars do, just for comparison. Matt Damon does a great job as Carroll Shelby, but minimizes the way Shelby cut corners in how he sold his cars, and he was slapped on the wrist a few times for his car selling practices. This is one of the few movies today that I would actually buy. It is such a great story and just listening to the sounds those cars made is worth the price. There isn't much not to like in this movie and it is a good antidote to the real world we are living in today if only for a few hours. I loved this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,8/10,"I was around cars as a child because of my dad and grandfather. I never took an interest in them though. I feel like this is the type of movie that could inspire an entire new generation of youngsters that want to race for a living.Christian Bale is excellent! Matt Damon is excellent! The sound design and editing sticks out to me on this movie and it's almost sure to win Oscars because of that. The cinematography does a great job of immersing you in the races and making your heart race! It'll be interesting to see what other films step up to compete in cinematography. If none show up, this will likely take that category too(Although I hope Parasite takes it).The script is good but I did find myself a little bored during parts of the character development scenes. Christian Bale is always Christian Bale but I do think Matt Damon was the stronger character here. I love Bale's movies and I'll always see them but Christian Bale reminded me of how he is for his role in The Fighter so in Oscar respects it's kind of an already been there done that kind of thing.This movie brings up competition for me. While it seemed to be heavy back then, I'm curious how much of a cut-throat competition it is nowadays.While this story favors America, I do think when it comes to industrial things or car-related things... American ingenuity is going to win out every time when it matters."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Rating 10/10
Inspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the ""background music"". Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!"
FORD V FERRARI,10 March 2020,6/10,"Christian Bale continues to prove that he is one of the best actors of this era, and this film is another example of it. Damon is good, but Bale carries this film much like his character carries his racing team. The story is very interesting, maybe better titled ""Shelby v. Ford"" rather than ""Ford v. Ferrari"" but a story worth hearing about, especially if you are not familiar with it already. It definitely consists of some run of the mill and cliche sport biopic moments and themes but it is worth checking out for the performances, direction and if you're into sports, cars and races.Mitchell Bulfin"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,Pure entertainment. Storytelling at its best. Not one political agenda addressed. Not one sjw box checked. A masterclass in entertainment designed for those who watch movies to be entertained. Masterpiece. Satisfying until the credits roll at the end. Do not miss this amazing movie
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,1/10,"If a movie gets that kind of budget and actors, you get punished with a score of one.
This movie only made it passed the 20 minute limit 'cause I was thinking about what to watch next.
I was immediately irritated by Bale's performance, and Matt Damon's character looked flat, boring, just doing his lines while trying constantly to put on his American charming smile. 5 minutes later I was done with this movie. Too many reviews promise a thrilling experience from beginning to end, don't go in with that expectation, and maybe you'll make it to the final lap."
FORD V FERRARI,9 April 2020,9/10,This movie is so energy- filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant per formance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is about the egos of two business tycoons Henry Ford the second and Enzo Ferrari. Still it's less about these two and more about Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. This film is a perfect tribute to both of them and their contribution to the sport of racing.
What's good:
1. The screenplay is great and so is the direction. There are many great scenes and the director Jamed Mangold is able to make us feel exactly how he wanted to.
2. The performances by all the actors are great. Christian Bale gets the most heroic part of Ken Miles and he shines throughout the movie. Matt Damon's part is less heroic but he also does a good job. Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas and other actors have also done a good job according to their small roles.
3. The second half of the film is highly entertaining.
What's bad:
1. It is an underdog story and has certain predictable scenes that many underdog stories have.
2. There is only one female character Caitriona Balfe and her role is pretty small although she gets one good scene.
Christian Bale fans will love it and others will like it."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,10/10,"Text: It has adrenaline from start to end with touches of drama. Excellent tempo. Very good script and direction. Very convincing performances. It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times."

FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"Watching cars race around a track hasn't meant much to me since I grew out of scalextric, but this film's trailer brought some of those memories back and I jumped at a chance to see it. Fortunately this movie is so much more than cars racing around a track, as central as that is to the whole story. Bale and Damon are terrific. The whole cast were great actually. The story is gripping. The cinematography is awesome. The tale is bitter sweet. Just like any good dish should be. You don't have to be a petrol head to enjoy it, but if you are, there's very few car movies as good as this one. I never thought I'd see the day I'd be cheering for a Ford win, but this film took me there. Imagine a modern day take on 'Grand Prix' with James Garner but with Le Mans, not f1. And Ford not Honda. It's a winner for me."
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,9/10,"I'm going to be posting the rest of my reviews for 2019 here now that the Academy Award nominations are upon us.Starting off with surprise best picture contender ""Ford v Ferrari""; this is a fascinating and entertaining examination of the real life rivalry between both companies, without resorting to simplicity or being too vague for non-automobile enthusiasts.Christian Bale, in all his British glory, knocked it out of the park as the firey Ford racer Ken Miles, and Matt Damon gives one of his finest recent performances as his sidekick Carroll Shelby. The rest of the cast are also great to see.If you haven't already seen it, definitely race out as soon as it's available to you and check it out.
Grade- A"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"In a time where very few good movies come to us, this is a gem. This is a throwback movie if your looking for a movie tainted by nonsense this ain't it. Bale should win an oscar for this performance. Ck it out its probably the best overall movie this year."
FORD V FERRARI,15 July 2021,10/10,"It's just insanely best.My Best watch of the month.Best screenplay
Best plot
And perfect cast.Rivalry between Ford and Ferrari put perfectly.The last 40 minutes of thrill, i just can't forget it."
FORD V FERRARI,17 January 2021,9/10,"What a great movie this is! I'm not familiar with the real story, but according to the reviews here, it's a pretty good depiction of what really happened.The casting is great. Damon as Shelby and Bale as the excentric Miles are fantastic and so is the depiction of their friendship. Jon Bernthal is great as the sneaky manager and the rest is also very good. The script is very well written and the whole atmosphere of the movie is coloured with romance. Miles' family scenes really add to the warm feeling of the movie. The support of his wife, his love for her and his son... I love it.I wasn't familiair with the tragic ending and it really got to me. Unexpectedly ofcourse.
You don't have to be a car or race enthousiastic to enjoy this great story."
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2020,10/10,"Cinema. Great cinema. Where to start? I guess, the starting line... the production aspect, top top top shelf. Stepping into every shot. Feeling the feel of the late 50s and 60s. The feel. Great start. Script, writing, story.. terrific. Performances. Stellar. So excellent when the director, direction, turns the actor loose. Everyone presents top shelf performances. Damon and Bale, great. The players, Caitriona Balfe and Christian Bale, would like to have seen more there. Who steals every scene though is Noah Jupe as Peter Miles. It is simply a great 2+ hours of cinema. One of the few times am compelled to rewatch the film."
FORD V FERRARI,12 July 2021,10/10,"Ken Miles performed a perfect lap and Ford v. Ferrari couldn't be a more perfect movie. It's just so perfect in every single way. There is no other way to describe it, Ford v. Ferrari is perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,"Acting on point, movie never gets boring. I liked the race scenes. And the ending is so sad. Very rarely I get emotional watching a movie, but this one got me.nothing too crazy tho, so 8/10 fair maybe 8.5"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.It's been a while since I've been to a night showing of a film. In picking this evening time and this film, it was both pleasing and irritating to be in a nearly full theater. The fun part is that I often see films where there are less than 15 people in the theater, and seeing an almost full theater gave me hope that others will continue to support going to movie theaters.The irritation part is the noise that people make during the film presentation. Why someone thinks their remembrances of the period, or what they think about what their seeing on the screen is essential to spout out while the film is playing, is beyond me. The gentleman sitting next to me turned around just as I did the same thing and together we asked them to be quiet. It took us doing this twice for them to get that they weren't at home watching cable TV.
Despite the noise interruptions, this film unfolded in a fun way. Remembrances of the 1960s abounded with cars from the era on the streets. Yes, they were perfectly restored vehicles, but it was easy to gloss over the prettiness to enjoy the beauty of those old cars reflecting their time and place in my life. There were Shelby Cobras, Porsches, Ford Falcons, Mini, woody (fake wood) wagons, Ferraris, and Ford GT 40s.The film is about how Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) turned down Henry Ford II's (Tracy Letts) offer to buy 90% of Ferrari's car production company. In turning down Ford's offer and partnering with Fiat, Enzo made unflattering remarks about Ford and his cars to the Ford negotiation team. Angered by the personal comments, Ford vowed to beat perennial 24 Hours Le Mans race winner, Ferrari.Chief Ford negotiator, Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), was then tasked with finding a car builder who will build a Ford-based car to beat Ferrari. Finding Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), the one-time winning driver of the 24 Le Mans, to make the car, Ford believes they found their man. Henry Ford gives Shelby carte blanche to build this car.Shelby, in turn, hires his friend and race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to be his test driver and co-builder. The main reason is that he can trust Miles as he knows cars and feels their abilities and problems as he drives them. Miles is also creative when figuring out how to make cars work better. The downside of Miles is that he's a maverick in his thinking and hates to conform to rules and being told what to do.Miles is married Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), who's amused by her husband's friendship with Shelby. There are couple scenes that this loving amusement shows up. One thing the film makes clear is that Ken is a loving devoted father who loved showing his son Peter (Noah Jupe) the ins and outs of racing.The film spends time showing Miles and Shelby developing the GT40 to race in Le Mans, but when it comes time to ship the car off to the race, Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) Senior VP at Ford, chooses another driver to drive the vehicle at the Le Mans race.Shelby is pissed, Miles is severely disappointed, and of course, the new driver doesn't feel the car like Miles would have and ends up blowing it apart during the race.Ford wants to fire Shelby for the failure, but the meeting between Ford and Shelby is fantastic because Shelby convinces Ford that he, Ford, has Ferrari where he wants him, scared. Scared because Shelby's car, with another driver, was faster than the Ferrari, especially on the straightaway at Le Mans. This was a great scene. It's reflecting Shelby's legendary ability to sell anyone on anything.Ford tells Shelby to fix the car and get it ready for the next Le Mans and that Shelby has control over the driver.The rest of the movie shows how they develop a stronger, lighter, faster GT40 car. But when Beebe intercedes again about Miles being the driver at Le Mans, Shelby takes Ford out in the GT40 and scares the crap out of him, literally.
Then at that moment negotiates with Ford to let Miles drive. As part of the deal he offers Ford his Shelby American company if Miles races and loses.It's scenes like this that are fun to watch and reminded me of the time that a friend of a friend, gave me a ride in a Lamborghini Miura, and scared the crap out of me while racing around a sizeable empty factory parking lot at a very high speed.There were sections of this 152-minute film that could have been trimmed, but I was engaged enough to not care about the lulls of uninteresting or engaging material. Other characters added to this story and made better. One such person was Chief Mechanic Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon). His ideas about creating a way to change the brake assembly were brilliant.Bale was intensely and independently outstanding in this role as race car driver Ken Miles. His ability to show tenderness and love towards his family and aggressively focused on making the car faster was terrific. Damon was wonderful as Carroll Shelby. The scene with Ford after the first loss and his fight with Miles in front of Mile's home reflected the off-told stories about the legend of Carroll Shelby. Bernthal was good as the famed Iacocca. Balfe was convincing as Ken's wife. Her support and understanding of her husband were excellently portrayed. My favorite scene shows Balfe driving Ken home while pressing him on his whereabouts. Her focused intensity was sublime. Letts was priceless as Ford II. The bullying ways he used around his staff and factory followed by his being humbled by the spin in the GT40 were terrific. McKinnon was excellent as devoted Chief Mechanic for Shelby. Beebe was appropriately arrogant, self-serving, and sharp as a foil to Shelby's vision. Girone was satisfyingly perfect as Enzo Ferrari. Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote an expansive script that could have been shortened and made crisper. However, there are some outstanding scenes in the film. James Mangold directed this film. To his credit, racing scenes can get old quick, but the excellent editing and cinematography made these scenes come alive.Overall: I liked seeing this film for multiple reasons, including that the subsequent Ford built Shelby Mustang GT-350 and GT-500 had parts made by my father's company in the late 1960s."
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2021,8/10,"In 1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca proposes to Henry Ford II to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motor and Henry Ford II. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic, and Shelby's best friend.Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Thinking that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph (350.8 km/h), on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car has brake fade during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the 7,000 RPM tachometer redline and he wins the race.At the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer Phil Remington fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini - piloting Ferrari's new prototype 330 P3 - Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.Two months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963.Ford continued its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001.
My Rating: 8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,19 July 2020,9/10,"Ford vs. Ferrari - 2019Here comes a masterpiece that will not allow you to check the time in your watch while watching it. It will take you to the journey and for sure you want to be a part of it. Talking about Ford vs. Ferrari in the title is just a glance of the story behind love, friendship, dedication, and hard work behind the creation of Ford car to beat the Ferrari racing teamThe story is a journey of people behind making of the most powerful car by the Ford after their proposal gets rejected by the Ferrari who was winning the race from the past 4 consecutive years. The film is not just about cars and races, but mainly focuses on Human connections to make the event Big, what it takes to be the best and still be on earth. Human connection is very powerfully depicted in the film with the help of great grand acting by each and every actor present in the movie. Director is able to mix and match the emotions as Few scenes can easily fill your heart and fully capable to give you a happy crying experienceThe film is technically very strong if we talk about cinematography, editing, and sound design. The amazing camera movements which are for sure not at all easy shooting the running cars and creating beautiful scenes on roads, racing tracks and airport as well. Editing makes you feel like you are totally into the story and living in it, amazing work on racing scenes and VFX. Background sound is the reason you feel the movie into your heart.Ford vs. Ferrari is a must watch which gives you emotionally strong experience and makes you believe in yourself by experiencing the scene where 3 ford cars cross the winning line together and the emotions behind and dialogues like ""money can't buy you the win, but ....."""
FORD V FERRARI,6 November 2019,9/10,"Great story and great acting, bit unsure about Christian bale's accent but that aside was good, although it was quite a long film it didnt drag, the dialogue was solid the action sequences great and you felt like you were there with them"
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari was an experience..this is what cinema, true cinema, is, wonderment, excitement, laughter, emotion, and just that ""How in the hell did they make that?"" question in your mind. This movie is spell-binding, heart-pounding, mesmerizing, pulsing with energy, and I was unable to even look at my phone for more than 2 seconds. The actors were phenomenonal, Bale, as always, a force of nature, the man can do no wrong. But Matt Damon, and Jon Bernthal were amazing too, and the incredibly well written dialogue, especially the chemistry and relationship between Bale and Damon, is both hilarious, beautiful, and real. The cinematography, soundtrack, unbelievable sound design, flawless direction all merge together and create truly incredible scenes..you feel the car vibrating, changing gear, speeding, braking, it's glorious. But then there's the ending, which, I guess, was too sad for me, even though it was still real, and emotional, and all that, I needed a happy ending. Still, this is one of the finest movies of the year, and pretty much a masterpiece, so I will rate Ford V Ferrari a 9.5/10"
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2019,8/10,"Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2021,9/10,"First, I am a HUGE car guy and am well aware of the history of the GT40 and the importance that car made on the world of racing. I was young, but lived during the time of this film's story and every single aspect of it was spot on. Wonderful acting, script, action, and the realism of the racing scenes made the hair on my arm stand up.Even if you aren't a car person, it is a great story that most all would appreciate. Highly recommend this film."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"Released in the U.K. and other markets under the far better title, Le Mans '66, Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating biopic telling of Ford's attempts to challenge and outdo the beloved cars of genius Enzo Ferrari in the world famous French 24 hour motor marathon.Seeking the prestige of the Ferrari badge, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), is humiliatingly rebuffed in his attempt to buy a controlling interest in the Italian motor manufacturer. In a fit of pique, he orders his executives to create a car that can turn the tables on Ferrari. Retired racing car driver now designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), is engaged by Ford executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to do just that. Shelby in turn recruits the cantankerously bloody-minded British racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to put his foot to the floor and hopefully secure the chequered flag. The project is to be overseen by Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).The film is centred on the dynamic between Shelby and Miles, their awkward relationship and history of confrontation ameliorating as they are both driven, no pun intended, to achieve victory. Their efforts are constantly frustrated by the unhelpful and self-serving Leo Beebe following his own agenda.Direction from James Mangold (Walk the Line) and cinematography from Phedon Papamichael are both first rate. The racing scenes are truly immersive and you smell the octane. Screenplay from the British pair Jez and John-Henry Butterworth with American Jason Keller, never gets bogged down in technical detail, it simply allows the story to flow, a story so engaging that the running time of two and a half hours never flags; it's not just for petrol heads. And it says much of Matt Damon's progression as a film actor that he easily holds his own in his many scenes with Christian Bale. Irish actor Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife Mollie provides a strong foil to her husband's headstrong ways.Is the film slightly formulaic with stock characters? Maybe so, perhaps. Henry Ford II is shown as a bombastic bully, Leo Beebe an unctuous Uriah Heep-style sycophant. But when all other aspects of a film come together, who cares? Besides, most people love pantomime villains. And whether unwittingly or not, the film shows that maverick genius needs the boring business acumen and the politics inevitably attached to succeed. Both Shelby and particularly Miles are shown as pretty hopeless in their business dealings, neither would've got a car anywhere near Le Mans without the bean counters from Ford. The film is also mercifully free of modern day political analogies, concentrating instead on telling its tale without distraction.I have a feeling this film will become a perennial public holiday favourite.4.5*"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,6/10,"I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,"Both leads are just amazing. First half is bit slow but the second half is great. I'll definitely tell others to watch it. Go for it. Lovely Biographical movie. Bale and Damon both are just perfect in the role. After Rush (2013) i find this movie great. Nicely written and directed. Loved the way of screenplay. Short review because reviews can't explain the movie or the direction/good or bad part of the movie. It's just about the taste of what you like. (sorry for bad English) - itsbymayank

FORD V FERRARI,23 April 2021,10/10,"Some stories are so compelling, I'm left speechless. This is one of those films. Not because I am a car buff. I live in Silicon Valley, drive a hybrid and take Public Transportation when possible. But not due to a self conscious image of who I want to be. I think if someone believes in something enough, they will do what needs to done to achieve that goal. Even the impossible.Ken is a mechanic that knows the logistics of the motor and how to win a race mostly because he is willing to bend the rules. An odd ball genius. He is introduced in this film as someone who will beat his hood with a wrench to make the engine fit. He is someone who sees through the conventional wisdom and sets his eyes to the limits to push boundaries. Someone willing to do anything to win. A high risk in the eyes of Ford Motors corporate suits.""If this was a beauty pageant, we just lost.""Looks aren't everything. But at a time America began setting the standard in the free world, there was an emphasis placed on ethics and presentation. The staple for American conservatism and the veneer for the American hypocrisy, which was always validated by high earnings. Due to the assembly line, American manufacturing has always fared well in earnings from mass production. But what if we reduce the number to one. One car. One day. One race where even One loose bolt can close your One Chance at winning. With the One driver who can win, what is the One obstacle that can get in the way. Themselves.The man who has stretched boundaries, maybe even the laws of physics to win every race, will be asked to reach one more time in the most important one.I can't say enough about this film. The acting is spot on. The director places sporadic dry humor alongside tense moments. Absolute Winner."
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2020,10/10,"James Mangold happens to be one of my favourite directors, and not just because of what he was able to do with the Wolverine franchise. I love his ability to infuse a sense of heart into every frame. It helps that he's working with great actors and manages to coax their best performances out of them.Granted, Christian Bale's accent is all over the North of England, but ultimately it doesn't matter, because you believe him as this passionate and difficult race car driver. This is also one of Matt Damon's best performances. It's easy to see why this was nominated in 2019 for best picture because it's both crowd-pleasing and a rock-solid piece of filmmaking.The supporting cast shouldn't be discounted either. Tracy Letts, once again, turns in a stellar performance, and Jon Bernthal plays against type as Lee Iacocca and it pays off.Some may dismiss it as a ""dad"" film, but for me, it's the finest ""dad"" film in awhile."
FORD V FERRARI,13 February 2020,10/10,"It's certainly filled with some of the fastest in Motorsports. RIP Ken Miles, Dale Earnhardt, Gilles Villeneuve, Dan Weldon, Ayrton Senna, Greg Moore and the Great Caroll Shelby...This was a Great Movie.. and if you're a fan of Racing.. it's Perfect"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari was really a great movie. Just solid on all levels. Great script, acting, and story was told in a really great way. The driving sequences were really exciting and felt like we were there on the race track. Enjoyed this one alot!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,8/10,"Ok well... I found a fair bit of the script (especially in early scenes) way too expositional. Some characters rather one dimensional (e.g. Leo Beebe).
It doesn't help that Josh Lucas has the kind of eyes/looks that are too distracting, he should just be a model! Central casting was clearly in the hands of someone with a 'type', which meant the players sometimes looked like an Annie Leibowitz Vanity Fair centre spread of the fashion worlds glitterati.
The director seemed to want to include the 'Englishness' theme (properly recognising the British influence on racing at this period and elsewhere) a little too much, so Miles and Mrs Miles sometimes seemed to be trotting out shorthand for the same.
I know Bale was (is?) English, but his choice of regional accent (though it may have been factually correct, I don't know) jarred a little for me.
All that said, I did think Bale (who I don't ever really 'like' due to an inherent lack of warmth) was very good (as he usually is) and well cast; Damon was superb (AA nominee superb) in a more complex and nuanced role. Likewise Tracey Letts playing Ford, whom I know from the excellent 'Divorce'.
One thing that I never understood was that despite the film suggesting Ford was coming from a standing start, suddenly with no explanation a car arrives from England which is clearly the core of what became the GT40....what?!
I loved the style and the pace, the colour and the cinematography etc, and I thought the race scenes and the general race milieu were brilliantly depicted. I have seen The Times (London) critics dismissing the film as old fashioned etc, and as I say it has some clunky dialogue and characters get tells, but if it is old fashioned in any way, it is that it tells a story about people and their complexity and what it takes to deliver the extraordinary, rather than reiterate some fear based drivel about how the world will be saved by a morally ambiguous superhero in Lycra. So thank God for that.
Rather like many a good race, it had a bumpy start but got better and better and by the end I was gripped, standing on my feet and cheering (metaphorically). See it on the big screen and enjoy the race atmosphere."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,8/10,"Enthusiasm for this movie will no doubt vary according to your interest in motor racing and the cars and drivers that make it. If, like myself, the sound of a 4.7 litre V8 on full song is akin to Beethoven's 5th, you will not be disappointed. Otherwise there is still much to be enjoyed here.The story revolves around Ford Motor Company's ambition in the 1960s to build a legendary racing car (the GT 40) capable of beating the venerable Ferrari team in Europe at the Le Mans 24-hour race. Loosely based on the real events, the thrills of speed, brilliantly portrayed in some superb racing footage, are complemented by the human drama as the racing team struggle with the monstrous Henry Ford 2 (superbly played by Tracy Letts) and his cronies and their own personal relationships. Matt Damon and Christian Bale make a great contrasting pair as all-American racing maestro, Carol Shelby, and cantankerous British racing ace and master engineer, Ken Miles, with tremendous performances from both. The strains of top-flight motor racing are excellently depicted via Miles' relationship with his supportive wife, Mollie (Catriona Balfe) and adoring son, Peter (beautifully played by Noah Jupe).Everything proceeds at a cracking pace and, unlike some car movies, the visuals are not overburdened with flash-and-crash CGI intrusions. A few cliched moments do not detract too much from the excitement and, at times, poignancy, of this highly enjoyable film. Vroom-vroom ....!(Viewed at Screen 3, Odeon, Warrington UK, 30 November 2019)"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,1/10,"Picked this up at the Redbox because it has such great reviews. Good cast. It's OK for some, but I was bored. to. death. I really should have known better.It's just car racing like the trailer trash flocking in the red hot sun at NASCAR, hoping to see a flaming horrific accident. '
Meh!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,10/10,I should have seen this on theatre I will regret Everytime
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,10/10,"At one point during the movie I looked at Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and wondered how he, with his bad heart, doesn't drop dead watching those races, especially one where so much is at stake. Because I was watching it on the screen and my heart was pounding like crazy. And here is the weirdest thing - I have exactly zero interest in car racing. Yet when I nearly stopped watching, it wasn't because I was bored nor because there was something wrong with the film, it was because it was so intense, I was getting too stressed out. I knew absolutely nothing about the real life story. I do wonder how I would have reacted if I did. But as it were I was not only completely engrossed the entire time, even looking back I couldn't find a single flaw. And believe me, I tried. It's like that race car they built - no frills, but the power to do precisely what it takes to succeed."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2020,9/10,"Ford V. Ferrari is an epic and thrilling true story that captivates the viewer from the beginning with great performances by Damon & Bale, great racing sequences, stellar editing and shot composition, and some well placed humor, making it nearly Impossible to not love."
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,10/10,The last time I saw a movie about a Racing circuit that was this much fun was Grand Prix. And this one is muck better. Loved the accuracy of the Ford Group's arrogance. The loss of miles was tough when it happened. Thankful this movie did not exploit that tragedy. Favorite character was Mrs Miles.
FORD V FERRARI,14 October 2019,7/10,"This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,7/10,"Story is great! Very emotionally intense! Matt Damon did a great job balancing acting and getting immersed in the character. While Christian Bale was, for me, too intense at many points I got a little bit uncomfortable."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the most talented actors working today, so my level of anticipation was high for ""Ford v Ferrari."" I'm happy to say that the movie doesn't disappoint: it's an engrossing, emotional drama that held me on the edge of my seat throughout all of its 152 minutes. ""Ford v Ferrari"" takes an obscure true life story and turns it into a heart wrenching and thought provoking tale of friendship, creativity, ego, corporate politics, and human ingenuity. I knew little about the facts behind ""Ford v Ferrari"" before walking into the theater, but afterwards I couldn't get enough of reading about the real characters portrayed so well by Damon and Bale. In ""Ford v Ferrari"" these two are in top form: Damon's charisma and Bale's quirky genius spark amazing chemistry that carries the entire movie.This movie is masterfully directed by James Mangold: the cinematography is awe-inspiring and the racing sequences are among the best I've ever seen. As a filmmaking achievement, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is outstanding. I do have a couple of problems with the movie: certain elements of the plot were predictable, and a few scenes here and there weren't fully developed so it was somewhat difficult to understand what'd just happened. But these are only minor flaws with the script that are outweighed by great performances, beautiful cinematography, and terrific racing sequences that should set the standard for future racing movies. 8/10."
FORD V FERRARI,28 June 2020,10/10,"This movie, IMO, lived up to the hype. The race scenes are nail-biting. The acting is top-notch. I'm very familiar with the Ford/Ferrari battle and the outcome of the Le Mans race. But, much like the movie Apollo 13, that didn't detract from enjoying the movie.
You don't have to be a race car fan to enjoy this. In fact, I never watch car racing. The story is brilliantly told and directed. I watched a video, prior to seeing the film, that showed the special effects used to create the race scenes. What's so amazing is how realistic this movie looks. You would never know what they went through to make these race scenes.
Bale and Damon are pure magic on screen. Jon Bernthal as Lee Iaccoca? It works! Everyone was perfectly cast. Lastly, the 2.5-hour runtime truly flies by due to the excellent pacing. You will be glued to your seat.
Perfection!"
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,9/10,"Do you need more incentive?OK - I will give you one:The director also made ""Walk The Line""And Sorry, my review is too short....wow."
FORD V FERRARI,11 April 2020,5/10,Another film where there's clearly been a sophisticated marketing background. I was looking forward to this but it was mediocre. There are some good moments but it's about 45mins too long. The best bits are the driving. Christian Bale used to be an interesting actor. Damon does his best to make a film but it's not enough. Can I get my money back?
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,10/10,Great movie with suspense and great performances from the actors specially bale. He was really into to the character.
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,9/10,"This movie was a great documentary of what actually happened, and I learned a lot. I've always loved the Ford GT and Shelby products. I have a 2014 Mustang myself. I like the fact that people were real in this movie.. acted like and looked at things the way they probably did back then. Everybody wants what they want, and some people end up getting burned because of it. This is corporate America. It's not the 2000s when people started getting greedy. They always have been. It's unfortunate how things turned out for Ken Miles. Feel sorry for the guy. All in all a great movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end."
FORD V FERRARI,20 June 2020,8/10,"I liked this movie, now I'm not usually a car-sport film fan I haven't even watched a single fast and furious movie but this one tops the notch! It has some great acting and some great editing.
My only issue with this movie is that it is a little tad too long but overall I had a great time watching this movie"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"With a gripping story, interesting characters, AAA acting, pitch perfect sound design and some of the most visceral racing action put to screen, FORD V FERRARI is an incredibly well oiled machine!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Storyline, acting of each characters is totally amazing."
FORD V FERRARI,21 September 2021,4/10,"I watched three episodes of The Queen's Gambit and 20 minutes of this. Again, I went back to The Queen's gambit. God! It took me 4 sittings to finish this. FYI just finished it, for the sake of OSCAR NOMINEE."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,7/10,"An easy watch that reminds me Hollywood can pass on a little truth and pride.
Altogether well oriented-
Exemplifying dignity and morals by separating the heart driven characters versus the selfish/uptight moneymen....
& also showing that PG13 is a high standard in cinematic storytelling (Mangold must have a heart of gold).Matt Damon & Christian Bale had the love in their eyes as they played their roles with such grace."
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,3/10,"This movie might have been better titled ""The Ken Miles Bio"" for the almost complete absence of point to point competition between the two car marques. Hollywood has yet to make an excellent racing movie but this one isn't even in the top ten. I gave it a three for excellence in period features such as technology, classic cars and the like. The secondary actors were better than the primaries. Don't waste your money."
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2020,10/10,"James Mangold did it again,he proved,with his previous film Logan,that he is the first director who made a perfect R rated superhero movie and now he made another magnificent movie but this time he proved us that he can do a masterpiece without any superheroes in it.
If you look at the Russo Brothers than at James Mangold and you compare Mangold non-superhero film(Ford vs Ferrari) with the Russo Brothers film(Extraction),than you'll notice a huge difference between the movies.
The thing is that Joe Russo and Anthony Russo are great at making superhero films,where as James Mangold succeed in both ways.
Another nice detail about ""Ford vs Ferrari"" are:1st-the cast fits like a glove with the real characters they portrey,
2nd-the soundtrack is great and it's well balanced with the theme,the emotion of the characters as well as the suspense that the film gives to us(the audience),
3rd-the story is bloody fantastic.
By the way,for once I'm glad to watch a perfect race car movie that doesn't have any drugs,guns,heist or ther jail stuff in the film.
Don't get me wrong,I like the Fast and Furious films,but sometimes I want something fresh.
With that said,all that remains is for me to strongly advise you to not miss watching this film because it is more than a great film,""Ford vs Ferrari"" it's a masterpiece.
The only regret I have is that James Mangold film should had won the Oscar for Best Picture or Best Screenplay,but it's ok."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,7/10,"I generally steer clear of most biopics due to the staging of ""special"" moments, ripe with poignant dialogue and meaningful looks into the distance. In truth, life just isn't like that. It doesn't serve up the momentous on cue. The important and life altering moments often drift by, not recognised until much later. Having said that, this film has more than its share of these moments, but it's still an enjoyable and well told story. The leads are good and the narrative compelling. The racing action is gripping and while there are a number of stereotypes in the supporting cast, it's still well worth the money to see it."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"It's hard to compare Rush (racer biography by Ron Howard) I suppose Rush race scenes were more intense, but the 2 leads didn't have chemistry like Bale and Damon in this one. Their friendship, colleagues and families really helped carry the story for 2.5 hours.The story is relevant in both auto race and corporate history. The director did a great job bringing the audience to this specialized industry with effective narratives so we could all enjoy the ride without feeling lost.There were so much to digest in the dialogues and so many good action scenes to admire that I would recommend watching it again! p.s. try covering your ears in the theatre, because I overheard spoilers in the hallway (*__*) not cool~! Another occasion, I had to put on my headphone on the train to avoid hearing spoilers."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2020,8/10,"The director didn't praise Ford by belittling Ferrari. On the contrary, Ferrari is a very respectable company. Ford's executives are selfish, hypocritical and sophisticated. When Le Mans announced that the championship was McLaren, everyone went to cheer for McLaren, only Enzo Ferrari took off his hat to salute Ken. Enzo Ferrari, 68, was a real racing fan after watching the whole race in Le Mans, and Henry Ford left in a helicopter after watching half of the race and didn't come back until the end of the race. Leo, Ford's vice president, always wanted to get wind and rain. Ken was not as respectful to him as other people, which made him feel very unhappy. So he had to retaliate Ken by mean of despicable means. If Ken can win the Le Mans championship, his face is also gilded as a vice president, but he would rather not gilded his face than be willing to be better. This is the highest level of baseness - to harm others but not to benefit yourself. It's not better drivers than Ken who beat him. It's business operations and bureaucracy. It's a dark system of humanity and corruption. The biggest enemy of drivers and athletes is not competitors, but those enterprises and people who violate the spirit of sports."
FORD V FERRARI,27 October 2021,5/10,"Well. I wanted to turn the movie off before the opening credits were finished, but I was watching with somebody else so I sat through it.It's a movie, it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good. It was mostly fairly boring. It certainly should have been no longer than 90 minutes. I gave it 6 stars instead of 5 on account of the high production values and the caliber of the acting.The Hollywood Melodrama Checklist was checked. There were a number of scenes in this film where I thought I was watching a car commercial.The obligatory faux-profound voice over from the opening sequence was repeated again at the end.You know what? I'm docking that extra star I gave it for production values and high caliber acting."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"Just when you think that Hollywood has but strained all it can out of ""American underdog victory stories"", it toots out Ford vs Ferrari. Ford is struggling and bound to shut down its production line unless someone can save its ass. The idea comes, to tackle Italian giants Ferrari at the greatest endurance race, Le Mans.Enter Shelby (Damon) and Miles (Bale). Together, whilst battling their own demons, they build and drive the one and only...Mustang. The story plays out but it's both Damon and Bale that really do excel in this film. They bounce off each other with effortlessly ease, which clearly makes this an enjoyable film.Not many sports orientated films are made that are of this calibre, but every now and then you get one that hits the bullseye."
FORD V FERRARI,10 April 2020,6/10,"All the aspects of the movie are very well done: Photography, directing, acting, the plot,... However, the theme of the movie is not interesting enough so it remains irrelevant"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2020,7/10,"..but nonetheless i enjoyed this well made movie. Great script, great actors/actresses and great photography. All in all - great historical flick. A surprising example that decent flicks can be made nowandthen in the 2000's."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"What a brilliant film. Even if you don't know much about Le Mans but enjoy motorsports, like myself, you'll still really enjoy this film and the story. The racing scenes are so gripping and you feel you're watching the race live. Well made, well acted and a must watch."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Just returned from the cinema. Another great performance from Bale and Damon. Great character development. The movie moves so fluently that it was felt much shorter than 2,5 hours. Instant Blu Ray purchase when it comes out. Another brilliant piece from the director that gave us Logan and Walk the Line."
FORD V FERRARI,24 January 2021,10/10,"I enjoy watching movies based on real events and then doing the research to see how true to life they remained. This movie did take some liberties, as most do, but not nearly as far as I assumed that they would.If you're into any of the racing style movies (Days of Thunder, Gumball Rally, Cannonball Run, etc.) I suspect that you will enjoy this movie. Production and sound quality are top notch, acting is superb and I was concerned that I would have difficulty seeing Matt Damon as Carol Shelby, but he pulls it off better than I expected. The storyline between Ken Miles and his son Peter was a huge part of the movie which I didn't know or expect, much of the movie is seen through his eyes but it pays off in dividends and doesn't come across as cheesy. Christian Bale's acting caught me a little off guard simply because I could easily recognize him but only because I've seen him so many times (Batman fan here).I purchased this on Blu-ray back in May (2020) and have already watched it about a half a dozen times because I find it to be such a good movie and will probably watch it six more times before May comes back around.Rated PG-13 but think that it makes a perfect ""Father/Son movie night movie"" for younger than 13 year olds due to the relationship between Ken and Peter."
FORD V FERRARI,12 September 2020,9/10,"I have seen on here many bad reviews for this film stating inaccuracies in the story, the cars themselves and overlooking other drivers involved, if this is you are looking for an accurate depiction of this story then read a book about it or watch a documentary as this film for me had very little about the cars, the race or the battle between Ford and Ferrari. This film is really more about the relationship between Shelby and Miles, to that end the film did well.The acting between the cast is excellent but notable for the main leads, Damon and Bales did an excellent job but for me Bales portrayal of Miles is a bit off putting due to the accent he employs. Ken Miles was born in Sutton Coalfield near Birmingham so I was a bit confused why at points he sounded like he was from Walkabout Creek (circa Crocodile Dundee) and then at others as alumni from the Dick van Dyke school of Cockney acting. I realise no right minded filmmaker would want to make a Hollywood blockbuster with one of the leads with a Brummy accent as they all sound a bit thick (appologies to everyone from the West Midlands but you do have one of the worst accents in the UK if not the World) but the accent he used fluctuated throughout the film which was annoying.It's well worth a watch for the acting alone and hopefully it will encourage you to learn about the true story of Ken Miles and the heavily flawed Carrol Shelby that unfortunately Damon didn't really portray."
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2020,9/10,"Even for a non racing enthusiast, the movie is a captivating watch. It brilliantly captures the thrill of the race and the competition, and, at the same time, manages to portray emotions in a balanced manner."
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari is an entertaining well done movie. Besides an exciting, true story, it contained the superb acting talents of Matt Damon, Christian Bale and a bevy of excellent supporting talent. The racing scenes were well choreographed and exciting. All in all a great movie from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc. And that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two. The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive. The film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles. But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost. The film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it. And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky, The address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold. Actually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist. In conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.The film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.The only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.Overall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,9/10,"Ford Vs Ferrari Is A ""Sports Thrill Ride"" Inspirational Movie Which You Will Enjoy From Start To Finish.This Is Untold Story Of Ken Miles (Hall Of Fames). Movie Will Teach You How Struggles Are. Life Give You Problem To Make Opportunities. Ford Vs Ferrari Was One Of The Best Script In 2019 , Story Is About The Succes Behind The Big Company Ford. Must Watch For Sports & Car Lovers.Film Will Give You Sentimental Attachment With Character Specially Christian Bale (Ken Miles). Matt Damon & Christian Bale Bromance Is Remarkable . Acting Is Very Realastic, They Nailed It Perfectly.Visuals Are So Powerfull. Story Is Intense And Gripping And It Will Engage You Till The End. Climax Is Memorable & Emotional.Thanks For The Perfect Lap. ( Director - James Mangold ) ."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2020,8/10,"I'm not a gearhead at all, but I really liked this movie a lot. The main reason was the dramatic, true to life clash between two automotive titans- Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari and the foot soldiers who fought the battle. It's really all about the characters, but there just happen to be some great 1960's Gran Turismo racing cars in it.In a nutshell, Ford's sales were slumping because 60's teenagers wanted more exciting cars. Lee Iacocca (later to become Chrysler's CEO) thought that adding some racing DNA to Ford would boost its image. So they transformed the Ford Falcon into the Mustang. Ferrari was on the ropes and Ford tried to buy them largely to acquire their racing team. Enzo personally rejected their offer as well as insulting Henry Ford II. That's all it took for the wounded CEO to drop $9M into his own racing program.It really gets interesting when Iacocca approaches Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) about heading up Ford's racing efforts. Shelby in turn ropes in Driver/Mechanic Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to work with him. The interplay between these two is really the heart of the film. Whether it's overcoming design problems or corporate bureaucracy, they are a joy to watch. Lots of little nuggets like a hilarious scene where Shelby's service in WWII as a B-17 pilot comes into play.There are many thrilling sequences in which vintage Ford GT40'S, Ferraris and Porsches roar around race tracks. On my Dolby 5.1 sound system, the growl of the race cars was awesome. Lovely shots of the town of Le Mans in France and its legendary race course. The climactic racing duel of Ford v Ferrari takes place in 1966 at the 24 hour race there. A real nail biter.Refreshing to watch a film where the story and characters move the film forward so effectively. For me, this more than 2 hour movie just flew by. Recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,1/10,"This flick has so many flaws. Zero heart. It's difficult to care for any characters, especially Ford II, he's portrayed as a hollow man so when the actor does a poor job, the result is a bad movie. The film correctly illustrates all the reasons United States is hated by nearly every nation, corporate greed. Foul language omission makes it an ok kids movie. Adults will walk away feeling empty."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,9/10,Great true story. Great acting from all concerned. Great direction. Highly recommend you go see this on the big screen! I will be happy to pay to see movies in theatres if they are of this quality. Well done all concerned! The only reason I didnt give this a 10 out of 10 is because I associate 10s as being from studio shills etc rather than fans and disregard them as a matter of course. Same as I disregard 1s and 2s as a rule. Do yourself a favour and go see this movie on the big screen.
FORD V FERRARI,7 January 2020,10/10,"This is a great and hystorically accurate movie which stands out along with performances of matt damon and christian bale at best.sound effects,visiuals and dialogues are spot on.cinematography and direction are winner too.one of my fav. Movie of 2019"
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,10/10,Definitely a must see. Doesnt matter if you like cars or not. The plot is very dramatic and climatic. Easily one of the top 5 movies this year!
FORD V FERRARI,4 April 2020,9/10,"What exactly did Enzo Ferrari's purple ink pen circle?
For Car Lovers, the most anticipated movie of 2019 is ""Ford V Ferrari."".Of course, ""Speed Car King"" as a commercial film, while restoring history, there are also deductive elements in it.Why did Ford buy Ferrari?
Ford and Ferrari, in the 1960s, when cars were not highly globalized, were simply two car companies that could not compete.One is the American overlord who pushes automobile production into the modern process, the other is the Apennine overlord who is immersed in automobile racing.
The two are on different continents and are not competitors in the same field, and their situations are even more different.1960-1970 was the golden decade age of explosive growth for Ford and all American car companies.During that decade, the annual production of individual models under Ford's main brand increased from 300,000 units to nearly 800,000 units. For Ford, which is aimed at the general audience, they have enough capital to do some things in circles.
Ferrari in the 1960s was in dire Straits, facing a situation that could not be uncovered at any time.Racing is a very expensive sport, a team behind the big boss to inject capital, the racing department needs to rely on car companies to obtain funds.At that time, Ferrari was like a single ""Iron Han Han"", no matter when and when, sports cars were only owned by minority groups.By selling sports cars, or selling racing cars to independent teams to feed the entire R & D team to form a closed-loop, this road is becoming narrower and narrower by Ferrari.Until 1963, Enzo Ferrari sat at the same negotiating table as Henry Ford II.
In the case of Ford, their purpose was clear - to move into the European car market.At that time, Europe was an incremental market for American automobile companies, but there was a very embarrassing problem in front of them:At least in the field of automobiles, Americans have no sense of superiority in European land.Why was the deal called off at the last second?
Ford wants to buy Ferrari, and Ferrari also needs to find a ""golden master dad"" as a backer. This seems to be a good deal for you. It should be smooth sailing. What exactly caused the transaction to crash?Of course, it is not because there is a ""mole."".
Ferrari's private secretary, Franco Gozzi, wrote in an Italian car magazine about Ford's acquisition of Ferrari.He referred to the clause that angered Ferrari the most and led him to walk out of the meeting - ""each item was over 450 million lire (about $257,000 at the time) of the team's budget.Enzuo had to apply to Ford for approval.""On the agreement, Enzuo circled the words ""submitted"" and ""acquired"" with his purple ink pen, and wrote ""not acceptable"" next to them.
Enzuo was an unruly man, and it is precisely because of his temper that he has created many popular stories in the history of automobiles.In his view, the rules and regulations given to him by Ford seriously affected his freedom of management of the team, which he had suffered for decades in the field.
According to the description of Ford Department manager Fei Lei, in the process of negotiations between the two sides for nearly a month, there are also other factors of discord.Enzuo, for example, has been critical of Shelby's relationship with Ford, and his bid to enter the Indy 500 has been thwarted by Ford."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,But the movie was fantastic... loved everything about it.Excellent work.Thumbs up.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,6/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a movie with a great Christian Bale performance, and it tries to tell the interesting tale of the events leading up to Ford's incredible win at Le Man's. The way they choose to show this had a few great scenes, but ultimately was not as interesting as it could be in documentary form. The best example I can think of is the difference between Man on Wire vs. The Walk. Documentary is just the better format to tell this interesting story."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,9/10,"This is one of this year's best, from the cast's performance, the story, and the cinematography. It has good visuals feeling that you are really in the 60s. Bale and Damon's acting were commendable. I really did not expect to love this one a lot because I'm mainly not a fan of action movies. I expect this to be at least nominated for Oscars."
FORD V FERRARI,2 June 2021,8/10,"Thankfully, this film has so much more to offer than CG racing scenes, as I have very little interest in cars. This could strangely be one of the best I've seen Bale in, and his chemistry with Matt Damon really carried the film from the start. Americanisms aside, I really enjoyed the aforementioned chemistry between the two leads, the philosophical themes explored through Bale's role as the late Ken Miles, and the lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the story. Thankfully I was able to rely on the characters to make me care about any scene with a car in it, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,7/10,"""Ford V Ferrari"" Review
(7.5/10)Between its thrilling racing sequences and underlying commentary, Ford v Ferrari makes for a somewhat entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography.
On paper, a movie about the Ford company's efforts to defeat its rival Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans probably only sounds interesting to either racing enthusiasts and/or anyone who actually knows what a 24 Hours of Le Mans even is. Thankfully, the final film, Ford v Ferrari transcends its biographical trappings to deliver an enjoyable viewing experience for gearheads and race-car novices alike. And with director James Mangold calling the shots, the biopic is mostly successful in getting at the heart of what makes this story interesting - namely, the struggle between commercialism and creative integrity.
At its core, the Ford v Ferrari script credited to Jason Keller and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth is part American corporate myth and part real-life story about a ragtag group of artists in their profession who're trying to stay true to their vision while working for a company that's far more concerned about public image and selling their products to the masses. Of the two, the latter element is more compelling than the former and gives the film a beating heart, even when it's all too apparent where the story is going next.
Ford v Ferrari knows what matters most are the people who come along for the journey. In this case, Damon and Bale have excellent chemistry as Shelby and Miles, and their dynamic gives the film much of its flavor, whether they're bonding over their shared passion for racing or coming to blows in what's typically a very funny fashion. Their personalities are well-complimented by those of Ford's business suits, with Letts and Bernthal doing excellent work as always and Josh Lucas bringing on the smarm as the Ford executive Leo Beebe (who proves to be the biggest thorn in Shelby and Miles' side).
The race-car sequences and recreation of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans are the primary attractions as much as anything else here, and Ford v Ferrari very much delivers the goods in this regard. Mangold and his DP Phedon Papamichael shoot these scenes with a steady hand, allowing viewers to actually see everything that's happening while still experiencing the sheer exhilaration that comes with being a body that's ""moving through space and time"".
Trouble is, it's all so very predictable. Miles loses his seat, but you don't think for a second that he won't win it back. Miles is losing the race, but you don't for a second think he won't pull it back. What these men achieved, in such a short space of time, was nothing short of miraculous. But that doesn't necessarily translate into an engaging story, and for much of its punishing run-time, Ford v Ferrari fails to get out of third gear. Like a race car without an engine, Ford v Ferrari looks good on the surface, but fails to motor for its 150-minutes. There's fun to be had watching the Ford executives clash, and the driving scenes are shot with real artistry and skill, but they're interspersed with scenes of true inertia. So while Le Mans might be the most exciting race on the planet, a film about that race is a very different proposition, with Ford v Ferrari lacking urgency and thrills, and instead simply chugging along in underwhelming fashion."
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,5/10,"Efficient and well made... and that's it. A simple and straight story with another ""American Hero"" (maybe a couple of heros) and a lot of simplistic and a bit silly stereotypes. A bit childishly from my point of view, but ok if you are looking for a simple and easy to understand pic."
FORD V FERRARI,2 May 2020,10/10,"The immersion of this movie in the racing scenes was stunning, incredible, extraordinary. I sensed Ken Mile's (Christian Bale) desire to obliterate all records and set himself as a Legend in Le Mans. Rarely do movies submerge me into a state of mind that gives me psychosomatic experiences. Those races are large portion of the movie and just like for the pilots we feel their relativity vicariously. The movie is a concerning two hours and thirty minutes, but in no point, in the entire movie, does it get dull, boring, redundant. We get a story-telling that is passionate, nuanced, idiosyncratic, and moralistic. Kudos to James Mangold.A beautiful highlight of the movie was the shots at the Le Mans. The viewer gets a sense of what Ken Miles is experiencing. We also understand a modicum of both the intuition and knowledge of the pilot as he is attempting to measure and calibrate the reaction times and distances. His son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe) and Mollie Miles (Caitriona Balfe) were an important inclusion in many of those scenes to remind us that despite his relentless desire for success, he was still a multi-dimensional character with decency and compassion, despite his crazy antics.The plot follows a perfect pace to provide us with the necessary details to understand the contention between Ford and Ferrari but also make it short enough to not lose our attention with too many character building or dialogue. We immediately recognize the temperament, character, values, and ambition of both Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles as they attempt to circumvent bureaucracy, corporatism, greed, and mediocrity. I would have enjoyed more emotion from both protagonists, but the tone that was set was maybe emulating the real life story of both, even in their character and personality.The movie reaches a resolution that can leave a bittersweet sensation to many, but the process to reach the moral of the story, many of the times can be more turbulent than expected, sometimes is far more complicated than visualized; there were definitely a lot of factors at play in the unfolding. It is refreshing to see that the protagonist, who was undoubtedly, could even be said obsessed with success, ultimately did not care for the plaudits and trophies of Le Mans. One can say that the process of becoming better was the alluring feature in his experience of racing cars."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,6/10,"As much as i liked this movie for what it is, fictional. based on true events. but this isnt a true story. some of the basic facts are in there but when a movie based on history should be as historical as that history. creative licensing is a stupid way to make any movie.
the time line is out. ford started this project without shelby, shelby came later after ford lost his first two tries at le mans. miles drove in the race the movie said that he had to stay home for.
where are all the other cars? for a hundred million dollar budget, they could have at least used some stock footage to show all the other cars in all the other classes that are involved also.
where was the winner's podium? ford and all others protesting that miles should be awarded first prize.
why was ford and his crony made to be villians? after all, it was his company, his cars and his race. why add the fake conflict?ive seen movies using all the facts from history without distortion. i thoroughly enjoyed them more knowing what i was watching was completely true. and if ive ever enjoyed a movie then later found out the facts were distorted, it ruins the entire experience."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"Saw this with some of my family but not expecting too much as the reviews from the upmarket press weren't too good. But they were wrong, really enjoyed it. Good drama/story and people you cared about. Great driving scenes and witty lines too.
I guess the reason The Guardian didn't like it was that it was about western white men driving planet killing (!) cars. And not an LGBT person in sight!So it seemed real. And because it was a true story there were no silly dramas/twists to try and make it more exciting. The truth, we'll presented, was exciting enough."
FORD V FERRARI,1 June 2021,10/10,"If you like cars, you must watch it.If you like race cars, you definitely must watch it.That's it. The rest, you can get an idea from teaser.I just watched it and want watch it again.P. S: This movie does not need a long review with points, details, and comparison to the real history. It is not a documentary, so just relax and enjoy it. It's worth it!"
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,Ford vs Ferrari was the best movie for racing to go and see if you like fast cars
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,10/10,Just amazing. Does not get much better than that. Jason Bourne vs batman in the street with wonderbread! Amazin!
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,7/10,"After watching the Best Picture winner, ""Parasite"" in the afternoon, I went back to the theater later that evening to watch this film. My expectations were not so high, and I honestly felt a little fatigued from being awed by the South Korean masterpiece I saw earlier in the day. After watching this film, I felt like I just ate a little too much pizza--it was good but it maybe too long. The story is fairly standard and somewhat uplifting, the performances were pretty good (refreshing to see Christian Bale in a British accent), and the visuals were good. However, I felt the climatic race and ending to be anti-climatic. Maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with racing, I kind of expected something more exhilarating like the Podrace sequence from Star Wars episode 1. Now the last moments of the race and the results were fun to watch-personally the film could've ended there. Now the ending, without spoiling too much felt too obligatory and could've just been cut. Sometimes events could merely be mentioned or even be written in the end credits, that's what the ending in this film was like. Overall, good film but not worth a repeated viewing."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"It is a well crafted movie with every scene and actor well chosen. Christian Bale and Matt Damon were amazing. The movie takes you a part of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles's life and how their combined passion, ambition, determination and dedication lead them to a success which everyone thought impossible. It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again."
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,8/10,"What's at stake in here is not the fate of the universe, nor even an auto race, but the glorious, endless pursuit of perfection.
Bale delivers as usual one hell of a performance.8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,8/10,"I'm not a great fan of car racing but director James Mangold's work delivers on all fronts for a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience. Besides, it's also a great human interest story. The entire cast performs well but the main 2 actors are ahead of the rest. As always, Christian Bale disappears himself into the character and gives an outstanding performance. Matt Damon gets to show quite a range from confident showman to a rarely seen vulnerability. Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael immerses the viewer into the racing action. The editing is outstanding and also the sound design is excellent - it makes your heart race faster as you hear the roar of the Ford GT 40. Some of the races are simulated by stuntmen. And some are created through computer graphics. But the real and computer graphics footage are indistinguishable because of the camera work and editing.
It's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is an ace director."
FORD V FERRARI,22 July 2020,3/10,"To long to describe this particular subject, that make it boring just to see a movie promoting a brand, and proof who has it more ""Better"". Pointless but good performance"
FORD V FERRARI,9 May 2020,9/10,"I am old enough to remember back in 1966 when a Ford car won the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) had gotten into car racing as part of the company's marketing effort for the Mustang, and Le Mans was considered the ultimate race because the cars were going as fast as 200 miles per hour over a 24 hour period. It took place not on a racetrack but on regular country roads. Ford engages sports car designer and former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who once drove for Aston-Martin, to build them a car capable of winning the race. Shelby had retired from racing because of a heart condition, so he recruits English car racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to be the principal driver of the car, called the GT40. The film is very entertaining, the period details seemed right, and the car race scenes are excellent. It was the Oscar winner in the film editing and sound editing categories and nominated for sound mixing.
The dominant racing car up to that time was Ferrari, and the rivalry between Ford and Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) became personal after the latter rudely rejected Ford's merger proposal. Other conflicts are between Shelby and Miles, who are old frenemies, and between the two of them and the top management at Ford, especially Josh Lucas as senior VP Leo Beebe. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), then vice-president of marketing, does his best to mediate. Damon and Bale are good, but Caitrioni Balfe as Miles's wife Molly is large wasted. Letts turns in the best performance in the film as Ford trying to live up to his grandfather's legacy."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,7/10,"Disappointed Ferrari was a minor theme in the movie.
Really only Enzo.
Expected character development from both teams.Ferrari racers, car models not even mentioned.
As explained in another review, Ferrari main driver quitting, not shown.
Nothing Ferrari. Just a footnote.The difference between 7000 rpm Ford vs Ferrari 9000 (8 cyl vs 12 cyl) not even mentioned.It is not Ferrari vs Ford.It was about an American company and its directors, about its icon Shelby, about its racers.
Well just one team out of 3.Really really lacking in history and confrontation."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"The best racing sport drama I've ever seen after 'Rush'. Car Maniac's will love this film. I know one or two about regular cars and I've no idea about racing cars but from zero to end, the film was exhilarating and i got to know how 24 hours le mans event goes. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's friendship in movie was funny yet beautiful! Even one liner jokes worked out very well. I specifically want to appreciate Sound Design crew and Director for this movie, boy what a feel they've given to this film! Watch it even if you don't know anything about racing cars, it's explained very detailed in the film."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"As an ex NASCAR driver, I was excited to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint at all!
Truly well done movie, really drew you in and made you feel like part of the story, and Christian Bale's performance was perfect for the part, and really I couldn't think of a better actor for the part...
This movie made me want to race again...!
This is a must see movie...the best of the year in my opinion!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 June 2020,10/10,"Guys this movie will be remembered as one of the best Cult Classics ever in the future.
Watch it especially for Christian Bale.
Matt was awesome as always.
Masterpiece."
FORD V FERRARI,23 August 2020,9/10,"When I first heard about Ford v Ferrari, I thought, who really cares. Ferrari's awesome, Ford sucks. When I think of Ford, I think of pickup trucks, mustangs, and junk stock. When a pickup drives by, kids don't gawk, but when a Ferrari drives by, everyone looks. There's no comparison, so why would I care about a movie about the two?I actually wasn't going to watch it, but my friend saw it and told me I had to check it out. At that time, the movie was already out of the main theaters, so I went down the road to an old B theater to see it on the big screen.I left the theater thinking 3 things:Awesome film.They didn't have to kill Ken.Josh Lucas was utterly annoying.I know enough about screenwriting and Hollywood to understand formatting, structure, and expectations of films. The main thing is there has to be plot points and conflict.In this movie, Ford is the hero, Ferrari is the villain. But the film also makes Leo Beebe out to be a villain and that was useless, pointless, and actually quite annoying.I also hated that they showed Ken's death. I understand his death was during the time frame depicted in the film, but the movie wasn't about Ken Miles, it was about Ford surpassing Ferrari by winning the 24 hours of Le Mans. The movie could have ended with Ford crossing the finish line. For all intents and purposes, that was the end of the film. The movie ended up being just over 2.5 hours long and it didn't need to be that long. The story could have been tighter.I know many will disagree with me. Why nitpick? Well, I gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, but it wasn't perfect. I'm always in search of the perfect film and this movie could have gotten a rating above 9. It might be up there with Shawshank Redemption, but it's not. And I'm sure that's because others agree with me, that it's a really entertaining film, but they really blew Bebee's character up and I think they lost some focus trying to make this film into something more than it was.If they removed everything about Leo Beebe and Ken Miles' death, I think this would go down as a perfect film, because it is a great story, great dialog and IMO it's Matt Damon's best performance. I loved when he took Henry Ford II for a ride. There's so many reasons to watch this film, and I've seen it about a dozen times already, but the last couple times I watched, I turned it off after the son says that's a perfect lap, because after that is everything I hate about this film, how Beebe (allegedly) cheats Miles out of a victory and then Miles dies.While watching Ford v Ferrari, there was a moment when Enzo looked at Ken Miles and gave him a nod. It was a subtle moment that got me thinking, wouldn't it have been great if Ferrari recruited Ken Miles / Shelby, and they kicked Ford's ass? Lol. I always seem to get ideas for other movies while watching one.I'd like to now see this same movie from Ferrari's perspective, because this film wasn't about Ford versus Ferrari. It was all about Ford; there's very little about Ferrari, but everyone hates Enzo and everyone wants Ford to win. It's a biased film. Another reason why reviewers may lower their score."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,7/10,"Excellent well made movie overall and bale is abnormally amazing delivering an Oscar winning performance but the ending is cruel and unforgiving I can't give away the rest due to spoilers, of course that doesn't take away from how the rest of the film is, overall some serious eyecandy"
FORD V FERRARI,27 October 2021,8/10,"Went into the film expecting a decent story and a time passer but came out absolutely surprised by the entire plot line and construction of the film with the beautiful chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The emotional connection this film portrays is exceptional and heartbreaking towards the full context and beautiful throughout the relationships built within the film. Le Mans 66 (Ford v Ferrari) definitely speeds up your heart throughout the entire film before it comes to a big crash, in a good way."
FORD V FERRARI,22 June 2020,9/10,"This was and incredible movie, the to find out it's a true story wow. SAD ending"
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,9/10,"Loved this move.More or less historically aligned, if not entirely accurate.However, great acting, some humour and lots of cars ... from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,6/10,"Ford v Ferrari is clearly comes from a place of heart and a very talented director. The car races in this movie are dramatic, incredibly tense, and very well shot. There's a lot of production value and effort that went into making this film and it shows. The directing was probably the best part, no real issues there. I love James Mangold as well as almost all his films, so I'll always support him and I can't wait to see what else he does. This film was pretty strong from a technical standpoint, the cinematography, the editing, the sound mixing & editing, and the visuals were all great. The acting was pretty great, especially from Christian Bale. I really enjoyed Matt Damon and his performance, as well as the endlessly fun, charming, and believable friendship and dynamic that he shares with Bale. I liked his character and I think he had enough development for what screen time he had, but at the same time his character didn't feel that special or unique, but I did enjoy his character. In terms of acting though I think Matt Damon gets pretty outshined by Christian Bale. That just goes to show that he's one of the best actors working today, he worked on this film coming off of Vice, and if you've seen that movie then you would know that he looks radically different in this film. It's kind of amazing how much and how quickly he can lose and gain weight or a role. He's an actor who can disappear into his characters and he never feels like he's acting, and he can play such a wide range of characters, I mean this guy played Batman for crying out loud. He fully dedicates himself to all of his roles and he's one of my favorite actors who will always have my undying gratitude. In fact this might be his best performance that I've seen from him in a long time. His character is very well developed and the vulnerability on display is captivating to say the least. The film is very fast paced for the most part and it was pretty fun to watch. It got a little boring at times, and there were some points in the middle that lost my investment, but other than that this film kept my attention for the majority of the run time. And yeah the story is a little drawn out, not everything in this film was necessary or justified, they could've trimmed off maybe 20 minutes. My last issue is that it's one of those movies that is pretty pandering in terms of it's message and it's story, it's fairly cookie cutter and predictable. And it's one of those films that is just screaming that it's going for Oscars and it's very obvious, it's kind of an Oscar bait movie is what I'm trying to say. But despite some issues I really enjoyed this film, it's not amazing and I'm in no rush to see it again, but I'd recommend seeing this one in theaters, because the sound and visuals are so immersive that it makes this film a very theatrical experience. See it with a good sound set up as well."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"James Mangold somehow turned what could potentially be a boring subject into one of the best films I have watched all year. Utilizing the strength of its cast and buoyed especially by a superb Christian Bale, this film was a true crowd pleaser.It was exciting from start to finish and the race sequences had my adrenaline pumping and had sweat rolling down my forehead. The sounds in this movie is superb and definitely adds to an immersive experience. This film, despite its run time, was never boring. Two hours and thirty minutes simply flew by watching this.A well directed film from start to finish. You have to see it in cinemas for the complete experience."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"I knew something great was going to come out from the pairing of Christian Bale and Matt Damon in Ford V Ferrarri and I was not disappointed at all. It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,8/10,"I saw this at a mystery screening at my local cinema. When I saw the title card, I was dismayed. First because I have no knowledge of, nor interest in, motor racing. Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.
I'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.
Petrolheads will love it. Non-petrolheads will love it as well."
FORD V FERRARI,13 March 2020,2/10,Cliche-ridden yawn-fest.The storyline is predictable (even without knowing the true history) and hopelessly inaccurate (if you do).
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Few movies I will pay the expense of going to see because of the high prices of theaters these days. This is one of those films. Just came back and must say. It delivered! Well thought out and told. Matt and Christian as always shined in this project. In my personal opinion Matt & Christian are two of our times greatest actors. They don't play a role, they live it. Go see this feature. You wont be disappointed. it's a great story that needed to be told, and in the hands of those two. Well worth your time. 5 Stars*****!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 January 2020,10/10,"I've always been a fan of Matt Damon and Christian Bale. And as always they did not disappoint! Well written and produced. Top notch performances by all in this piece of work.
A well time spent enjoying. They touched on all the subjects to a point it kept you glued to your seat! I would absolutely recommended watching this film. You will enjoy it very much....!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"Really good film. Just a really well acted, well written, efficiently executed film with an engaging story and characters you are invested in to match. I was starting to think Hollywood had forgotten how to put out good content. But this is really worth your time. If you're interested in history, cars, racing, and just good storytelling in general you should see this. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are wonderful together, with Bale particularly just knocking it out of the park. Mangold continues his flex on everyone in his rise to auteur level filmmaking, beginning with ""Logan"" and continuing with this movie...Thoroughly enjoyed it."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,,"This is very well directed movie, filled with top notch acting, and some real gripping car races that I enjoyed and really wanted to love, but kept having this nagging feeling like they were checking off boxes.It has this old fashioned feel to it, which I actually enjoyed but may put off others that may believe it drags (specially at the start). Someone actually starting snoring in the theater.But honestly this is a good enough movie, that at the end of the day, could have been better; the relationships between the masterfully performed characters deserved to have been carve out a little more.Also almost everyone seemed, so it was hard to root for anyone; but I guess that is why the performances were partly so good, we were shown real people. Again just wished more of a deep dive into what made everyone tick.7/10"
FORD V FERRARI,27 January 2020,9/10,"Thoroughly enjoyed it like no other sports film. It was such a nice build up towards the ending. Bale you beauty your attitude throughout the film was kickass and film came out very well with writing, performances and background score. Definitely recommended for moviebuffs for the thrilling and touching experience. Could've caught it in theater that'd have been great but in case if it's going to re-release gonna get my ticket 💯. Gald to see it in Academy nominations it deserves all the way."
FORD V FERRARI,11 May 2021,10/10,The movie is entirely true abd each and every incident happening either it was the race or was it the end everything was true.Acting was really amazing from Chritian Bale I loved him from the dark knight and now my love just increased.
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,7/10,"It was entertaining, but it was not the movie I had hoped for.They skipped the Mark I and Mark II entirely and went straight for the Mark III.Nothing was mentioned about all the hardships and failures - even the crashes resulting in the death of the driver - all during races Ford lost.There was no struggle to overcome. I had hoped for a movie which included the design engineering to resolve the problems.The true story is so much better!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,10/10,"WARNING: After watching this movie, ANY sport other than auto-racing will be boring to you. If I was stranded on a desert island with only 10 Blu-ray movies to keep, this would be one of them.Primarily, this is a racing movie. Le Mans is a very special race in the racing world. Using 2 drivers, they race for 24 hours rain or shine. Obviously, the drivers are very important, but the building of an ultra high performance car that is driven 100% flat-out for 24 hours is the engineering challenge.The movie also tells the fascinating story between Ford and Shelby. A partnership that still exist today, you can still buy a Shelby Mustang for about $20,000 above a standard Mustang price. Clearly, the Shelby name means something to people looking for performance.About 60% of the movie is amazing car racing footage. Having said that, one of the most impressive scenes to me is when Shelby gives Henry Ford II a ride in the Ford GT. Fords reaction, is incredible, and an amazing piece of acting. You might look at Henry Ford II as a stuffy Business Man, but deep down inside he is still a ""Car Guy"" and he was blown away with the extreme performance of a 220 mph car.I consider myself a movie buff, I have over 3000 DVDs and Blu-ray's in my collection. I ONLY watch a movie one of two ways. In a movie theater or on a disc from my collection. I never stream. Most of my movies are from the 1930s to 1950s. But, Ford v Ferrari is nothing less than a masterpiece. If it was your job to edit out the boring parts from this movie, you could only eliminate 30 seconds, maximum.A movie like this is best seen on the big screen, the really big screen."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,Great movie. A must see for the big screen. The sound is phenomenal.
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,8/10,Great!! Not my 'subject' but I love Christian so much!! Really nail biting moments. Great acting
FORD V FERRARI,13 February 2020,10/10,"Such a great movie
You live with ken miles across the whole race
But a very sad ending"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,10/10,"Christian Bale born a pom the perfect choice here as the pommy go fast man of the 1960s. Matt Damon has never made a bad movie. Onya Matt. Surprise Henry Ford 11 gets a spot to expand his droll dour personna and does it well. I felt his shattering. The movie score superb I shazamed it. Ford V8 engines have always emitted the ulimate raunchy note by far european engines dont come close. Damon and Bale bounce off each other so well. The visuals pace vibrance super
Suport actors great especially Carrol Shelby main man. Thank you
Patrick
PS read a few purist petrol head reviews where away from escapism the Ford Motor Co was described as Goliath as in David and ...... Well Ferrari did sell out to a Italian socialist Govenment owned Fiat Motor Co
Who was Goliath free enterprise Ford or Italy Government Fiat Motor Co ?

FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,9/10,"I was so excited to see this movie and the fact that it never disappointed me, Because I really really enjoyed it from start to finish despite its relatively long duration, I think that watching this movie was one of the best moments in 2019 With the shock factor that was large and multi in all moments of the movie, Speaking of the performers' performance, the performance was very excellent, and this film is the best for Matt Damon for the martian a year 2015, As for Christian Bale, he deserves to run for the Oscars.
Finally, I wonder, why did filmmakers wait until 2019 to produce this movie and tell this legendary story"
FORD V FERRARI,2 August 2020,6/10,"I'm a huge fan of Ford, Ford's racing heritage , the Mustang , the GT40 and the historic 1966 1-2-3 win for USA.Positives :
1) I'm glad that they tried to tell Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles And the rest of the Shelby American team story.2) I love that they did practical effects with cars.That's it everything else is contrived Hollywood ""Based on Actual Events"" Drivel.The biggest fail in this movie is casting.
It's a huge lift because many of these real life people were larger than life personalities;
1) Matt Damon in no way portrays Carroll Shelby with any authenticity
2) John Bernthal as Lee Iacocca, are you kidding?
3) Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II -- 50% Tracy Letts/ 50% Dick Cheney characterization , 0% Henry Ford II -- 100% terrible miscast and poor acting choices
4) Christian Bale , does a good enough job, but doesn't convey the true class, courage or chivalry of Old school/ hard knocks race driver Ken Miles
5) Only highlight Alex Gurney as Dan GurneyYour better off watching Adam Carolla's 2016 documentary film ""The 24 Hour War"" and his 2019 follow on effort ""Shelby American""."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,10/10,"Starting things off with Christian Bale, when Joker is released we all thought that Joaquin Phoenix is the chosen one for this year Oscar, but Bale's Performance is outstanding, I mean Matt Damon's Performance itself doesn't feel good enough because Bale shared the leading role with him. Astonishing. Now, let's talk about the racing scenes, OMG, Very exciting, entertaining, breathtaking, sorry Rush, but FVF beats you in this one. History wise, the movie is rich and worthy enough to be nominated for Best Screenplay plus the idea of the behind-the-scenes secrets that happened during that time was actually, the best part of the movie. Straight 10/10, I don't find anything wrong about this one. MASTERPIECE."
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,10/10,"I'm not a Christian Bale fan. Probably because of all the off-screen cocktails he's been blending, but i must say, I really liked his character. He played so good, i forgot i dislike him. Probably his best performance EVER as an actor.This movie is well made into the last piece of paper on a shelf in an unimportant area of the screen. It feels like a solid ride through a well-written world of car history.I'm not a big engine-man. For me, it was perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"Even though this is a movie about motor racing, specifically Le Mans, I found that even non-enthusiasts would enjoy it. It's about the journey Shelby and Miles go on. The 2 hours 30 minutes don't feel like a drag which is a testament to the flow of the movie.Matt Damon was really good as Carroll Shelby, I mean really good. Christian Bale as Ken Miles on the other hand, phenomenal. Oscar worthy performance as he completely throws himself fully in the role.The sound mixing and editing just felt on point and could well be award winning too.Go out to watch it, it's worth the hype and lives up to the trailer."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Christian Bale is astonishing.
An instant classic.
Ford v Ferrari is a Triumph.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon soar in one of year's Best Films."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,10/10,"Even with the mediocre Christian Bale (why didn't they cast someone with talent?), this is a very exciting and great film. Matt Damon is fantastic-but he's always fantastic. Why Damon hasn't received an Oscar for his acting talent is a mystery.
If you enjoy motor racing, you'll love this film."
FORD V FERRARI,3 April 2020,8/10,One Best movie of the last 10 years . Very entertaining and captivating. A rare movie that's able to please everyone.I know nothing about cars and I found it to be very good . A lot more slow paced and mature than I thought as well . This isn't just a racing movie.Would recommend to anyone.
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2020,10/10,"There is the age-old adage that fact is always more interesting than fiction. While a certain amount of creative licence is often necessary for plot development, a good old fashioned true story is one that leaves a lasting memory for years to come.Le Mans '66 is one of these films, and it is superb. Yes, the storyline deviates from the actual events at times, but the essence of the movie is in keeping with this pivotal moment in motor racing history; the glorious battle between a luxury sportscar manufacturer and the mass producer of automobiles for the common man. David vs Goliath, Box Office vs Benefits Office - you choose. Either way, Le Man '66 plays out as a buddy movie between the main characters, Carroll Shelby and a highly volatile Ken Miles and it plays out in a magnificent way.It's irritating sometimes to read reviews on IMDB, where 'self-made' geeks offer criticism which isn't fair or indeed, particularly smart. For example, I don't care if the Ford GT40 MK II doesn't sound like it has a 7.0 litre engine or the racecraft from the drivers isn't 100% historically accurate. Does it really matter in the scheme of things? The movie is an exhilarating roller coaster ride from start to finish with an exceptionally entertaining and compelling performance by Christian Bale who steps into Ken Miles's shoes with great gusto. Matt Damon plays Carrol Shelby at times for laughs and comes across as a passionate, cheeky salesman with an unwavering sense of self-belief. It's a killer combination.Like everyone, we all draw different messages and meanings from films, and the conclusion I made was a real surprise to me. I thought the film would be about taking on the big boys and beating them at their own game (which is the actual storyline but not the underlying tone). What transpired was something different - Ford tarnished their achievement by putting their big corporate multi-billion dollar machine ahead of the glory and legend of the sport. By not letting Ken Miles win and instead, instigating a cheap and cheesy publicity stunt to sell a few more units, Ford did more damage to their reputation that day than enhancing it. The words 'no class' spring to mind with the added hammer blow of not only robbing Miles of a much-deserved win but then tragically losing his life in a fatal crash while testing the next generation GT40.If you can ignore drivers staring at each other while driving at 200mph or the fact that Enzo Ferrari was probably not at the race (at that time of his life he rarely left his office, not even for races), then Le Man '66 is a petrolheads dream of a film. There is enough truth in the story to make it a compelling and riveting spectacle from start to finish.While Miles is not afforded the same stellar reputation when compared to a Fangio, Senna or Clark, the film successfully raises his profile as a racing legend which is fitting to his and the Le Mans GT40's memory."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Brilliant story, screenplay, direction & acting !! And above all, there's Christian Bale. He single handedly knocks this movie out the park with his portrayal of Ken Miles. Outstanding entertainment for racing & non-racing fans.."
FORD V FERRARI,26 March 2020,10/10,"The Shelby mythology is well fed with this film, but to be fair, Ol' Shel himself was always quick to praise Ken Miles, so it's nice to see film that recognises the input from a truly international band of racers & hot-rodders.Matt Damon is great as Carroll Shelby, but then Damon is great almost always.... To the casual filmgoer, his wheelin'n'dealin' business style, his brashness and his confidence are well portrayed, but you can appreciate to his performance easier if you've seen interviews with Shelby himself.Christian Bale & Catriona Balfe are brilliant as the Miles'. They deliver the accent & lingo brilliantly (I was born in the same town) and I loved Bale's inclusion of the Brummie phrase ""going round the Wrekin"", that shows real depth of research into the character, even if it is wasted on the vast majority of viewers... In a racing car, Bale really makes you believe that he's grabbing that Cobra / GT40 and wringing out Every Last Drop of performance (watch the DVD extra's to see how it was done, well worth it!) as well as fulfilling his role as development driver by constantly thinking of new ways to go fast. You get the sense that he was immersed in the jargon, not just reading it from a page... He Understands.The crew went to extra-ordinary lengths to recreate the period venues, not, thankfully, all CGI for which this film is all the better. The sight of all of those Cobra's, GT40's etc is enough to have one going weak at the knees (as well as the achingly gorgeous Panhard on a trailer when 'Miles' first gets to Le Mans), even if it obvious that the Superformance etc. cars are the ones running bigger wheels and low-profile tyres. A nice touch, possibly as a nod to Ken Miles' Midlands background, is the Mini (Austin, not BMW) sitting outside his garage.The Ford politicking is central to the theme and, for dramatic tension is exaggerated somewhat. You can imagine Henry Ford II acting in that imperious manner, but any film needs a true villain and Leo Beebe (quite harshly in many opinions) carries that particular torch through to the films end.Just like Steve McQueen's Magnum Opus, 'Le Mans', the hero doesn't win through in the end, coming second. Like many sporting controversies, there is opinion, denial, conjecture & opposing sides about the manufactured finish.Interestingly though, the film has the cars finishing in a perfect line abreast, whereas in real life, Bruce McLaren sped up slightly at the end also, unlike the film, Shelby was also instrumental, with Beebe, in orchestrating the 'dead heat' although once the French officials had wreaked their havoc, he always went on record as having bitterly regretted denying Miles the 66 'Triple Crown'.It's a bittersweet epilogue where Miles is killed, I guess the films intention was to show how much of a racer he was and, even after getting shafted by Ford, was still intent on making their car faster & better...In summary, ignore the historical stuff, you've got Wikipedia for that. Simply turn up the volume and enjoy the best motor racing film since 'Le Mans'. Only with more dialogue. And plot."
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2020,7/10,"It's a good film, with good performances from Christan bale and matt damon, Racing scenes are amazingly shot with great sound effects."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,8/10,"You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about ""historical inaccuracies"" of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual."
FORD V FERRARI,16 September 2019,9/10,"I thank god every day for the bless he give me,, thanks to him (and some people in hollywwod) i can enjoy this movies so early on! This is definitely something you wann watch in the theatres, incredible movie, plot and PERFORMANCES OMGGG,, this is some oscar material guys i mean it!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 December 2019,7/10,"People who love cars must watch this movie. Those who are not interested in cars must watch. :) The acting is great, the script is great."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,3/10,"If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage."
FORD V FERRARI,14 March 2020,8/10,"Bale's performance was great as always, he always brings magic to every character but I also enjoyed Matt Damon's role as Carrol Shelby as well.
The final race was incredible and shout out to everyone that was involved in the making of this movie. Miles looking in the mirror and seeing that no one was even close to him was very beautiful. Great character shift when Ken (a self centered prick) decided to slow down so that he could cross the finish line with his teammate.
Props to the writers for adapting a screenplay for this film. I bet it wasn't easy trying to make a movie about racing cars but also have a lot of character development."
FORD V FERRARI,23 March 2020,8/10,"Life to only the opponent can understand their position, lonely, lonely high cold, pity each other."
FORD V FERRARI,16 June 2021,10/10,You'll watch this film again and again .best film i saw last year.
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2021,6/10,"This was definitely a good movie, worth seeing once. However, I couldn't help comparing it to Days of Thunder. Days of Thunder was just entertaining the whole time. The acting in this one felt forced. I felt like I should want to cry at the end, but I didn't. They just tried too hard. The only real redeeming feature of this film was the fact that it was based on a true story. If it wasn't based on a true story, I don't know that there would have been anything else really redeeming about it."
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2021,10/10,"I loved every single minute, it flew by and left me exhilarated. I've watched it three times I love it"
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,8/10,"One of the best sport drama movies I have ever seen. This movie is mainly about Le Mans racing of 1966 and the feud between Ford Motors and Ferrari. Christian Bale and Matt damon as Ken Miles, British race car driver and Carroll Shelby, American automobiles designer have done a perfect job respectively.
This movie is not only for racing fans. Casual movigoers also definitely would enjoy the movie. The thrills, emotions, love, passion are balanced equally. Overall this is a perfect crowd pleaser.
At last, great work done by sound department and the racing sequences were shot very nicely."
FORD V FERRARI,8 June 2020,9/10,Incredible acting. Loved this movie. Shows that things don't always end well.
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,9/10,"You know you are totally hooked to this movie when you are planning watching it in your bed, and you end up watching it all the way seated in it, rivated to the screen, unable to move, deeply absorbed.What an exhilarating ride that was. And what, again, an amazing performance by Christian Bale. Certainly one the greatest actor of our time."
FORD V FERRARI,15 December 2019,6/10,"It is entertaining, its a crowd pleaser, Christian Bale (as always) inhabits the role and Matt Damon is Matt Damon. But this is made to appeal to the widest range of viewers and as such dumbs just about everything down. Its soooo predictable, corny as hell and of course the baddies are so archetypically baddy. There's nothing subtle here, though I did like Marmite product placement."
FORD V FERRARI,17 December 2019,10/10,"Entertaining from beginning to end with a bit of a surprise at the end. The story line seemed very real and while I'm sure they embellished in spots, it provides a view into the history of car manufacturing and that race to be the best and the fastest on the planet."
FORD V FERRARI,14 August 2020,10/10,"I'm pretty sure I could watch this movie every single day of my life and still never get tired of it. It's so good. It's such a pleasant watch and has become one of my ultimate comfort films. Just watch it, there's pretty much no reason not to like this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,"I didnt know what to expect of this movie but it is one of my favorites now. The story line is not confusing, theres good guys and bad guys. Theres humor and awesomeness. I agree with a lot of people who have reviewed this movie: this movie will make you want to learn now to drive stick shift! It was so awesome and the racing felt intense and badass. Christian Bale is a wonderful actor and Matt Damon was superb! Damon deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for this movie. Both him and Bale had really good chemistry. The only negative thing I will say is that there was no backstory to how both of their characters met. You assume they already knew each other at the start of the film. Other than that, loved the film and is one of my favorites."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"Not much can be said other than it is a fantastic movie with great actors.
No need to be a race car lover, this film based on a true story is very touching."
FORD V FERRARI,11 May 2020,9/10,"Who said racing movies is boring because casts always wins ? i don't think that rubbish is valid anymore. I mean the man who directed Logan, what you expect from him ? Seriously, the casts did an awesome job. The vibes of '66, with soundtracks, costumes, artifact, editing everything was so perfect. The ongoing politics inside the Ford was truly cumbersome but beyond everything, it's a masterpiece movie to me."
FORD V FERRARI,25 December 2019,7/10,"Maybe the movie could be a little shorter. I still had a good time.
The characters are very motivated. Convincing."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"An absolutely terrific film. It's been a long time since a movie had such a brilliant cast-literally, every single performance is spectacular. Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Caitriona Balfe, Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, McMullen, Letts, McKinnon, and Girone all play their roles to balanced perfection. James Mangold's direction is spectacular, the film's cinematography is jaw-droppingly brilliant, the editing is masterful, and the score of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is excellent. Brilliant acting, direction, cinematography, score, and editing; pulse-pounding, jaw-dropping, and thrilling; laugh-out-loud humorous yet incredibly emotional-this is literally everything you could want out of a film. Excellent."
FORD V FERRARI,23 June 2020,9/10,"An old fashioned made movie. Great acting, great and believable chemistry between the actors, well directed, great story, directing and special effects. It's a pleasure to watch a movie in this day and age without any of today's political undertones.Strongly recommend anyone to watch it."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,10/10,Hands down the best movie of the year enjoyed every single bit of it. I might even buy tuna on iTunes when it come out.
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,7/10,"James Mangold's latest star studded creation delivers jolting and mesmerizing performances by both lead actors - Matt Damon and tenaciously comedic Christian bale, which transforms the movie about corporate rivalry into well acted, entertaining, perfectly directed film which is based on a true story. The film hypnotizes both racing and non racing enthusiast into submission of glorious cinematic tale."
FORD V FERRARI,21 July 2021,5/10,"Cinematography, acting, sound, and color were great!Pretty much everything else about this was testosterone-fueled action. If you like that, cool. I'm bored of it at this point. Kind of just disappointed with how boomer-centric a plot this actually turned out to be. Very toxically masculine, very ""Us vs. Them."" Pretty overrated overall."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"Love the chemistry between bale and damon, only thing that could of done better was bales dodgy British accent"
FORD V FERRARI,15 April 2020,9/10,"Firstly I should say that I'm not particularly a fan of motor racing, or aware at all of any of the story covered. Had it not been for the rave reviews, I wouldn't have sought this one out.The story itself is relatively straight forward, and the outcome not a particular surprise. This film could easily have fallen into mediocrity, however it just so well made. For the entire film, there barely seems a scene or a word out of place. On top of this, it looks amazing. I can't recall a film that, while not dealing with typically spectacular visuals, just looked so good.The acting is outstanding, especially Christian Bale, who gives I think his best performance, in a fantastically nuanced job. Matt Damon is good and the rest of the supporting cast generally spot on. Overall very highly recommended, one of the most professionally made films I've seen in a long time."
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,9/10,I loved it was intense and exciting at the same time the cast was great and the car scenes where great to the racing was amazing I loved it considering I grew up loving cars Ford vs Ferrari gets a 9-10 perfect movie great racing
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"What this movie does really well is get you emotionally invested in the characters, due to great acting and strong screenwriting. They built a star studded cast for this movie with Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, etc. and it really payed off with them all giving great performances. The racing scenes were exhilirating and excellently shot with great audio editing to make you feel like you're in the car with the great Ken Miles. All of this combined makes this movie easily a top 5 movie of the year for me."

FORD V FERRARI,16 August 2020,9/10,"Aside from the dramatization and the embellishment of the tensions between the corporate world and the racing team most of the facts are mostly historically accurate. The only thing I did not like is that they push the throttle further in the straight, in the straight the pedal is to the metal all the way and if you want to run a bit cooler your foot is still steady on the pedal 90% of the way, not 10% then 100% then 50%. Apart from that it is a really enjoyable and gripping movie for any racing enthusiast about the most iconic feud in Le Man's history. The part that is really missing is the actual feud between them but that would make the movie 5 hours long. No this movie is about two racing legends. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles who even to this day real racing fans adore and daydream about.
If you are even remotely interested in racing 100% watch it"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,8/10,"This is a pleasantly surprising film. Partly because of the narrative - I was expecting a pro-Ford take on the celebrated rivalry, after having seen the Amazon documentary (I think it's called the 24 hour race or something). I was proved wrong.By choosing to focus on the two primary characters (superbly portrayed by Matt Damon and Christian Bale), James Mangold's gamble pays off handsomely in this tale of man and machine against all odds. Ford vs Ferrari is as much as Miles-Shelby's dogged perseverance against stumbling blocks from their own backers as it is against their iconic European counterparts. Their partnership is chalk and cheese - the diplomatic Shelby complementing the ""difficult"" Miles but it works remarkably well. There is a good reason the American calls the Brit ""Bulldog"" as Miles' tenacious pursuit of the perfect lap motivates people around him to go further. The action and humor prove an effective blend in driving the narrative forward. The cinematography, score and sound design are expertly done, capturing the intimacy of characters' personal lives as well as the frenzied restlessness of race days.In terms of performances, Bale and Damon have a terrific chemistry and Mangold exploits it shrewdly. While Bale tends to overact in some scenes (his facial expressions border on the ridiculous sometimes), he nails the eccentricities of a war veteran-turned-race-driver character to perfection. Unlike others, I did not find his accent surprising, but his preparation and dedication to his craft continue to leave a lasting impression. That said, this film completely belongs to Damon. He has the best scenes, the best lines and the meatiest character. His Texan drawl may not be pitch-perfect, but his control and restraint form the essence to the story as well as a ideal icy foil to Bale's hot-headed, fiery persona. The supporting cast is quite decent, though I was disappointed to not see the John Bernthal get more screen time.Ford v Ferrari wins not because of the titular rivalry, but inspite of it. A very enjoyable and entertaining racing film."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"I've been down on Hollywood lately. In that regard this film was refreshing.
This film puts an interesting perspective on LeMans, and how the US got there with the GT40.
I grew up in the 60's. I was 15 when this race occurred. Carroll Shelby was a God and the GT40 a dream.
It was a time when things could get done in this country. JFK said we're going to the moon.....we did. Carroll Shelby wanted to eat Corvettes on the track and he did with the Cobra. Henry Ford II wanted to beat Ferrari and with Shelby and Miles and the GT40 he did. Pull out the stops, damn the corporate committees, just a ""git 'er done"" mentality.
It's a fun film that doesn't get lost in the racing. It is a story of friendship, attitude, determination and yes, Le Mans.
It is also a fantastic ode to some the greatest icons of Automotive history, Shelby, Miles, Iacocca, Henry Ford II.
Go, watch and enjoy,"
FORD V FERRARI,21 April 2021,8/10,"I really enjoyed the movie. Even though it was rather long I didn't feel the time passing. It's catchy and has a good pace to keep you focused. As far as I could read about the events, it's in general more accurate than I would have expected. Christian Bale does a good role, nothing short than what I expected."
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,9/10,"The movie is really driving you through the whole story. It's a very thrilling experience. Excitement rushes and keeps you tied to the screen through the racing scenes. The excellent soundtrack keeps your emotions occupied. Production, editing, the engine roars, everything fits perfectly like on a GT -40 :)
The Oscars are well deserved.
Christian Bale is also very convincing in his acting. You can see that he's entirely into the character with the British accent and all the strange tics of Ken Miles. I haven't seen a good movie like this in a while."

I haven't seen a good movie like this in a while."
FORD V FERRARI,9 August 2020,8/10,"This is exactly what i love about movies. Ford v Ferrari reminds me how great a movie can be with outstanding lead acting synergy and seamless story telling. Car related movies especially feel kind of hard to pull off, in where i seem to only account for movies such as the Fast and Furious franchise for reference. This film actually makes you feel like you are the one driving, if that makes sense. Everything about this being a true story also enhances the experience, as well as near flawless execution and CGI. The pacing of the movie also is just perfect and i didn't even realize the movie was 2.5 hours because i feel like i just blew right by it! Will definitely be revisiting this movie soon!!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,Fun movie with two great leading men. Both are grappling with a tough industry while maintaining their own vision. Damon & Bale's portrayal of the real life friendship of these two mavericks is remarkably good. I don't think it's amazing but it is an enjoyable movie.
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,8/10,"First of all if you haven't seen the movie what are you doing in your life?
So I will this short, Christian Bale is one of the best actors today. He gave a wonderful performance in this film! And the relationship between him and Matt Damon is what makes this a masterpiece. Other thing is the racing shots and sounds of the cars was absolutely amazing. And by that I can say this is one of the best movies in this year."
FORD V FERRARI,27 April 2020,10/10,Definitely similar to the Le Mans movie from 1971. Thanks for this fantastic artwork!
FORD V FERRARI,10 April 2020,9/10,"Ferrari stands in the stands and pays homage to Miles, who is a little silent on the track. That quiet moment is the most important moment of the movie full of motor roar: the winner in the title actually loses, but the loser really wins. Miles, Shelby and Ferrari are pure to the extreme, trying to preserve the last trace of self loyalty in this copper smelling world."
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2020,10/10,Wow what a movie. This is what movies for and should be made like that. Superb acting from matt damon and Christian bale is awesome. I have seen this movie now 5 times and never get bored.
FORD V FERRARI,6 January 2020,7/10,"Movie would have been much better and about 30 minutes shorter if they removed the wife from it all, rather than shoving her in as they did."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"I only know a little about cars and I effing love it! Ford v Ferrari is a movie that non race cars fans can experience such thrilling historical moments and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.I heard that this American sports drama was adapted from a memoir called The Carroll Shelby Story which was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes--the worst of which he describes as an ""explosion."" The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. In Chapter 21, Shelby describes his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. (Anyway, this passage contains a little bit of spoiler, although in fact, it's not. It's merely a flash info I got from wikipedia right after I got out of the cinema and mesmerized).I like the idea of how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the story. Their relationship in the movie is spot on, portrayed really good by James Mangold and his team. My only complaint about this film is that, unfortunately, their in-depth story (relationship and adventure) wasn't dug deeper. We get to see the huge intrigue between two corporations. But that doesn't ruin the whole story. This drama is based on true event of an unsung hero. I didn't know all the true story until I watched this epic biopic the other night. I'm happy that I learned something from this movie. Even Matt Damon himself--in one of his interviews along with Christian Bale--didn't know the real story till he read the script. The way I see it, this film's not about winning or losing; this is all about ""achieving the goal"". I'm so impressed. It's totally worth to watch. No, it's actually a highly recommended film of 2019. Go ahead and see it in imax for better experience!"
FORD V FERRARI,22 July 2020,9/10,I love F1 and racing generally and I make no apologies for recommending this to any racing fan. If your not into racing why did you even think about watching this film? So on that basis this film is easily as good as Rush which I rate highly. If you want high cinema go to a art house.
FORD V FERRARI,10 March 2021,9/10,"I know its historically accurate, but the ending didn't need to happen/be shown. It should've been just text on screen when the movie was over, imo. This movie is definitely Collection worthy"
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,4/10,"Racing unrealistically slow, car movements all wrong, exaggerated acting, too long, predictable. Proud American sort of Vietnam war movie feel.Wanted to like it. Some good scenes. Rather shocked by how most seemed to love it. We are all different, aren't we!"
FORD V FERRARI,25 July 2021,9/10,"Take one look at the cast and you know you won't be disappointed with this movie! The tandem of Christian Bale and Matt Damon is one of the best I have seen amongst two A-list actors.A loving, captivating, and inspiring true story!"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,9/10,With so many great performances by big names I think particular recognition for Tracy Letts is much deserved. That test drive scene was something else.
FORD V FERRARI,16 December 2019,,"An enjoyable film with fun racing scenes and a great performance from Christian Bale. I'm not a car nut, which kept me from loving the movie, but not from enjoying it. It has some good comedy, important ideas about human ingenuity and passion projects, family, and business relations. A good movie, for me not a great one. Anybody who is passionate about cars and/or technology might love this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2020,10/10,"Before writing my review I wanted to answer those who criticized the movie for being historically inaccurate, come on guys this is not a documentary! Even the director said that it is inspired by real life events but not all of this really happened.
And for those who said that this movie glorifies Ford it doesn't by any means, at the time Ferrari had the top cars and racers so Ford envied them, so the movie does the exact opposite.
Now let's talk about why I adored this movie (and I'm not even a car racing fan):
1- The racing scenes were incredible, they are taken from inside the car so you feel that you are with Ken Miles in the car, it's very engaging and exciting.
2- The cast is amazing! with beautiful chemistry especially Bale, Matt , Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts
3- CHRISTIAN BALE! As usual he is unrecognizable and gives a wonderful performance. His character is so likable and unique and you really get attached to him.
I wished more people had seen this movie in theatre because movies like this are not made anymore and it really deserves to be supported. I guess the name wasn't attractive for a wider audience. But anyhow go see it now! You won't be disappointed"
FORD V FERRARI,5 March 2020,8/10,"... as we prefer to call it in Europe. As refreshing as a nice cuppa tea. Thoroughly human performances against a magnificent and evocative automotive backdrop. A winner, despite the ""suits""!"
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2019,10/10,"Big, well crafted, exciting, meaningful... Every element in the film works beautifully, sound editing, cinematography, acting, costume, etc. Makes for such a fun an engaging film and it also holds truth and insight into the human condition and doesn't treat you like a child. A grown up, direct and well told story, made me nostalgic even for the old-Hollywood classics when directors where humble and made sure to stay out of the way in service of the story. I'll have this one on bluray for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,8/10,"The Movie is fantastic, and everybody knows that. My only problem was the fact that for making some parts of the story look like a surprise, Ford v Ferrari is misleading you to believe somethings. When will that become a problem? Precisely at the time that those misleadings will get into the audience's brain and make it difficult to appreciate a lot of peaceful and good characterizations."
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,7/10,"When you accept that this is a mainstream movie you enjoy the (real) story and racing scenes. We can complain about how we get to see main character's life so little even his devastation at some point. However, they did really great job on racing scenes. Only thing that i can complain about is that the ending could be more painful to win(maybe some suspense). It was kinda all about victories throughout the whole movie and nothing really bad happened. But yea anyway it was fun to see."
FORD V FERRARI,3 April 2020,10/10,"A beautiful film, it really took me back to the 1960s. The acting and storyline is superb."
FORD V FERRARI,8 October 2020,7/10,The movie won 2 oscars for Film Editing and Sound Editing. For me the movie is well done. Although it is an adapted screenplay and have added elements to make it a more compelling feature it is still a very good movie to watch. It really takes you to a different time of the human history and did very well in portraying that era of time in my opinion. Christian Bale is amazing. I was impressed the first time he was shown on screen. There's also good messages portrayed in the movie and some good memorable lines to take form the movie. Overall it is a very good movie but I don't get the urge of rewatching it so in the end I gave it a 7 out of 10. The movie is worthwhile but in my opinion it will not be a classic that you can rewatch it year after year.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"I had huge expectations for ""Ford v Ferrari"" and the movie didn't disappoint at all! Amazing Christian Bale - he is again doing perfect job portraying a very interesting character. Life and work of racing drivers are usually really complicated and every big champion needs to tackle different issues in their private or professional life. The movie managed to tell us a complete and heartbreaking story that involved conflicts on different levels. Miles (Christian Bale) and Shelby (Matt Damon) against the interests of Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), Ford vs Ferrari, the expectations of Henry Ford II, the feeling of being a great racing driver but also a great role model for your son. Honestly, Bale deserves an Oscar for this performance and I am really looking forward to the Oscars next year, because 2019 offered some of the best movies in the history of cinema."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,Absolutely spectacular movie. Damon and Bale were fabulous and it's non stop action from the get go. Thoroughly enjoyable movie one of the best ones I've seen this year.
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,9/10,"This was good! VERY GOOD. Finally, a film that's not a comic book. A film about complex characters that still hits all the high notes that you want in a movie - moments of humor, moments of emotional depth, and an exciting final third act as you root for your heroes to win the big race that the entire movie has been building up to! More movies like this, please."
FORD V FERRARI,6 September 2021,10/10,"If you are a car enthusiast it doesn't get better than this. The cars are just spectacular, in an age when car magic still happened. And then there are the racing legends. Christian Bale is one of the two top character actors today so he turns into Ken Miles or a close replica, like the cars. The funny thing is what happens with Matt Damon who is really good at playing Matt Damon. It turns out that Carroll Shelby fits right in. The rest of the movie is the best Hollywood has to offer. So yes, if you like car racing, this movie is for you."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2021,9/10,"A shocking unbelievably interesting true story - although I later found out that it was partly twisted to make it more dramatic. Still it's really a good movie that captures you immediately. There's no boring second, you feel all the excitement through the whole movie and you don't notice how long actually this movie is. And I'm not even interested in motor racing or cars. Christian Bale is great in his role showing an Oscar worthy performance. One of the best movies I've watched in the recent years."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"I have not seen a movie this good in years, and I see a lot of movies! This movie has everything. Truly entertaining from start to finish. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were absolutely fantastic and great to watch. The racing scenes were edge of your seat. I can't recommend this movie enough.... If you're looking for a great night out, then see this movie! You won't be disappointed!!"
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,9/10,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale have the best chemistry on screen I've seen all year. It's a bummer they didn't know who to push for the acting category for the Oscars. Because they both should be nominated. The story of this movie is great and the performances are great. The small issue I had is it was slow at times with the 2hr 30min runtime. But with this story, I get why it is this long. James Mangold does an amazing job with this movie. He is probably the most underrated Director working right now. He can pretty much do any genre and it's good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari probably won't win Best Picture but It's still one of the best movies of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,2/10,"The real story is well documented
yet they had to invent and show things that never happened.Ken Miles raced Le Mans in 65
films says he didn'twhy , it's unnecessary, it adds nothing to the story but incredibility
The movie is full with such nonsense and it sucks"
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,9/10,"Frankly speaking, whoever reading this review right now, please stop reading any more reviews wasting your time. Trust me, undoubtedly this movie belongs to the ""Best of 2019"". So what are you waiting for? I bet you won't regret after watching it.Happy watching!!! 🙂"
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,8/10,"As is the soundtrack.
I'm so not a petrol head, but this was great entertainment."
FORD V FERRARI,2 May 2020,4/10,I am a motorsports professional . . . network radio and print . . . and have personally covered both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring . . . and endurance racing is nothing like what was presented in this movie. I'm sorry . . . this was a complete load of utter crap.
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,10/10,"FORD v FERRARI
RATING: 4.9/5Yeah, Ford v Ferrari is definitely my favorite movie of the year. It's been years since i felt like i was watching actual movie stars on the big screen. It was great to have that feeling in the theater again, thanks to Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Same goes for the supporting actors. There were no phoned in performances, everyone showed up to play, even the kid. Not to mention, the 2 1/2 hour run time just flies by, as the film jumps from situation to situation. The story is tight. No subplots, no fat to really trim. This movie knows exactly where it's going and the road it needs to take to get there. No detours, probably because it's based off the true story of when Ford beat the dominant Ferrari at the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race back in 1966. The movie is actually called ""Le Mans '66"" in some countries. It's considered the Super Bowl of racing, for many race enthusiasts.Anyways, the film takes place in the 60s but it feels very modern because they spend all their time either racing or working on cars, giving it almost a timeless quality. I was iffy on the musical score but after watching the movie twice, i noticed the score would get me anxious during the race scenes (4DX is the preferred way to watch this movie). My leg would start shaking and I'd get this feeling that i had to go fast. As someone that likes driving fast, that's pretty impressive, so the score definitely does a great job of immersing you in these races, and not overpowering the scenes. Cinematography is spot on. There's a moment where they're racing at night, in the rain, and it just made me super anxious. If you've ever driven in hard rain before, going 60 mph or more, you should be able to grasp the concept of how dangerous it is going over 150 mph, with other cars trying to pass you. This is a great looking movie.I'm really struggling to find negative things to say about this movie, so I'm going to address some of the negative things I've heard in reviews I've seen.
TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE:Yes, the movie is filled with white men, and one white woman, so there's not a lot of diversity here, if that's what you're looking for. Remember, it's based off a true story that takes place in the 60s, ""Mad Men"" era. Knocking a movie for trying to be accurate to reality is just not smart at all.
NO CHARACTER GROWTH:Someone said there was no real character growth in the movie. In the final race, a big thing happens for one of the characters, that practically took a lifetime of growth as a person for them to accomplish. It's even acknowledged by other characters in the movie. It's just nonsense to say there was no character development.
-????:
One reviewer was hoping to see the engine built from the ground up and was disappointed that's not what they got in the film. I mean, the story being told wasn't about the car being built from scratch. The Ford Racing program already existed before Ford ever decided to take on Ferrari. This was about Ken Miles and Carol Shelby being brought on board to do the impossible with what was already there at Ford. This reviewer wanted a different movie.
CLIMATE CHANGE:Yeah, that reviewer was full of it. LOLUltimately, even if someone is not into racing, i think the concepts in the movie are extremely accessible. There are so many themes going through this movie, you're bound to find one that you can get behind. The story of man and machine, creators v. big business, innovation against time, being the best versus being a team player, etc... there's a lot of commentary going on just beneath the surface. The movie is a great snapshot of the American Spirit. It takes place around the time America landed on the moon. Around the time when American exceptionalism was arguably at its height. The Ford GT40 is practically a representation of the American Spirit, America potential. The impossible made real. It's magic, and so is this movie.SIDE NOTE:
Ford decided to go back to Le Mans in 2016, for the 50th anniversary of the Ford GT40 win in 1966, and they won! Like i said, that car, that racing program, is simply magic."
FORD V FERRARI,22 April 2020,9/10,"Behind the racing car is the vanity fair under the influence of capital. The real driver is always chasing the pure speed and the integration of man and machine. At the end of anti climax, the reality is so treacherous."
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2021,8/10,"Visually stunning and the characters/plot keep you interested the entire way through. Really nice movie, even if you have no prior interest in racing definitely worth a watch."
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2020,8/10,"I was never interested in racing movies but as i love the main actors i thought about to give it a chance. They didn't disappoint me. Got lot of background information about all this racing stuff and cause it's a biography i also notices lot of interesting things about cars, Ford, Ferrari etc. Even when you don't like racing, the acting is so authentic from Bale & Damon, you will love it. Furthermore i was surprised about Tracy Letts, loved his performance als Henry Ford II. Of course there are also a few car races in the movie. Now i really know for sure, race driver is nothing for me haha. Have Fun!Cheers
Fletcher"
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,10/10,"Exciting film, for those who like cars and hate leftist ideologies, it's a masterpiece! Nowadays, rare to see!
No Feminism!No Anti-Racism Speech where it doesn't exist!No GAY advertising!No immigrant victimization!It's a simple, objective, exciting, dramatic story!2: 30Hrs that seem to be 10 minutes!AMAZING!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 February 2020,10/10,"Great, entertaining, feel good movie--and so much more. Wonderful acting."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,8/10,"As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.
This year oscar is going to be a difficult choice."
FORD V FERRARI,18 March 2020,8/10,"I watched the documentary and read up about the Le Mans race in 65-66 that happened when Ford beat Enzo and Ferrari in the 24 hour race. So with that in mind I knew the story well enough to notice they left some things out and added some drama to move the story along. I enjoyed seeing Christian bale and Matt Damon on the screen together. Wasn't sure it was going to work but hey they got it too. Overall I'd recommend reading and watching some more stuff on the actual event. This movie doesn't do the story justice... but definitely a fun movie, slow at parts but amazing to see the story of how Ford rose to greatness (well kinda) in a time when cars needed to change. Worth a watch for car finatics or history buffs!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 December 2020,9/10,"First of all, Bale and Damon each delivery Oscar worthy performance and demonstrate once again why they are at the top of their field.The story itself delivered far more than I expected and made this film so much more than a racing movie thus the scenes off the track were just a gripping as those on it. This is exactly what separates this film from those also in this genre.Combining the performances and the writing with the cinematography and sound work put into this film, and of course James Mangold, make it one of the best entries this year and fully worthy of its praise."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,9/10,"Plot writing was great from start to finish. They didn't missed every detail from the truth event. They told the story perfectly from point A to B. The character development was great for Carroll Shellby and Ken Miles character. I'm not sure about Leo Bebee character cause I found him just another cliche movie villain. The dialogue written perfectly well.The cast performance was great and engaging. Matt Damon and Christian Bale did a great job as their character. I really enjoyed their chemistry in this movie. They nailed their character perfectly without any flaws.The action sequence was great and perfectly shot. No CGI,no shaky cam, and not messy cut. That's what I can describe for the racing scene. You really need to experience better on cinema by the way.The cinematography looks beautiful especially during the Le Man's race scene.Overall, this is probably best racing car movie since Rush."
FORD V FERRARI,25 December 2020,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019 with its good cinematography, quality acting, beautiful script, high-budget solid production and excellent sound editing. Especially Christian Bale has done a great job as always. The movie didn't have much to do except it was a little long."
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2020,8/10,"Honestly, at the begining i dont want to watch this movie. Because i dont like car race, at all. But when i saw the rating.... And Matt Damon also Chris Bale.... I decide to watch this movie. And i like this movie. But i still hate car race.""Well, You Promised Me The Drive. Not The Win"". What a big heart."
FORD V FERRARI,11 August 2020,7/10,"There is no doubt that this year's award season is one of the best quality in the proposition composition of a film factory, not only the literary drama is above the standard, but also the cost is in place to make several heavy racing dramas addictive."
FORD V FERRARI,7 August 2020,7/10,"Super good-looking and super angry, buy a car will never buy a Ford, so Ford is how to agree to the release of this film"
FORD V FERRARI,25 September 2020,8/10,"James Mangold directs a wonderful piece of nostalgic cinema, that tells the story of the Miles/ Shelby relationship that saw them put Ford on the map for elite endurance racing.Beautifully set, the film is a love letter to the sixties and portrays the cars as accurately as possible. This was an era where car design was at it's peak, and the film does well to convey the power of the stars of the show.The script is well written: often humorous and sets up the movie for some stand-out moments.
Bale and Damon are perfectly cast and the former excels as the charismatic and eccentric race car driver- his accent a little surprising at first, but well delivered throughout.The politics at Ford and Ferrari create a perfect backdrop for a sun-drenched slice of race car history and depicts the events that took place with an entertaining angle.It's a solid movie that will grip you more as it goes on. Mangold has done a great job here, as have the cast and writers."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2020,9/10,Truly a great my dad movie. Bale and Dameon are amazing. A cool story. This movie is just fun and well made
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,,"Ford v Ferrari is nearly exactly what you expect it to be. In this case, that is not a bad thing. The performances are solid, the action is exciting, the stakes are high, and there is just enough background intrigue to create a meaningful central conflict. It's a crowd pleaser and a thrill ride, with appeal for just about anyone. The film never strives to be overtly political, nor does it push a strong social agenda. No, this is a movie about cars and the people who make and race them, and this is a story about American exceptionalism, akin to the space race or the miracle on ice; the difference being, the stakes are contained: Can Ford build a car that can take on Ferarri at Le Mans? And who is going to drive that beast? It's an America vs Italy story; a story of ""creatives"" - doers - the racers, the mechanics, the visionaries - vs business interests - cautious, profit and image focused. Who will win in the end?"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Easily one of the best films this year. Heart beating, nail biting leaving you on edge of the seat. Christian Bale gives an Oscar Performance. A Must See...!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,Worth the watch but hoped for better..Guess I knew the history of the story forever and felt let down
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2020,8/10,"What made me watch the movie - the castingWhat I liked about the movie - it is what it says. A match between two rival car companies, where Mr. Miles makes his mark only to be forgotten for decadesWho will I recommend the movie to - anyone who'd like to see the art of actingWhat did the movie teach me - not always does a good person win. Sometimes, it doesn't even matter that you win. When your aim is perfection, little things like awards don't mean crap.#OMAAT One Movie At A TimeHere, the word 'movie' refers to both movies and series."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,6/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"CHRISTIAN BALE. CHRISTIAN BALE. Yes, Matt Damon was good, but CHRISTIAN BALE! He completely became Ken Miles, and he was mesmerizing! After Vice and then this, you can see what an incredible actor he is, with an unmatched range. The movie was directed very well, and had great scenes of race car driving. I also loved it for what it lacked...no gratuitous sex, violence, etc, that permeate today's movies. Just a great story! Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,27 March 2020,10/10,Best movie of that year.what a direction of that movie must deserving oscar
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is engaging and giving me thrills when I watch it. I ain't no fans of racing or even about automotive (in this case, about cars). But I really love how the movie flows and make me laugh."
FORD V FERRARI,3 April 2020,9/10,"What a great movie! I loved it all the way, needed some time to lose Damon and Bale, but it was such a thrill to watch those two go at it together. But there were two actors who stood out even more,Caitriona Balfe and Noah Jupe. But especially, without selling short an escellent performance by Balfe, Noah really impressed me. Sometimes you just know you witnessed the birth of a new movie star, and to me, with Noah, that is the case and I truly hope I will be proven right the coming years!I'm entirely unfamiliar with his list of movies, checking him out some outtakes on YouTube might already confirm my notion about him. Looking forward to more!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 August 2021,9/10,"Ken Miles was way ahead of the others in the Le Mans car race. When he was ordered to slow down to get a three car photo finish with the other two Ford, he was willing to wait. He did not get champion technically. He was very hardworking but was willing to put aside his personal benefit and accomplishment to make everyone happy. Although he didn't win the race (although he deserved to since he built the car and drove really well) he thanked his friend for giving him a chance to participate in Le Mans.I don't know how true this story is. Some say Miles slowed down as a protest to Ford, but the film seems to show otherwise. Anyway, it's a really interesting movie."
FORD V FERRARI,27 March 2020,8/10,"This is a movie that tributes to some men who lost their names in the history boiler, actually shows the amateur spirit of the racing sports. With limited material support on their individual account compared to todays billion dollar budget business of race sports, Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby takes effort to win a most important racing event in the world. Even you are not a huge fan of motor sports you would enjoy this movie like I did on ""Moneyball"", ""42"" or ""Field of Dreams"" even I don't like baseball. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will assure you that you enjoy the movie while you're watching it.
Besides the great actors' performances, you will like the cinematography, effects and the intriguing story that tells the rivalry between two big car and motor companies Ford v Ferrari as they give their name to the movie. A Nice and satisfying action and drama you have to watch."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is one hell of a ride and a fantastic movie from start to finish.It's directed by James Mangold, he did Logan (2017) and Walk the Line (2005), and stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Jon Bernthal to name a few. When I first heard about it, all I knew was Mangold was in charge, and Damon and Bale were in it and I was already interested. And now that I've seen it...it's amazing.Probably the best aspect of this movie is the directing. Mangold does a terrific job here and the movie looks and feels superb. There are sequences that'll just move you to the edge of your seat.The performances are great as well, especially by Damon and Bale. Both their characters are an absolute joy to watch and the chemistry between them both is excellent. Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is probably my favourite part of the movie. The character is just terrific and hilarious on the screen.The start and first act of the movie may be a bit slow for some people (I understood why but still thought it was fine). Other than that, I don't really see a flaw or issue.Ford v Ferrari is definitely one of the best movies in 2019. It's a whole lot of fun, excitement and joy packed into 152 minutes that feels a lot quicker than it is."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,9/10,"This film had everything, tight direction, story, acting. It was funny, thoughtful and based on real history and it even had realistic action.
One of the best films this year, even my wife loved it."
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2019,10/10,"LeMans 66' shows just how much this modern age of access has made everythig meaningless, empty and easily discardable. We live in a world of fake news and social media drama influencers, influencing the creatuon of meaningless movie scripts and prequel sequels, while this cinematic gem portrays the good ol' days when things were ""real"" and had tangible value.I haven't been this thrilled in cinema since seeing Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time. Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.This was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,10/10,Its not just a movie like others. This one truly got into my hurt. If I'll keep seeking my words all day then that is not enough I really loved it.
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,8/10,It was amazing. Always movies based on true story became so interesting and full of tension. And it could show the difference between sportsman and business man .
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,7/10,This is a real rollercoaster of a film. There's lots of tension that builds to a awesome climax and a touching ending. Ford Corporation really comes off looking like an awful place to work. Every executive is drawn to look like an arrogant cutthroat. Only Iacocca is spared. Ferrari was shown to be the company with true dignity and vision. I loved the movie and can't wait to see it again.
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"I was looking forward to a new movie about racing cars and especially one about doing Le Mans because there's a lot I'd like to know about that race in particular. This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role. The part is the true center of the film despite Matt Damon's strong performance and that of numerous supporting players. I will truly be surprised if this movie doesn't sweep all the award shows."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"Great acting, cinematography, the race scenes where outstanding, good story tho obviously no surprises in the plot but the acting and characters really made this a stand out👌"
FORD V FERRARI,9 November 2021,10/10,"I didn't think I would fall in love with two race car drivers in the course of a 2-hour film, but here we are. Ford V Ferrari is exactly what a true story adaptation should be. The writing did a great job telling the story in an engaging way where you could understand and be excited about what is happening whether you love cars or not. It has something for everyone. Action, love, friendship, comedy, passion, conflict, all in a perfect harmony to create a stellar film. It has quickly become one of my all time favorite movies and a great rewatch (although I stop before the end because there are too many tears)"
FORD V FERRARI,29 May 2020,10/10,"Sometimes I really admire Hollywood. In fact, the story of this movie itself can be said to be a typical negative energy case of passion losing to money and sports spirit losing to business operation. I didn't expect that it could be made so hot. Two and a half hours! I haven't moved my eyes, and I don't think all the mattresses in front of me are redundant. It's a satisfying commercial experience."
FORD V FERRARI,18 December 2020,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari is drama based on the real story of Ford Motor Company trying to enter the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. The film introduces Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 & owner of Shelby American a vehicle manufacturing company which he founded after his career as a racing driver was cut short due to medical conditions. Further, we are acquainted with Ken Miles (Christian Bale) a British racing driver and a part-time mechanic. Miles has a reputation of being a hot-head and being hard to work with.The real story then begins with executives of the Ford Motor Company (FMC) proposing to Henry Ford II of adding a racing division to the company which will be helpful in increasing sales. Ford convinced with his executives' pitch agrees. Rather than build a division from scratch FMC thinks it would be better to acquire an existing racing team. A perfect opportunity presents itself as Ferrari is in the search for a buyer for its distressed company. Positive and hopeful FMC exec's reach out to Enzo Ferrari the owner of Ferrari with a potential deal. Ford expecting a conformation of the deal being completed, is informed Enzo Ferrari, after stalling their deal and using it as a bargaining chip has completed a deal with Fiat. Ford takes this as a betrayal and feels he was wrong done by. Vengeful Ford orders his staff to build a racing division on its own with the sole purpose of beating Ferrari.Then Shelby is approached by an FMC exec to build a car which is competitive enough to win 'the most prestigious automobile race in the world' & 'Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency', the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Shelby initially not fully convinced, that the level of success can be achieved as visioned by the executives of the FMC, still accepts. Shelby then tries to get Miles on board as its driver. Miles too having the same reservations as Shelby did, is convinced by Shelby to join him. The film continues with the two trying to build a perfect car and win the coveted race. In between there are multiple speed breakers that they need to try and find solutions for.The film surely keeps the viewer curious with the fascinating real story. Unlike other motor racing movies, this one focuses more on the backend workings of a racing team than the on track excitement of the race, which too is wonderfully depicted in the latter part of the film. The movie could have been christened better, as the title can be misleading from which the viewer may assume the movie to be a portrayal from a neutral point of view, focusing on both Ford as well as Ferrari, which is clearly not the case. For major parts the movie sticks to the real story, but includes a few fictional stories and characters as well, still it does not let down the viewer.Audiences may have been disappointed when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt who were initially casted and replaced by Damon and Bale. Still both Damon and Bale do a stellar job in their portrayal of the real life characters. We surely have seen better acting performances from the pair previously, but still this performance does not extract any obvious complaints. The screenplay and dialogue is well rounded with what one would expect from such a movie. Director James Mangold too does a fair job, leaving very less room for disappointment. The post production effects could have done a better job, but maybe was kept mellow considering the time period.Taking everything into account, Ford vs Ferrari is great watch lacking any areas of disappointment. Motorsport lover or not the movie keeps the viewer interested throughout and surely deserves all the Academy Award nominations it has received.Acting- 8.5Casting- 9Cinematography- 8.5Dialogue- 8Directing- 9Editing & Effects- 7.5Sound & Music- 7Story/Plausibility- 8.5Storytelling- 8.5Rating- 9"
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2021,5/10,"I liked this movie. The scenes with the president of ford were very bad and very poorly made and written. He is shown in the beginning. He tells his people to shut down the assembly line? and tells the folks that they are nothing and they don't deserve their jobs, and to come up with an idea to make ford cars better. Very bad stuff. The folks who assemble the cars and work on the lines building the cars have zero to do with the ideas for the cars and things never went the way the movie shows. The president of ford, and yes I know who he was supposed to be, would not stop assembly of their product for any reason, or they would close. None of those scenes ever happened or would ever happen at any company. I wish someone would tell me why anyone would talk to lowly assembly workers in that way and shut down production of their item. Silly poorly written, and ruins this movie. OK folks stop the line, I am angry at the stuff ford makes, and if you drones cant come up with something better to build then you need to walk home and not come back? Ok will move along. Did a child make this movie?"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"Well done movie. Great casting. The movie moves as fast as the Shelby Ford and I didn't notice it was 2 1/2 hours. If was riveted to the story. I wonder how true to life the story is because Ford and his minions came off kinda bad. In any case, it's a great flick. Nice to see a movie today without all that condescending PC/feminism polluting the story. This felt real, not forced into today's narrow PC Hollywood storylines"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect entering the cinema, as the trailers did not necessarily promise a good movie, but this film was just perfect. Honestly, I teared up hard a few times, it was just overwhelmingly beautiful cinematographivally, dramatically, and philosophically."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.As someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.The acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.There were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.Ford v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,Actor's performance are marvellous specially bale...there are lots of top notch cinema scenes and shots in movie...simply another masterpiece by James Mangold and Bale..
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"What an amazing movie and stellar performance from Christian Bale. In fact the whole movie is not about LeMans or Ford, but about this wonderful character Ken Miles. After seeing the movie I guessed it was all exaggeration à la Hollywood, but after doing some digging I came to the conclusion it was all historically correct. He was really that brilliant test/racing driver and engineer, mainly responsible for the development of the GT40. Disliked by the Ford management because of his attitude and outspoken opinions and robbed from his LeMans victory by these same people. Besides the story, the racing is visually stunning and the CGI crashes make you duck in your seat. A masterpiece you should watch on the big screen. Only criticism is the stupid Fast and Furious like shifting and turbo noise when the engine is pushed towards 7000rpm. Why Hollywood, why?"
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,10/10,"Wow
To be honest I don't like the racing movies and I was hesitated but this movie is one of the greatest this year with no doubt"
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"This is a sports movie that I want to compare with Borg v McEnroe and perhaps Rocky. And this movie just falls a little short of those movies, for me. Perhaps it is that car-racing requires such complicated mechanics in a team-effort to be successful, as compared to a simpler pathos in one individual's endeavour.Also, I am wary of a film trying to bring me in with its *wink**wink*intheknow knowlege of cars and jargonist language about cars. It's meant to explain things to a viewer and bring them in, and mock the characters that ought to be mocked (because we're intheknow, and they aren't). For some reason, I was aware of and resisted such attempts. Alongside my experience here, the storyline was adequate and just escaped being hokey, and the characters were adequately pitiable and relatable.What I was really impressed by was the foregrounding of the LeMans lap, and then visually punching us with that pre-knowledge when the actual race was on. The scenes were visceral and this boosted my rating.I thought the edit and shots taken and varied between close-up and other were all done well. Would love to compare shots with Logan, Walk the Line or Copland, just to see.Matt Damon does his best Tommy Lee Jones impression with his voice, I thought. Just throwing that out there.An alright film, and probably better than other car-racing films. Car-racing? why not, just for this story."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,7/10,"Every minute of the movie is interesting, even if you are not a motorsports fan. Take your time and dive into a historic event, with a lot of big personalties that try to reach their dreams without losing everything they built in their life."
FORD V FERRARI,28 September 2021,9/10,"Bale is excellent in this movie, great chemistry with Damon. Some cheesy scenes, but that's Hollywood. Worth watching for the car scenes, they're well edited.The scene with Ford in the race car was excellent, you could feel his excitement and fear all at the same time.I really enjoyed this movie.Well done!"
FORD V FERRARI,26 June 2020,8/10,"It's also too neat. It's so neat that there's almost no fault in all aspects of script photography editing. It's so neat that there's hardly any unique authorship. Deliberately dramatized with true feelings, suitable for the students of film academy to watch."
FORD V FERRARI,15 June 2021,9/10,"Christian Bale. Matt Damon. Ferraris and Fords. What could be better? Car enthusiast or not, this movie is incredible. The script, the scenes, the acting, the cars... it's all there. One solid movie."
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,9/10,Breath of fresh for the film industry. Really enjoyed this one... I regret watching it on a small screen!!!

#filmreactiviews"
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,3/10,"I've never taken Christian Bale for a great actor. His appeal is for people who enjoy some kind of technical perfection and fake authenticity over substance. His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line."
FORD V FERRARI,15 September 2021,10/10,"Best movie I've seen in a long time, great acting, great story, great effects, great realism......give me this over all the current green screen super hero garbage any day."
FORD V FERRARI,26 April 2020,9/10,"Visually stylish, gorgeously filmed and with a fantastic soundtrack.
I really am not a big fan of motor racing but this kept me enthralled from beginning to end.
The real life events have been manipulated somewhat for entertainments sake but the result is so good that hardly matters.
Best film I've seen for years"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,8/10,"Absolutely excellent film : Ford vs Ferrari, with Matt Damon as car designer Carroll Shelby(Oscar exemplary role) and Christian Bale as British driver Ken Miles(perfectly cast).Well done although I thought Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife and related story was unnecessary and interrupted the tight screenplay.John Bernthal was amazing as Lee Iacocca (who in real life saved Chrysler and who passed away four months before the film was completed). Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II was also great as was Remo Girone in the role of Enzo Ferrari.It may be called Le Mans '65 in your country but the film is really all about Ford and Ferrari.Of course special effects abound (one has to recreate the 1960's - my favorite decade) as with most modern Hollywood films (although Infernum, my latest film has no special effects and still makes the point across using excellent location shooting).The Le Mans scenes were filmed in different places and seamlessly edited together so the viewer sees just one location.Finally, I wonder why didn't they use Mclaren as the driver working with Shelby instead of Miles, as he ended up creating his own super car company and probably has a more interesting story to tell than Ken Miles. who knows, it may become Ford v Ferrari, the sequel."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"I saw the good reviews for this one got curious finally checked it this is a great movie!! (And I'm not even a car guy) good story, pretty good characters you feel the race sequences!! Did take me a little while to know the characters at first and some scenes can drag but overall great surprise of a film for me worth watching in the theater ( watch in row 3 or 4 so closer for the racing scenes) it's a must see if you're car person and if not still recommend it you might like it like I did;)"
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,10/10,"Christian Bale and Matt Damon were fantastic in this adrenaline filled incredibly shot fast paced real-life story. Oscar for Bale, I hope.
And I remember there was a GT40 at the dealership last Fall - I am going to check it out :)"
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2019,10/10,"Great cast, great script, just works on every level as a fun and complex father/son story. Watch this on a big screen!"
FORD V FERRARI,29 May 2020,7/10,"This is a commercial film with good completion. The highlight is that there are several racing scenes full of speed sense. The editing and mixing are very excellent. The engine sound is quietly superimposed on the soundtrack, which is very ingenious. It can make the audience's heart beat accelerate with the sound effect, making people blood boil. But this film only has these technical advantages, which are worth praising. Others Face is really not competitive."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"""There's a point at 7000 RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space and time. At 7000 RPM, that's where you meet it. That's where it waits for you.""Incredible movie! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I've always loved car racing & this film that tells about the events in the 3 years leading up to & the actual 1966 24 hours of Le Mans race that showcases the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari totally brings home the trophy. Well written, acted, directed, edited, etc. it's the whole damn package. What heart & soul Christian Bale pours into the role of sports car racing engineer & driver, Ken Miles, with Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby (automotive designer & race car driver) coming in with a very close second. Great supporting cast with Jon Bernthal as the famous Lee Iacocca, Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe, Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, & Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II. Not once in its 2 & a half hour run time did I get bored.The score by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders drove the movie just right & even has a track called ""7000 RPM"".Well done & major kudos all around. I predict some Oscar noms for this.."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"This is what cinema is supposed to be, simply fun. You have beautiful cinematography, great acting, a ridiculous sense of speed and danger during the races, accentuated by some great music, an emotional story... I could go on, but most of it is really positive. It drags a bit by the end, and the main ""bad guy"" is a bit exaggarated, he's there just to be bad, no motive or characterization, but hey, i really hated him. All in all a very pleasant surprise, i was biting my nails the whole time."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,#FORDvsFERRARI exceeded all expectations. Amazing performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Great screenplay by James Mangold. I don't know how else to describe the experience other than it being perfect. Another movie on my very short list of (5/5Scales)
FORD V FERRARI,27 January 2020,10/10,Matt Damon and Christian Bales Performances were out of this world even the side characters gave a good account of themselves. Story is a bit tough to understand at first but it all makes up in the Drama/Suspense and Action of the film. 10 stars.
FORD V FERRARI,18 June 2020,5/10,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, but I was disappointed about how Mangold directed it, some overacting, and a too melodramatic script.First, the director expects us to believe that two race car drivers will drive side-by-side giving each other the evil eye while careening down the straight at 210 miles per hour. Better yet, in some early scenes they shout at each other in their open-top race cars, as if they could be heard over the sound of the engines. Mangold also channels Ben-Hur's chariot race, with cars nudging each other sideways. During the Le Mans race, he cuts away multiple times to driver Miles' wife and child watching the event on TV. I'm sorry, but no network then or now would televise a 24-hour race in its entirety. I can almost hear the laughter of anyone in the racing industry who watched all the absurdities (I am sure they would have a longer list than this one).Next, the director did not rein in the outrageous overacting by Christian Bale as Miles. Add in the demonic glowering of Letts as Henry Ford and you have a cartoon, not a well-conceived treatment of an historical event for American racing. As is par for the course with these testosterone-driven movies, the female characters are destined to be background cheerleaders for their men; in this one, there's only one of them.Equal blame then to the scriptwriters, who came up with a predictable plot line in the best (or worst?) tradition of American melodrama. We have the bad guys (Ford and Beebe) and the good guys (Shelby and Miles), and everyone else is window dressing. Not a shred of nuance here, which should be an insult to the moviegoer, but I guess the bar has been set pretty low for decades now.The racing scenes themselves are well-filmed, with lots of low-angle shots that create even more of a feel of being there. A lot of viewers want explosions, and you get more than your fair share of those here -- maybe too many to be realistic.It's unfortunate that in a film of almost epic length you don't get a good exposition of the friendship of Miles and Shelby. Unless I'm wrong, and it just consisted of a lot of bantering and occasional meaningful looks."
FORD V FERRARI,11 September 2020,10/10,"Brilliant movie from start to finish , great acting and the CGI is awesome"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is now my new personal favorite racing movie! It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a while!I went in to this not knowing much about the story, but by the end I was blown away! I had no idea how gutsy (and sometimes crazy) Carrol Shelby and Ken Miles were! The film is flat out fun, not just because of the thrilling racing sequences, but also because of the at times laugh out loud humor scattered throughout too, (though not enough to be considered a comedy).Matt Damon and Christian Bale both each give two of the best performances of their careers!
The racing sequences had my heart pounding with adrenaline and there were times I wanted to cheer!I could go on and on but really, do yourself a favor and go see this one, whether you're a car fan or not. You'll be caught up in the drama and the fun whether you're a gear head or not! It has something for everyone!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"First of all. Both Bale and Damon did such an amazing job making this movie feel so honest. I was especially impressed with Bale's performance. He made this character so believable and relatable without even saying that much.
Although the trailer makes you think it's all about Ford and Ferrari, the movie is actually the story of Ken Miles. Wich was, in my opinion, much more interesting.
Also the racing scenes where stunning and very cool.
I have only one thing I didn't quite understand..What was Shelby shewing the whole movie long?"
FORD V FERRARI,21 April 2020,10/10,"This movie is truly one of the biggest thing on 2019.
It's so accurate, sharp, so timely, interesting convos, it's beautifully made.
Cast is indeed another thing, I mean, who's not gonna love two legends on screen in such an awesome, action movie. Bale is our treasure and so is Matt too.
For those who have not seen this movie yet, even if you are not a fan of action genre, tou have to see it. It's not some kind of made up tale, it is a history.
Absolutely loved it.
Respect Ken Miles"
FORD V FERRARI,9 March 2020,6/10,"I'm not sure if I'm just missing something, but this is another recent release I was keen to see after rave reviews. I am a car guy and love movies that are set in the era this movie is set, but there was something seriously lacking in this movie. I don't know if it was Bales put on cock way accent or what, but the movie left me feeling extremely unfulfilled. The story itself, which I was not entirely familiar with was OK, but there were some serious flat spots that made me want to turn it off.it also had a very anticlimactic ending, I was hoping they would show the car crash close up, instead it was off screen and in the distance.It was shot well, the race scenes were good, and the set design and streets transformed to the mid 60's was really well done. Matt Damon was great, the standout actually, I was more interested in bales performance but it was lacking something.Still worth a watch, but I would wait until it's on Netflix or something."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2021,9/10,Honestly can't come up with a criticism. Not sure whether it is historically accurate but it is a lot of fun. Great soundtrack and music score too.
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,8/10,"Eventhough it might look like another generic racing movie, Ford v Ferrari is actually a very engaging and emotional story about two people who work against the various obstacles they face in order to achieve their aim. The performances by Christian bale and Matt Damon were top notch and both their characters are throughly fleshed out. The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie. The movie portrays the contrasting perspectives of both these sides quite well. The racing sequences were directed magnificently by Mangold and keeps you at the edge of your seats. It was done primarily using practical effects and very little CGI and its impact is clearly feltThere are a few cliches that we usually see in biopics like this. There are also a few parts where we might find it predictable. But other than that, it's an engaging and excellently crafted movie that keeps you engrossed from the beginning, with well developed characters and a lot of heart"
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2020,7/10,It's an interesting story worth watching even if you're not into racing or cars. It's a marketing lesson.
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,Rarely go to movies unless I have high expectations. I'm also a car nut so I already knew the story. This movie exceeded my expectations and dramatized the story perfectly. The interactions of Damon and Bale kept me glued to my seat along with excellent racing scenes. I never once noticed how long the movie is and now that I'm wished it was longer. Great entertainment!
FORD V FERRARI,31 May 2020,8/10,"Compared with the hot blooded Ford and Ferrari, the human nature struggle, the racing spirit and the bureaucratic corporate culture struggle are the most touching themes."
FORD V FERRARI,4 October 2021,6/10,"I'll admit, Bale and Damon are total miscasts for their roles, but the overall production was excellent enough to carry the movie. Unfortunately, the script is unforgivably bad. It's not so much a movie about characters as it is about stereotypes: about Italians, about southerners from the US, people that work in business - what have you. Christian Bale doesn't seem to have gotten into his character at all and Matt Damon doesn't even really look like he's acting, just putting on an accent. This is one of those movies that will lose a lot of its luster over time once audiences view it away from the hype and any familiarity with its main stars."
FORD V FERRARI,3 March 2020,9/10,"You don't have to go in with any prior knowledge of vehicles, Ford, or racing history. It may help with feeling more attached to the characters but I feel this movie did a great job with character development. Great sound track. Great racing scenes. Great sound effects. Great acting. I went in expecting a boring ""dad movie"" and when the movie ended I had tears in my eyes and I had a whole new appreciation for the sport. It also felt like a nice history lesson. Don't do any prior research to the film and go in with an open mind, and enjoy the amazing performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,10/10,"Good flick, kept my attention the whole way through."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2021,10/10,This is the first movie in a long time I've enjoyed watching from start to finish.
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was tremendously exhilarating, I found myself pumped with energy all the way through. Also, the score... the score kept me going. Beautiful story, which I vaguely knew of, it was perfectly written and executed. That being said, Matt Damon and Christian Bale made the perfect combination, they managed to portray their characters to perfection, they had great chemistry and I hope I get to see them working together again in the future. Once again Bale steals the show, what an actor.
1000% recommended watch. Even if you knew the story or not, this film will give you that thrill. Incredible, very well deserved Oscar nominations!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 September 2020,10/10,Brilliant film and I'm not just saying that because there was a Villa reference in there. Cinematography and direction were brilliant.
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,9/10,"A beautiful story/rivalry very well told. Christian Bale at his best, indeed a Oscar worthy performance. Sets, cars takes you back to late 60s, you get fully immersed into it. Racing sequences are also very well shot, enjoyed it thoroughly. Apart from racing legends Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby, you'll get to see automotive legends Lee Iacocca, Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari. One need not be a car race lover to watch this wonderful movie. Go for it, you'll love it for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,9/10,This movie is great the actors are some of the best in the business imo and they have great chemistry together in screen. I don't know how much of this movie is really true as far as the banter between Henry Ford jr and Carol Shelby but I know the achievements are all true which are great. It couldn't have been any other driver other than Ken Miles. Christian Bale did a great job of playing the part it was sad how he passed because of what he accomplished he will live forever proving Americans can make a super car aka (race car) just as good as the rest of them

FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,9/10,The first half an hour I was thinking how long is this movie. Then I looked back down and an hour and half had passed and was ready for more. You get so involved into the movie the real world melts away. This hasn't happened in a long time. You will be entertained!
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"Interesting story overall, great acting, and a surprise ending for this true story. It would be hard to image non auto racing fans not enjoying this thrill ride."
FORD V FERRARI,13 December 2019,8/10,"This Movie is fantastic, the performance of Christian Bale and Matt Damon is terrific and a very good movie overall. If you're looking for a fast speed car movie or a fast action movie like Transporter or Men In Black: International then this is not for you.
8.5/10"
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,6/10,Good film but should have included more technical focus on the development of the car from the beginning not just cut scenes of them testing the GT.The film included too much drama between Miles and his family for some reason which was not necessary and didn't serve any purpose.
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,Christian bale again did fantastic job.. perfection.. Mat too superbly acted.. cinematography as of original 60's.. music is alluring have listened tracks many times .. you will watch racing scenes again n again.. bet on that..
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,8/10,"In my books, this is one of the best motor racing stories told and I think one of the top 3 movies I have watched in 2019. Even as a person not into Le Mans type racing, the storytelling of the two main characters and how fast cars and racing are presented will envelope you into this obsessive world even if you are not a motorsports fan.With romance, family bond, brotherhood, conflict, success and tragedy in the right amounts coupled with a great script, cast and film-making, this is an extremely potent movie that will make you leave the cinema with multiple spectrum of feelings all at the same time. The umami of great story telling."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! This is what movie theaters were made for! It grabs on & holds you until the very end. Bale & Damon are fantastic together. The sound effects engulf you. I was laughing & crying....it has something for everybody.
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,10/10,"The movie was done really, really good. I enjoyed it very much and i have no cons to disclose. The movie was simply fantastic, and you'll learn a few critical things as well about the history of Ford & Ferrari. Two thumbs up."
FORD V FERRARI,4 July 2020,8/10,"Don't believe in collective honor, it's just a trap to let you lose everything!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 December 2019,10/10,"Well, this is probably the best movie released in 2019. Such a great story, such a great cast and last but not least great cars! Loved every minute at the cinema. Totally worth your money and time. Recommend this to your friends and family and they will be grateful for that."
FORD V FERRARI,5 November 2019,8/10,"Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
FORD V FERRARI,31 May 2020,10/10,"Truly entertaining from start to finish.
Forget the great races, the drama, the story, just Christian Bale doing a Brummie accent - what more could you want?"
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,9/10,"I was trembling after the win at Daytona. I was angry after Le Mans. I went through a lot of emotions watching this movie, and I loved it.
And then there's Christian Bale. This was a Matt Damon movie, you know, till Bale comes on-screen. He swoops in like the thief he is, and steals the screen from Damon!
If you love your car, love how this machine becomes one with you, understands even the little bits of adjustments you make, and obeys, this movie is for you. If you just let your car run free, let it be the master, you will love this movie. Hell, if you don't love cars, I dare say you will love this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"Wow when I heard 2.5 hours, i calculating how many times I could go to the washroom just to take a break. Not once did I get up..not for a minute.
The story, the visuals, the acting..oh Mr. Bale you have to get nominated again and throw one in for Mr. Damon too because their onscreen chemistry was electrifying and super fun. Coming from a female who has no interest in racing cars, this was a joyride in itself, watching the cars go around the track, the speed, the adrenal and Mr. Bale's facial expressions while driving was truly a delight to witness. Thanks for the great ride guys. Loved every moment."
FORD V FERRARI,3 July 2020,8/10,"What a movie!!! Mind blowing. So well made, what can I say about Matt Damon and Christian Bale.. no words are enough. The movie excels in every single aspect. I didn't even notice when I was clutching my own fingers while watching the race And when tears were rolling down my eyes. A must watch."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,8/10,It was a pleasure watching this Adventure 💯 i mean the acting was A great couple hours to watch.. i really loved the racing scenes and Christian bale was really into it like always.. The combination was really interesting ❤
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,"I am no knowing that much about cars history ,but i find this movie to be quite entertaining ,tension of the races is sended to the viewer in form of emotions,adrenalyne,excitment,passion,perfection,work and last but not least the dedication.Americans should be proud of such movie productions ,because this movie teach you so many things ,beside the history parts of it , you can learn what engineers were struggling to work for back in those times ,how races evolvee cars aerodynamics,power,breaks and every single system of the cars.Now i knowed some parts about these from university ,since we learn more about cars construction history and we been told that the races made car producers to evolvee them products due to competivity ,etc.. . So i am glad this movie come out ,and that there can be people who can feel those things , who can understand further the work of an engineer , and how much work those car companies put into developing newer and better cars ,but also show the work behind a succesful company !! is them engineers/workers and dedication.You must not pass over this , is just so delightful to watch it ,even if i didn't had the luck to see races happening real life (in Romania).i still curse those days ,when a high speed circuit was planned to be builded and been canceled! by politics changes and coruption.. .So those who have acces to those things, appreciate the opportunity of taking part to such a race."
FORD V FERRARI,24 March 2020,9/10,"The start of the movie is a little bit boring but the movie only getting better and better and the ending is surprising i can tell u that i enjoy thr races are amazing and u getting more excited and nervous about going to happen.
To conclusion the movie is worth the time and u will enjoy the movie for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,9/10,The whole movie is incredibly awesome. It's never let you feel bored. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's performance were amazing. I didn't think that a car racing type of movie would be this much enjoyable..
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,8/10,"It's not too often that we get to see some familiar faces (or names) on any film title released in recent times. A few examples would include Shia Lebouf (A Transformers Actor from the Bayverse) appearing in The Peanut Butter Falcon, Jesse Eisenberg's appearance in the Zombieland Sequel (For the obvious reason that it's been a whole decade since the first one came out), and Ian Mckellen (For the fact that Flushed Away was the last real big film starring Ian Mckellen).But all of that aside, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon both did exceptionally well portraying both Ford stars that made the GT-40 become the next best thing in Ford Motor Comapny's legacy and popularity. Yet despite the year 1966 for being the second year of the Mustang, the GT-40 was the overall key to victory against Ferrari. The races needed to win were most certainly well-constructed to the point that it acted more like a VR experience than watching an actual race take place.Regardless, however you see this in theaters (Or otherwise), I'd greatly give out a recommendation to this in any way!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,4 July 2020,7/10,"Don't believe in collective honor, it's just a trap to let you lose everything!"
FORD V FERRARI,28 July 2020,9/10,"I am not really into racing, cars, and never was and to be honest first I started watching just because of the renamed actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale,which have a great chemistry together and give the perfect energy to the audience the whole time, and to be honest that is really it about for the cast, the others seem like they are just added for the sake of it, like Ken Miles's wife (Molllie Miles/Caitriona Balfe) and child (Peter Miles/Noah Jupe) both have like 2-3 scenes and that is it, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), the same, and the others are pretty much irrelevant (Character speaking not real actors), but in the end the movie is a biography and it really acts like it. The film from start to end is interesting on a high note because if you don't know anything about racing it doesn't really affects the audience and pretty much explains what needs explaining. The movie has a great energy to it and a true charm and after you finish it it gives you a good ""mood"" like a great storytelling biography should be and if you really paid attention from start to finish you will surely search questions from the real events in the past about racing like I did. In the end, it is surely a recommendation and a nice family movie which will get your mind focused on every aspect, especially if you never watched any race like I did."
FORD V FERRARI,9 March 2021,10/10,"Holy god this movie is amazing, i was entertained throughout by the amazing racing and characters. The plot was interesting and by the end my emotions were everywhere. Christian bales character ken miles is easily one of my favorite characters in cinema, and mat damon's character is amazing also. This story is really unfortunate and it makes me pissed that this happened in real life, screw you ford."
FORD V FERRARI,27 September 2020,8/10,"I really liked this movie.
A movie about passionate people who find ways to do what they love, how they love because they know that those are the things they have to do in their lives. And the movie succeds in making the viewer living this along with the characters.
A special note of appreciation for the way Christian Bale portraits Ken Miles. Really, really liked it."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"I don't write many reviews. Seeing this movie drove me to leave one. Ford v Ferrari exemplifies all that's good about movie-making. We were totally enthralled with the story and it's historical significance. There was no shooting, mayhem or violence. One can walk away and feel proud that it's all about American ingenuity, grit and determination. Bravo to the actors involved. The entire effort ran on all cylinders! We loved it. Thank you."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,10/10,"The Movie is brilliantly edited With an all cast Christian Bale & Matt Damon together its a perfect match for likeness of their characters. Matt Damon has certainly grown as an actor with versatility and we all know Christian Bale Becomes any character he portrays and is well suited to play another amazing man, Ken Miles. I love how they showed us the true Politics of the Motor Industry. Great true story, but as a Ford lover, Ford couldn't see the Forest through the trees! If wasn't for Miles And even then!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,6/10,Story was really good but the editing and scenes seemed out of place. The background music was horrible.
FORD V FERRARI,26 December 2019,7/10,"The movie was pretty good, there is not a ton to really say about it. Lots of fast paced race scenes and a pretty great story about a friendship between two men trying to make one of the fastest race cars of the time.The story kind of dragged at some times but was over all pretty riveting and enjoyable to watch. The acting from all parties was great and I could not ask for a better cast for the film.Something about it just did not grab me and it was not the best movie about race cars I have ever seen but enjoyable enough. Its definitely worth checking out though."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,9/10,"There is a lot of good in this movie but for me by far the best is the performance by Christian Bale. He is faultless in this move, even down to the subtly Brummie twang and expressions. Very believable.The actions keeps you on the edge of your seat and even though you probably know the story beforehand, its delivery is superb."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,7/10,"I am not a car person. I don't like the smell of them, I don't particularly like driving around in them, and I couldn't care less about petty differences between car companies. That being said, Ford v. Ferrari managed to win me over.It took a subject matter I had no interest in and got me invested with endearing characters brought to life by great performances from Bale and Damon. This is a perfect movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon; it's predictable every step of the way, but it leaves you satisfied and even a little sad to say goodbye to these characters you've grown to love.The only other James Mangold directed films I've seen were his two Wolverine films, and while Ford v. Ferrari is no where close to the quality of something like Logan, it does have that same emotionally honest quality that Mangold's other films have. FvF is fun, it's got a good pace to it, and it put a smile on my face. Sometimes the most predictable story is also the most satisfying."
FORD V FERRARI,7 April 2020,10/10,"Taking place in the mid 60's, Ford v Ferrari is an action/drama based on true events. Though the plot has been simplified, it successfully tells the story of how Ford, one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world decides to build a race car to defeat one of the most popular companies known for their fast cars, Ferrari.Car enthusiasts along with racing fans would absolutely love this one. The lead actor duo, Matt Damon and Christian Bale didn't disappoint and stood up to their reputation as one of the best actors in Hollywood. The same goes for the rest of the cast for their believable performances. The director did a great job recreating the look and feel of the 60's and despite having to deal with a lot of characters and events, it seemed like a clean, non-confusing story with a brilliant beginning and ending. The movie has a lot of racing scenes which are bound to get your adrenaline rushing and these scenes are particularly fun to watch.Ford v Ferrari is a really well thought out movie and scores a 10 out of 10 in all areas for me, and I found it to be moving and inspiring and is definitely a must watch for all!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"I love this film!!! I experienced this in 4DX for the first time in Pico Rivera, California. The high price of $20.25 for admission was really worth it. 4DX put me in the driver's seat. This is a cinema technology from Korea that gives motion to a group of seats in the theater. The cinema that I attended had the seats arranged in groups of four. Imagine a roller coaster simulated in a movie theater. The seats also let you feel the rumble of the car engines and lights in the auditorium add the finishing touches such as sparks.Ford v Ferrari is a movie about the Le Mans, France 24 hour race that pitted the Ford Motor company vs. the all-time winner Ferrari. More than that, it is about the friendship between American car engineer Carroll Shelby and the unsung hero English car racer Ken Miles.Have you ever wanted to experience what it's like to be in the pilot's seat of a race car? This is the perfect film to test drive the 4DX system at a theater near you. I recommend it."
FORD V FERRARI,12 April 2021,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a movie which only comes around every once in a while. A movie that educates you on an important event in history, while also taking you through a thrill of a ride. Coming from someone who isn't a big racing fan, not a big fan of racing movies, and doesn't know a lick about cars, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. The racing scenes were awesome, the story was great, and the performances from Bale and Damon were brilliant!This movie will be remembered!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 July 2020,5/10,"... most overrated movies of all times. Unfortunately, people check either 1-star or hype-star reviews, so this one will be missed, although it is realistic.5/10 stars on my list"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"A real movie, with real actors, interpreting real people with all the corporate game behind his back"
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,8/10,"It was more a battle within Ford rather than Ford Vs Ferrari. ""Miles"" would have been a better tribute to this unsung hero of this story. We hardly ever see a Ford Vs Ferrari battle except few scenes of on track race.
From very start it was all about Shelby n Miles duo who brought fame to Ford n how Ford internal politics played out.
Le Mans '66 is much valid title but Ford v Ferrari is a commercial title for this movie.
Bale did wonderful as always, excellent character development.
Over all movie is superb, my only gripe is with the title."
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,10/10,I just went out with my wife from the movie theater. This movie blew us away. The story taken from actual fact is incredible and exciting. the speed scenes are superb I felt like I was sitting next to Christian Bale. It's a movie to see it is a must !!
FORD V FERRARI,15 December 2019,10/10,"This movie would win the Academy Award for Best Picture and Christian Bale and Matt Damon (whom I personally can't stand) would win for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. I saw it in the theater and it was a rare movie treat. See it in the theater while you can."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,9/10,"The movie Le Mans '66 is based on a actual happened story. In a nutshell, the Ford motor company was in the market to buy Ferrari in the early 60's However Ferrari utilized the offer of Ford to get an even better offer from FIAT. An unexpected strategic move which pissed off Henry Ford II in that way, he wanted to take revenge on Ferrari by beating their cars on the black side where Ferrari was dominant for years in a row. So therefore the race engineering group Shelby got involved in order to design and construct the perfect race-car which is able to put an end to Ferrari and its years of overwhelming victory force.
The key-players in this movie are Matt Damon who plays Shelby and Christian Bale who plays Ken Miles.
Le Mans 66 is showing in a somehow funny way how the Ford GT40 was re-invented and perfected for racing at Daytona and finally Le Mans. Funny to see how racing was done back in the good old days and how things got so changed throughout the years. For instance: the pitlane was not separated by a big wall at Le Mans, but was actually on the racetrack. Safety features such as.....which safety features??! In those days racing cars were designed with paper and pencil and constructed with hammer and screwdrivers, no robotics or any micromanagement tooling. Analysis of race data was done by engineers and racing drivers, not computers.
In the movie Le Mans 66 you feel like you are actually in the 60's. You feel the power of a 7ltr engine, the adrenaline rush of the drivers you can taste yourself. The only thing missing is the smell of gasoline and of exhausts. I say: Great movie!!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,8/10,"As someone who enjoys motorsports and LeMans racing in particular I was very eager to see this film. As far as historical accuracy, they just about nailed everything except for the Rolex 24 scene which is set in Daytona, Florida but was filmed at the LA area Auto Club Speedway. This makes sense and isn't a huge issue unless you are a racing fanatic such as myself. As for Ford V Ferrari, at times you really forget that Ferrari are the main antagonists. Ford V Shelby would be a more accurate albeit less marketable title. My issues with the film are that runtime is a little long and few scenes are somewhat cringy(Miles and his wife driving down the road and Miles and Shelby getting into a fight). Its Hollywood so you expect it but the movie could have done without both of those 2 scenes. Still as far as movies about motorsports and sports in general this sets the standard."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,10/10,"I really enjoyed the movie. The racing scenes are awesome and exhilarating. The Ken Miles scenes are funny and enjoyable. I felt sad when he died in the end. The fistfight between Shelby and Miles made me laugh out loud in the theater. I heard some other laughs in the audience. I'm surprised that I understood it, since I don't know much about Le Mans (I'm an F1 mega fan). The scenes with Mollie and Peter are also nice. I especially enjoyed it because I watched it with my dad (another motorsport fan). The jokes are also enjoyable, even if they aren't meant to be jokes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale acted well. My favorite scenes were the ones where after Miles drove a car, he'd go into some mega explaining mode about how the car needs to be improved. He'd say things like ""Oh, the steering is too loose,"" or ""The engine needs to be bigger,"" or ""The car is way too damn heavy!"" Those made me laugh a lot. I recommend this to anyone 13 and up. Really cool. Loved it."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,10/10,"This movie can't get better.
A Must watch.
So stop wasting time by reading the comments and watch it ASAP"
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,10/10,You will surely be amazed by performance of Christian Bale; Matt Damon was brilliant as well. You should definitely watch.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"Thrilling at times and tender in moments. Incredible racing scenes and with great visuals and audio. I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and he would not have been my first choice for Shelby, but after viewing the film I cannot say that he wasn't the right choice. The acting was spot on and the story was well told. Likely my favorite racing movie of all time. Entertaining and moving"
FORD V FERRARI,11 March 2020,10/10,It's just amazing you won't regret watching it even second of it will inspire you and give you goosebumps .
FORD V FERRARI,17 March 2020,10/10,"If you are expecting it as those fast and furious series with racing just meant Vin Diesel you are welcome to get out .
But it's a movie which really meant to racing not any stunt to impress someone it's an inspiring story and it will give you chills at every moment of race in it .
It depicted the unsung legend Ken Miles who expired even before getting popular and his talent just reminded a history .One this is for sure you will get really inspired after watching it just go if you haven't watched this superb depiction of this legendary racer."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,1/10,"Disrespectful towards Italians; the writing around Ferrari is just like about Super Mario tbh; poor, cheesy, childish; maybe Hollywood should keep its mediocre movies made exclusively for patriotic and nationalistic reasons, to Americans only. Also, I thought Bale was exquisite playing the mad boxer part a while back, which earned him an Oscar - he tries the same here, but soulless. Should have the option to give it zero."
FORD V FERRARI,6 February 2020,9/10,"My review for Ron Howard's ""Rush"" enthusiastically placed it at the top of the heap for ""racing genres"" if that is such a thing. That film was excellent even if you are not a racing fan.Well now that I have seen ""Ford vs Ferrari"", I am having a difficult time choosing which one is better. I'm going to lean towards Ford v Ferrari because of the performance by Christian Bale as it is fresh in my mind and certainly a great character and acting job. I love his rebelliousness and genuine love for the machine...the way he communicates with it intuitively as if it was alive, Iis great stuff. At first I didn't think Matt Damon was cast well for the part of Carroll Shelby. From what I know (and I did meet him once) he was more of an outspoken cowboy, but I have to say Damon was excellent and his performance grew on me. Not as good as Bale who stole the show, but still excellent. The Lee Iacocca character was also slightly miscast but still, a very entertaining performance.I liked how the period corporate culture of the US car industry was portrayed, with strong personalities and business practices of that era. It was especially entertaining when the Ford boys were they trying to match wits against Enzo Ferrari.As to the racing and car stuff, it was great. Period authenticity was respected even in the scenes in France. The growling soundtrack and sweeping score just works. I enjoyed the innovative camera work of the racing scenes. The Ford GT40 was a miracle of brute American know-how against the refined Italian machinery of the legendary Ferraris.Based on factual history (with a little artistic license thrown in), the story is compelling and left me very satisfied.In my opinion, ""Rush"" and ""Ford V Ferrari"" are the two best racing movies ever."
FORD V FERRARI,27 December 2019,10/10,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not even a car guy. Not even a fan of racing, but this movie although a bit lengthy was good. Everybody turns in a remarkable performance and you forget you're watching a movie for awhile there. Would watch again every once in awhile."
FORD V FERRARI,8 April 2020,10/10,This is action packed and also something many of us can relate to. Hidden potential that is suppressed by others....
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,3/10,"I kind of, sort of, walked out of this movie. Not because it was terrible or anything but I just didn't care about the characters. The movie also wasn't very ""cinematic"" although I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that. Now, I am not interested in racing but if you compare this movie to Rush, a movie I waited to see because I wasn't interested in the subject matter, it's night and day. I really enjoyed Rush. It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.The thing that bothered me most was Bale's performance and it might be the worst I've ever seen him do, although that's a pretty high bar. He plays a caricature of someone, not an actual character. And he ruins it for me because the whole family dynamic is awkward. There's 0 chemistry and it doesn't seem real in the least. I couldn't take him or the movie seriously. The scene when his wife is swerving all over the road and yelling at him was weird and out of nowhere. The son barely says a word.The movie is way too long. Every scene seemed to be the same after two hours. Let's have more shots of Matt Damon's character standing in front of the sun. Let's start every scene out with some classic guitar playing for nostalgia's sake to get you excited. The only good scene was when Bale's character talks about the perfect lap, that's it."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,8/10,"One of the contenders for the 2020 Oscars is a sympathetic film by the acclaimed director James Mangold about car racing, and which, important to note, fortunately has nothing to do with the ""Fast and Fury"" series.The title of the film was changed to ""Le Mans 66"" in most countries where it is shown outside the US, although the original name is more appropriate, because the historical facts in the film have been adjusted and amplified, in order to highlight as much as possible the rivalry between two large factories, different in every sense, and first of all in terms of conceptions and philosophies in general, when it comes to cars and the automobile industry.
Either way, both titles are certainly better than the original ""Go Like Hell"" when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were reportedly considered for potential lead roles.
This is how we get a very watchable movie, with excellent chemistry between the main actors, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that, once it starts, can easily be turn a blind eye for all its imperfections.There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing. Wishing only that other films seen in competition for this year's Film Academy Awards are more like that."
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2020,7/10,"Let me start off by saying I think Ford is garbage, and the most boring, plain Jane looking cars out there to this day. Of course I'd love to own a Ferrari; who wouldn't?!
This movie has a pretty good cast, but as usual, the most versatile actor today steals the show. Christian Bale can transform into any role/character, and make you believe he's the real deal!
The cars were really cool, and the racing was pretty realistic! I like anything based on true events, and I think this movie did a pretty good job telling the story of Ford teaming up with Shelby to win Lemans, and beat out Ferrari."
FORD V FERRARI,22 August 2021,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari is an adrenaline packed adventure based on a true story. Starring Christian Bale as racecar driver Ken Miles alongside Matt Damon as Caroll Shelby. One of the things i loved the most about Ford v Ferrari were the technical aspects, specifically the sound editing which it won an oscar for and the cinematography. They matched the tone of the movie extraordinarily well as they were utilised extremely well during the fast paced racing scenes. Both Bale and Damon delivered spectacular, mesmerizing performances filled with raw emotion. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, no matter their movie preferences. I would have to say this is indeed a must watch picture.."
FORD V FERRARI,28 May 2021,9/10,"Awesome movie that ties history into a plot that grabs the audience.Like all true stories, there has to be death, and for that reason, I rated it a 9.This story should of been told sooner in the 90s or late 80s. But I guess it took ford 50 years to get another win another race, at the le mans.It makes me have a better appreciation for ford, even though I hated Ford.I was raised on big block chevys, but had a admiration for ferarri in the early 90s thanks to Michael Schumacher.Enjoyed the story but the only ford ill ever consider buying is the gt40 mk2.Your right though ken miles you are right a car only opens up at 7000 rpms.Ken miles one of the biggest underdog to beat a well known winner.Also we use wedges in a rain races in nascar, Ken miles thought of that 😳 🤔 🙄 😬 😀 🤣I like how Christian bale took his role in this movieWell doneMatt Damon was good too.Just saying a movie for either Schumacher seasons up and downs or a story about Dale Earnhardt would get sales."
FORD V FERRARI,12 October 2020,8/10,"A good movie. True story based. 1960's set. When Ford motor company chief Henry Ford II could not simply buy everything and when he got insulted by an Italian, the game starts. Corporate lessons(brand identity, partnership, management committee), passion by technocrats and many important aspects of speed of car vs it's machinery were painted well. Also, strong bonding of humans portrayed well: Wife, child and friends. Art direction is also impressive. Then.. Christian Bale tranforms himself for each role. Even his moving silhouette itself defines a new character in each motion picture."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,7/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is a good, fun movie for those of us who like cars. It's got a good story, great camera work, and is well paced. Caitriona Belfe was perfectly cast, and so was Christian Bale. The one criticism I had was that several performances were easy; it didn't feel like some of the performances really had to reach that far, didn't have to extend themselves into the roles that much, just sort of going through the motions. The car(s) ultimately felt like the star of the movie, plural because there are plenty of nice car eye candy throughout. Again, I enjoyed this movie, it was fun and satisfying, and had some good funny moments."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"There are movies that give you 100% of what you expected and there are movies which exceed expectations in every way possible and blow your mind away. Documenting the le Mans race of '66, this team has delivered a vintage classic that is as classy as a scotch straight out of the cask after maturing for decades!Set up in the 60's, the Ford Motor Company is in pursuit of a new design that will take them back to the glory days. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) gets a path-breaking idea from his marketing team to design a Race Car, like the legendary Ferrari. After failing in an attempt to buy out Ferrari which is broke, Ford decides to build a race car on its own and commissions Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) for the job. Shelby takes the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer who is struggling to make both ends meet. While Miles's addition to the team adds tremendous improvement to the design, the Marketing Head Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) wants him out of the team. How Shelby and Miles manage to achieve the American dream of winning against a Ferrari at le Mans is the remaining plot.What fascinates the audience is that the movie starts like a documentary and picks up pace in no time to make everyone watch it literally at 7000rpm. Whether a person is into cars or not, the detailing given to every aspect of a race car and how it is tested and done is prone to give a 'car-gasm'. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will definitely be serious contenders for the Oscars along with Leonardo Di Caprio, Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix this year. Their transformation into the role is top class. Another noteworthy character is Josh Lucas portraying Leo Beebe. While he is pure evil as a personality, he is a pure genius at what he does and how he gets it done. Thank God for this is just not a 1hr30mins affair. The movie runs for a good 2hrs32mins and it was still not enough.Pure Gold!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,8 March 2020,10/10,"This kept my interest all the way thru. Even spiced up and glamorized for Hollywoods sake never caused me once to say as I always do ""C'mon, I mean really""... except maybe when Henry Ford II started balling like a baby. Hard to understand Bales English accent at times still wasn't even to much a bother since you were already so gripped in the movie by then. Damon pulled off the perfect car guy character and Fords top henchmen pulled off their roles as well. Very watchable movie and I know you will enjoy it too. Worth the watch."
FORD V FERRARI,5 February 2021,4/10,"One would think that with this kind of production budget and stellar cast this film would spark, but the storytelling was bloodless and unoriginal and more than 60 minutes into the movie I still didn't care about the characters."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"Because I am not. However, I enjoyed it fully.Because at its core, it is a universal principle: go after what you believe, you can and will do it. Don't take short cut and don't regret.This is a inspirational movie for everyone, everyone wants to do something out of ordinary. Totally recommend it."
FORD V FERRARI,4 March 2021,8/10,"Loved It. Loved it! I LOVED IT!!
Watch this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,24 October 2020,10/10,"I don't think I've ever given a 10 for a film, or if I have, very rarely. This film is guaranteed to have you glued to the edge of your seat! Matt Damon and Christian Bale play wonderfully off each other, both showing they are at the top of their acting game! I can't remember when I last enjoyed a film this much. The rest of the cast were perfect too with fantastic portrayals of corporate greed and arrogance from the Ford Executives and superb nuanced performances from Catriona Balfe and Noah Jupe as Ken Miles' wife and son. This is really a film not to be missed. Everyone from petrolheads to Mums can't fail to be enthralled!"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,7/10,"Ford v Ferrari has a lot of positive things, altough it didn t surprised me at all as an entire film. The movie explains with all the details the story we went to see but does not show us almost nothing emotionally related to the main characters, and that is unacceptable having Christian Bale and Matt Damon on stage. I had much better expectations"
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,9/10,Jeff Daniels. I keep mistaking the two. I would've bet money this was Jeff Daniels.
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,7/10,Its fun and all but it lacks the real story and the tension.. thats where it lacks.. it's fun.. but.. not accurate.. if u can get me
FORD V FERRARI,16 January 2020,10/10,"What a great movie this was! It has been some time since I felt so excited while watching a movie. It is simply great, no wonder why it was nominated, I hope it wins! GO WATCH IT! Superb!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"As a petrol head I suppose I'm biased and although I wouldn't have chosen the two main actors in their roles I'm so glad they did as both were just brilliant. From start to finish it was telling the story but without any frills bells or whistles. It's a story of friendship and passions when a lump of metal with a beautiful sounding engine grips you and becomes part of your life. The photography was as it should be and wonderfully put together. I saw this at an I MAX sitting at the back and with accompanying soundtrack made my day. I'm sure the purists will find fault somewhere but for me seeing a picture like this, in this format is what it's all about and ticked all of my boxes."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,10/10,If you saw this Movie With IMax sound you know exactly why i am giving this 10 stars
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"I am not a racecar fan, not a criticism. But with such a great cast, I was intrigued to know more about this story. A truly wonderful film, entertaining, inspiring, moving, and truly exciting. My opinion, easily the Best Picture of the Year, deserves the Oscar ..... I couldn't believe how long the film is, it went by so quickly and yet clocks in at well over two hours. I hope you enjoy it too! anthony plumer, portland oregon"
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,Thrilling. The engines roar and your heart pounds. Excellent acting by Chris nolan and Matt. Outstanding making of the movie.
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,6/10,"A happy go lucky (aside from the ending) movie about Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby and their quest to make and race a car to beat Ferrari's dynasty at Le Mans.The movie was definitely enjoyable. Great true story, great acting by Damon and Bale and it was brightly shot. The way it was shot actually reminded me a lot of Green Book.I did have some issues with it. I thought the way the story was told was really straight forward and lacked any depth. I would have liked to see more of Ferrari's perspective, I thought Ken Miles family dialogue didn't feel very important to the story, I thought, outside of Tracy Letts, the supporting cast fell way short.So, while it was an easy watch despite its 2.5 hour run time, it lacked depth to bring it from a fun movie to a great movie."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2020,8/10,"The most disappointing thing is that reality is always played by dark human nature and corrupt systems.The most striking thing is the fate of the racing driver who always explores the edge of death.There was a moment when I turned from a world-weary attitude, and the next moment, the brakes failed, the explosion, and the loss of a permanent racer. Beautiful fantasy drivers transcend the reality of winning or losing, to gain their own peace and achievement, not to fall into the secular arena of human nature."
FORD V FERRARI,29 May 2020,9/10,"Everything is fine about this film. The plot, the screenplay , cinematography and the acting. Surely Christian Bale steal the show. Big thumbs up to Ford vs Ferrari."
FORD V FERRARI,22 May 2020,9/10,I am amazed how good this film is. Saw it two days in a row at home. Must have been even more awesome in a theater. The missing star is cause of the last minute of the movie when we was told what happened to Ken long after the race was finished. A totally unnecessary let down.Don't mind the people who give this movie low rating because of some personal issue they have with a wrong colored lug nut.
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,10/10,"What an awesome evening I just experienced! Drawn into the music, scenery, old time 70's feel which is and will always be the best movie era of movie making period!
All the perfect flowing racing, chivalry, the cars in that era and of course beat on acting. I can't say enough and won't anymore, just watch the movie and zone out to just yourself and you'll have flashbacks to your own era if you were around in them years.
Way to go to everyone who made this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,10 June 2020,9/10,"Wasn't expecting such fun bundled along with package, I laughed along with this more times than I remember than any other movie I've seen on the last 12 months. Maybe it's the British sense of humour in Bale's portrayal of Miles.. I don't know, I just really enjoyed it. Not knowing the history of the story kept me engrossed throughout. And for those picking fault at the accents Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe used. Try growing up in the West Midlands. I did and still live here and I got the accents right away. Pretty damn close to how they sound around here if you ask me.Can't believe the words yampy is now in at least 2 movies 😂A great way to spend an evening."
FORD V FERRARI,27 February 2020,7/10,As it has an expected plot the screenplay should have been different.Also in terms of the philosophy it doesn't have is great there. It's more of a homage to the greats of the racing world.
FORD V FERRARI,17 April 2020,9/10,"I'll be honest, I'm rarely emotional watching movies. Somehow this proved to be an excellent, worthwhile exception. You can almost smell the gasoline and burning tire in the race sequences. Matt Damon and Bale outdo themselves bringing the characters to life. The cinematography is marvellous, and low cameras, zoomed in faces and out of focus long shots bring depth and perspective to scenes.A visual tour de force well worth enjoying."
FORD V FERRARI,20 April 2020,6/10,"With the actors in this movie, I thought it would be better. Bale and and Damon are always enjoyable but the script was lacking and all the other characters were cut out cardboards. Balfe was wasted as Bales's wife. You could have plug and played anyone in that role. The Ford executives were one dimensional with Josh Lucas' character playing the villain of sorts. We never know his motives except for being a jerk. Overly predictable in terms of how the characters would act. Could have been done so much better."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"This is the best movie of the year thus far. Best movie on cars and racing. Brilliant script brilliantly done by brilliant performances of cast and crew. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Editing nominations for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,15 December 2019,10/10,"This is why I go to the movies. James Mangold has always been a favorite Writer/Director of mine and he delivers perfectly with this 'buddy' movie about one of the greatest drivers of all time with one of the greatest car designers of all time. Bale and Damon are spot on , though it's hard for me to decide which one turned in the best performance, because, as of this writing, Bale has locked the Golden Globe and SAG nominations. The rest of the cast just added to the incredible story of Ford taking on Ferrari at the 24 Hours of LeMans.
For racing enthusiasts, this is pure adrenaline, several scenes during the race sequences that made me jump back in my seat. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is amazing. There is a scene where Miles (Bale) takes his son out to the LAX runway and explains to him the perfect lap. It was such a touching scene (it plays later in the movie) because of the way Papamichael lit it. It sent chills down my back.
In conclusion, a must see film for anyone, racing enthusiast or not. One of the best race films ever and one of the best pictures of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,15 December 2019,9/10,James Mangold captures the race vertigo - in and out the track - in a unique exciting way. Bale and Damon are awesome!
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"I live 70 miles from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Our yearly family gathering from Orlando, KY & NE come for the Indy 500, NOT Christmas like most families, so YES, we're race fans. I saw this opening night with my son & 11yo grandson who could say ""Helio Castroneves"" clearly before he could say ""oatmeal."" From the beginning, it shows the thrill of those who truly live & love the sport and ONLY stop driving when they must yet stay involved in whatever way they can to BETTER IT, using their unique talents, come hell or high water. Does age stop them? Nah, not when you have the needed talent and a friend who believes in you...BUT even he also has to bow to ""corporate culture"" at times to get to where he ultimately wants to be. He knows he'll be ABLE to. He just has to wait for HIS right moment. You'll LOVE IT when he does! It makes you realize if you have special talents, you may need to wait for the right moment to make your move for success to come but then it will. What IS success in the end?"
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,10/10,"If you love cars you know who Carroll Shelby is but not so many will know who Ken Mills is. Ken Mills deserves a movie of just him he was an extra ordinary driver in his early races (not part of movie) he would be so far infront when come in for a pit stop he would have a cup of tea as well. His love of a good cup of tea is part of the movie.
I never expected this movie to make me laugh so much, cry so much and want to punch someone in the face so much it was a real roller coast of emotions.
The acting, the script and the racing scenes where second to none 2 of my all time hero's were done proud"
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,"Get your popcorn ready kids, cause you're in for a ride.
It was like watching the actual ""le mans 66""i was cheering like it was a live broadcast running on tv.
bale and damon, the new dynamic duo to appear on screen,bearing crazy resemblance to their characters they exceed expectations with their acting as well.
I've done my research yes, the film is as accurate as an arrow, with a bit of sprinkles on top they made it possible.
Definitely a huge oscar contender this year with its fascinating cast and crew delivering an absolute treat for the viewers.
The story of the decade that everyone should know about."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,8/10,"This is a movie and not a documentary. A documentary is primary a source of information. A movie is primary a source for intertaning. Movies will dramatize and change the story for better intertaning.
I recommend this movie but if your really interested in Ford versus Ferrari check some out some documentary's or even better a number of books that are available."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"I hate car racing but this long movie - nearly 3 hours - held me fixed to the screen. Superb acting, astounding cinematography and a great story made it worth every cent.And the cars; this was a time when cars were not seen as being evil as climate alarmists tell us but both works of art and amazing bits of machinery. But the real essence of this story were the men who built and raced the cars.I recently wrote a review for the reboot of Charlie's Angels which was filled with snowflake issues and PC writing. A fun franchise had been ruined. Ford v Ferrari however demonstrates that Hollywood can still put out a great movie which hasn't been ruined by woke points of view. There were no little girls competing with the men in this incredibly tough occupation and boy did the movie benefit from that. Carroll Shelby, played by Damon and Bale as Ken Miles, both legends of racing and cars were spot on in a masterfully directed bit of recent history. Having said that Catriona Balfe was superb as Bale's wife.One of the year's best."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"Wow, this movie is looooooong
Some good acting.
Saw it today in an X screen (wrap around) which didn't really add to what's a good movie already.
Some characters seem a bit contrived but that aside a good set of acting from Damon and Bale"
FORD V FERRARI,3 October 2020,7/10,It's a fun movie to watch with an amazing sound edition. The story it's well placed and the acting it's just great. A very fun movie to watch.
FORD V FERRARI,16 July 2020,9/10,"This movie is fantastic; beautifully acted by Bale and Damon, it does a remarkable true story justice. The main characters are well written and likable (particularly Ken Miles, played by Bale), and it builds up to the climax brilliantly. One of the best movies from a great year for film.
Rating: 8.6/10"
FORD V FERRARI,19 August 2020,7/10,While I watching this movie i was so excited. Because i know how is the true race and its pressure.
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,9/10,Best movie for wining oscar.superb movie.really awesome.great job
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Without any spoiler and long talk, this is the movie of the year. Go watch it if you haven't already"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,7/10,"Bales got a strong English accent and his boil on his eyeball has gotten considerably large, but he's solid as all hell along with Damon. Fast cars. Worth the watch."
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,10/10,One of the best movie I have saan In my life.Superb Acting awesome cinematography great story drementious screenplay I mean to say everything is fantastic.Must watch for everyone.
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,7/10,"The usual ""Hollywood"" style rise and fall arc won't let you stop from appreciating this beautifully shot race wars film."
FORD V FERRARI,20 September 2021,10/10,Mind blowing movie. I don't have words to explain this blockbuster biopic. Bollywood should learn.
FORD V FERRARI,10 August 2020,10/10,Firstly I'm a car fanatic. This movie deserves a 10. Acting by both Shelby and Kyle (Christian Bale: his acting is brilliant and mind blowing). They gave each other space to be themselves and push themselves and also to be creative and design the best Ford ever. I will watch this movie over and over and over. It deserves many awards.
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2020,9/10,"High in racing sequences...! Great acting..! Christian bale killed it..🔥🔥🔥
Great movie...!"
FORD V FERRARI,30 March 2021,10/10,"This film is more than just cars.You can literally relate it to any field.This is not a race of cars. It's race of victory.Dayum I loved this film.And if you're a car lover, you'll be intoxicated with this movie.I recommend this to everybody whether or not you like cars because like I told you, this film is not just cars. It's more to it. You'll get what I'm saying once you see it."
FORD V FERRARI,21 January 2020,9/10,"I couldn't care less about auto racing, but this movie had me from the first scene to the last.
Damon and Bale are fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"Playing out the real life story of how Henry Ford the 2nd vowed to get revenge on Ferrari after a failed takeover bid that left him feeling humiliated, so decides to crush the Italian team at the infamous 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race.Note : In the UK, the film title is 'Le Mans '66.This story has been told by Amazon Prime's 'The grand Tour' too, and they had the good sense to keep it short to around fifteen minutes and included more technical information that this movie lacked, which would have helped to build a more rounded picture, this picture is aimed at appealing to motor racing fans in general, technical information is part and parcel of being a fan, it is not solely about the drivers, this film feels dumb down a little too much for it's own good.The film, good presentation and accurate feel, Matt Damon plays the part of a man forced to give up racing due to ill health and focus on something else related quite well, Christian Bale is excellent as rough around the edges racer Ken Miles, it is nice to see Jon Bernthal as something other than a brutal thug that he is often cast as, Caitriona Balfe provides an excellent supporting role.However, the film is too long at two and a half hours, a good twenty minutes could have been cut from this without removing from the core story, the relationship between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is the core focus at the expense of the more important finer details, such as the film's main protagonist Ferrari and his team of drivers, and instead pays attention to the boring politic's of Ford's executives, namely Leo Beebe trying to win the race his way when Carroll actually knows what needs to be done.Overall the film is good, but it is something better enjoyed at home rather than a movie theatre, I don't regret going to see it, but I was not blown away by it either."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing acting, story and adrenaline. Absolutely brilliant movie . Do not hesitate to watch it! It is worth it every second 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
FORD V FERRARI,20 December 2019,10/10,"I don't care about the historical accuracy. I'm not a big racing fan. I saw this movie at the request of spending a birthday with family. WOW. Bale is beyond amazing. Damon is excellent but Bale had a better character to portray. If he doesn't win an Oscar, he's been robbed. This movie is not what you expect and it's superb."
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,9/10,"Like "" The Worlds Fastest Indian "" this film really has some heart . For any fans of motor sport its a given you will enjoy this film . For anyone else there is plenty to keep you engaged and entertained . The racing scenes are exciting and spectacular while the human interaction is warm and honest . Loved it ."
FORD V FERRARI,26 January 2020,10/10,"Must see racing movie. James Mangold brillant film making , amazing character performances from Bale and Damon ( Bale in particular, becomes Ken Miles, he is Ken Miles, it's astonishing how he does that every movie) , nerve wracking racing sequences , terrific sound track - sound editing & mixing...make this a wonderful movie about racing...and surprisingly what's more is the heft of human drama that actually hits u hard more than the racing itself....Mangold has made the impossible, making a racing movie that will be cherished by motorheads and loved by the regular movie lovers as well...Iam giving it 10 ."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,8/10,"Bale and Damon perfectly helm their roles and James Mongold brilliantly brings the tension and excitement of racing to the big screen.
Whether you are a car enthusiast or not this film is a must see this year."
FORD V FERRARI,8 July 2020,10/10,"When you watch a good movie, the movie still runs in your veins after its over, the words run in your head.I could feel Ken Miles and understand the struggle Shelby made. Once the movie started , it just kept getting better and better and knowing that its based on a real story - getting to audience to feel what a man felt years ago is nothing short of extraordinary.I dont want to say much. But after interstellar this is one movie that is worthy of your time and attention."
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2020,10/10,"I have no idea how much of it was just pure Hollywood fiction, but the movie was well made.And contained perfect examples why I hate corporate pen pushers."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,This is by far the best movie of 2019. A movie worth going to see on the big screen. Great acting!!!
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,9/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is one of the best movie ever made. It's an almost perfect Movie. If you've not watched yet, stop reading this and go watch this 2hr 32min race. I don't know much about racing car things or how those race happen, but i really enjoyed the movie. It feels like I'm inside the car driving with Ken miles(Christian bale). Music and BGM is perfect. One of the few Recent movies with perfect ost. It's based on true events which makes the movie even better. Christian bale (ken miles) steals the show . Matt Damon is also exceptionally good. The real champion is ken miles. Definitely a must watch movie. Please go watch the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,8/10,"American films tend to sing glories to the achievements of their citizens and in this case, an Englishman is involved in the ultimate success of an adventure to beat the top representative of speed and quality in car races.Undoubtedly Matt Damon and Christian Bale give their best -as usual- in their performance, but Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee happens to steal the show from them as the corrosive, hypocrite, and false villain of the narration. He becomes THE MAN ONE LOVES TO HATE and in top form, indeed.The whole atmosphere of a gripping script is enhanced with his presence and the way he shows how he can plan underground strategies to try to sink Ken Miles, but in the end -and even if he humiliates Miles- the spectator ends with a bitter flavour remembering his presence.KUDOS for such a superb piece of acting, Mr. Lucas."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"The movie was well made and from that I have read, mostly historically accurate. It had great actors, the ferrari's looked gorgeus along with the other cars. If some parts of the races were cgi (most likely some were) they weren't recoqnisable.It felt a bit off that the Italians were clearly made out to be the bad guys, with the drivers facial expressions among other things. Also we didn't see anything from Ferrari outside the racing scenes. I also would have really liked to see a bit of the cars design process, but no, the car just suddenly appeared out of no where and then we went on from that fixing the problems it had. Miles's wife's sudden mental breakdown in their car also felt off and was a bit strange. The movie generally left a lot of stuff unexplained, even though it was 2,5h long. Every time when the cars were racing music was playing in the background, I would have liked to have sometimes only hear the cars engines with no music."
FORD V FERRARI,21 March 2020,10/10,"Before i thaught this movie might be moderate but my thaught was wrong,this movie stole every body's attention from its begining till its end.. Dont miss it.."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"The movie does an amazing job keeping you at the edge of your seat when the races are on, it has a very good development and Christian Bale does an amazing job. The movie builds an amazing climax due to the races and even if you aren't acquainted to race cars, you are going to love this great proposal of James mangold."
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,9/10,"Ford and Ferrari have certainly seen great competition in the history of the car race. Christian Bale (Kane Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) both had hard work and perseverance. Kane Miles worked hard for 24 Hours of Le Mans, great support from Shelby team and Ford company, family support. Ferrari made the mistake of underestimating the Ford company and once again proved not to judge a book by its cover."
FORD V FERRARI,20 February 2020,8/10,"Christian Bale as Ken Miles was an excellent choice for film makers .
A masterpiece that right from the beginning has a strong screenplay and the cinematography and editing are above par . Ford v Ferrari ~ a 7000 RPM blockbuster that would make you feel energetic and motivated , however i bit sadistic !!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 May 2020,9/10,"This movie was exciting to watch with a constant build-up of action and triumph. I don't believe it did the death of Ken Miles enough justice, but I don't mind as it kept a constant plot and tone throughout the film."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2020,5/10,"An unnecessarily long, average movie with Christian Bale! and looks like ""Ford v Ken Miles"" would be a much better title."
FORD V FERRARI,20 April 2020,6/10,"Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,9/10,Since I had just visited the Henry Ford Museum I decided to check this out even though I knew very little about racing. It was phenomenal. Everyone in the cast is just perfect and the soundtrack will get your heart pumping. I'd love to see it as an Oscar contender.
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,7/10,"Let's get the negatives quickly out of the way. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this one and some play major parts in the story. But it is quite impossible to cram 5 or more years of reality, into 150 minutes of film. So, it is a pass for me.What i really didn't like though, was the racing/action scenes. There wasn't any sense of speed in them. Instead there was a lot of camera trembling, sped-up shots and cgi. That was a real let down in a film that has a car as one of the main protagonists.On the other hand the actors were all brilliant. From the main man (Damon), to the bad guy (Lucas), to the daredevil (Bale) everyone added significant parts to plot and character development.The plot was going to be good because the real story had all the ingredients for a Hollywood movie. Danger, emotion and underdog status, along with the sad story of a man capable of greatness, but always on the out of the corporate new world.And last but not least, the cars were simply fantastic. The Cobras, Mustangs and GT40s from Ford, alongside the main opposition in the Ferrari 330 P3. Majestic!
Even if you know the story or don't, petrolhead or not, it is a very well made film that you have to see."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,7/10,"Let me preface this by saying that I am quite a car guy. Not the type whose entire life revolves around cars, but I own a sports car and enjoy the odd track day. This means suspending my disbelief in a car movie is always a hard thing...... but this movie certainly doesn't make it easy! For a car-movie aimed at car people, it was strange to find it packed with inaccuracies and car cliches. The idea that a car explodes whenever it rolls or makes contact with a hard object had finally died in most of Hollywood's mainstream products. Why bring it back in a car-movie?Here are a few others:
-Ken's car seems to be so fast that he can catch up from with everybody whenever he decides to. Why isn't he winning in the first place?
-There's this cliche that racers can overtake each other in a straight line by deciding to press the throttle harder. Again, why aren't they already doing that?
-Brake fade and braking points obviously don't happen that way, and swapping out a knuckle assembly to cool the brakes is like buying a new phone because the home button is dead (oh wait...). Ford did come up with a quick brake-change solution (which almost every new car uses), but it looked nothing like this.
-the 7000rpm ramble present from the opening lines of the movie (and the movie's overall interpretation of RPM) is rather detached from reality. Different engine architectures behave differently at different RPMs, trying to pin that on a single value is strange and unneeded
-Sorry but car guys would never use ""her"" to refer to their automobile! It's not a ship!With that out of the way, on to the movie stuff:
-the writing team tries very hard to make the story overly dramatic, by utilizing lazy writing tricks (the Daytona bet, for example), which really shouldn't be necessary considering how fascinating the base story already is
-Christian Bale is a very good actor, but he really overdoes the Ken Miles character. There is close to no footage of the actual guy, so he had the opportunity to build whatever character and mimics he felt like. Why he chose to go so incredibly over the top (both in accentuation and behavior) is beyond me
-There's a lot of CG going on during the races. Quite a lot. It is not badly executed, but was it really necessary? There are historic races at Le Mans they could have taken footage from rather than leave us in the uncanny valleyIt's not all bad though. The story's a highly interesting one, and Matt Damon's performance is very good. His relationship with Ken Miles is touching, and having them compete against their own headquarters makes for a great double-sided challenge. And while the production's runtime is on the longer side of things, it never feels so.To sum things up, it is a more than decent movie (hence the 7/10 rating), and probably does a great job at translating what car racing feels like to people who aren't into it or know little about it (my wife had a really good time and enjoyed the movie's constant suspense, as well as its visuals and performances, so it's got to be doing something right!). However, it's neither Oscar-Winning, nor even remotely accurate when it comes to car stuff."
FORD V FERRARI,16 January 2020,8/10,"The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.Top notch stuff, well worth watching."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe thoroughly inhabit their characters - that's the best thing about this movie, I think. Each of them has multiple scenes in which they are alternately charming and sympathetic. I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history."
FORD V FERRARI,24 March 2020,9/10,Great movie! It kept me excited until the end! The story was good the cast very good. One of the best films of 2019
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,10/10,"Amazing performance by the lead actors - Matt Damon and Christian Bale, their chemistry is palpable. Christian Bale delivers another moving performance in this movie. The workings of a big ugly corporation like Ford was captured very well in this movie. I loved the small details such as Enzo Ferrari tipping his hat to Ken Miles while Ford and everyone else is congratulating the winner. Shows that Mr. Ferrari is the true lover of the sport and a thorough gentleman."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,8/10,This is one of the best racing movies along with rush hence if you liked rush you'll like this movie but honestly rush was better in terms of directing and storyline however this movie is amazing because of the solid performances of Christian and Matt..is it worth watching ? DEFINITELY YES..it's one of the very few movies that are long but you really don't want the movie to end like you are enjoying every single moment of the movie just like driving a Ferrari or something you don't feel the time!
FORD V FERRARI,2 January 2020,8/10,"A historically inspired story that is noth long and worth it, even with a few tiny hits of boredom"
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,9/10,"Damon and bales chemistry make this film what it is, even if your not a racing fan this is a great watch of the highs and lows of the rise of Ford and shelby."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2020,10/10,I would like to thank the dorector and producer for making this movie.
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is not a regular documentary movie. This movie was done soooo good that it was a pure joy throughout the entire movie !!!
With exceptionally great acting by Christian Bale and even Matt Damon.
The production went all the way to really reproduce the look&fill of that time, in every possible aspects.It's a must see !! I warmly recommend you all - Go see it."
FORD V FERRARI,3 October 2020,9/10,"Just watched the movie, nothing more.
Christian Bale absolutely magnificent. Great casting also
Feeling good after"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,The movie is very well directed. does well to show what it takes to race behind the scenes. captures the emotions of both the lead actors very well.
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,10/10,"It was worth 2 and half hours of my time, excellent move! Bale and Damon did awesome job."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,What a great movie! It's all about Christian Bale.. Big Salute to you.. What a transformation and action. Remembering Machinist movie... Oscar wining performance.
FORD V FERRARI,7 March 2020,,"This movie was great, it felt like I was in a car the whole movie! On a serious note - This movie is well worth a watch, an epic rivalry, awesome acting and brilliant directing. You'll be wanting to go 150 on the highway after you watch this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2020,10/10,One of the best movies in 2019. A must watch movie. Christian bale and mat damon jus nailed it. U will get goosebumps in some scenes.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Amazing marriage of human drama, action, and history. I even enjoyed watching actors that I don't like. All I can say is that I've never seen 2.4 hours pass so quickly. Not one moment of boredom or a single wasted frame. Congratulations on an extremely successful effort."
FORD V FERRARI,7 July 2020,9/10,Every one should watch and i think Christian bale deserves oscar nominee at least
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,"Movies about a big race or an upcoming sporting event have been done a thousand times before and they all have one thing in common - that you must win against overwhelming odds.Add this one to the list as well. So what makes this one special? Nothing in particular.. But its a Damn entertaining movie. Well written, well acted, excellent characterization, well directed.This is great entertainment. Go for it.. you wont be disappointed."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far .
FORD V FERRARI,29 July 2020,9/10,"Such a fun, engaging movie. I saw some critics say it was too long, but for someone who takes sometimes several additional hours, days, even, to get through a movie due to ADD and a short attention span, this film raced by.The character work with Miles was so great as to get the viewer on his side from the start, and Bale's performance was exactly what the movie needed to create a guy in which we're so invested. It's the combination of passion, skill, and knowledgeability that makes Ken Miles THE guy to root for.Matt Damon was good, however I think he could be replaced with virtually any other actor and the movie would be unchanged.The character building we are given before, the villainization of the Ford team; they inject the racing sequences with the same suspense and adrenaline present when your home team is fighting for a championship title. We not only have a favorite, we have rivals.And oh, what a twist--what a soul-crushing twist. I almost couldn't finish the movie. I had to look up whether it was real in the hopes that it wasn't. It's one of those times that you just wished based on a true story was fiction so as to console yourself."
FORD V FERRARI,9 May 2021,9/10,"I hadn't even heard of this movie until I'd stumbled upon it. Solid writing, acting, and attention to detail. I cannot love this movie more."
FORD V FERRARI,31 March 2021,10/10,"As Enzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars dominate the mid-1960s motorsport world, the American car designer, Carroll Shelby, is forced to retire after winning the demanding 1959 '24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race. But, before long, an unexpected proposition by the Vice President of Henry Ford's motor company, Lee Iacocca, will offer an opportunity to beat the Italians at their own game. Now, under those pressing circumstances, the British sports car driver and racing engineer, Ken Miles, reluctantly agrees to lend a hand and improve the firm's image, as Ford's race team has less than ninety days to rewrite history. As a result, the non-conformist duo comes up with the mighty Ford GT40 Mk I high-performance racing car. Can Shelby and Miles break Ferrari's streak?"
FORD V FERRARI,8 July 2020,6/10,"Good as the cast is and even racing scenes, this movie doesn't have as good a script or heart of a story as Rush did. With a title that hints at comparison or even more competition for the story, it doesn't deliver that. It would have been better titled Shelby & Miles v. Ford."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,10/10,"The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal. Matt Damon is perfect as a chicken farmer from Texas. Christian Bale plays a short tempered British person almost to perfectly. Josh Lucas portal of a ford executive with a determination to ruin the GT is just frustrating enough to be convicting. Jon Bernthal finally gets to play a likeable character who has a job to do at first, then just becomes part of the solution.The writting is also beautiful in more ways than one. You need to pay attention to the little things, as they tend to come back up later on. Its also poetic in nature, from one scene to another. Thing's that are said, and things that happen have a deeper meaning and you have to be ready with a box of tissues. This shouldn't be considered a spoiler: when Henry Ford II is talking to Shelby about going to war should go down as one of the greatest moments in film history. That conversation represents both characters and the true life story of Ford Vs. Ferrari perfictly!Not to mention the love story between Ken and his wife feels real. No relationship is perfect; she doesn't want him to quit and shes not going to stand back and watch him throw his life away. The other side of that situation, he wants to be a race car driver, but he needs to put food on the table. I can reallynfeel the love between these characters, and I feel for them.Set design, props, and costumes were so on point for each character, location and clothing that when the movie was over I felt like a time traveler. This film just did such a great job of pulling you into its world. Not to mention the cars!!! I love how Shelby drove a AC Cobra throughout the movie and Ken trashed the Mustang. Again, this movie does a great job of just keeping you drawn to the plot so well.The BAD: I felt like it ran long in some places. Especially towards the end. This movie could of, and should of ended after the race. You already ended the movie with captions, why not add a few more. On the topic of the captions; they're to fast. Im not a spead reader, leave them on the acreen fornat least 5 seconds.
This is fsr and away my favorite movie of 2019! I was hooked from beginning to end. I would even love to see another racing movie based on Lancia's really history."
FORD V FERRARI,14 September 2019,10/10,Both Matt Damon and Bales performances were fantastic and brilliantly directed by James ( by far his best directed film to date!)Along with the excellent duo Oscar worthy performances the racing sequences were upmost beautifully made along with the films cinematography!Im fully confident and expecting multiple Oscar nominations on all fronts for this joyful movie!!
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,6/10,"The driving scenes aren't any better or more realistic than the foolishness in the fast and furious movies. You can't yell at other drivers, and everyone is trying to ""out brake"" (what they mean is ""brake later than"") everyone else on every turn. That's just part of driving a good lap. More time on the throttle and less time on the brakes means a faster lap.The movie is stylish, good clothes, cool music, but there's a perfectly good documentary about the same events called ""The 24-Hour War."" All those people they talk about in this movie are actually IN the documentary. It's on Netflix. Hell, I had dinner with David Hobbs at the Chattanooga Motor Car Festival last fall, and I also saw Bill Elliott there. Those are real people who really risked their lives for the love of racing, not some actors playing at it.If you prefer to see the Hollywood version of the world, that's your decision. But I prefer real life or real fiction. This ""biopic"" nonsense is merely the appearance of art depicting the appearance of reality. Some would say the shadows of reality seen on the wall of a cave. I love a good story as much as the next guy, but if it's real, I'd like to hear it from the guys who lived it, not someone (like me) who only wished he'd lived it."
FORD V FERRARI,24 March 2020,9/10,Loved the movie. Very fast paced and enjoyable start to finish. I love the Mustang but after seeing the Ford leadership I would definitely have second thoughts about owning their products. Matt Damian's performance is very believable. Great story
FORD V FERRARI,21 January 2020,,"Not being a rev-head I did not know what to expect, but Le Mans '66 / Ford v Ferrari was a wonderful surprise.
The story behind Caroll Shelby the man and his relationship with Ford and the racing team is great drama.
This is a film full of great acting, well directed, flawless cinematography that varies from beautiful to exciting, with a perfect sound track and absolutely brilliant editing.
There is a lot of depth and emotional range in the interactions of all the characters."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,10/10,If you like being placed in the seat of a race car while sitting in the middle of a movie theater then this is the movie for you! Totally awesome!
FORD V FERRARI,18 July 2020,9/10,"I am not a fan of F1. I saw this movie just for the sake of it and oh man, I might start seeing F1!Such an inspiring movie.Be so passionate about something that people will remember you for that."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"Really good movie. Not even a racing fan, but Bale and Damon click from the word go, both with their humor and dramatic skills on display. I also knew nothing of the real story, which made for some surprises. Then ending shot says a lot as well.Well done!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,8/10,"It is the 1960s, Ferrari is reigning as king of race cars, while Ford has gained a reputation for mass production of uniform road machines. When a buyout goes sour, the biggest grudge match, or the longest, is about to catch the world by surprise.I hesitated about going to the cinema for it. Ford v. Ferrari already sounds like a pissing contest between corporates. Well, it definitely is something of that nature, filled with testosterone, business games, and cars. The fun though is undiminished, and the amount of 1960s corporate suits didn't bother me at all. Matt Damon is so incredibly in control of his talent, capable of convincing the audience he IS Carroll Shelby, even if Damon himself is not a car guy at all. This says much about how good the screenplay is, based on a book of the real events. Christian Bale is as usual, on a wild ride with his A-game. The distinct mannerism of the racing Hall of Famer Ken Miles is immortalized through Bale's distinct craft, borne of his unshakable dedication to the art of acting. From Josh Lucas, Jon Bernthal to Outlander's Caitriona Balfe, each cast member delivers. Also, using all real racing cars instead of SFX for key car racing scenes definitely pays off on the big screen. The camera angles are brilliant in capturing those 200 million-dollar cars in motion. I absolutely love the racing segments even though I know so little about cars.The 2.5 hour-film boasts with comedy, thrills, and dramatic revelations that proceed to make so much sense during the climax. To me, there wasn't a moment wasted, and my second viewing experience turned out even better, ripe with ""a-ha"" moments. The score circles me right in, too."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,"Once in a while, there is a movie that gives you hope that Hollywood has, finally, broken its addiction to sequels, reboots, adaptations and other ""reinventions"". A movie of such technique, panache, storytelling and outright acting prowess that catapults it into the realm of The Classics.Ladies and Gentlemen, James Mangold and his team of craftsmen have delivered this rare jewel of a movie.A linear journey into the lives of racers (Shelby and Miles), executives (Iacocca and Beebe) and visionaries (Ford and Ferrari), locked in a battle for racing supremacy, raged in the grandest of arenas: Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans. A battle where each screw, each bolt and each suspension inch can make or break the journey to the top.A battle that is waged by figures terrifically played by a fantastic cast of actors, first amongst them a performance for the ages by Christian Bale as Ken Miles, who clearly signifies that he is on the prowl for another slew of awards. Matt Damon shines as Shelby, although he reaches summits mostly when interacting with the aforementioned Bale. The Miles family also benefits from excellent performances, that of Noah Jupe as his son being among the most touching one given this decade.
Commenting at length on the rest of the performances would take too long, but there is not a single solitary performance that is off or even slightly broken. Of special mention is those of Tracy Letts as a gruff but driven Henry Ford II, and a ""bravo"" for the ages for Remo Girone, who does Enzo Ferrari incredible justice with such a short screen presence, conveying the pride, passion and dignity that characterized the life of the Modena-born engineer.This review would not be complete without commenting on the meat of the movie: the racing sequences. These are going to enter in the history of moviemaking as ""magnum opuses"" of the genre, with the gorgeous lighting, crisp editing, roaring sound effects and effectively timed musical addendums turning the 20-minutes-or-so Le Mans racing sequence into a masterful art work in and of itself, no small feat.In retrospect, and quoting Kingsley Amis, we are in the presence of a flawless masterpiece""."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,9/10,"Those who are fan of the movie ""Rush"" will obviously like this movie. It showed the golden age of the time. You will feel the pressure, suspens, and urge for the win in this movie. You can feel the speed frees up your soul."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,2/10,"From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.The screenplay was very disappointing, however.The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Watched this morning at 10 am. Wow. What a film. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a great team on screen. Possibly the best movie I have seen Damon in. Bale, as usual, is sublime. The supporting cast are brilliant, especially young Noah Jupe, who surely has a great career ahead of him, rather like Mr Bale has and continues to have. You don't have to like cars, but if you like great movies with great performances this is for you. A shoe in for the Oscar nominations."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Cool cars, great acting, artistic direction, excellent cinematography and thrilling car races. All packed into a well-written character drama about the man's never ending quest for perfection, friendship, team-effort and corporate greed."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,8/10,"There aren't too many movies that have come out in the last decade that were good enough for me to want to watch them again or buy them. This is definitely an exception and its a racing movie. Well, sort of a racing movie. The cast is pretty good. Matt Damon and Christian Bale kill it on their end. Its very compelling emotionally and can definitely make you empathize with the characters. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have a political message or underlying social message in 2019. You can go read the synopsis for this movie to find out what its about, but its a great movie for people that don't even like racing. The characters are predictable and the story is rather predictable as well, but it is based on a true story of which we know the outcome and the setting lends an idea of the kind of people you are going to see. This is probably one of the best movies about racing I have ever seen. You don't learn much on the historical side of things and, honestly, that is probably a good thing. If you are looking for the story without the entertainment then watch the documentary, but if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie with badass cars, then, this movie is for you. Btw, this movie is visually striking and shot very well."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,7/10,"71' Le mans Steve McQueen vs James garner 66' Grand Prix which one is better?94' the shawshank redemption think of any scene where it could of been better ?
not easyford vs ferrair who is it for... the gearhead or his or HER girlfriend
well you will find some nice moments here but health and safety has crippled the classic car film of yesteryear much like the crippled and maimed stuntmen that made them possible.but what bothers me most is the spotlight on the drama watching this film you cant escape the fact the bad guys win, the crooked bankers don't go to jail and the good guys die, perhaps their real reward.this film is sprinkled with pleasant moments ""shelby flying comes to mind"" but i am on this unwanted emotional roller coaster with no payoff.
Not the car film we all hoped for, with a re-edit it could be rescued a little, but this is no cult classic.ford vs ferrari could of been a passable comedy but where it sits now is no mans land, barely re-watchale.but please keep trying to find that automotive masterpiece.
leMans is too much for the gear head much like 71' two-lane blacktop they are phenomenal but finding the perfect car film, now that Ain't easy.For a film about building a racing car and winning leMans, why is the spotlight on unnecessary filler.
throw in some motorbikes and let the every man daydream for a couple hours then BACK TO WORK.your reward watch
No mans land (1987) Charley Sheen
Two-lane blacktop (1971) James Taylor yeah the singer
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974) Peter Fonda R.I.P
White Lightning (1973) Burt Reynolds the goat
The Gumball Rally (1976) Raul Julia
Le Mans (1971) Steve McQueen the film you should watch instead of this.I said, that's life (that's life) and as funny as it may seem

But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around."
FORD V FERRARI,2 March 2020,7/10,"Not bad, nothing special, it can be watched.
Could be shorter."
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,9/10,"Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale.

FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,4/10,Matt Damon slayed it. Enjoyed Christian Bale. Caitriona Balfe is a one dimensional Actor doesn't really add to Movie other than they needed a woman character for the Movie. She needs more acting classes or something
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"I watched this film in IMAX to get the full experience. The racing was thrilling to watch, it feels like you're there rooting for the main character to win. I recommend watching this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,9/10,"Seeing this movie in the cinema is another thing, in the racing parts it is as if we were driving. Christian Bale makes an excellent performance, for me deserving of Oscar nomination, Matt Damon and Jon Bernthal perform as always, as the rest of the actors. Briefly one of the best movies of 2019, we highly recommend watching at the cinema."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,6/10,"Ford v Ferrari is the most average and mediocre film to release at this point in the year. There is nothing great, good, bad, or terrible about this movie. It's just okay. But considering that great movies do exist, mediocre movies feel unsatisfying by comparison.The acting is by far the best part of the film. Matt Damon is amazing, Christian Bale is pretty great, and everyone else is just average, which is disappointing considering the notable cast. The child acting wasn't all that good.The writing is pretty unspecial and average. It takes the classic American underdog trope and does pretty much nothing original with it. There's almost nothing to say on this subject because of how little substance the writing has.The editing was alright but nothing special. The shot composition was alright but nothing special. The soundtrack... I've already forgotten everything about it, only a day after it came out. The adr was super noticeable and terribly implemented.Watch this if you are into racing or this story in particular, but for me it felt like a futile attempt at sweeping the Oscars."
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,4/10,"Okay, half of the movie was just nonsense conversation, but I got really into the races."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Two words....Timeless epic! Went into this movie thinking it was another attempt to use a star studded cast to take my money and grab my Interest. That's exactly what it was and I've never been happier. Film is expertly written, expertly performed and expertly directed. One of those once in every two years kind of film, one you can pull out on a rainy night in 10 years from now and be ever so glad you did. It Is long....it is a typical testosterone film....but it's so worth the watch!!!!! Brilliant!!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 April 2021,10/10,"Hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen! 2h30 intense hours packed with action, tension, emotions, adrenaline, the actors were absolutely splendid. Must watch, even if you re not a cars lover!!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 September 2020,5/10,"With films such as Rush and Senna one believes that it is possible to make motorsport movies that are realistic, reasonably accurate and enjoyable. Unfortunately Le Mans 66 fails to deliver. While the acting of Bale as Ken Miles is excellent and the characterisation of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari are entertaining almost all other performances miss out - even Matt Damon.
The close-up racing scenes are terrible! Most of the drivers spend their time looking sideways at cars alongside them rather than at the track. They also watch a strange instrument that appears to show the speed in mph! Really!!! When did anyone put a speedometer into a racing car? It doesn't tell you anything and it would distract the driver.
The Ferrari drivers are not given any dialogue so they make up for it with evil smirks taken from a 1920's horror film. The Ford drivers are even less lucky - you don't see them at all! Not even Denny Hulme who shared Miles's car.
The racing at Le Mans was probably the most boring part of this over-long soap opera.
Someone should have decided whether this is a sports docu-drama or a film exploring the relationships between the key players ... Ferrari, Ford, Miles, Shelby. It failed to decide between the two. As the old joke goes - what do you get if you ask a committee to design a horse? A camel."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,6/10,"Its entertaining. Cliche at times but the movie moves rather fluidly. Forget about the inaccuracies thats what books are for, this a hollywood film so expect hollywood stuff. The sound editing is killer and the cinematography is great also."
FORD V FERRARI,7 January 2020,9/10,"The movie has it all. Comedy, drama, villany, action and very good acting. There is nothing to dislike. Give yourself a favor and go to the movie to see this masterpiece. Everything in the right doses."
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,1/10,"I really like both Matt Damon and Christian Bales earlier work.
But this was just horrible. What a nightmare to watch."
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2021,10/10,"This is one of the best movies I watched. Incredible performance by all actors, the soundtrack was amazing in adding excitement and suspension to race scenes, and Christian Bale was just phenomenal yet again. Would recommend anyone to watch it."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,8/10,"Well written and almost similar to the true events. Enjoyed the movie, matt damon and christian bale played their parts brilliantly."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"What an exciting movie! Well done on every level: character development, cast, tempo, acting, stunning!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,Hell of a movie. Those roaring engine are pure orgasm with a thriller and riveting plot. Energetic and extremely talented actors. Worth every buck!
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"The director of the film James Mangold himself claims in interviews that he shot 'Saving Private Ryan' in the reverse, a film that unfolds gradually, and in the third act shows all its beauty, in a monumental scene portraying the course of the great and one of the toughest car races in the world - Le Mans, during which racers drove all day and night.At first, however, I would like to briefly address the loud and polarizing opinions about this film that have already appeared.
So the ultra-left side (swjs) already thinks that this movie is a step backwards, because it focuses on the friendship of two white men and generally it is a movie packed with alpha men fighting for power. Of course, this is unfair simplification and not true.This film tells a classic story of David vs Goliath, a story of beautiful friendship between two passionate people. On the surface this is a film about a duel between Ford and Ferrari in Le Mans, but if we dive deeper, it is truly a story about eternal struggle between corporation and artists (which can also be transferred to the film industry itself).Therefore, people should forget about politics at least once, especially if we are in the world of art, cinema, film, because pushing politics into everything becomes really devastating and toxic, art / films are given contexts that simply do not exist in these specific cases. Ford and Ferrari is a nostalgic return to the old cinema, yes, it talks mainly about men, but also about their passion, family and love. About small- big things that are simple and present in everyone's life, it is a film for everyone.Other opinions that I heard are that the whole story is too simple and predictable, and the characters are not shown enough off the race track, too little character study. First of all, the allegation about the simplicity of this story is absurd, because the director clearly wanted to make such a film - it's not just a car film, but a classic western as the director himself confirmed in an interview for The Times : ''As much as I felt like I was making a race movie, I was making Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a movie about friendship "" - he said. And it's true.This film ticks off every known point in the classic western story, in which you can find a duel between the good and the bad, fight between the charming 'outlaw' poets of the wheel and the great, bad, big bosses of something much bigger. Perhaps, as some say, Mangold's mistake was focusing too much on the conflict of bureaucracy - the racetrack, but as I read in interviews, the script was re-written several times, it was supposed to be an old classic cinema about male friendship and hardships and it works. And yes - from time to time, we need to take a break from the over-intellectualised and psychologically intense cinema and we simply need such pure entertainment, with a dose of pathos, emotions, great collective scenes and two very pleasant acting performances.And now back to these two main characters. Bale and Damon play two geniuses, one of whom can communicate with the rest of the world like a normal human and belong to a larger community (Damon's Shelby) and the other (Bale's Miles), is a total freak, an outsider incompatible with anyone and anything except maybe his wife and son, exuberant eccentric. But it is exactly this '' separateness '', internal life, loneliness and quirks of Miles, that can lead to the defeat of the invincible Ferrari. These two make the film from beginning to end and the chemistry between them is great. The duo dynamics provide us with a few really hilarious scenes, one of which deserves special attention - the fight scene near Miles's home. Bale and Damon are excellent comedy-wise in this scene, as middle-aged daddies pathetically trying to knock each other down with bread or a trash can lid.For me, these two performances deserve recognition, because Damon and Bale did what they could with the script they got. They both did a lot of work.However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Bale. Bale plays Ken Miles, the maverick British racing driver really brilliantly. His energy, the entire digging into the psychology of the character, but also into his physicality - Christian is a master of total acting. Pay attention to the work of his arms at the cinema - just like Miles, and yet there are so few video clips with Miles. Bale's acting is not at all 'too big', Miles is just like that in this movie - explosive, impulsive, full of passion, but also has a tart language without a filter for those who want to manipulate him. Also, let's not forget that Bale spoke personally to Miles's son Peter, as he prepared for the role.Miles was a bona-fide eccentric, and his cockpit monologues have something of Top Gear about them.""Learn to drive, you pillock!"" he roars as someone cuts him up. ""More of that please, giddy up!"" he shouts when the car responds. ""This feels like a bag of squirrels!"" he yells when it doesn't. Miles was from Birmingham, but Bale's version has more than a touch of Yorkshire. He is basically an unholy hybrid of Jeremy Clarkson, Alan Partridge and Geoffrey Boycott.""Christian had this remarkable list of Brummie expressions he made on a wadded-up piece of notepaper"" Mangold said in The Times interview ""I'd like to frame it. People said that Miles liked to talk to himself while he was driving and we hadn't really written any ongoing mutterings for him. So between takes when he was in the car, Christian had this piece of paper: 'Your face is redder than a spiked arse . . . let's not go round the Wrekin (Black Country slang for going the long way).' "" I find this anecdote hilarious.According to the director, double-decker rigs allowed Bale and co to be filmed in the cars while they were driven by professional drivers sitting on the roof. ""So the actors are moving through space at 100 miles an hour, they're amid other traffic all being driven by pros, but they're allowed to act, remember their lines, take notes."" Or, in Bale's case, swear like a trooper.Bale's character is certainly, heightened (but as I wrote this is Miles in this story) hurling wrenches as freely as he chucks insults. Mangold thinks the performance expresses ""a lot of the joy in Christian's soul. So many of his roles, in a very direct contradiction of who he is in life, are just very grim. The playfulness rarely gets a chance to shine.""With Phoenix, as with Bale and Daniel Day Lewis, ""you're not even sure where the acting stops"", Mangold said. ""There's a kind of danger.'' and he added : ''Matt, Christian, Joaquin, Russell Crowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert De Niro: they come to the set to play. They're the opposite of tricky - they want to be directed and they've worked with many great directors, so they have a great deal of trust.''And for all these reasons, for me Christian Bale is actually the most fascinating actor in today's film world. He is the most unique and unpredictable actor of modern actors. He always turns left when everyone else turns right, and vice versa - goes straight when the others turn. His choices are quite unusual, they never go with fashion, with mainstream.In the previous year, he played without hesitation in the very polarizing '' Vice '' and there is no doubt that he angered many on the right side of the political scene, and today he plays in an old-fashioned western - sport film about purely male friendship, which, as I can see, has already annoyed some feminists and ultra-leftists.But Christian only goes his own ways, just like Ken Miles, and chooses roles that challenge him, not because of political correctness. As he has shown more than once, he does not care who he can anger with his dark, witty, sardonic and self-deprecating sense of humor (you can see it in many interviews) and I absolutely love it.Finally, that's why Christian is a brilliant actor, one of a kind, but also a chameleon - because I've read thousands of comments online about him and no one actually has a clue. But James Mangold, who is friends with Bale, gave a great IndieWire interview about the film and Bale, one great quote: '' I felt the role was close to Bale and prayed he would do it. He's a model to me of artistic perseverance and flexibility. He'll text you with thoughts and free associations about the character. It's all incredible food. He's a wonderful father, loving husband, great friend. He's not interested in being famous. He drives a pickup truck, he's grounded in the world, he raced motorcycles but had to stop when he got hurt, when he had kids. There are so many parts of Ken in Christian, who's a perfectionist. He's trying to achieve something for himself. It's magical to direct someone like that because they draw you into their own idealism. You feel that energy; it permeates the set''.Like Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood, Le Mans '66 is about ""the transition moment for men in the Sixties as the world is changing from underneath them"", Mangold says. With their nonchalant machismo and hands-on practicality, Miles and Shelby are an endangered species, as Leonardo DiCaprio's and Brad Pitt's characters were in Quentin Tarantino's movie. Mangold seems a bit like that too. Not a dinosaur, but one of those muscular all-rounders who would have thrived in the golden age of Tinseltown.He smiles. ""I'd be very happy 50 years ago, in the Hollywood system."" He says he's trapped, but he has always been ""a wanderer in terms of genre"", from cops to cowboys, asylum inmates to country singers, superhero pensioners to retro racers. He thinks his versatility has been ""almost to his detriment"". Nonsense. Mangold is just that quaint, old-fashioned thing: a really good director.Let this be the ultimate encouragement. Ford vs Ferrari is an epic, old-fashioned cinema, no CGI, they had car replicas, for that reason only it's worth watching in the cinema, on a big screen."
FORD V FERRARI,14 October 2021,10/10,"The best movie from 2019 until now (14.10.2021)! Matt and Chris are .... Phenomenal! 2 Super Oscars 4 2 Super actors!!!And ... Mollie ... WOW! Superb!I would like to see them both in another real story movie.Super movie with super actors! And ... Ford ... Mr. Ford, the second (😂) is ... great!"
FORD V FERRARI,26 September 2020,9/10,"Story based on real incident, superb action , full off emotions. I was moved by this movie. Really brilliant. Liked Christian bale a lot, one of my favourite actor."
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,9/10,"I went to this movie with a fellow shelby fan. And man, what an experience we had. We just smiled the entire movie. It's fun, beautifully captured and historically very accurate! I don't know what else to say about it because they did so many things right. This is a MUST SEE for every car and race enthousiast and i hope no one misses out on this incredible picture!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"I've gotta say that I came to the theatre with lower expectations since some people were complaining about the story sounding boring. I only to came to watch because it had two of my favorite actors in it, Christian Bale and Matt Damon. After the movie was done, I was blown away.The story is exactly what it says, but those words can't describe the experience of watching this. Right away you get to know the characters and they're not so generic as I thought they would be. Christian Bale was the best part of this film, and his performance is very compelling. It feels totally separate from what he was in the Dark Knight and American Psycho.As time passes, the stakes get much higher. There are always barriers added along the way, whether it's the dangerous conditions of racing or the people involved in it. You will definitely love some characters and hate some as well (you'll know who I'm talking about).This is the ideal drama we should keep getting from Hollywood. The performances by Bale and Damon are fantastic, and this'll bring many awards."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"As I'm not a huge car racing fan I was a little hesitant about seeing Le Mans '66, but this is not a racing film, well it is and it isn't, so if I enjoyed it, despite the racing, I'm sure that most others would too, and racing fans even more so.The mark of a good film is being so engrossed in it that you don't even realise how long it is, which is exactly the case with Le Mans '66. In fact I was astounded when I was told how long it was afterwards.Unlike some other shorter films, which have occasionally dragged on, the two hours and 42 minutes of this film flew by leaving me completely sated.It's a great story, especially knowing it's a true one, but bear in mind it's not a documentary but a movie, so there's going to be some artistic license.Some incredible acting made me warm to some individuals and abhor some others, exclaiming out loud 'you bleep'. The intensity and rush of the race to race, and the racing itself drew me in and made me eager for them to achieve their goals.The film succeeds in every way a retelling of an historic event should, making you care, informing you and entertaining you.My advice, get yourself in gear, race down to your local cinema, and settle in for a for a darn good ride along."
FORD V FERRARI,3 February 2020,9/10,"Wow! Great story, great acting, great action...and if you like cars and speed...seriously entertaining!"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"I usually don't like racing movies, but this one is amazing, it is really intense, sad and alot of drama. This movie have 3 of my favorite actors of all time, Jon Berthal, Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Well written script and then when it said that it was a true story, I was blown away. Watch this film if you are a fan of amazing and emotional movies. Must watch for every movie lover!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"Funny Wenn needed sad and Hart felt Wenn needed and good sound and crashes, ackting from baile and mat was awesome including bailes voice acting was definitely worth the watch"
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,10/10,"This movie literally blew me out.Every moment and every scene got on my nerves,excellent story and perfect direction.Highly recomended"
FORD V FERRARI,13 March 2020,10/10,"It is so good... Very excellent movie... Very good actor performance.... So tense and exciting from start until the end... The race is so intense... This movie makes me know about Le Mans 24 hours... Carroll shelby, and Ken Miles.... The music is so good too"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,9/10,"When I learnt about the back story of the movie, the most curious thing was who will play Enzo Ferrari. Although I was slightly disappointed with his characterization, I cannot find any other negatives about this movie. From start to finish, the story flows naturally with the two leads and the support cast (who were brilliant)."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is the best racing film since Rush.
Christian Bale with another killer performance. Matt Damon with also another great performance.Amazing chemistry between the cast. Perfect and nail-biting action and also very emotional .
A must watch for all racing fans.Kudos to James Mangold and the rest of the crew."
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,"This was a very enjoyable filmIt is a feel-good, underdog wins, suits win only the hollowest of battle victories, good guys when all the wars.The driving scenes were great, and I don't care if the gear shifting was technically correct. There were a few memorably intense acting scenes: Tracy Lett's reaction to being driven in a great racing car by a great racing car driver. Christian Bale being driven in a station wagon by an absolutely ferocious wife (Caitriona Balfe) stick in my mind.After watching this movie I wanted to see what else Caitriona Balfe has acted in - I've watched a few episodes of Outlander and have been really impressed by her ferocity on screen. Not merely noisy -- but oozing heartfelt intensity.Oh - the cinematography, editing and sound were all world class.As an afterthought--Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe are two of the handsomest stars I've ever seen. This production discourages seeing them that way. Bale looks lean, hungry, and slightly weird in most scenes; Caitriona Balfe is not much past ordinary in appearance. The other racing movies this one is compared to are about beautiful people who occasionally need to change out of their racing duds so they can send them to the cleaners before dropping by the club for hors d'oeuvres and aperitifs.The --uh, restrained--comparisons with Rush, LeMans and Grand Prix may be justified, but I fully enjoyed this movie. If you like cars, competition, various versions of excessive testosterone,--a number of interesting cultural interactions, I think you'll enjoy it too.Not deep, not technically fulfilling, but clear and interesting story-telling, and cinematically beautiful movie-making all the way through."
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,9/10,"This movie has it all, a well interpreted and interesting setting, big hitters that do not disappoint, humor that fits all crowds, and an emotion Journey following a man and his obsession with pushing the limits.This is excellent film making, phenomenal set design, and I even found myself appreciating some of the lighting. The final frame of the film has a crazy artifact shadowing the confused bystander which transitions to the outro text."
FORD V FERRARI,21 February 2020,9/10,"Great flick
Both actors were great, but Christian Bale stole the show. Mat Damon was great as always. I do so love his comedic skills."
FORD V FERRARI,7 April 2020,10/10,This is a movie i have come across after a long time which is so long (Runtime 155 mins) still not at all slow and couldn't believe I watched it at a stretch......You must watch it if you are an action or thrill fan..... great direction...Great movie.
FORD V FERRARI,16 August 2021,10/10,"Wow, what a ROARING biopic. I can't believe it. Definitely one of the best films I've seen in a LONG TIME. I laughed. I screamed. I cried.Great story about the American spirit and American fortitude, and what may manifest from those entities."
FORD V FERRARI,17 August 2021,10/10,"This movie had my hair blown back from start to finish. Absolute pleasure to watch. The perfect synchronism of sound effects, visual effects, cinematography, landscaping, and score was executed here.Just absolute pleasure. I literally have nothing bad to say about this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,26 February 2020,10/10,"Not gonna bore you with a long review, One of my fave films this year !!"
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,10/10,Is there anything Christian Bale cannot do? He once again delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Matt Damon is also in superb form. The racing sequences have been picturized perfectly and the movie will keep you invested in the characters long after it is over. Must watch.
FORD V FERRARI,15 May 2020,10/10,"Cards on the table - I'm a massive Damon and Bale fan so that's what caught my eye. I'm not that driven by cars ... sorry!I love this film. The acting is great, the storyline epic and the production is excellent. I love the mix of the moody soundtrack, slowed pace and great soundtrack.It is thrilling from the off and the pace never drops.Cannot recommend this highly enough."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2019,9/10,"This movie is not about cars. (For me at least) Of course those are beautiful, the racing scenes, the sounds, the lack of cgi... but still. It's definitely not about Henry Ford vs. Enzo Ferrari. In this movie's case the Hungarian title is better imo: ""Kings of the Asphalt""This movie is about the tenacity and the single minded fanaticism that is needed to achieve greatness. This movie is about the painfulness of being different. This movie is about how hard it is to be extraordinary.And boy, does it deliver. We already know that when Mr. Bale does something - it is done absolutely and without question to perfection. You can feel every thought, every decision, every second of the character through the screen here as well. Matt Damon is also exceptional in my opinion. Their chemistry, their dynamic, their friendship can be felt every scene - and it makes the film great.Don't get me wrong - there's racing! And lots of it. It's just more than any racing movie ever been...
The director of the film - James Mangold - did an exceptional job. There was a lot of - literally - moving pieces and he made those move together in perfect harmony.It's good if you know of - or heard of - Shelby, but that's it. You don't have to know everything there is to know about car racing history. They tell you. And maybe it's even better if you don't. You can feel the weight of taking every corner without knowing if that's the last - and you can only have that experience once, until you don't know the story, the ending.
Of course, if you've ever driven above the speed limit, and with a 200+ horse power car as well helps - but it's not necessary to enjoy the film.Fun fact: the last part of the movie is the illustration in the dictionary when you look up ""life's not fair"" or ""no good deed goes unpunished"".Memorable quotes: ""Am I on fire?!""
""There's a point above 7000 RPM...""9/10"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,I dont write many reviews but when I do it's either because a movie was an absolute waste of my time or the movie was so good I had to try and let other people know! Luckily this is one of those movies I want other people to know about! To start off it doesnt hurt that I love cars and auto racing but that is beside the point. This 2 and 1/2 movie had mine and everyone else in the theaters attention from beginning to end!!! 2 and 1/2 hours felt like 30 minutes and even though the ending was very good it left me wanting more! That being said from the casting to the script writing and action scenes this movie is amazing and definitely worth the watch!!!
FORD V FERRARI,9 January 2020,9/10,"Watched the movie two times, the second time i couldn't watch the ending...
Based on the true story Leo Beebe's official reason to convince Ford about that ending picture was that he was affraid the three cars might crash into eachother while striving for the 1st place... and he being responsable for the investment had to do something about it... sounds like a charlatan to me...his family should be ashamed of his actions! and corporatists aswell...
McLaren took the prize even know he knew it didn't belong to him! which is a big blow to his reputation...The movie is excellent, you can see they invested alot of love into the picture, everything is so well glued together!
Matt Damon's performance is flawless, Christian Bale does a great job impersonating this rather odd character.It's not just a random story, it's also a moral message to the younger generation!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Christian Bale and Matt Damon together in one IMAX frame is just mind boggling ! And it is sensationally directed by James Mangold !!
James carefully articulated each frame to make the audience feel a real-time experience of a passionate driver and passionate race car designer while reliving the rivalry between FORD & FERRARI."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"This movie genuinely describes what actually trying means when somebody strives for something bigger. No unrealistic goal, their agenda was pretty clear - learn from mistakes. I also admire the acting. I enjoyed every second of this movie. Truly a masterpiece biography of the two legendary companies."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,7/10,"This is an out-and-out motor racing film, centring on Ford's rivalry with Ferrari at the Le Mans 24 Hour race back in the day. A confessed petrolhead, I've attended the Le Mans weekend many times so was curious to see how this historical drama played out.It was interesting and accurate, and brought home the dangers of the sport at that time. My wife struggled to stay awake however, so a wider audience might find it less than enthralling."
FORD V FERRARI,9 January 2020,9/10,"More than the Racing Stuff, loved alot of the Emotional stuff it holds. Yet it offers some Goosebumps in particular the 1st Race of Ken. Unexpected Ending thoughBoth Bale & Demon just Rocks the Role of Ken & Shellby"
FORD V FERRARI,14 June 2020,10/10,"When a movie works the viewer is too engaged to notice flaws. Exhibit A: Ford v Ferrari.It helps that the source material tells an engaging true story involving protagonists with genuine depth and clear interlayered themes (underdog fish out of water - Miles, Shelby, even Ford - overcoming adversity - corporate politics, Ferrari dominance). The screenplay takes these strengths and plays to them. The lead characters are well drawn and the performances are both believable and entertaining. The drama is punctuated by short, sweet on track action sequences that put the viewer at the centre and convey the sensations experienced by racers efficiently and authentically.And there are some nice little touches. For example, I liked the shadows of the cars appearing to process on the wall of the garage in which an absorbed Miles listens to the unfolding race on the radio.Here I must declare an interest. I am an armchair petrolhead/gearhead who, in different times, can happily sit through F1 free practice sessions. But there is enough drama, enough performance, enough story for those turned off by the idea of lumps of metal turning circles for hours on end. My motorsport hating family loved this movie as much as me.Wonderful.Defence rests."
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2021,4/10,Reminded me of The Right Stuff--male hormones raging--but at least that film had some passably okay female roles. FvF has one cringe-inducing female role. The film makers are lazy and get away with portraying 1960s women as powerless toys and shrews. Ruins an otherwise interesting subject and film chock full of star turns.
FORD V FERRARI,19 May 2021,9/10,"For someone who knows very little about cars, Le Mans, & NASCAR, I was captured by the amazing storytelling & performances by the whole team. This movie told a fascinating, true story about an event in history that I probably would have never taken an interest. It's character driven without sparing the action. Strong cast performances including supporting cast members Ray McKinnon and Tracy Letts."
FORD V FERRARI,1 September 2021,10/10,"As if Ken Miles reincarnated in Chris Bale, only for this role. With the same accent, the same way of looking, same way of driving..Now, after seeing this acting, it's hard to understand who is Chris Bale or was he Ken Miles? Was Ken Miles human? If he was, such an amazing human being, such a genius, so passionate, so lovely! I wish I could live in Ken Miles days. All my love for him, wherever he is now.And for Chris Bale, everytime he is acting for a movie it's like he was made for that movie. As in Batman, as in Le Man's 66."
FORD V FERRARI,28 July 2020,9/10,Christian Bale is a great actor. Beautifully filmed and edited. A little formulaic with the typical corporate ass.My only real complaint. Tires don't squeal in the wet. Tires only squeal in dry conditions. Makes me cringe.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"""Sometimes words...they are just not useful. Tools, well they can fix and repair things.""Truly lived up to the billing and justified my choice of being the most awaited movie in the last quarter of 2019. This was totally an engineer's wet dream, but you don't really need to be a keen follower of motor sports to understand the movie. Rather, you will be compelled to research on it after you make the exit.Most people will be deterred from watching it, just by looking at the runtime, but trust me, it's totally worth it. Everyone is in such fine form that it makes the watch a really pleasant one. Matt Damon as the iconic Carroll Shelby hits it out of the park. The lady playing Ken Miles' wife was fantastic and that scene where she has a bout of hysteria in a speeding car was definitely my favourite.Go for this one. It's really a spectacle."
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2020,8/10,"Great story of Miles and Shelby. How they build a car worth risking. Nicely done movie . Emotions, power, engines, speed and CARS. Well done"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"The first part of the movie was a little slow and kinda boring but the second part plus the last part was incredibly exciting I was thrilled with the racing scenes like I was part of it, now let's talk about Christian Bale what a performance he is the star of the movie.
overall great story to be told and played well done."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,10/10,"Who cares about history? Dracula is not real he is just a fiction. So Ford vs Ferrari is something to feel good, to think you are a man but you are just a boy. Cars, intrigues, money, transactions, Ford, Ferrari you have everything in the same pool. You are not happy? Leave us! Good to see ""Tano Caridi"" after many years. Overall a very good movie."
FORD V FERRARI,21 December 2019,10/10,"As a chevorlet fan...this was regardless one of the best movies of all time even though they bashed the corvette. Even if you ARENT into cars this movie was filmed and directed so well. This is in my top 5 movies and i have only seen this movie 2 times in theaters and my top 5 list consists of 1. Shawshank redemption. 2. The Godfather. 3. The Godfather part 2. 4. Scarface. So thats saying something. I highly recommend this movie to everybody reading this dont even think twice about seeing it. Its Matt Damon, Christian Bale, and Jon Bernthal...what more could you ask for. I cant wait to go see it for my 3rd time in theater next weekend with another buddy who hasnt seen it yet."
FORD V FERRARI,29 April 2021,7/10,"This movie is pretty perfect but there are A LOT of scenes where i just make or predict the best scenario to be just amazing it always dont match up with my complicated or i should call it ""DIRECTOR THINKING "" answer ,well then the scene goes with the simple way the basic and primitive way , for example "" the scene when all the drivers ran you couldve just let Ken miles tge only one walking amongst them that would be soo cool and the commentators are like "" oooohhhhhhh miles walkkkk likee he owwwnns the racing field wooow "" its just cool man."
FORD V FERRARI,20 December 2019,10/10,"This movie was great, it had all the fun of an action film and it never slowed down. The acting was great, the plot was good, and the finale keeps you on the edge of your seat."
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,"An interesting movie, full of motion & sound
Highly recommended, the acting is amazing, picture & details
A must watch movie"
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,10/10,One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck.
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2019,8/10,"Top executed movie for car lovers having all the race scenes that Rush was missing. Make sure to watch it in top quality cinema - you won't regret it.
Also great acting - Matt Daemon and Christian Bale really is a good match of chemistry. Some great scenes from the guy playing Henry Ford II.
All in all perfectly executed movie."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,8/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is a movie based on a true story in the 60's. the movie setting was realistic because it was settle. Matt Damon and Christian Bale give brilliant performances, and what gives this movie the love it deserves. the movie covered sales and marketing so well it wasn't boring. The movie shows ken miles as a likable character even if ford didn't like him. Matt Damon role is just as good as Bales. it was"
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,10/10,"Must Watch!!!
Christian Bale Fantastic performance!!!👌👌"
FORD V FERRARI,20 December 2019,9/10,"I will say that I didn't have high expectations for this movie coming in. I was a little skeptical of all the good reviews, even though Damon and Bale were on the front line of the cast. Boy was I wrong.I don't like to give movies 10/10, (I've probably only done it once or twice in my life), but it took me several minutes to critique this movie enough to bring it down one star. My only critique is that it is a long movie. It's appx 3 hours long and you can feel it by the end.That being said, this is, in my opinion, the best movie of the year. Bale brought an Oscar winning performance as Ken Miles, a hardened, entertaining race car driver. His performance was probably one of the best of his careers. That was backed up by Damon, who played Carroll Shelby, a race car manufacturer with a love of racing. I only say that he backed up Bale because of how impressive Bale was, but if Damon had been alone in this movie, he would have easily been the star.The filming and editing was phenomenal. Sound was fantastic. The supporting cast were also great. All around, it was the most entertaining and the most inspiring movie of the year."
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,10/10,"Enjoyed everything about this movie. Christian Bale's performance was thoroughly entertaining. Matt Damon was solid along with the rest of the cast. A must see, surprisingly a lot of character development and heart."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,One of the best racing movies I've seen. Must see. 10/10
FORD V FERRARI,13 January 2020,10/10,"Yes, I could mention the fanatical leave-nothing-to-chance, try-anything-first, do-anything, gear-headed, rugged doggedness, that only sheer will and deep intestinal fortitude that Christian Bale's Ken Miles displayed in his skill and commitment who gave audiences a lesson on how to handle his car to get it done. Or, I could discuss that character appropriation we can always expect from Phenom actor Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby that he so graciously offered fans which ascended everything that was steered only by the great Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca interpretation as the boundless pit crew lead; they all literally appeared to actually be haunted by these portrayals throughout the story. This come-from-behind tale gave viewers a true appreciation of the infamous competitive history of two top-tiered car manufacturer icons Ford and Ferrari's chronological past... but to me, to me...the love story between Ken and Mollie Miles played by Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe shined bright like a diamond amidst all of the steel, rubber and tire dust. The unspoken communication they shared, the connection that they had, the space they entrusted and gifted one another to express their individual emotions, ambitions and needs is what real love looks like. Great Job!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,8/10,Seen a lot worse. Bale was really good as the brummie Ken. Some car they built.A good watch
FORD V FERRARI,17 January 2020,9/10,"But this movie got my gears grinding and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, the chemistry between Matt and Christian, legendary."
FORD V FERRARI,25 February 2020,10/10,"Christian Bale and Matt Damon - a combination which is perfect for cinema fans. This film is at least at the same level as ""Rush"" and sure one of the best films in 2019, which is tough in year where films like ""Parasite"" or ""Joker"" are the concurrence.
But this movie is not ment to be mentioned in the same list as those two films. Ford vs. Ferrari shows why and how cinema can be a wonderful experience again and again."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"+Great story telling
+Fantastic cast and performances
+Not a car fan but loved the drama and suspense-Not entirely factual but does lend itself to be explored outside of the film"
FORD V FERRARI,15 April 2020,10/10,"It's not often that I hand out a 10/10. This film earned it for staying as true as it gets to the REAL life events and characters without compromise. There are many things that an avid motorsport enthusiast who knows their history will spot. But even the errors or speculative occurances in this film are passable, and that's what made this great cinema. It's so close to the truth that those discrepancies become minute and decay as you ride along with an amazing cast. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing these historic figures because they nail it spot on. Feel free to watch any interviews with Shelby or Miles - Damon and Bale sell their performances as fact. And not one actor in this film did not complete a great job. I will say the special effects are stunning, as well as sound design. Obviously the creators of this film worked very hard with Ferrari and Ford to capture and display this amazing piece of history. I as a racing fan cannot laud this film enough. I knew it was perfect when my wife and daughters, who have little to no interest in the pursuit of speed and records, all immediately attached and engrossed theirselves with this momentous tale."
FORD V FERRARI,16 January 2020,,I enjoyed every moment of this movie. Great story and wonderful acting. I already knew a little bet of the story because it was mentioned in Grand Tour but still it was very entertaining
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,Fully enjoyed this film. It has everything you could want. Very beautifully filmed with phenomenal acting. You won't be disappointed.
FORD V FERRARI,24 January 2020,7/10,"Fantastic interpretation from Christian Bale. One of his bests.
Nice balance of comedy and drama. I don't fully understand the character development of some of the protagonists. The side cast (wife, petty vice president) feels kinda cliché; I like the interaction, even though they don't provide enough conflict. The main antagonist, Ferrari, has some nice shots but they're not a real threat because we're too immersed into the main character's personal struggle for perfection.
That finale, that missing victory, gives a lot of weight to the whole final act and to the good relationships between Miles and Shelby. But if we look at being and end point, it really says much. I'm a bit disappointed yet happy about the overall movie."
FORD V FERRARI,19 October 2020,9/10,"I think the movie takes it time to flesh out it's characters which means it's gonna be slow paced, paperwork and all that stuff but I think that's a good choice coz we need characters to care for. When the car stuff begins, the movie def serves to please audiences who love cars but also makes the right choice by making the path to success full of obstacles that characters need to think their way out. Also there's great character development for Miles due to his decision in the race.My gripes are minor, I wish we saw more of Shelby's past as a car racer.. And there was this emotional scene in the movie that could've taken more time coz I felt it was a bit fast. But like I said, minor gripes, this can be regarded as a masterpiece."
FORD V FERRARI,15 August 2021,10/10,VERY NICE Storyline and narrative arrangements. Colorful characters. Acting is on point. Loved every second of that movie.
FORD V FERRARI,5 May 2020,9/10,Since Bale is there in it you always expect something new from him and so he did in this movie too... Bale played the character of the legend Ken Miles who wheeled race for Ford and here he showed how he outrages all the problems that came between him and the track... Ken was also a veteran so Bale also tried to potray that time to time in this movie
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,1/10,"Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2020,8/10,"Based on a fascinating true story, Ford v Ferrari is a compelling period drama from director James Mangold. When Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II, Ford hires American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles to develop a race car to defeat Ferrari and win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Starring Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, and Caitriona Balfe, the film has a good cast that delivers some strong performances. And the script is especially well-written, making it easy to follow the car and racing jargon. Also, the racing scenes are incredibly exciting and kinetic. Ford v Ferrari is a captivating film about determination and the strength of the human spirit."
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,4/10,"First of all, you expect a conflict between the two adversaries mentioned in the versus that happens to be the movie's title, right? Nope...Wrong. This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: ""You won't believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari"" :PWe literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don't blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.Leaving this ""title nonsense"" behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven't heard of a machine called ""car"" before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version's essence. That would be my director's cut I guess. Long story short, you won't miss much if you don't watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn't hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time. I didn't hate the movie. It was just far behind what it offered with it's cast, 8+ star rating, fantastic reviews and so on."
FORD V FERRARI,6 September 2021,8/10,"The experience of this movie is phenomenal, although the climax is something you won't appreciate, but definitely it's an auditory Treat."
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,5/10,"It´s a film without emotion. Well filmed and with some of the best actors in the world, it practically transmits nothing. Love for cars, calling cars as if they were women, being moved by engine revolutions, have nothing to do with the current times of silent, electric and non-polluting cars. But above all they do not transmit anything, family situations, servility towards bosses, nor, how did he say any emotion."
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2019,9/10,"When you think of great sports movies, Rocky, Remember the titans and Rush comes to your mind. This movie won't be know as the best sports movie of all time but would surely be among the top 20. Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.
Solid 9 out of 10 for me. A must watch if you are a racing fan or a fan of good sports movie."
FORD V FERRARI,13 January 2020,5/10,"Christian Bale was useless at playing a Englishman - Americans just can't do English accents - they must have all gone to the Dick Van Dyke acting school!!
Why did they not cast an English actor to play the part of a Englishman? Despite this the film held together well and was very enjoyable."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,10/10,"I learned this has very little CGI. I was sure to watch this in a theatre with great sound. Man was I happy about the decision, a fantastic movie with great history to be learned. Even if you aren't a car but, this is a moving and at times funny story with amazing actors and scenes, extremely well put together. Question is, when can I go watch it again?"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,7/10,"Generally enjoyable but could have benefited from a 20-minute trim.Also, in many of the racing/practice scenes, the cars seemed to be doing about 70 while showing us speedometers indicating 200. With all the CGI in this movie, it wouldn't have taken much more of it to add a real sense of speed.Good performances, decent script. Give it a go."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Great movie. Ah, the good old days of characters and seat-of-the pants motor racing! One small thing - early in the movie they go out of their way to paint a typical 60s garage on a typical '63 American street, then Caitriona Balfe comes out to meet her husband in an anachronistic modern-style mini dress! She should have been wearing period-style women's beach shorts which would have ALSO shown off her 'loverly pins'."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,"++ Oh boy what a fantastic heart pumping thrilling movie! Christian Bale I love you man! Matt Damon we can always rely on you!
++ The way Bale delivered the script where talks about cars really excited me, because it is the same way I talk about cameras and image processing. It takes a deep passion to feel for a tool in that way, so the character of Ken Miles really touched me to the core.
++ There is an overarching theme of loving what you do and in contrast doing something for the sake of selling throughout the movie. Loved that moral battle.
-- OK cinematography but it won't matter because the acting and attention to detail in set design makes up for it."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,9/10,Awesome movie and depiction of the competition between corporate hotshots to claim title of fastest and best. Love the American spirit and determination of Shelby and Ken Miles. The respect Ferrari gave Miles was heart warming
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Amazing story, vivid, you cannot stop watching until the very end!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,10/10,"First of i dont like racing or cars, but I love this movie. Christian Bale plays his Best role ever and the story drags you in."
FORD V FERRARI,17 December 2019,5/10,"The movie follows the 90s sportsmovie structure to a tee.It's been a week since i saw the movie and I am already starting to confuse scenes in from the movie with scenes from 2006s 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby', in my head.Josh Lucas hamming it up as the movies corny antagonist - helps to blur the lines further.The movie sounds great and looks beautiful - but if you are looking for anything beyond that, this one might not be for you."
FORD V FERRARI,11 November 2020,10/10,"I absolutely love this movie, good ol american car history, about Ford and Shelby working together to race in LeMans and winning"
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2020,9/10,"What a story of two legends and it's nicely framed by Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Good direction and perfect scenes executed according to the timeline of the movie.
Although the storyline of the movie could have better been understandable to viewers if they added a few more details. But doesn't impact much.Go for it if it's in your watchlist."
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,8/10,Heartwarming story of how a multimillion dollar company beats a small Italian family owned manufacturer in car racing.
FORD V FERRARI,8 July 2020,10/10,What a wonderfully made this movie. Must watch for all race lovers. Don't miss it.
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,7/10,My family members keep wanting to go back. I've enjoyed it all three times. Christian Bale became a different person in the show. I forgot it was him and was totally into the character. Matt Damon's portrayal of Shelby also was excellent.
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,10/10,"Great movie. Go and see it. It's got all sorts of emotions.
Matt Damon and Christian Bale are superb."
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,10/10,"Took my wife, my 16 year old and 9 year old to this movie and it was fantastic. This could have been a boring movie very easily but Bale and Damon were great together."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari tells the incredible true story set in the 1960s, the movie follows the renowned ex racer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a short tempered and mildly arrogant but extremely talented driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they attempt to beat the Ferrari, the fastest car at the time with a Ford in the famous 24 hours of Le Mans.Arguably one of the most talented directors working today, James Mangold is a steady hand at the helm of this two-and-a-half-hour experience. The film's brilliance is however not the result of any single cog working to perfection but every moving part working in tandem to build a flawless machine. The direction, the editing, the performances, the score, the production design, Ford v Ferrari very literally fires on all cylinders.With a film centred on race cars and the thrill of 7000 RPM, turning the film into an unofficial Fast and Furious sequel is an unfortunate possibility. Mangold however sought something deeper than the action with this film, something more profound. At its heart Ford v Ferrari is about character and a powerful friendship. Ken Miles is a brash, often rude driver and car mechanic, a man whose real home is behind the wheel or under the hood. Shelby is a man haunted by his days of glory yet determined to push his cars across the finish line. Meanwhile the Ford Motor Company desperately searches for a revival in business, they eventually find hope for their company on the racetrack, challenging the mighty Ferrari in the 24 hours of Le Mans. Shelby, the only American who has ever won the Le Mans and Miles, the only driver who could give Ford a fighting chance tirelessly begin their work building the ultimate speed machine. The real story in this journey is the friendship between these two men and the tireless pursuit for excellence.Christian Bale once again disappears into his character, after portraying Dick Cheney in Vice, Ken Miles is a starkly different character especially physically and yet again Bale pulls off an incredible physical transformation proving once again his unbelievable commitment to his craft. Miles goes through perhaps the most elaborate emotional arcs of any character in the film, a passion for cars, a family to support, and an intolerance for the polished self-importance of big corporations. Bale conveys the sophistication of this character with ease, he becomes Miles enchanting the audience with a brash charm delivering a performance that is nothing short of Oscar worthy.Carroll Shelby is perhaps the one man who really understands Miles, the only man who sees the real brilliance of Miles and perhaps the only true friend Mile has. Damon gives this performance the force it deserves portraying a great American car manufacturer who believed in excellence and who truly understood what it took to carry home a Le Mans victory. Shelby is the audience's character, we see experience the film in his shoes, we understand the difficulty of the decisions he is forced to make, we feel the victories, the defeats and the pain with Shelby and Matt Damon brings that emotional range to his performance which again is worthy of the highest honours.When the film does hit the racetrack, when the audience is put behind the wheel, the film reveals a whole new adrenaline rush. The races are jaw droppingly brilliant. The film gives the car fanatics exactly what they want and more, the growl of the engines, the burning rubber, the screeching metal, the thrill of the race, it's all dialled to eleven. The sequences are masterfully shot, the camera is low and tight, interiors are close to the driver, we feel their heart pound as they knock the car into fifth gear, the exteriors shots are close to the ground, we see the sparks and rubble fly, we feel the heat. The grit and danger of a race is perfectly portrayed, nothing is predictable, no one is safe. Mangold creates a claustrophobic, tense yet realistic portrayal of a race giving the audience some of the greatest race sequences perhaps of all time.Ford v Ferrari is one of 2019's most entertaining experiences while telling a compelling and emotional story at the same time. There is not a moment the film takes its foot of the gas, no missed opportunities, no weak performances, no broken moments. The film is clear contender for the best of the year and is certainly worthy of the title, not only is it a cut above most of the year's filmography but it will likely stand the test of time to cement a place in Hollywood's finest moments. In a powerful moment with his son Ken Miles says, Out there is the perfect lap. You see it? As far as movies go, Ford v Ferrari is the perfect lap."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"Been said before 2 and half hours fly, great action scenes and brilliantly written, a must see on the big screen!"
FORD V FERRARI,27 August 2020,5/10,A cool movie about how North American company/team cheats in the most U.S. way to win a very famous competition and sell even more cars.
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,9/10,What a treat! I really enjoyed this movie and on numerous occasions found my heart pounding with excitement whilst grinning from ear to ear! Excellent film! Definitely worth seeing.
FORD V FERRARI,10 April 2020,8/10,"Great characters, great action, awesome insight into a ruthless rivalry. Well worth watching - insightful and entertaining."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"A story about son and father. A son who owned his dad's dream with all senses and trusted him more than anything. What a sweet fairytale! A movie about true friendship between two passionate but little crazy guy who love racing and taking challenges but not focused win only. A movie about two giant company was fighting for their glory on the mid-'60s.Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari) a true story based film. A beautiful narrative of Fearless British race car driver Ken Miles and US Automobile designer & Racing Driver Carrol Shelby.Christian Bale did a mind-blowing performance again. Matt Damon was very neat and tight and delivered exactly what it demanded from the character.A MUST watch movie who likes real-life drama, challenges, determination and madness to achieve something."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,Ford take challenge and fulfill on the hard work of Ken and Shelby. But ken didn't get the credit because of their cleverness. It was a wonderful racing movie. I started feeling like they are part of my family and it's wrong with Ken and Shelby. But the truth is today no one knows who won the race everyone know Ken. So his sacrifice is taken care of.
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,9/10,"Both Matt and Bale do a wonderful job acting here. The story itself is a beautiful one. It's a story about passion, about overcoming obsticles, about friendship and above all - the drive to win. Although the movie is quite long it does not feel like one. It sits you in for a ride that has its ups and downs, yet never gets boring or starts lagging.I loved this piece and would recommend to everybody weather a car or racing fan or not."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,Well scripted and picturised. Legendary history and great performances.
FORD V FERRARI,29 September 2020,7/10,"First rate acting from the entire cast. Some nits: Bale felt a little over the top. I can't not see the Punisher when Bernthal strides on screen. Balfe played a minor role, but her outburst in the car felt like it was shoved in to provide some character development. McKinnon was absolute perfection, like they just borrowed him from a real pit crew. The story doesn't pull you in. There aren't big dramatic moments that mattered to me. Instead, the acting and dialogue were enough to pull me in and enjoy the flow of the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,29 August 2020,3/10,"I tried to watch the film, but it was too annoying. First Matt Damon is negotiating with Lee Iacocca -character while chewing gum the whole time. In the next scene he is talking with Christian Bale with food in his mouth. Had to stop at that point, sorry."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,9/10,Wonderful drama has this movie. I really loved this movie..Matt Demon done his job very good and all the characters done there job. This movie deserve The Oscar and Sir Christian Bale deserve The best actor awar. Finally I would like to see everybody shoud watch this flim..
FORD V FERRARI,28 March 2020,8/10,"Excellent true story about how ford beat(took revenge) ferarri in 24 hours le man after ferarri pulled out of a deal to sold ferarri to ford and instead sold it to Fiat.
Cristian Bale and Mat Damon were execellent in their characters.
Races looked amzingly real. Direction,cinematography,editing were great too.
It's worth the time and you will not be disappointed.
8/10"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,10/10,"Matt Damon at this best: smart and steady. Christian Bale at his best: versatile and quirky. I think that this is American movie-making at its best. It's not high-brow art. There's no super sophisticated dialogue. Average people will love it, and critics will tear it apart. But it speaks to an ideal that many of us remember: when the U.S. created quality automobiles, when many people had work, and when being competitive in areas of production was important. It's pre-NASCAR, and driving LeMans is a different type of racing."
FORD V FERRARI,6 November 2019,10/10,You must watch this incredible movie. Everything is perfect.
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2021,8/10,"Not as a racing flick, but as a movie altogether.The way Bale portrayed the daunting pursuit of perfection has brought this one in the group of films which can be counted on one hand that have made me shed a few. Damons delivery was also up there.Also more of a 8.5 rather than an 8"
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,10/10,The acting was so classic.this movie is just amazing specially ending waooo it's amazing.
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,10/10,It's a very good movie.I recommend this for car lovers
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,10/10,What an amazing movie this is. Great Performance by Christian Bale and Matt Demon. I enjoyed every single minute of this movie. It's a Must Watch Film.My Score 10/10
FORD V FERRARI,29 June 2020,10/10,"This movie was so good, I had to go to the movie theaters to watch it more than once."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2020,10/10,This is one of the best movies ive seen starring Christian Bale. The sound needs to be very loud and clear to fully enjoy this movie. This is one of the most captivating stories and Christian Bale does a incredible job at playing the raw tough guy character that drives the Ford GT to victory.
FORD V FERRARI,11 May 2020,9/10,"Great script. Great chemistry. A great ""buddy"" movie, but so much more. 2.5 hours will fly by so fast!"
FORD V FERRARI,1 July 2020,10/10,You won't regret watching this Biopic.Gr8 Experience.
FORD V FERRARI,8 October 2021,5/10,"So not much really happens for such a long film. It's more like a snapshot of the characters, certainly don't get to know them any better by the end of the film than you do just after their first introduction. There's a couple of races, some people yell a bit, some nasty guy tries to get his way and annoy people, and so on. I don't know, it's like the actors were really great at pulling off playing authentic seeming boring people. A rating of 5 is pretty high but films can certainly be a lot worse than this just that they can also be a lot better."
FORD V FERRARI,27 February 2020,6/10,"This is THE AVERANGE HOLLYWOOD FILM. The movie goes on the same old tracks of every Hollywood movies: done well, but nothing original. Oh, sure: Christian Bale and Matt Damon are twe great actors, but they are wasted in these standard roles. I shut down the TV after 60 minutes of this boring show."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"Straightforward story: build race cars that can win Le Mans.
But that is only the start...you need the best driver in the business, even if he is a bit touchy now and then. Not sure the corporate obstacles were real, but I suppose the writers needed to add some conflict. Nah...1 point deduction.
Racing/testing scenes are really well done. Fast and furious, indeed."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,8/10,"*Ford vs Ferrari*
Certainly a movie for car racing fans, but more so for vintage cars enthusiasts. Christian Bale excels his acting skills as the protagonist as a car tester/mechanic/racer. Matt Damon gives a great supporting performance. However, Jon Bernthal seems to be a wasted cast since his part where his performance matters gets peaked in the first 40 minutes. He appears to have no potential role after that. Nevertheless, watching the drama between team Ferrari and Ford unfold with sleek shining vintage beauties is a treat for eyes and ears. Cinematography, sound-mixing, screenplay, and editing is on point.
My rating 7.9 🌟"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,5/10,"This is as simple as a kids Movie and the stereotype characters and simple-minded dialogues made me laugh. Womens (beside Ms. Miles) are completely missing. A lot of scenes are ungainly constructet (wheel nut, stopwatch, ...) or just boring. And why the hell Mr. Miles carries everywhere in the world everytime the same coffee pot? And beside all this to me the race scenes weren't really thrilling."
FORD V FERRARI,24 January 2020,9/10,Great popcorn movie that you'd have to be dead to not enjoy. It is a bit on the long side. I think they stretched it out to give their characters depth.
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,9/10,"Beautiful, and creative in conveying the feelings of enthusiasm and joy and fear and anticipation, representatio is beautiful especially Christian Bell.
8.5 Fair rating"
FORD V FERRARI,2 March 2020,6/10,"I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half"
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,10/10,"A true story told well. Excellent acting from all the cast. The crew is also to be commended for the excellent work on this film. Great story and plot line, plenty of action. Fun, funny at times, serious at times, but at all times entertaining. Bravo! One of the best movies of the year. This movies is going to be a sell out. Get your tickets early!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2019,8/10,"Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,1/10,"This movie deserves no awards, no nominations, no high ratings. Waste of time. Probably they paid a loooooot in promotion. Comes to show you AGAIN to not trust critics. Embarrassing at least. I didn't know the story and during the entire movie I was wispering ""America First""... Hahahaha. After the end I ended up saying ""... and Second and Third"". MAGA people will love it"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,10/10,"As all of the true masterpieces, Ford v Ferrari isn't only about the race, rather more compelling challenge of the life. Where individualism comes to question should we rethink our values on collectivism? What makes the perfect connection between you and family and how true are our friendships are the questions that the movie challenges it's viewers. Funny yet thrilling story dramatized in the most perfect way possible. It doesn't matter if one outpowers the other, what matters is to win the race of life!"
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,8/10,"To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."
FORD V FERRARI,31 August 2020,,"Have no idea how this is a 8.1, but newer movies especially big blockbusters always get a high rating on IMDB, a 6 rating is probably generous"
FORD V FERRARI,23 September 2020,9/10,Ken miles was bought to life by an amazing performance from Christian bale and equally supported by Matt Damon. Exceptional direction and well written script makes it worth it.
FORD V FERRARI,28 September 2020,9/10,"I liked the movie from beginning to end. It captures the life from the 60's spot on.
Story it's self is great Ford vs Ferrari and actor's nailed this movie. I highly recommended to watch this."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,8/10,"From the director of ""Logan"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""Identity"" comes a true story about Ford's attempt to take Ferrari from the throne of Le Mans.
This film is an embodiment of a careless and fun experience. Because of the perfect pacing, the film manages to keep you engaged and entertained for 2 and a half hours.
This film could be separated into two sections. The first one is a preparation for the minor races and the big finale. The second section would be racing itself. The first two acts are about the relationship between Damon's and Bale's characters. Although, it's not anything new or spectacular, their relationship was very well executed and you could've believed that they were good friends. They didn't show that at all times, but you could feel it because of the tight script which elevated both of their characters. Besides their relationship, the film focuses a lot on a behind the scene conflicts in a Ford company. Yet again, because of the script that ended up being very interesting. The rest of the film focuses on a racing, and I was actually surprised by how much runtime racing took. The grand finale takes almost a whole third act, and because of the way it was filmed, you don't even notice that. When the film gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself into a racing contest, it doesn't let go of you. That brings us to the best part of the film, and that was the way it was filmed, and also the whole production design. It's impressive that they managed to almost completely avoid the usage of CGI. Instead, they shoot the racing sequences in the cars whilst driving. When you're shooting that in a practical way, it's easier to get the audience invested. You notice appealing camera angles, immersive sound design, production design and all the details that went into designing this film. One of the reasons why did they choose that approach is James Mangold, who is the creator of that idea. He had a vision and he accomplished to achieve it. He's slowly becoming one of the most versatile directors working today. He touched almost every genre there is, and yet, he did not make a terrible film so far. Besides his visual decisions, he managed to pull out incredible performances from the whole cast. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were incredible. Damon in a bit subtle role and Bale in a showier role, both of them delivered. It's a shame that both of them are being campaigned for a leading category at the Oscars, so they are probably going to cancel each other's votes, but nonetheless, they were at the top of their game. Besides them, I would like to compliment Jon Bernthal, who in his short time on the screen put a damn good performance.This film is definitely one of the better technical achievements of this year. If you're interested in seeing this film, check it out whilst it's still in cinemas. Watching it in cinemas certainly elevates the experience, and it emphasizes the huge amount of attention to details."
FORD V FERRARI,22 June 2020,8/10,I don't know a crap about car racing but the way the movie has been made it kept me on the edge for the entire 2.5 hrs. I think this is what proves the quality of a sports movie when it keeps a novice interested and Google-ing about the details of that sport..
FORD V FERRARI,2 August 2020,10/10,"It's so frustrating and saddening to see this happen on screen and Christian Bale and Matt Damon has done a fantastic job, bringing the same feeling to the screen."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2021,9/10,"Terrific narrative of the effort by Shelby and Miles to take on the night of Ferrari in racing .. gripping , wonderful performances .. Damon and Bale both playing their roles with class and cool .. and the race scenes have their Adrenalin punch .. must watch."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"What a movie!! Amazing acting, super script, great direction.
BALE has did it again, unbelievable act by him once again.
BALE & DAMON works as a team, which will hold you to your chair."
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,10/10,Christian Bale and Matt Damon work great together in this wonderful show. The show keeps you on your toes the whole time about both of there lives. Great to learn the journey these two went through to make a car for Ford. Highly recommend seeing this show!!
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"I sat down front with the surround hi-tech sound vibrating my whole body as the revs passed 7000 causing my adrenaline to kick me into high gear. And the movie was good too: acting supreme, the car fast beyond imagination, and the people just as real, keeping me riveted to the screen 'til the very end. I don't doubt that was exactly how it played out.The only downside was that every time I instinctively reached for the gear shift, it was on the other side. But I'll get it right after a few more laps!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2021,10/10,"Car movies are actually hard to do well, and car people are a tough crowd. Cars are harder to shoot well and they're harder to get people deeply emotionally attached about. This one was cinematically beautiful all the way through, had solid character development that actually got you attached to the characters, and the storyline was beautifully told with just enough detail to be unique, but not so much detail to clutter the storyline or distract and confuse the viewers. As a mechanic and occasional track driver myself, this is my favorite car movie to date and I've seen a lot of them."
FORD V FERRARI,18 May 2021,9/10,"Matt Damon & Christian Bale shine in this docuclassic based on true events! As a fan of Ford products, I found this storyline quite refreshing. Enjoyed this film! Easy 9 out of 10 stars.... Bravo!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Definitely one of the best race movies ever, but with a buddy-friendship story ode to Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby plot as well as little guys against the big establishment that any non-car guy could enjoy, so your wife will enjoy it too. My wife loved it, but she does drive a 429 hp AMG E53 cabriolet, so she's definitely an honorary car guy.See it in a good theater with a full sized screen and top sound so you can experience the amazing race cinematography and feel the roaring engines in your chest.Christian Bale gives one of his his best Oscar worthy career performance as Ken Miles, from a long list of career Oscar quality performances in movies like Vice, The Big Short, The Fighter, and American Hustle.A must see future iconic movie right up there with James Garner's Grand Prix and Steve McQueen's LeMans.Now, every time I get into my 2009 911 C4S, I want to wind it out in second gear to over 7000 rpm's just to hear the engine scream."
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,9/10,"It's not an ""important"" movie, but it's very entertaining and very re-watchable. Matt Damon and Christian Bale give solid performances as usual, as does the rest of the cast. Good direction and I loved the use of the song Polk Salad Annie. I had a minor problem with some aspects of the ending, but nothing worth bringing up."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,7/10,"(translation from Italian) American films all have their roots in the Western: the man who faces others, the man who faces nature, the man who faces the great challenge. In this film the great challenge takes place with two extraordinary protagonists: Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Because this film to express its epic is implanted on the model of the Western and on these modern knights who ride the steel and ride the engines, but the structure and narration are those of the Western. The merit of the director is that he has found this formula. In a show business which is now flawed and calibrated by digital, he first rediscovered an epic realism - as he had already done with Logan, his previous film - that brings us back with this strength and courage. The film is important for its realism: cars and races shoots delude us that we are really there, because they are not simply digital, they are true and perhaps enriched by digital, but not fake and electronic. You can almost hear the cinema seats vibrate in the race. I have been and am a passionate driver so I found myself immersed in the cars of the 60s. I had had some of them and I reviewed them like old loves. I told to the person sitting next to me that I suffered as a lifer forced to watch an adult movie in prison, because seeing again the forms of those cars, hearing the engines roar of cars I had, remembering the feelings and emotions I felt was poignant and beautiful. So, my review is definitely partial because I couldn't get away, though I tried to be cold, from the charm of these engines. By the way, we talk about mythical cars because there are the Le Mans 24 Hours Ferraris, which therefore are absolutely extraordinary and there are the Fords made for this challenge. Indeed, the root of the film is this. There is a famous line by Henry Ford I - in the film there is his nephew Henry Ford II - who in 1909 created the first inexpensive automobile because he introduced moving assembly belts to make various mechanical parts and his assembly line was revolutionary, a production system called Fordism. Ford had his own way of making it clear what was his marketing concept: ""Any customer can have a Model T painted any color that he wants - Model T was Ford first model - as long as it's black."" His grandson Henry Ford II is the protagonist of the challenge against Enzo Ferrari. Everyone knows the myth and strength of Ferrari. While Ford Motor Company was born in 1909, the racing team Scuderia Ferrari was born in 1929, but in 1937 Alfa Romeo for which Ferrari developed race cars decides to regain full control of its racing division and immediately after the war in 1947 Enzo Ferrari founds Ferrara S.p.A. which is the most successful team in the world with 15 World Drivers Championship titles and 16 Constructors. So clearly Henry Ford II realizes to have a titan next to him and despite having the biggest automobile industry of the time he must face a Goliath who has no slingshot, but a bullet, or rather a cannon in his hand and therefore can beat him at any time. However, the power of money, strength and will in the film are also born by Lee Iacocca, his marketing expert, who starts the challenge. Although actually it is said that one day Henry Ford II wanted to drive a Ferrari and after a lap, when he got off, he said: ""It's a perfect car, that damn Ferrari must have hired God to design it."" In this kind of respect there is all the film yeast, the spring that triggers the story, making Ford decide to beat Ferrari on Le Mans race. 24 diabolic and terrible hours, whatever the weather: with the fog, with rain, with cold for 24 hours at a time the cars must run at infernal speed, reaching the famous, desperate, terrible 7,000 rpm. At 7,000 rpm it immediately goes out of phase and the cars grab, so you have to be constantly careful. The one with the most resistant rider wins with the best pilot, with the best car, more reliable, more powerful. These two elements combined must shoot in this hellish carousel for 24 hours, challenged by other terrible pilots with other diabolical cars. All against all in this eternal lap. The night goes down and you must run, the fog rises and you must run, rain comes and you must run, there is the sun that breaks the stones and you have to keep running. This is the 24 Hours of Le Mans and who wins there it's like he came out of hell. From 1960 Ferrari had won 5 times in a row and at this point it's up to Ford to beat him choosing two knights as Shine. In a western movie they would have been two gunslingers: one who has fought so many challenges, but is temporarily disabled - in a western movie he would be wounded in one hand or he would have the classic shoulder injury while his friend tells him ""Come on, we'll make it"" - and must train another gunslinger for this challenge, perhaps younger, perhaps less experienced, maybe as good as him, but irascible, not controllable. Therefore this couple joins to face this challenge by transforming it - and this is thanks to director James Mangold - in a talent challenge against marketing because it's not just Ford against Ferrari, but also the eternal challenge that is always there between artistic flash and prosaic reality. Ford makes this race to sell cars, so he must win but he must sell, while instead Ferrari makes the race for his pride, just to win. So this great challenge begins."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,"Okay, get this out of the way first: 7000 revolutions per minute - the limit of the Ford 427 engine... or better, the limit of the valvetrain. A stock(ish) 427 will start to float its valves above 7k and lose power. This was it... it's not a hard limit, a few years later these FE motors were turning 8-8500rpms, but the screenwriter for some odd reason focused on this minutiae. Everything else is perfect; although we know what happened in '66, everyone in the theater was sitting on the edge of their seats. The sounds were great, the straight-cut gears in the gearbox whining louder and higher as the car accelerates, with the staccato of an almost-no-exhaust V8, all piped through THX speakers is close to a religious experience, especially as very few of us got to hear this monster live.
Acting is on point, finally a movie where Christian Bale doesn't have to fake an American accent, Matt Damon pulls off a seemingly effortless Carrol Shelby - no doubt weeks and weeks of acting work and watching Shelby interviews went into it, but the whole movie just feels like one of those special ones, where the actors just enjoyed themselves."
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2019,8/10,"Cristian Bale puts his method acting to perfection, getting inside the character of the talented race driver Miles. While Matt puts in a sophisticated performance as a racer-turned-businessman, it is Bale who rules the little-longer-than-needed film time. The characters have been drawn out beautifully in the early part of the movie & the crux of the Ford vs Ferrari rivalry hits the peak during the climax. A special mention goes out to the child actor who portrays Miles' kid for betraying the innocence & excitement of the racing phenomena which swept the early 60s. If you enjoyed Ron Howard's Rush for the personal rivalry of James Hunt vs Nicki Lauda, you should definitely watch out as the giants Automobiles lock horns through the amazing driving skills of its racers. Go for the film in IMAX or 4DX wherever possible, and you would find the time just zip past you."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"Overall, it's an entertaining story for those who know little of the actual timeline of events but the full story would have taken a six hour movie to be accurate. So they've taken a decade-plus series of events and compressed them into a one year tale that's filled with excitement and drama.For 60's racing fans, and antique car buffs in general, there is plenty of eye candy that should satisfy, although I'm sure many of the race cars shown are most likely CGI; it's hard to tell anymore."
FORD V FERRARI,1 January 2020,10/10,"This was the best movie I saw in 2019. Full disclosure, I'm a Star Wars Fanatic, a Scorsese Fan and both had a great release in 2019.What makes this movie engaging is that you get invested into the characters both for their skills and their very human fallibility.The racing action is thrilling and the technology of the modern age can render the sights and sounds of the'60s racing likely better than the real thing."
FORD V FERRARI,29 February 2020,9/10,Really enjoyed this film...Christian bale was outstanding...an interesting piece on history. Sad too
FORD V FERRARI,12 November 2019,10/10,This movie was so good that everything in it was perfect. Hats off to all cast and crews. All the action sequence were amazing and the plot was also moving with character development. James Mangold once again proves himself as a superfine director.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,"Just go and watch. All things will justify themselves. Characters, direction etc placed perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"This is the most entertaining and one of the most satisfying films I've seen in years. Don't let viewer reviews by racing snobs deter you from seeing it. Two and a half hours flew by. The script is tight and efficient with great pacing and just the right amount of drama, the racing scenes are thrilling and all the performances are excellent, with Christian Bale the standout. My husband and I have very different tastes in movies and this is one of the few that had enough action for him along with a captivating story for me; we were both riveted throughout. The whole film is as exciting and fun as the previews conveyed, which is rare in my experience."
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,7/10,"I'm not much of a car fanatic let alone racing fanatic but the story had me intrigued enough to go see it and I was not disappointed!Ford v Ferrari tells the story of how Ford made it's first racing car with an aim to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in France over Ferrari who had won the last four years. At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.Let's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.I also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.The film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,10/10,"Great movie, amazing acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Cars and racing scenes were amazing. One of the best movies of this year."
FORD V FERRARI,22 June 2020,9/10,"I've seen all the big ones and this is the best. Christian Bale, who I don't particularly like, was outstanding."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,10/10,Loved it. Outstanding performance. You can feel the engines. Simply wow!!
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,8/10,"I have read several of the reviews posted here for ""Ford vs. Ferrari,"" and I generally agree with most of the criticisms: too long (15-30 minutes could have been cut, in my opinion), too many cliched scenes, and a very cliched character in the form of Leo Beebee, a Ford executive, who is clearly supposed to embody evil, soulless corporate greed (in case you have an IQ under 50 and can't figure that out within the first two minutes that character is on screen). Finally, I agree that Christian Bale's accent sounded cockney as opposed to Brummie--and I'm an American. Speaking of accents, I am surprised none of the nit-pickers here has mentioned something else I found slightly annoying: the character of Ken Miiles' son is portrayed by a boy with a strong English accent, but Miles' son was growing up in California and therefore would have had an American accent. Maybe the producers just thought a kid with an English accent would sound more appealing to audiences. (The child is a good actor, at any rate.)All that aside, even a huge movie snob like me found the film highly entertaining, and the length bothered me less than in other overly-long movies. (I believe most Hollywood movies in recent years could benefit from losing at least 15 minutes, frankly--Black Panther and Wonder Woman immediately spring to mind, although there are many others.) I did not go to see this expecting a documentary but rather to be entertained. I will add that I attended it with my brother, who is a former automotive journalist and therefore, to put it mildly, a real ""petrolhead,"" While he commented that there were definitely historical inaccuracies in the film, he genuinely enjoyed it as well. (Since leaving automotive journalism behind, my brother has worked in Hollywood, so that probably helps; he does not have any expectation that a Hollywood release is aiming for historical accuracy, since he knows that business well too.) However, I can understand why other automotive and/or racing obsessives might be more bothered by the film's flaws. If you are simply looking for well-acted, fast-paced (well, during the on-track scenes) fun, I highly recommend this."
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,10/10,This a movie that makes your adrenaline rush as well as makes you cry. I haven't watched a movie like this in a while.
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,2/10,"Ye Gods, what a dreadful film. What is that Christian Bale character supposed to be? That cockney accent (I think?)... Dick van Dyke springs to mind. And his 'missus' - coom in fora cuppa. But that doesn't go near explaining how dreadful it all is - the two cars racing side by side, for miles(!) with the drivers staring across at each other. Yeah. At two hundred miles an hour. And how many cliches do you want? Ferrari are Italian? Lets make all their team and mechanics, like.. excitable. Peter Sellers could have got the gig. And Ken is on the bus on the way to Le Mans.. it's France! Let's sit two nuns behind him. He gets off the bus. We'll have two gendarmes walking past. Christ, send for Sellers! Get him out that Ferrari gear. He now should speak like zees! I nearly walked out. Y"
FORD V FERRARI,5 May 2021,10/10,Absolutely amazing. The movie shows Ken Miles as the genius he is. Was kind of bummed out by the unnecessary PR stunt of Ford at the end but still is a masterpiece showing the rivalry of motorsport.
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,10/10,"Amazing movie, I think it will win the Oscars ..
Wow wow wow"
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,"Everything is amazing.... Woooow , the best movie of the year"
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,7/10,I like cars. So therefore I now I liked the movie more than I would have if I wasn't a car person. It was quiet good. Not amazing. They forgot Ferrari after the beginning in the movie then they suddenly were in the movie againin the end.Spoiler: When Ken crashed the Ford GT at the test track and the car exploded it was extremely unrealistic that he got out completely fine with no burns. Nobody would survive that.
FORD V FERRARI,15 March 2020,6/10,"Good racing scenes, ruined by flat characters (what was the point of Miles's wife being there) and a terrible hamming up by Christian Bale, apparently using his own English accent, but managing to make himself sound like Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Very sexist too."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,10/10,"Brilliant cast and the cars and action all filled out a fantastic story with humour, drama, excitement, suspense and sadness all in exactly the right balance.
One of the best films of the year, I wouldn't change a single thing about it."
FORD V FERRARI,17 March 2020,10/10,"An absolutely amazing movie, incredible acting, cinematography, incredible everything.Christian bale as always, was brilliant. Incredible performance by him. You would he engrossed from the beginning to the end. Matt damon was also amazing.
All in all, an absolutely brilliant film and a must watch"
FORD V FERRARI,7 April 2020,9/10,"This movie is fantastic. It is so gripping, you can't help wonder what would happen next. Story is excellent, acting and cast is excellent.
I would not watch the last 5 minutes of the film because it was unnecessary and ruined a perfectly happy ending. BUT the rest of the movie was fantastic."
FORD V FERRARI,5 May 2020,9/10,"A film about the creators of a sports car for ford by Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. Shows the struggle and competitive spirit between the two companies Ford and Ferrari. Fighting individuals with corporate leadership goals. A balance is maintained between racing action scenes and dramatic moments. You, as a spectator, believe in Bale's game and what is happening on the screen. Worth mentioning is CGI, which harmoniously complements the racing scene. Sad only olied and expectad ending."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2020,9/10,Great combination of the small man's human drama and the pure octane racing is what makes this movie very likable even in between people that are not fond of racing sports.Christian Bale delivering again with yet another superb performance and exceptional picture with academy awards for best sound and film editing are the main reasons that this movie is of such a high value.
FORD V FERRARI,15 September 2021,8/10,"Nothing to say. It's a real story. And the film was really heart touching. ""Don't Drive! After watch this film""."
FORD V FERRARI,16 June 2020,10/10,"Ken Miles should have won! The ending should have had either: KEN MILES CLEARLY WINING, OR; Ford wining the race in a three-way tie. Anyway, THIS MOVIE IS IN MY TOP TEN FAVORITE MOVIES! The Chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale is just Badass! And this movie is obviously my favorite sports movie! DUH! Thank you Ford!"
FORD V FERRARI,6 September 2020,9/10,"A lot of passion was put into this film and you can tell when just about the entire cast put on their A-game. Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon put on very memorable performances and the supporting cast all did such a fine job.Not a moment was wasted in Ford v Ferrari, and not a dull in sight. Even if you can't label yourself a car aficionado, there's truly something for everybody in this piece. FvF is part history, part underdog story and part bromance. The chemistry runs wild.The cinematography and the composition of every frame is absolutely fantastic. Every shot in the film felt planned out and at times very creative use of lighting and frame work.If you love cinema at all, this one won't disappoint. Ford v Ferrari is a must-see."
FORD V FERRARI,23 March 2021,10/10,"There's a point at 7,000 RPM...
where everything fades.
the machine became weightless.
just disappears.
All that remains is just a body doing time and distance,7000 RPM
that's where you meet it you feel it coming.
it ereeps up on you close in your ear.
ask you a question.
the only question that matters.
WHO ARE YOU...??"
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,6/10,A combination of boredom and farce. The slow predictable trawl of Iacocca round Italy; the ridiculous characterization of John Miles and the car races turned into demolition derbys; the complete disregard of co-drivers; the simplistic portrayal of Ferrari. The best thing you can do with this movie is switch it off and slip in a copy of Grand Prix which really captures 1960's motor sport.
FORD V FERRARI,4 October 2020,10/10,"I have no more words for this movie than PERFECT!! If you love cars, this is the perfect movie for you, if you don't... Well, It's still the perfect movie for you!Recommend it for everyone!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 September 2020,9/10,"Its a wonderful movie. Gorgeous visuals, great acting, intense, based on real story."
FORD V FERRARI,27 December 2020,9/10,"I don't know anything about race cars really, so I don't know what struck me to watch this movie. But I don't regret it. It was more than just racing.
Acting was phenomenal, except for one or two lines I heard come out of Henry Ford II. Expect to be enthralled by the characters (I absolutely love the dynamic between Ken Miles and Shelby), but even more so by the movie itself. At some points suspense had me ready to jump off my seat. Humor always kicked in at just the right moments too.
I feel like the movie is sending a message about trying to find the balance between trusting yourself, leading, and trusting others, following them, in order to speed to your goals without exploding. That's what I got from it, and if I'm right about the message, I think it's a good one.
Feel like this review is turning out a bit messy, but like Shelby says in the movie, sometimes ""words just are not useful.""
Just know, the movie's pretty darn good."
FORD V FERRARI,2 October 2021,9/10,"Loved the movie with such great story and cinematography, if you like to know turning points in history for great creation and if you like cars mist watch movie for you!"
FORD V FERRARI,3 November 2021,9/10,"Christian bale is incredible in the role of ken miles, the cinematography is beautiful you feel like youre in the car, the plot is a thrilling ,based on a true story' story."
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2020,10/10,"Pure adrenaline rush for an automobile fanatic like me!
Spot on performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon.
Movie takes you into a beautiful era of 60's racing when GT40 was introduced. You get to witness all historical moments, incidents and achievements.
Lovely background score and scenes behind wheel. Bloody hot Le Mans racing action scenes.
Very lively flick. It's like you're actually seeing everything happening now. Full of emotions, drama, laughs and action packed pit crew performances during racing. Thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
What a nostalgic experience.
Hats off to director, cast and crew for delivering a masterpiece .Definite collector's choice for racing fans."
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2019,8/10,"Having just stepped out of an advanced screening of le Mans 66 or Ford vs Ferrari if you prefer, I was really looking forward to this film and I wasn't disappointed. As a fan of the 24hr race I found the racing scenes to be heart pounding, adrenalin pumping and visually breathtaking. The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair. It's not just thrills either. There are genuinely touching moments in this film with a great supporting cast and a great villain in Enzo Ferrari. I loved it and if you have an interest in the source material you won't find a better petrol fuelled film this year. SA"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,8/10,I am not a fan of Motorsports or a rev head. However this movie was awesome. I was reluctant to see this but was blown away by the performances and the story.
FORD V FERRARI,14 May 2021,10/10,"America first! In the 24 hrs of Le Mans in 1966 at least... Great movie with Mr Damon and Mr Bale in great shape in a true story.Fantastic race scenes and swinging sixties music. Even if you're not a race lover (I mean the sport, not the skin colour issue) you'll love the performance."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,1/10,"One word: boring. Whoever thought this was a good idea for a movie should learn programming computers to perform specific functions. They should certainly never work at anything requiring interaction with the public. No good guys, bad guys, twists, or payoffs on the supposed expectations. I don't viscerally hate many movies. This is one. I usually like Damon, Bale, Berndahl, and many of the other cast. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. If you really want to check this out, wait for free streaming somewhere. This is clearly one of those movies that critics are pushing to demonstrate their ""influence"" or get paid, and there are so many fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews here it's hard to trust IMBD anymore."
FORD V FERRARI,13 April 2020,8/10,"Although based on the true events leading up to, and during, the 1966 Le Mans 24 hour race, there are quite a few inaccuracies in the story told here. For most people though, this is an enjoyable movie as Bale and Damon are on top form. Motor racing fans will love the racing scenes with good close up action featuring legendary Fords, Ferraris, and Porsches. At around two and a half hours, the overall pace should have been a bit faster, after all it is about racing! As always, many reviews here on IMDB make interesting reading, just don't believe the very negative ones."
FORD V FERRARI,22 October 2019,10/10,"Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,10/10,"Determination, challenges and rising above is what this movie is about. This true story takes you for a ride that you can feel. A brilliant piece of cinema, in my top movies of all time.
Thank you for telling this story in a beautiful, thrilling way."
FORD V FERRARI,30 March 2020,10/10,"I will have to start by saying I am biased allready before seeing this movie. Sorry, but that's the truth. I am a huge fan of Carroll Shelby, and especially of his awesome creation, the classic, 427 Cobra. He is also an automotive legend who, togeather with Ken Miles, made racing history. I can only say thank you, to the both of them, thank you very much!The film Ford vs Ferrari was truly exciting from start to finish (line), and I loved every second of it. Just as other great racing films prior, like the classic Le Mans with Steve McQueen, and Days of Thunder with Tom Cruise, it brings out the best of automobile racing. These films all capture the essence of motor sports, each in their own way, showing what it takes to be a winner, including the dangers of speed that follows.The film gets a perfect 10 in my book as I felt completely entertained throughout the whole film. I am not rating it on absolute historical accuracy, or total perfection when it comes to the art of filmmaking, but as an enthralling, riveting, really awesome, kick-ass movie for all to enjoy. It may be a bit much jargon for those with less interest in cars or racing, but stil, one hell of a flick!R.I.P. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Drama, action, comedy, sick racing scenes. Loved the relationship between the father and his son as well as his wife. The movie kept me interested the entire time.
Christian Bale played his part so well. Matt Damon was awesome as well. In fact, the entire cast was great.
This is one movie that you will want to take the family to see it on the big screen.
My 12 year old said it was the best movie he has seen in a long time. That is something special coming from a kid his age.
Thank you Hollywood for coming out for a great movie that breaks your heart and cheers your heart."
FORD V FERRARI,30 May 2020,8/10,Amazingly good movie. Great story and well acted. Even better to see all the old cars when they were new. If you are an old car nut you will love it. Seeing 66 Falcons roll off the production was really cool.
FORD V FERRARI,19 March 2020,10/10,One of the best films I've ever seen it's as simple as that.
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Car enthusiasts should enjoy the movie, great racing scenes, superb acting by all, awesome cars and as it's based on a true story you may learn some historical facts too which was interesting and prompted me to do some more research on the events after watching the film, well done A+"
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2019,10/10,"I was a bit skeptical about seeing the movie in the theatre but i booked the ticket and went for it. Good thing i did. I feel this is a movie that has to be experienced in the theatre. The racing scenes are AMAZING. The story is amazing. The acting is simply brilliant. If you are a racing fan, I expect you will enjoy this more than anyone and it is a must see. But whoever wants to cry, smile and feel adrenaline all packed into a movie, definitely go watch this!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 April 2020,8/10,"'Le Mans '66' (Ford v Ferrari), directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line), is a feel-good family flick that looks at the true story of Ford's car designer Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon (The Martian) and his driver Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight) - where they go head to head with Ferrari in the 1966 'Le Mans' motorsport race.My first impression of the film, after watching the trailer, was; ""this looks and feels like 'Rush'."" 2013's 'Rush', directed by Ron Howard, a film I enjoyed very much - felt comforting and easy-going - even though there is a literal turn for the worse, there's still a warmness to the narrative that feels very smart and cool (at all corners). I was imagining 'Le Mans '66' to be very similar to 'Rush', and thankfully it was - my expectations were met. It had all the same coolness, slick dialogue and fast story. What appealed to me during both films was their aesthetically pleasing setting. I found myself wanting to be in the South of France or Northern Italy, laying in the sun and drinking a beer. 'Le Mans '66' draws you into to its ambience so well and it actually makes you feel present. I have watched it twice now and could easily watch it again, especially when the weather is looking grey.A few pointers - looking at the technical side of film, the pacing was good as it kept the story fun and engaging though the duration of the film could have been shorter. Some scenes were not particularly interesting or necessary. There was a lot of exposition during the first act which had me wishing for a more conversational dialogue. A lot of what happened could have been explained in a less amount of time. Even so, it wasn't something I cared much about - its production value and sixties appeal had me glued to the screen. However, it was sometimes hard to settle down because of Bale's, over-the-top, accentuated accent but again, as time progresses, it was not something that bothered me throughout. Having said this, I thought Shelby and Miles' on screen relationship was joyful and convincing. Their narrative was interesting and gave me a better understanding about a story I never knew existed. Sometimes biopics have a better way of delivering information - due to their motivating characterisations and re-imaging of crucial events. For example, the racing sequences have more emphasis than actuality, (don't hold me to this - I have never been to a race in my life). However, the brilliant 'Academy Award' wining sound, edited by Donald Sylvester (Logan) and the great use of camera work by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (Nebraska) - puts you behind the wheel of the iconic 'Ford GT40'.For someone that has a mild interest in cars and motorsport - I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone - especially if you have a fascination about exhaust pipes."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Very good movie, not only for petrol heads.
Well shot and played, good sound and overall very good put together. Family friendly."
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,9/10,"I'll start by saying that I am more of a casual fan of racing (Love rally racing though) , I do adore cars however. ( I adored seeing the Chevy racing team with their Corvettes early on in the movie)
Even if you have no love or interest in either of these, it should still not dissuade you from seeing this movie.The acting is top notch, as you would expect with Bale and Damon at the helm, but the whole cast is stunning. The story is based on the 1966 '24 Hours of Le Mans', and the resounding duel between the all-American, yet struggling Ford racing team and the already legendary Italian Ferrari team.I won't go to much into the plot but, I left the cinema for the first time in awhile feeling fulfilled by a movie, the visuals are excellent the cars and settings accurate and there was clearly oodles of love and adoration poured into this movie.
The racing scenes are the highlight, they are incredibly tense and gripping,making the rivalry between the 2 companies come to a very satisfying boil and conclusion.If you don't understand the love many of us have for cars and racing, this movie will make you understand. It makes me truly happy seeing the passion and love for motor-sports and cars in general being shown by the characters and clearly present in the writers. Bale's performance in particular, almost makes you want to pick up wrench and head for the garage yourself. These characters live and breathe cars and you can feel it.Highly recommended to all audiences.Please Hollywood, more passionate film making like this."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,9/10,"Great action scenes, mixed with drama story! Amazing acting of Christian Bale! When the cars driving you want to drive as well it keeps you inside movie all time long!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,9/10,You can't get enough of this movie.. Loved the characters and acting of the stars. Even if you don't know anything about cars you'll love it I guarantee that..
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2020,7/10,"Very entertaining & interesting, especially for petrolheads. Christian Bale's accent as someone from the midlands of England does not quite hit the mark however 😂"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,10/10,"My palms were sweating, very very exciting and interesting. Even cried once too😑"
FORD V FERRARI,1 January 2020,10/10,"This films brings everyone together it doesn't matter if you are a fan of racing cars or not and this film just shows how faith and hard work really pays off. I really enjoyed this film and how the al the sense that they have created in this films fits perfectly with the characters and the storyline it self, just WOW."
FORD V FERRARI,10 April 2020,6/10,"The acting crew is absolutely amazing. They delivered stellar performances and brought so much emotion to each character. Besides that I don't understand the hype around this movie. It feels a bit boring and dragged more than once. I felt like pushing myself to watch it until the end just because I started. Maybe If you're a car fan this leaves a different impression, but for me it felt like a movie for passing time and hardly any work of art."
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,6/10,"It seems to be boring for me as I don't like racing movies, i just got some informations about ford and ferrari history and i continued it cause I like matt damon and bale"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"This has got to be the greatest movie ever made about any sport. No computer CGI here. Everything about this movie was real. The acting is top notch, the driving and race sequences pure perfection and the great thing about this movie were the cars."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"My dad grew up watching and listening on the radio about Fords attempt to beat Ferrari and he would share these stories with me growing up. So this movie was a huge deal to me. The movie does a great job how much it meant for America to beat the unbeatable Ferarri but also how snobby of a person Ford the 2nd was to his employees. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's chemistry was the best part of the film in my opinion. Bale stands out the most playing the crazy driver who got the GT40 to 220mph! I highly recomend this movie if you're a car lover, or even a history lover. Great work!"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,Well done guys! Lots of lessons for life that make you think. Touching movie.
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,Honestly I went to watch this movie with zero expectation and knowledge of the plot. The film is a history of Le Mans '66 told with a thrill ride from Bale and Damon with stunning visual racing scenes. James Mangold has done a fantastic job as a director. Worth the watch in a movie theater.
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2019,10/10,"I'm not a guy who knows about racing and cars, but wow this film really makes me want to become an expert. This picture has it all , An exciting and thrilling dosis of action, A catchy story and a spetacular acting.
The whole cast was incredible ,Matt Damon gives a great performance and Christian Bale fuua! what a terrific actor! My hat off Mr.Bale what a performance in every scene he shines as Ken Miles, He really deserves an Oscar nomination for this one."
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2020,10/10,"With this movie you understand that exist two kinds of movies, blockbuster movies and real acting movies!
Christian Bale and Matt Damon has a perfect chemistry!
Bale leave you for one more time with your mouth open with his acting...
Thank you all for this movie, it's a triumph and a perfect legasy for Ken Miles and Carol Shelby!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Great storyline, Bale deserves an Oscar for this! Chemistry between Bale & Damon is out of this world. A worthy competetor for Rush!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,10/10,"Wasnt that interested in seeing this film. Love cars, a fan of Christian Bale and English. This film made me laugh, it was tense and it made me cry. Loved it! I could watch it again."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"Ford V Ferrari is a sensational film. The cinematography in general is simply incredible, as the racing scenes and the emotion only add to its brilliance. Christian Bale is absolutely fantastic, Matt Damon is spot on and at his best, and Jon Bernthal is excellent as well. The soundtrack, score, acting, and directing are all exceptional, complimenting the film beautifully. Bale and Damon's performances are Oscar worthy, no doubt. With only about a month left of this year, Ford V Ferrari overall is easily the best movie of 2019."
FORD V FERRARI,17 January 2020,8/10,"Both Bale and Damon are getting old..so am I.
A story I didn't know, told from the perspective of the loser.
David against Goliah, where David are both Ferrari, Miles and Shelby, facing in different ways the Ford ""enemy"".
Miles can't quit his passions and fulfills his faith, a star that after fighting his demons and winning finds his peace no matter he has been mocked and used.
He shines in the end before crashing hard."
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2020,5/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a film that commits the worst sin that a film can. This movie manages to not offend at all while also managing to do nothing extraordinary. This movie challenges no one and leaves it's audience the same way as how they began. It is entertaining enough for its longer than average run-time, but being entertaining isn't enough to fill the longing for something better this film leaves you with."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,8/10,Ford vs Ferrari... Great movie to respect Ken Miles. One of the greatest road racers ever.
FORD V FERRARI,17 January 2020,10/10,"Best movie of 2019. excellent male cinema without feminism, gayness and other hit"
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,7/10,A pretty good movie really. Tells a good yarn. Nicely made. Good cinematography. Good acting and good character chemistry. Lots of cgi but merges in quite well. Generally historically accurate. Nice plot in that it creates two anti-heroes battling against being the underdogs and battling against the ruthless ambitions of their own sponsors. Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.😀
FORD V FERRARI,24 December 2019,10/10,"Just saw the movie yesterday , One of the best movies in the last 10 years , Highly Recommended , Bale and Demmon acting was Out of this world ,
the story , the plot , the light commedy , and the ending all built up perfectly .
thanks for this master piece ."
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,10/10,"The ""Standard"" Extraordinary performance from bale , He deserves an oscar this year for his role in FVF , Matt damon also did very good job .
One of the best movies in the last decade ."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Wow!!!!it is not one of the best,it is the best as far me"
FORD V FERRARI,28 December 2019,1/10,"Well at thirty years of age this was the first time my partner and I had ever walked out of a cinema before the movie had finished...As a petrolhead I should have loved this film. I know the story, I have seen the documentaries, I have watched the old films. An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated ""this had better improve""....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.The writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.I am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,Matt Damon and Christian Bale provided perfect portrayals of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles.
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2020,9/10,"Incredible sound mixing, felt in that car, racing...Would like to see this dou again in the future, great chemistryI recommend it, definitely worth your time"
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,10/10,For someone who is practically addicted to motorsport this film really impressed me. The making of how the incredible Ford GT40 was created and how it took on Le Mans against Ferrari. Edge of your seat stuff right here definitely a must see
FORD V FERRARI,29 December 2019,10/10,"I am mainly an F1 fan but the 24hrs of Le Mans is just different from any other race. Ford VS Ferrari had me on the edge of my seat for the whole film. Coming from someone who is practically addicted to motorsport this is a solid 10, it's a must see for any motorsport fan."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,9/10,"Great racing scenes and drifting , great cinematography, the acting is great obviously
Great story , not 100 percent accurate to the real one but it's ok, and yeah just every thing is great ,definitely reccomend a watch , plus the movie was 2:30 hours + and I didn't feel the time , actually I didn't know it was 2 and a half hours until after it ended"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"It is a well scripted, well directed movie with great camera work and right blend of emotions. Bale Damon's duo works out perfectly."
FORD V FERRARI,26 August 2021,9/10,"Going to cimema with my friends to watch this movie, i had not read about neither it's plot nor about Ken Miles and his story. Getting out of it, we all angreed it was a masterpiece.I have watched it again some times, and it gets me to feel everything that goes in the head of the protagonists. Although all these contribute to the greatness of this movie, the fact that it's based on the true story of Ken Miles takes it to another level. I think that only those who knew his story did not googled Ken, to learn about his life and contribution to racing.If you haven't watched it, do yourself the favour and do so!"
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,9/10,"It's been long time since I enjoyed a movie like I enjoyed watching this movie,"
FORD V FERRARI,7 January 2020,9/10,"The blend of reality, excitement, community, passion, racing all captured very well. Christian Bale, you are just amazing. Huge respect to both Ford and Ferrari. Both Giants of racing."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"Amazing acting, direction, action sequences and incredible story. Showcases human emotions in cinema after many many years. Very good sound effects."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,This movie is so good. The cinematography and Bales's acting was fantastic. Even people who are not motor heads can watch this movie. This piece of art will inspire many people to experience racing at least once in their life time.
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"I have to say, I am a big fan of fast cars. And I am a big fan of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. So this Movie should be good. But this Movie was Awesome! It has it all. You Laugh, you cry and it is exciting!This Movie is not made for Petrolheads only, its a Movie for everyone!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,,"Absolutely wonderful, ""speedy"" and heart touching movie.
I feel a race in every detail: from beautiful shots to the amazing sound of cars and the rest.
My palms are sweating on the turns.
Good acting, good characters and good story.
Yeah. I feel it. I feel this in every turn."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2020,10/10,"As a Chile un the 60s I enjoyed Le Mando, Sebring, Daytona, this movie took me back to those days.
Great acting snd súper edition. A real good movie depicting the 60s and the rivalry of two giants."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,7/10,"Christian Bale killed it in this movie. Matt Damon was great too. As a racing movie, a bit of a let down but the last race was fantastic. A real nail bitter! The title Ford V. Ferrari is misleading; it really is a story about two guys who love cars, and I really appreciated that. I really loved the family dynamic with Bale's character in this movie especially. Overall, I can see why people would give this movie a perfect score, but for me the writing just makes it fall a little short. But for a biopic, it was fantastic!"
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,"I enjoyed the movie so much that me and my friend could not stop discussing every scene. Although you might not be a big car films lover, the plot is definitely going to catch you.The characters are so intense and definitely well portrayed by Bale and Damon. It was closer to what happened in reality than I was expecting, so I appreciated that it was not an exageration."
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,10/10,"I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent."
FORD V FERRARI,12 March 2020,9/10,"One of the best movies, I think, but I expected more from this. The critics said 'It's a very, very good, or excellent film', but I think it could be better. That's only my opinion and yes, it is a very good film, but I think it's not excellent."
FORD V FERRARI,6 April 2020,,"When I was in design school, my professors always reminded me that it was much easier to do a campaign for a condom company than a fence-building company. Thanks Susan. That is true. F V F is a fence company - a movie about cars and racing cars. But, this is a great, well made, creative masterpiece. It never gets corny or starchy. Granted - some of the periphery characters are caricatures, but, the main characters on which we focus feel real and not put on.
In contrast to some of the Oscar pics that seem more like rewards for towing the line rather than artistic achievements, it's good to have a movie that you can watch from start to end w/o questioning what you're watching and still get completely caught-up in it. I loved JoJo Rabbit almost as much (that took a lot from Wes Anderson - a favorite), but a good straight-forward, well written, un-cringy movie like F v F should still be an AA favorite."
FORD V FERRARI,13 April 2020,10/10,This was a great movie to watch with our family. It focused on the story and the history of what happened.
FORD V FERRARI,15 June 2020,9/10,"The final part of the dozens of minutes of the racing scene was exhilarating, intense and exciting.The drivers' pursuit of speed and excitement is in sharp contrast to the tepid conservatism of Ford's top management, which makes these peak-chasing drivers greater than ordinary people."
FORD V FERRARI,31 July 2020,10/10,"Movie is wonderfulCar humming i love it
Christian bale my all time favorite actor and FvsF no words .Wow"
FORD V FERRARI,29 July 2020,9/10,The movie's editing is fantastic. The pace is so fast and the right time. You never get bored at any point. Of course the product placement is weird and feels like an ad some times but it's okay. If they have to do it to get money they should.
FORD V FERRARI,31 August 2019,10/10,"Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
FORD V FERRARI,6 September 2020,10/10,"Every time I passed by this film, I thought nah, I'm not interested cars that much at all - but how wrong was I. This film is not really about cars, it's more about relationships and passion. The acting in this is phenomenal and the sound track had me smiling and excited many of time. Its such a good film, 2.5 hours of excitement, fun, thrills, laughs and cries, it has everything - I highly recommended !"
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,9/10,"Completely blown away by the performance of Christian Bale.
""It's a perfect lap."""
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2020,9/10,"Kick it into 7000 rpm and enjoy a brief ride through history when considering watching this solid film, Ford Versus Ferrari. The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.As failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.Put two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap."
FORD V FERRARI,26 February 2021,9/10,Saw this on the airplane on a small screen and I wish I had seen it in theaters. What a great spectacle and performances from Bale and Damon. Highly recommend it!
FORD V FERRARI,7 May 2021,9/10,"An immersing and tense gripping story, I must say I am glad to actually have tried this. Racing films can learn a thing or two from this. Great cast present, Good CGI present, awesome races present."
FORD V FERRARI,21 July 2020,7/10,"It is too long, could be shortened by about an hour."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"I had the same excitement going to view this film as I had in 1966 when I drove 90 miles to watch the movie Grand Prix. I would have liked to have seen more racing action. The sound was great, but my favorite racing movie is still Grand Prix."
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2020,7/10,In a sentence I can say it was great and full of excitement with a strong screenplay.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Absolutely brilliant film, it is long but didn't feel it when I was watching. It has been a long time since I've really felt drawn in and immersed in a film. I could easily go see this again."
FORD V FERRARI,5 March 2020,8/10,"Great performances, great content, fun atmosphere, beautiful filmmaking. Although toward the end it just seemed abrupt and uninformative. Also, Damon's conveyed emotions seemed confused at the end."
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,7/10,"As a huge fan of Christian Bale, and an even bigger fan of Enzo Ferrari and the journey behind the Ferrari perfection, it was a story which grabbed me from the first frame and held me captivated to the last frame. The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining."
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,10/10,"I am blown away by this movie. And feel like I must leave a review while it's still fresh.First off, I'm a tough critic. I want to love movies, but it's been years since I've watched one that I really loved. Then came F v F.... This movie is absolutely brilliant! From the acting to the cinematography, even the soundtrack and sound effects, everything is on point.I've always love racing, watched F1 and WRC when I was young, but didn't know much about Le Mans, let alone the story behind Ford and Shelby teaming up. The story line was captivating, the plot twists were unpredictable. The rivalry with Ferrari was palpable, yet being only a medium for a much deeper story. The paste of the movie is perfect, always leaving you wanting to know what's coming next. The dialogue is rich, the details, credible. It plunges you into the world of racing in quite a convincing manner, with technicalities and politics that doesn't overwhelm the audience. The performance of Bale and Deamon are outstanding, touching at times. You heard it, I almost cried...I don't know how factually accurate this story is, but I don't care. This movie is a masterpiece."
FORD V FERRARI,12 September 2020,5/10,"This film could have been simply brilliant. Unfortunately it failed badly. Some historical inaccuracies would be okay for drama and entertainment, but this movie rewrites history in a way that is simply unforgivable.What's even worse, the motoring scenes are lazy and worse written and executed than the Fast & Furious movies. You don't need to be all about facts, but please, don't think of the audience as complete idiots when it comes to driving race cars fast. Also, what's with the cheap looking CGI and sped up driving clips in a movie of this caliber?Such a greatly missed opportunity. The story would have been great without all the extra drama added, and the great actors and their great performances were shot down with second grade technical performance in the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,10/10,2.5 hours and not a single second boring. Good actors and story. Very good directing by Mangold. Racing movies should be like this one because you think your the driver of the cars. This movie is made for theaters and not for TV. A must see.
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,10/10,"Who knew Matt Damon could character act. Casting was brilliant both Damon and Bale really felt authentic. Story was great, tit for tat between two great of automotive names (Ford and Ferrari). Loved the photography and detail, hats off to all involved.Watch it on a projector this film really needs the big screen"
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,5/10,"I don't what to say - it just wasn't for me. If you're not into racing or cars or the ""american dream"" I think this is probably a movie to miss. For me, it was already not my style, but on top of that it felt like a film that had recycled the plot and characters of every other sports movie and re-skinned it.Both Bale and Damon's accents were laid on thicker than ""fur on a frog"". Did I do that right? Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.Another issue is that at least in other sports films there's a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford's bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship? That theme did not seem apart until its final scene - leaving it as a last ditch effort to move and connect the audience to the characters. At the very least we could say it celebrated Ken Miles for his achievements in the racing world - so kudos to that."
FORD V FERRARI,20 February 2021,7/10,"That could have been THE perfect racing film of its time, but the all-American father-son pathos and the clichéd portrayal of the Italians in this unfortunately screws it up a bit for me. Still a pretty good movie overall."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,"Fact"" if you wanna watch this movie You don't need to know anything about cars , this Is a true story is not all about Racing, though ;
The title should be Miles And Shelby and the rest vs Ferrari ,
""Miles"" played played by the one and only Christian Bale who delivers one of the best performance this year outstanding,
""Shelby, Matt Damon on his top as always
Breathtaking Movie From the beginning to the end gives you that kinda boost that kind energy you want as a viewer , just wonderful movie !! Bravo!!
One more point to the director Amzing Job Sir ."
FORD V FERRARI,7 November 2019,8/10,"This is a great biopic that tells a compelling story between the American and Italian car makers in one of the toughest races in the world. As a person who likes cars and has a passing familiarity with Le Mans and car mechanics, I thought this move was excellent for people who only had a surface level knowledge of these things and had plenty for every type of movie goer.Damon and Bale are obviously excellent, with Bale donning a proper English accent and lots of eccentricity and Damon pulling off the forced retired racer and now car designer smoothly. The supporting cast was extremely well done, with special call outs to Tracy Letts, who played an absolutely excellent Henry Ford II and had one of the best scenes in the entire movie. His ability to display such a wide range of emotions really sold the audience to how invested he was in this character. Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, Bale's character's wife, was also excellent. She has a few of her own scenes where she steals the show and is the perfect compliment to Bale's character's own ad hoc lifestyle at times.In fact, most of the scenes involving Ford Execs were so good that they warrant their own biopic with their own characters. The political battle between Ford's VPs was interesting and infuriating at the same time, showing repeatidly that they are their own worst enemy.In terms of direction, this movie was executed well. Conscious decisions were made to have Italian dialogue not translated in certain scenes, allowing the audience really understand visually the scenes without giving it away. Most shots are very clean and the driving sections are well done to build tension while also not becoming boring.The movie does throw a lot of you in terms of details, mentions of gearboxes, lift, brake roters, tire swaps, etc... all show that a proper gear head would enjoy the jargon. The Ford GT40 in general really shines here and takes center stage multiple times in the film. There is one particular scene where Damon's character take the car for a spin and you really do understand the absolute power behind the car and its eventual final designs that lead it to be successful.At over 2.5 hours, this movie does not leave anything out and truly does tell the compelling story of the Americans at Le Mans. Overall the movie comes well recommend and is definitely worth a watch."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,Best movie decision I ever made. Great acting and story. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both on top of their respective games.
FORD V FERRARI,9 January 2020,10/10,"Casting, script, direction, special effects, soundtrack, editing, camera shots."
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,5/10,"I am a big Gar..... sorry Christian Bale fan but really overacts in this paint by numbers predictable nonsense full of pantomime characters and ridiculous dialogue. In its favour, Matt Damon good, production values good....That's about it!!"
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,Christian Bale again proved to be a very great actor over here. The whole story was very good directed and the chemistry between the actors and actresses are thumbs up! Damon and Bale definitely nailed it.
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,9/10,"I'm clearly not a fan of car racing, but I still managed to find this movie thoroughly enjoyable. It has a good combination of action sequences with family/friendly banter and there is something to enjoy in it for the whole family."
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2020,8/10,"I'm glad they paid homage to Ken Miles in this movie, his story was phenomenal. It would have been a shame not to credit him with what he and Shelby did for Ford."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,8/10,"I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,Great cast. Great direction. Great dramatic storyline.
FORD V FERRARI,23 December 2019,10/10,"Didnt realize hollywood could still make a movie like this. I'm actually getting bored of the superficial characters, large explosions, sleazy scenes, and empty emotions. This movie decided to just be good. Damn good. Bale and Damon lead a perfectly portrayed set of characters in this film that draw you in from the first scene and doesnt spit you back out until the credits roll."
FORD V FERRARI,14 July 2020,10/10,"What a good movie. Great acting from all, and it kept me rapt throughout. Incredible story."
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is more about how powerful people can thwart other people's dreams just to impose their opinions, not matter how ignorant and selfish those may be. Matt Damon and Christian Bale deliver outstanding performances as the legendary Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. This movie will keep you glued to your seat from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,5 April 2021,9/10,Really enjoyable movie and maybe not only for petrol heads actually! The storyline is based on a true story but really well told and acted. Well done to Matt and the rest of the crew!
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,4/10,"This movie makes me hate Ford. I wish I would've known that this has a sad ending, I would not have gone to see it. Very disappointing movie."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,6/10,It was ok. Bale and Damon do well in their individual roles. Felt like a box ticking exercise a little they didn't get too involved with the engineering which is a shame. Also the driving feels a bit as hoc to say there's a 24 hour race it doesn't feel like you see the impact it has on the drivers . Don't know if it was my cineworld that let the soundtrack down but didn't feel the sound bouncing around me like I expected .
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,Absolutely fantastic film in fact I'm a bit speechless at how good it was and what an incredible story Bale and Damon was fantastic in this film and I really got quite emotional in places it had everything well done to all the people who put this together 👍
FORD V FERRARI,7 January 2020,10/10,"I really wasn't expecting much going into this film witha average expectations, but this us easily one of the best films I have seen in a very long time, years. The fast paced cinematography and racing scenes, well driven plot and excellent acting makes the film amazing; even for one who has no interest in racing at all. Definitely a must see and I cant understand how this will be snubbed for all the awards."
FORD V FERRARI,17 March 2021,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari is the best car&racing movie I have ever seen. It includes all the details with all realism, great acting performance, and of course the speed that bring us a beautiful masterpice with 7000 rpm"
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,10/10,Great movie. Great actors. Really had my adrenaline going with alittle bit of yelling for Ken to win. Definitely family friendly and a must watch for Mathee Damon fans. Love it.
FORD V FERRARI,13 March 2021,9/10,"As a petrol head i collected around 100 dvd where cars are leading. This is the last one that arrived, and it kicked Grand Prix from his statue as best race movie. Maybe that movie is more accurate about racing, overhere there is a much better story, great characters and talented actors. My family had some doubts, because they not always appreciate my appetite for cars, but they enjoyed this for the full ride.....go & see this.Afyer i wrote this, this page tell me this review is roo short, i really don't know what to tell you more of getting this lovely movie on ypur screen."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,8/10,One of the best films of the year. A gripping story and a top top performance by Bale
FORD V FERRARI,21 February 2020,10/10,Best film in 2019 very exciting film excellent acting for all the cast one of the best car movie
FORD V FERRARI,5 February 2020,9/10,"Fantastic acting for both, but in my opinion Bale wins because ´he came further behind'.
These 'based on true story/events' movies are quite usual today, which isn' t bad at all, cause there seems to be hard to write good movies otherwise.
Really worth to see yet You like sportmovies of not."
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,9/10,I am not racing fan and not automotive love but this movie is incredible. Puts you on presaure with them to win a race. Reflects life with competitors in anothrt and same team.Perfect acting from everyone.
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2019,10/10,"Years ago, I would say that I'm not interested in seeing a story about motorsports. But it all changed with ""Rush"" - it was a great movie that made me realize this topic isn't that boring as I thought.
But Le Mans'66 brought it just to another level. The ultimate level, actually.
It's a masterpiece, that will entertain you more than anything you've seen in this year (maybe except Joker, which is great too).Great characters, fantastic acting, great scenario, wonderful camera work and beautiful cars!Definitely a ""must see"" - in IMAX, if possible"
FORD V FERRARI,14 March 2020,10/10,"I can honestly say there is not one thing about this film I dislike. The casting, storyline, the cars, the soundtrack..... But the real treat for me was actually seeing the delivery of a first class Brummie accent by Bale. I note that a couple of other reviewers have said he spoke with a 'UK Northern accent' (nope, we're Midlands!) and a Cockney accent (seriously?!!). As a True Brummie I can honestly say this is the first time I have watched a film and actually seen someone act and speak like the people I know and see every day. It was so great to watch a film without the irritation of someone over-egging the accent and capturing the Wry humour. And the accompanying script was spot on for colloquialisms too. Overall, an incredibly moving, funny, poignant and utterly entertaining experience."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"Loved it! Matt Damon was particularly strong, his face can say so much in the expressions, and facial movements that speech isn't needed.
I did laugh at the 'fight scene' as it was reminiscent of The Bourne films!! 🤣
Really great story, acting, photography, well done x
Working out who I can take so I can see it again."
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,10/10,I wasn't expecting too much when I went to the theaters to view this film. I really just wanted to see it for the racing but this movie delivered so much more. I found myself in love with Ken Miles (ChristianBale) and Carolyn Shelby (Matt Damon). It's more of a Shelby v. Corporate than Ford v. Ferrari. Everything in this film is real and fantastic! It maybe my favorite film of the year and it's one of the only ones witch made me cry. If you have a chance to view this film I highly recommend it. I know it won't beat 1917 for beat Oscar but it damn well deserves it.
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,10/10,"It is not the best movie I've ever seen, but is the best movie I've seen lately. The cast was very good, especially Bale, and the storyline and the action didn't let me get bored. I think it deserves an Oscar."
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,10/10,Every second of this film is relevant. Amazing cast crew racing was amazing even though I knew how the race ended I was still on the edge of my seat.
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,3/10,"I give this film three stars only because it wasn't my type of movie - I am certain folks who are into racing and action films will truly enjoy it. I saw it because it got nominated for multiple Oscars, and because a friend of mine assured me I would like it. Unfortunately, the combination of my lack of interest in the subject matter coupled with the rah-rah Go America message (at the expense of the Italians, naturally) was a bit too much. I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it. I also appreciated the fact that it was based on a true story and that the Ford Motor Company and the characters involved came across realistically as the less-than-admirable individuals they were."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,I don't normally rate movies but I really enjoyed watching this movie. I was a kid when this was happening and loved seeing the accuracy of this time period. This is such a great story. Thanks
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,Absolutely blown away by this movie. Actors and director do an awesome job of telling the breathtaking story of America coming out on top. Best movie I've seen in a LONG time!
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,"Being a gear head, they got this movie on par. Not too many scenes about lingo that nobody will understand, I took my wife and she thought it was going to be a guy movie, she was in tears at the end. Centers more around the relationships between Carroll and Ken, and Shelby International and Ford Motor Company. Straight up fun and drama. I will owns this movie, just waiting for the Blu-Rays to come off the press. The racing scenes were not complete CGI, they were real scenes with added touches. It feels real because it is real. If you haven't watched this movie then you are sadly missing out on a great time."
FORD V FERRARI,30 October 2020,8/10,"Probably the best cars movie I saw. It is much beyond a race, a great story and a good processing of the plot."
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,10/10,"Never thought of reviewing a movie before, but this movie is one of a kind.
A movie that makes you feel engaged and emotional especially with the outstanding performance of Matt Damon & Christian Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,10/10,"Never thought of reviewing a movie before, but this move is one of a kind.
A movie that will make you feel engaged and emotional especially with the outstanding performance of Matt Damon & Christian Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,,"My first review was for the movie Andhadhun. After a year, this is my second review. Ford vs Ferrari is a gripping movie till the end. Better to not watch the trailers before you watch the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,8/10,The movie is really good. The actors christian and matt did a great job together. I liked the way ken miles reacted to people for being different and although it did him pain you could see he really cared about everything and was so positive even when he got up by losing le mans. I loved how quickly he moved on. Such a charismatic human he was. But the ending was so sad. Didnt see that coming. I wished that wasnt filmed.
FORD V FERRARI,19 October 2020,10/10,"I love this show much that it sticks to my mind even after few days watching it...it has the true American style and class...perfect show...nicely done...Christian Bale has never let us down...fantastic actor!
For bonus, no Asian culture or characters in thos show makes it deserve for 10 star, TRUE AMERICAN SHOW...WE SHOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF SHOWS MORE!!!
Support TRUMP...MAGA...."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"I thought this movie was a really great movie. This is so different than all the movies coming out this year. The cars look and sound SO AWESOME. The acting is amazing I loved everyone one in the movie. There weren't any cringe worthy moments which I despise in movies. There were no CGI if I can recall in this movie, which means, everything in this movie was real. And honestly that exactly how it looked. I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or a 10 only because I feel like they could have given us more information about the main characters in the movie. I wasn't really sure why Christian bale and Matt Damon's character loves to race. We can clearly see that they do I just didn't really know why. But if you look over that stuff and focus on the great energy coming from everyone in the movie, then I know you will enjoy yourself"
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2021,10/10,What a cracking movie about an amazing true story! You don't have to love cars to love this movie. Performances are great and the direction is spot on. 10/10!
FORD V FERRARI,23 March 2020,8/10,"The movie is amazing but the end was very bad
If the end wasn't that bad I would give that movie 9 or even 10"
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2019,9/10,"This movie was spectacular. I felt every minute of it and every event really matters. It rarely drags but mostly the storytelling is unique and entertaining.
Bale gives a great performance, better than last year in Vice. Damon makes the movie feel real, and the chemistry between them is so brother-like. Jon Bernthal makes a great addition to the cast and makes his scenes quite intense.
The editing and sound are astonishing because it gives us the realistic feeling of racing. Cinematography is life-like and it makes cars easy to follow, I won't even start with the color grading...
I thought that soundtrack could be used better, it didn't hit all the notes for me, but it wasn't bad.If you're a car enthusiast, it's a must watch, if you're an average consumer, it's a great movie to finish a day with, or even a week."
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,9/10,Christian Bale has just nailed the character provided by the fabulous direction. It was an exhilarating emotional ride with some of the fabulous performances of the year 2019. Christian Bale is sure to get the nomination for the Oscars. Background score and sound design was terrific. #FORDVFERRARI
FORD V FERRARI,14 November 2019,8/10,"Cool car racing, good acting,good performance.
a little bit boring."
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,9/10,"A beautiful movie, especially for racing and speed car enthusiasts, the level of the main actors (Christian and Matt) was very cool, photography, montage, lighting, photography, and clothes were very cool and perfect! The most beautiful thing about the movie is the sensation of excitement and the unpredictability of upcoming events. You will not feel like watching a biography, and I think this is a strength!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,8/10,"Excellent movie, made in the way that movies used to be made. Intriguing,interesting well written and superbly directed.
Stellar cast that really convey an amazing true story.
Please give me more like this."
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2021,10/10,The Greatest race car movie of all time. Triumph and Tragedy portrayed by two of the greatest actors ever.
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,9/10,"The movie is refreshing with some breathtaking sequences, power-packed screenplay and a genius direction.
There are never seen before car racing sequences that gives the audience a thriling experience.
The movie never gets dull.
Christiane Bale ha done a fabulous job.He is soul of the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"In my opinion this film is the best film of the year. The acting is amazing. The music is perfect. The cinematography is flashy in a way that suites the film. The story is brilliant. Based on a true story, this film kept me captivated the whole time I was watching it and it made me want to watch the real Le Mans this year. Excellent watch. A must see"
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,10/10,"Honestly, I went to watch this movie with no expectations, and I regret nothing. It was totally worth it. Brilliant storytelling, beautifully shot, masterfully acted, and surprisingly emotional. Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered an outstanding performance. Although I don't know anything about cars or didn't know much about the real story, I absolutely enjoyed this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,2 March 2020,8/10,"From the trailer (if you didn't know the back story) I could expect just another movie about racing. But it turned out to be so much more: true friendship, double standards of corporate world and just people, passionate about their work.
Brilliant work of actors also!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"A simple heartfelt story of a friendship vs corporate egos. The story's car jargon doesn't confuse the audience.Also the CGI and Pratical effects only enhance the movie and never take away the experience from it. The movie is the beautiful, old fashioned (story arc wise) and definitely a blast!"
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,8/10,"I'm not a big fan of cars and racing, but still there was not a single moment in the movie that bored me. It was an absolute terrific cinematic experience, all thanks to Bale and Matt Damon. Christian Bale was the highlight of the movie, absolute monster of an actor."
FORD V FERRARI,9 January 2020,8/10,"Excellent acting!!! Also emotionally, I wanna say ""I hate Ford."""
FORD V FERRARI,21 January 2021,10/10,Such an amazing movie skirmish rigid HF the dvd extras email address and I will send you a picture
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2021,9/10,"I can't write too much here, but I can write this: This is on my top 20 movies of all time."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Ford v Ferrari was a really special experience for me. I am not a person who is related to the cars, but this movie made me feel like a pilot. My adrenaline went crazy while I was watching the race scenes ( or should I say I was experiencing them ). Ford v Ferrari was like a virtual reality racing game. Cinematography, sound efects, visual efects and soundtracks made the experience so realistic. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both GREAT actors and in this movie their performances are Oscar-nomination worthy ( especially Christian Bale ). In a nutshell, It's been an exciting and enjoyable 152 minutes. The directors and the actors did a great job and adapted this rivalry to the big screen. When I got out of the theatre, I was thinking about how much the audience need this kind of movies."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"A great story being transferred to the big screen, it was inevitable that the facts would be a bit dramatized but nonetheless an awesome way to show how great Ken Miles was.
The movie can be also watched by the ones not familiar with the story."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,10/10,"U have to die if u miss this one it has every thing U want from a movie wich include cars and racing in a pit
Feel the adrenaline feel the road"
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,"There comes a moment in one's (professional) life when one's own passion, drive, skill, and one's immediate team and opportunity - all line-up. Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here.Guys, this is the one to watch on IMAX !"

FORD V FERRARI,9 January 2020,10/10,"From a hard core Ferrari fan it is a great deal to accept that I rooted for Miles all the way :D The racing scenes were really good and exciting, the tempo of the movie was right for me and the '60s mood was enjoyable too. :) If you love cars or watching car-racing, this movie is perfect for you. #goferrari #themustangwasgorgeoustoo"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,8/10,The two male leads do things that may. It make sense - but guys will get it. My wife enjoyed it too.
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,3/10,"Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout. In a movie about trying to build the world's fastest car they never show anyone actually build a car. It sets up a problem and then cuts immediately to the solution. I also feel like the ending is 20 minutes too long."
FORD V FERRARI,14 December 2019,10/10,A well made movie. Hard to find any flaws in any aspect.
FORD V FERRARI,14 December 2019,9/10,Not really a car girl or anything but seeing the story was phenomenal!
FORD V FERRARI,4 April 2020,10/10,Even after comparing it to multiple movies definitely have to say this holds the crown as the best Matt Damon and Christian Bale did an outstanding job.
FORD V FERRARI,2 January 2020,10/10,"A late contender that took the film of the award from me! Even over The Joker. Bale's performance alone is worth the entrance fee. His chemistry with Matt Damon and the rest of the cast is fantastic. I found it heart warming to see his relationship with his family, and funny also.Plus, no political agenda, a film about a time when blokes were blokes and it's told as such! Thank you to the film companies for allowing this to be the case!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 February 2020,8/10,Matt Damon and Christian Bale nailed it in their character
FORD V FERRARI,7 March 2020,10/10,The story line was awesome never gets boring. Very well acted by Matt Damon and Christian bale
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,8/10,I thought this movie was quite good. I would definitely recommend this movie to others. The movie had the right amount of background information. Over all great movie.
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,8/10,Well done. I thought Matt Damon retired after that zoo movie.
FORD V FERRARI,16 May 2020,,Definitely this movie was a perfect suit for a director like Michael Mann.
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,8/10,"I have to say that I'm by no means a racing fan. I came into the movie with relatively low expectations (mostly because I found the name lame) even being such a Bale and Damon fan.What I found was a beautiful film that gets to be intimate, profound and sincere at moments. A film with an impeccable sound mixing, a thrilling OST that submerges you into the race and conveys a feeling of weightlessness, freedom and victory I hadn't felt in a long time.I profoundly recommend it to everyone reading this, specially for racing fans, as I've heard it's really faithful to the true story it's based on."
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,10/10,Great movie with a good story and lots of race action. Matt Damon did an awesome job along with Christian Bale!
FORD V FERRARI,15 March 2020,1/10,"Had to turn off after 20 minutes, perhaps it got better. Christian Bales accent was joke. I wondered why they didn't just get an English actor to play his character until I found out he is?? Pathetic."
FORD V FERRARI,5 April 2020,10/10,"I knew the story, but the acting in this movie is simply unbelievable. Must watch for anyone."
FORD V FERRARI,25 April 2020,10/10,It is a good film and interesting film.the film is good because it can get bored.i like thi film because awesome.
FORD V FERRARI,30 June 2020,8/10,Its not very often you see a movie made about the history of something without it being war. Its also rare that such movies keep my attention all the way through but I thoroughly enjoyed this.
FORD V FERRARI,17 June 2020,10/10,"WOW, is all I can say about this movie! I grew up in the sixties and this movie brought me back to the flavor and feel of the era. The sights and the sounds, the great cars and music just captured that time almost perfectly, The only minor flaw were the high pressure sodium streetlights, which were not in widespread use until the seventies,"
FORD V FERRARI,23 June 2021,10/10,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."
FORD V FERRARI,10 October 2020,10/10,Very Awesome! Thrilling and Inspiring! Must watch! The characters The Story Line everything is inch perfect apart from the heartbreaking end 😢
FORD V FERRARI,19 September 2021,10/10,I can say that it is the best success story movie I have seen so far.
FORD V FERRARI,22 December 2020,9/10,"I just saw Ford v Ferrari and I was quite surprised. It is such an incredible film that you will like it, either if you are a passionate racing fan, or not.The movie has it all: excellent acting, great story (and a true one), beautiful camera shots, and... the perfect cars! I could notice that the film has given a big effort to place the setting correctly, and it does! All the details, the plot and scenes continuity come together to an extraordinary film, without mentioning the impressive sound editing and enjoyable soundtrack that it also has. The best car racing movie I've ever seen."
FORD V FERRARI,8 November 2020,10/10,"Such a great movie!! Damon and Bale absolutely nailed it! But Christian Bale, my goodness, he completely sold this performance. He knows how to take you with him. I can watch again and again."
FORD V FERRARI,17 January 2021,8/10,One of my favourite movies of the last few years. Fun story with an ensemble that really shines. A buddy film at the core but has lots of interesting characters from real life. Real-life can provide great stories and this is proof.
FORD V FERRARI,8 March 2021,9/10,"Is a fact-based racing drama about events leading up to and including the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it's briskly paced and entertaining enough to appeal even to nonracing fans. But it does include car crashes, explosions, drivers on fire, and people dying. Characters also fight, punch, and wrestle, and there are some violent temper tantrums.The film is based on a true story of the rivalry between two automobile giants Ford and Ferrari in the 60s with a few tweaks here and there. Ford was founded at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in the early 60s Ford is a renowned biggie in the automobile industry producing a large number of cars daily with a huge corporate set-up headed by Henry Ford II, but it only churns out boring cars that are meant for daily driving, it hasn't entered the sports car segment and somehow the company has reached a plateau, in the absence of any dramatic new change, the company might close down. On the other hand, Enzo Ferrari's Ferrari founded in 1939 is at the top of its game now producing fine sports cars and winning the prestigious french racing event Le Mans year after year as an indisputable champion. Ferrari's brand value might have reached its peak but it's bankrupt for channelling all its investments and profits into bettering their cars. Ford decided to take advantage of it, they went to Enzo with a proposal of helping them with ten million and form two amalgamated brands but the terms might bar Ferrari from participating in the Le mans, Enzo felt insulted, he returned back the Ford executives hurling abuses at them. Henry Ford II decided to put his money on making the word's fastest car (GT40) and beat Ferrari with it in Le mans. The film depicts how Ford wins the Le Mans 66' with the help of a very talented car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt demon) and a gifted automobile engineer and race driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale). Now It's a film meant to watch in the theatre, you don't have put your brain extensively at work to decode the plot like one needs to do in case of films like Interstellar but even if you're not a motorhead, you are gonna like it."

FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,5/10,Petrol heads will probably enjoy this and the racing scenes are well done but there was nothing that really gripped me about this movie. The two central characters were pretty good but the film could use at least 20 minutes of trimming. Not bad abut also not great
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Friendship, family, little guys v. Corporate hacks, and the most exhilarating car race depictions you're likely to see. Bale & Damon at their best; Balfe & Jupe fleshing out roles that give the story depth, rather than filler; terrific performances by all supporting cast; writing, production, direction are all top notch. I very much enjoyed this film, and can't wait to see it again."
FORD V FERRARI,12 September 2020,8/10,I watched this movie and was really impressed by the performance of Christian bell. You can not identify him as a big actor. He doesn't have signature moves which he repeats in every movie. We have many super star here who just uses their signature Moves in every movie..
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,9/10,"Have a wonderful drive watching it, the script, the direction, the actors, cinematography, all are spot on.
Really inspiring, escaping the cliques in the biography movies."
FORD V FERRARI,8 December 2019,7/10,"Decent movie. But i don't understand what's missing. May be the casting. In this movie, I just watched Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Not the actual characters. Cinematography not so powerful. Sound editing really well -At the end you are watching a race car based movie. Sound must be well- I cannot praise character build up as well. Some of them are just there like John Bernthal. Anyway, it's a nice movie to spend couple of hours for fun. If you have a nice sound system just wait for BR."
FORD V FERRARI,8 June 2021,10/10,"Great movie, acting and engaging scenes. I never liked Ford (the brand) much but after watching this movie, I'd definitely never buy one out of principle 😂."
FORD V FERRARI,12 January 2020,8/10,"Very good, and the photography from the racing scenes is amazing....but be prepared, probably 5% - 7% of screen time is focused on the footwork of shifting gears, braking or accelerating!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 April 2020,6/10,Not worth watching. Its exceedingly long for a movie composed entirely by stereotypes and american clichés. Some of the acting is good but it does not make up for the rest of the movie. Very commercial and not so entretaining.
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,10/10,Great movie with a great cast! Shows the origin of the Ford GT40 and the initial struggles Ford and Carol Shelby had to overcome in order to contest Ferrari's dominance of the racing world in the 1960s. Damon and Bale play a great duo in this movie which really makes the movie comical and dramatic throughout. Definitely recommend this movie!
FORD V FERRARI,22 May 2020,10/10,"FORD V FERRARI is not only one of the very best films of 2019, it's one of the best films of recent memory, period. With a spot-on script by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and impeccable direction by James Mangold, as well as Oscar-worthy performances, especially from Christian Bale (though, admittedly, I don't take the Oscars or the annual presentation seriously any longer), it is a film I think anyone interested at all in movies should watch... especially true cinefiles.And on a personal note, I'm also pleased to say that the film's use of expletives is minor and that it can be enjoyed by nearly anyone. Frankly I am quite weary of having to listen to the f-word literally dozens of times in most film & television/streaming productions these days. (But don't let this personal observation discount my ""pocket review"" or steer you away from FORD V FERRARI. It is an excellent film and deserves to be viewed... more than once.)"
FORD V FERRARI,26 December 2019,7/10,"The story is great.
Christian Bale was amazing
it has some beautiful shots and few great scenes
but they made it so ""american"" you can predict the next line"
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"The US title is closer to the film. It's not really Le Mans 66. The story and its telling is brilliant. As someone who has been to Le Mans and used to race cars, I can say that it doesn't convey the atmosphere or the general background noise. The pits in the film are authentic down to the dark concrete corridor at the back. The new pits are nothing like the older pits. As a story it is superb, but lacks what is needed to make a fantastic motor racing film."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,I cant say much.. Bale's role as Ken Miles is so fantastic and memorable.. He must compete with Phoenix in Academy Award for the best actor..
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,If It was possible I would give the rate of 100000 out of 10. It was fabulous. It worth it to be watched 100000 times.
FORD V FERRARI,30 June 2020,9/10,"Ford vs Ferrari is going to join the list of highly rewatchable modern classics. The execution of everything here should be a case study on how to put together a great movie. The directing, the editing, the amazing score and how it tangos with the action. It's impeccable."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,6/10,What a disgusting human being fordII was. Great similarities to trump
FORD V FERRARI,22 January 2020,9/10,"I was really looking forward to watching Ford v Ferrari and I wasn't disappointed. The plot is engaging and based on a true story and the two leads have great chemistry. Rush also a racing film is one of my favourite films in recent years.I loved the story and the bureaucracy they showed at Ford, which has parallels with large companies in the present day. The action is tightly edited and the race sequences are thrilling and exciting.My only recommendation would have been to trim the run-time a little, as the first half of the film has a lot of set-up and exposition which could have been condensed. Overall, its a great film and I found it an enjoyable ride, if you excuse the pun."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,5/10,"Well, now I know that the way to succeed in racing is get by your rival and give him a dirty look. Great acting and this movie looks fantastic, let down by the script. And anyone who thinks Ferrari was the ""underdog"" really didn't follow racing in the 60s. Yeah, Ford outspent Ferrari, but money doesn't equal wins, or Ferrari would dominate F1 today."
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,9/10,"Well this has to be one of the greatest race car movies ever. Performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale are so, so good... there is real chemistry between their acting, really good. This is one movie you watch and have the urge to watch it all over again"
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Wow, what a movie that was!
The whole thing about this movie is that it's not about racing. If you're expecting a racing movie, better go and watch earlier installments of Fast & Furious franchise. This movie is about a great friendship and one of the most famous rivalries in the history of motorsports. Yes, it is a drama, that tells us a very sad story, that I won't tell now in order to avoid any spoilers.
it's amazing how good were the writers and the director, who managed to make an intense movie for a motorsports fan like myself. Knowing the story in details, I was sitting there an watching the movie living every second of it. Amazing work!
Matt Damon and especially Christian Bale are outstanding.
There are slight differences with the real story, but my guess is that it was done with purpose, to make the story more interesting/dramatic.
Overall one of the new additions to the my favorite movie list.
Go to the cinemas, grab a huge pop corn and enjoy more than 2 hours of an excitig story, some very well done racing sequences, great acting and some very good humor.
10/10 stars."
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best racing movie.
Excellent acting by Christian Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Fantastic, keeps you on the edge especially during the racing scenes, Christian Bale and Matt Damon deliver strong performances as Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby, this is a must watch movie for all motorheads. Also got to know a bit of history about how Ferrari used Ford to get taken over by Fiat. Racing scenes at the Daytona and at Le Mans were well shot. This has to go down as one of the better roles enacted by Christian Bale post his tryst with DC comics as the Batman."
FORD V FERRARI,30 March 2020,10/10,"I highly recommend this movie. Actors are pretty good
Best movie of the year 2019"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,Perfect movie for a racing fan. Watch it if you wanna feel alive
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"I don't know about you but I am snoringly bored of superhero films that have been crowding out the mainstream cinema lately. So it was a pleasure to see this film, which was a really solid Hollywood drama about a relatively novel subject. It's not a movie that will leave you thinking for days afterwards, but instead a perfect movie to see with a friend or date for a solid 2 1/2 hour watch that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,7/10,I enjoyed this movie. I just couldn't help but feel like it was more of advertisement for Ford than it was a movie. but really cool action scenes
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,10/10,"A friend asked me to go see it and I hadn't heard of it or knew what is was but I watched the trailer and thought, ""sure"" WOW what a movie. Bale and Damon were perfection in their roles. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I know nothing about racing. I had no idea anything like Le Mans existed.I hate how ken was treated but I loved what he did. He seemed like he was an amazing man, driver and engineer!! Ford owes him and Shelby everything!!"
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2019,5/10,"Maybe it's because we know the race result, so the suspense isnt really there. Some good cinematography but the race sequences are so repetitive."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,Highly recommend watching this movie. Such a great story to be told.
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,This tugs at the hearts of automobile lovers as well as the same car enthusiasts that are family men. The exceptional balance Mangold and the writers did here can never be pulled off by Michael Bay or JJ Abrams. This is an Oscar contender for me.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"Watched this in IMAX, incredible. Its the true story about one of our nation's most successful people, a revered racer and the legendary American race car that won the most prestigious race in the world 4 times over. Amazing acting and very genuine."
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,9/10,Surprised a car movie would have these goofs! (They should use me to screen vehicles.)
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,9/10,"I loved this movie... the acting, the story, the racing scenes. It really sucks you in."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2021,10/10,A golden era of motor racing and those cars were to die for which sadly a lot of drivers did. Top film.
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,10/10,"It's hard for me to give movies a 10 out of 10, but this movie has to be the best movie of 2019. From the second this movie starts youll be sucked into the story and youll feel every emotion from the actors. Just amazing!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"James Mangold has directed two of my favorite movies: Logan and 3:10 to Yuma and it's safe to say, he has done a tremendous job with this one!
It's a straightforward drama but at times, to my surprise, the movie is downright hilarious! There are two scenes where I couldn't stop laughing. Those low angle wide shots will give you eyegasm.
Bale and Damon's tempestuous friendship on screen is the real highlight of the movie made believable by their wonderful performances. Movie drags out for a while in the middle but it picks up as fast as a race car coming out of a pit lane. Bale's Brit slags are on point! Even if you don't know or care about cars I guarantee you'll enjoy this one."
FORD V FERRARI,5 November 2019,8/10,Saw this as part of a preview screening event. The dynamic between the 2 main characters (Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby & Christian Bale as Ken Miles) is electric and really emmersed me into the story. In America this film has been titled Ford vs Ferrari though personally I didn't think Ford came out well from this biopic. Nevertheless one of the best films of the year so far!!
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,"I am not a cars fan, I didn't know the history behind this movie, after a little research, of course isn't 100% fact because isn't a documentary.
Taking previous considerations, the script doesn't add anything without a purpose, the movie is engaging from first to the last scene. All actors have great chemistry each other, the CGI is barely noticeable, this is a true wonderful REAL car's movie. If not fans of automobiles really enjoy this, car lovers are going to love it.
The photography put the viewers in the action and emotions, it's wonderful too. One of the best movies of the year. This movie is gonna keep growing and growing in box office because no good movie passes without many people noticing."
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,2/10,"Usual USA propaganda.
No mention of x3 new Zealand drivers..
Load of bullocks"
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,2/10,"3/4 of drivers were from new Zealand.
Americans cant drive corners... ."
FORD V FERRARI,19 May 2021,10/10,"I had no idea what to expect. I knew the story, but the way they told it was amazing.They showed us Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby and his team were the true heroes, not the people at Ford.The acting was fabulous. Matt Damon and Christian Bale did a great performance and gave real personality to the characters.I enjoyed every second of this movie, i even had some tears at the end.10 out of 10, all day long."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,7/10,"Damon and Bale are terrific but and average Wacky Racers episode has more character depth. Racing exciting enough, even if Bale seems to have learnt how to drive by watching Talladega Nights. Far too long, but at least you can top up the popcorn and miss nothing."
FORD V FERRARI,16 September 2020,8/10,"Absolutely awesome movie
Great scene, great story and great chemistry between Bale and Damon.
I have a great new respect for ken miles and all his achievement."
FORD V FERRARI,3 July 2021,8/10,"Up there with Rush in terms of story and delivery but my god Christian Bale's accent is terrible. Fairly unique though, never have I mentally travelled from London to Yorkshire skirted the boarder of Scotland and made it back down to the west country in one sentence before!"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"So many epic scene.
Both Matt Damon and Christian Bale are brilliant actors.10 out of 10 indeed."
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,"As alway, bale is a great actor Leading a good story."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2020,9/10,"Ford v Ferrari is a 2019 American sports drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. The film stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone, and Ray McKinnon in supporting roles.The plot is based on a true story, two men - American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British-born driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), take on the racing team of Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race by building their own. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles were dispatched by Henry Ford II and Lee Iacocca with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.The plot is built on the automotive battle between two corporations, but director James Mangold narrows it down to two person character study. Both Matt Damon and Christian Bale understand their character's strong personalities and use it to fuel the dynamic between their respective characters. Christian Bale is brilliant and mesmerises the audience yet again playing Miles - a volatile underdog that Ford doesn't want on their team. Miles is at the heart of the film, and Bale is almost magical to watch. Matt Damon is far more fleshed out character as Carol Shelby and gets his big moments on screen which he makes the most out of. Their combination and chemistry is exhilarating; you can't help rooting for the two when they're on screen, even without any cars involved. Speaking of which, James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs.Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes brilliantly to the film as well. Jon Bernthal is solid, and so is Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, but the most heartwarming relationship is between Miles and his son Peter, played by Noah Jupe. This pushes the pedal on the screenplay, which keeps it thrilling and, surprisingly humorous enough to ensure there's not a dull moment in its two and a half hours runtime. Motorheads and racing fans are guaranteed to love 'Ford v Ferrari', but even the casual moviegoer will get a brilliant 'against-all-odds' story as well. 'Ford v Ferrari' at the end of the day is what one might say a real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, non-pandering movie that might seem endangered nowadays."
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,10/10,"Excitement , Frustration , Sympathy , Camaraderie , Loss, heartache , spirit of true friendship .... These are some of the emotions the viewers will experience while watching this cinematic jewel...Christian Bale nailed it each and every frame he appears...A Must Watch Film"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,"During certain scenes in the movie my heart was pounding so hard and breath was literally taken away. I didn't expect that intensity and masterful director's work, but even after 8 hours I am still contemplating the stuff seen.
Easily 10/10"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"To fully enjoy the racing scene, thus movie needs to be scene on the big screen. Jumped out of my seat on a couple of car collisions. Christian Bale & Matt Damon deserve Oscar nominations, but I give the nod to Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,10/10,Definately in my top 10 favourite movies. Bale is fantastic in it as always. Not even for a second you feel that he isn't a race car driver. Transports you to 60s. Racing scenes are flawless. Just go for it.
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,An amazing movie with an outstanding performance by Matt Damon. Real. Good movie!
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"I enjoyed every minute of this movie. you did it again Bale, also Damon did and amazing job. all actors was great ..."
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2019,10/10,"I attended the screening at Fox Studios yesterday and It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far, the Best Film of the Year!"
FORD V FERRARI,22 March 2020,9/10,I literally know nothing about cars but I still liked this movie.
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Excellent movie. Nice casting,Nice Screen play. Very good direction..Overall excellent.."
FORD V FERRARI,3 June 2020,10/10,"I came across this movie browsing hbo while chillin in my cabin in the woods. Saw that Matt Damon stars in it and decided to give it a go.
I must say it's been a while since I got this surprised by a movie.
Plot, tension, epic final, irs all there 🤙"
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2020,10/10,"Christian BaleThe chameleon with his thick British accent and goofy behaviour almost moulds into Ken Miles, the maverick British Race car driver. The role is played to such perfection that you can lick Christian and actually taste racing grease. He breathes his soul to the cagaracter and it's almost impossible to comprehend and this man could have done something else with his life in the meanwhile, upto Ford Vs. Ferrari was released.The Oscars should be resonating with his name once again..Bale once again dazzles the silvercreen with a bravura performance, adding yet another cap in a scintillating career studded with great performances. Indeed, a chameleon😎😀"
FORD V FERRARI,9 October 2020,8/10,Everything you want in a film. Cannot fault it at all. Stayed true to the story and complemented by fine performances from Bale and Damon. Underrated.
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,,"A spectacular journey filled with action, excitement, complex human relationships and great characters."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,3/10,"I don't recommend it. The drama was all about unconvincing excuses for depicting violence. Dramatic scenes and loud sounds does not in itself constitute good cinema. I had the thought that watching the move was like watching paint dry, but loudly.Techincally it was well done but there is no real story there, just famous names (both the actors and the characters depicted)."
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,10/10,Honestly cannot believe how good this film is! Was fixated all the way through and was sad when it was over. Obviously being a racing film the cars are out of this world but had me laughing my head off at points Matt Damon and Christian bale are actors I usually avoid but in this both are superb. An absolute must watch
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"This is a great movie. Casting, visuals, script and actual story! Definitely did the car movies justice and should go down as one of the all time best. Don't wanna give anything away but damn, FvF is outstanding!!"
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,10/10,Perfect actors for the role! Can't say anything but a great movie
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,6/10,"****** Warning mild spoilers ******.
I have always been critical of the 1971 Le Mans movie mainly due to the seemingly tacked on love story presumably put in on the behest of the studio to make it a movie rather than a documentary of the 1970 Le Mans race.However now that I have seen the latest Le Mans movie I have a nostalgic yearning for a movie with a pointless incomprehensible love story sparingly threaded in between fantastic racing footage and non CGI stunt work.Which is the complete opposite to what you get in Le Mans 66 which has instead threaded rather sparsely CGI heavy Le Mans racing footage in to a Bale/Damon star vehicleAt nearly 3 hours long it feels like watching a less than classic year at the 24 hours of Le Mans in its entirety, the story of how Henry Ford 2nd anger at Enzo Ferrari's apparent deception in Fords attempt to buy Ferrari is over simplified and rushed which would leave a viewer who had little or no knowledge of the true story behind the film baffled as to why Henry Ford was enraged enough to throw so much money at the GT40 project.Anyway eventually about just over half the movie run time we get to Le Mans in 1966 and we start to get what we paid for 'classic cars racing in a classic race' albeit CGI'd to the max.My advice wait for the movie to get on the streaming sites so you can fast forward through the porridge."
FORD V FERRARI,28 June 2020,9/10,Great movie! However the name is the reason why I gave it a 9 and not a 10!I've known of Carroll Shelby most of my life and to not have given this film its proper name is a crime to Mr. Shelby. A man who basically carved out the American racing scene before any of us knew about any famous american auto racers.
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2021,7/10,"Great making of a movie! It reminds me of the tremendous works that are getting done by the field workforce. Executives and Corporates can only make decisions in the AC rooms and amid luxury.Hats off to all of them who are getting the job done, without any appreciation.We need more of this kind of movie. Enjoyable from beginning to end."
FORD V FERRARI,29 June 2020,8/10,"Good movie and I don't even like racing. What a disappointment on the part of Henry Ford's ethics, though."
FORD V FERRARI,5 January 2020,9/10,"In the movie the Ford GT40 was delivered by a TWA DC10. However the DC10 was introduced in 1970, while the movie is set in 1966.
In reality the Ford was delivered by a TWA Boeing 727."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,8/10,What idiot let Matt Damon wear the black felt hat backwards?
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,10/10,That Two and a half our was the best time I ever spent for movies.
FORD V FERRARI,10 January 2020,9/10,"The movie was amazing, the performance of the actors was more than great, the only thing that I objects was the name it should be Ken not Ford v Ferrari
Ford is not the hero in this story"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"Christian Bale gives an outstanding preformance as Ken Miles in this movie. He really portrays the character credibly. In addition, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sublime. You also get a really good view into the corporate side of things and understand what is at stake for Ford and Ferrari. Perfect movie for all car lovers!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 June 2021,10/10,A flawless movie/flawless acting by all the actors no exception only that Christian Bale is always superior.
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,9/10,"I've enjoyed Ford v Ferrari, Emotion is a very key element in the success of a film and also to connect the film with viewers, and this film has plenty of it, Matt Demon just killed it in the role of Carol Shelby, he emoted all the emotions perfectly especially in the close up shots, Christian Bale played the don't give a damn type of character of Ken Miles very well(atleast I looked at that character that way), his body language in the film suited the character very well. The storyline of the film is scripted in a way that it never felt boring, I sat on the edge of the seat during the Le Mans race. The soung design was perfect, watch it with sorround sound system and you'll like it, especially because it's a racing film, the sounds of foreground and background and the music behind were perfectly blended doesn't matter how many sounds you here at the same time. some shots in the film were also good. I recommend you watch the film."
FORD V FERRARI,12 September 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen amazing performances all round ken miles was robbed!
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,8/10,"Starting with the story which is crisp and thrilling, Christian Bale what an artist he is, always setting up the standards of his movie high and his Co actor Matt Damon always came up with the expectations very well. Only one bad thing about the movie that it was too long and stretchy at one point so that's why I reduced half rating. It's a must watch movie 🎥"
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,8/10,Just the tension and stress you love feeling watching a scene (especially with super fast cars).Prints perfectly the real story of how Ford begun car races and it also shows how the world works around us with profit being on top of everything.
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,10/10,"When The eigien running it feel like you behine the wheel and rasing the ""Le-Mans"". If you are the fan of race car you will love it."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2020,10/10,Superb performance by both lead actors...A true masterpiece!!!
FORD V FERRARI,25 December 2019,10/10,This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Although it's a long movie my attention was captivated for the entire length of the film. Damon and Bale both delivered an Oscar worthy performance and they truly made the audience feel as though they were really there.
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,10/10,"Great movie, great actors !
Thank you very much for the great experience"
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"I watched the movie after knowing that James Mangold had directed it. It is one of those movies where after watching it you don't really feel that it was an 2.5 hr movie.It is difficult to compare it with ""Rush"" as the premise is different. Even though the title suggests "" Ford v Ferrari "" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.
The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it.
At the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time."
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,10/10,"This movie was perfect. I really don't care about cars or racing at all. I just love Christian Bale movies so I thought I'd take my dad to go see it. He's a big car junkie so I thought he'd like it. When the movie finished, the entire movie theater clapped. That was a first for me in my lifetime (I'm 25). Bale and Damon's acting was incredible. For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard. I seriously feel like we are in the dark ages of theater. There are about 2 movies a year that are good. I rarely mark movies as a 10, but when I left the theater, I couldn't help but mark it down as a 10. I loved the movie from start to finish."
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,8/10,"I enjoyed this movie so much, but was so disappointed that ""G.D."" had to be blasted in the first seconds of the show. You get it several more times before the movie's over. Why? No need for that. Secondly, they changed Ford's actual statement about beating Ferrari to ""greasy wop,"" just for shock value, I guess. Otherwise, this film has it all. Josh Lucas is the guy you'll love to hate."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Both have their atturide , not fading up infont of each other. tremondous chemistry, the end monoloige was great the 7000 rpm one. Will keep fighting for oscar.."
FORD V FERRARI,20 March 2020,9/10,The only part of the film I was unhappy with was Phil Remington was portrayed. Otherwise an enjoyable film
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,8/10,"I hate the race ending You get chills,i think ken miles death is not needed"
FORD V FERRARI,20 January 2021,10/10,"I hadn't heard too much hype about this film so wasn't expecting too much from it, but it really is quite astonishing. A great story incredibly well told, a quite brilliant cast, and some amazing cinematography.
I have to admit that I wasn't aware of this story, so it was nice to not know what was going to happen next!
The casting is perfect. 2 main protagonists that you're rooting for from the first minute, an believable family dynamic, and a very dislikable villain in Leo Beebe (found myself swearing at the screen at him at one point).
Totally immersive, and oddly seemed like it wasn't long enough at 2hr30mins. The sign of a truly great film."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"I have never written a review here before, but this movie inspired me so much, I just had to say something. FvF felt so much like my all time favorite movie, ""The Right Stuff,"" I was duly impressed. The acting, the cinematography, the script and direction were just spot on. I at first didn't want to see it because I absolutely hate Christian Bale, but his performance IMHO was Oscar-worthy. The racing scenes were exciting and visceral, the CG locations were perfect; everything about this movie just drew me in. I highly recommend FvF for the whole family!"
FORD V FERRARI,23 February 2021,8/10,"Good story. Good acting. A bit long, but the story needs that much time. Worth the time to watch it."
FORD V FERRARI,10 December 2019,10/10,"I've been a sports car and Formula 1 racing fan for sixty years, and I liked the racing scenes, but I loved this film for the story and the acting. You'll love all the heroes and despise all the creeps. There are no weak performances. Christian Bale, Caitriona Balfe, and Noah Jupe as the Miles family were outstanding. They all deserve some kind of award."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,Great story and great performance from both Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The ending seemed predictable towards end of the race but I was wrong.
FORD V FERRARI,16 October 2020,10/10,"For me it's a 10/10.This is simply one of the best movies made in the past decade. The effort put in, the act, camera shots it was all perfect."
FORD V FERRARI,7 May 2020,9/10,"Providing a monumental tribute to British sports car racer Ken Miles, 'Ford v Ferrari' delivers with high-powered action and superb sound and video editing. Albeit heavily handed on the action side, actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale manage to leverage the tension with pure hearted performances that speak volumes about human drive and passion."
FORD V FERRARI,10 November 2021,10/10,I give it 10 out of 10 because it's the only movie in recent memory where women stayed in the kitchen while men achieved greatness. Ken Miles' wife only left the kitchen to deliver him sandwiches.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,5/10,"Had a personal day yesterday and picked out a movie I figured my girlfriend didn't want to see (and boy was I right, for multiple reasons).Bale phones in his performance with a subpar Cockney accent that doesn't fool ANYONE, the script is predictable and the dialogue is flat and boring and makes you cringe so many times you start fearing for your health.I was close to leaving the theater at multiple occasions, and I was never as close as during the ""fight"" scene outside Bale's house. At that point, one thinks someone in the crew should've had the integrity to raise his or her voice and say they should just go ahead and scrap the whole thing. Cut their losses.It felt like a two hour and thirty minute Disney Channel-straight-to-DVD movie that could've easily been compressed to 60 minutes.The only demographics I see enjoying this are kids, and male car buffs in their 60s that still daydream about winning ""that"" race and riding down into the sunset with that girl from high school they were too scared to speak to speak to 45 years ago.For Bale, whose been on a roll in decent years, this movie is blemish of the worst kind. Sucks."
FORD V FERRARI,3 January 2020,10/10,Ok perhaps not perfect. But so much more than just a great guys movie. Edge of your seat and tearjerker in one plus brimming with great performance and oozing style.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,"The movie is really good overall. The sound and music were well put together, and the effects looked perfect. Without a doubt this is one of the best racing movies in my opinion."
FORD V FERRARI,21 February 2020,2/10,"Yes it is entertaining. But sooo cheesy. So corny. Really sick of cheesy American heroism movies. ""Lets go to war against Europe?"" really??? Why you would even remind about World War 2 in some racing car movie? Is it not enough millions of movies every year about a war? Can you leave this brainwashing, cheesy American patriotism out of racing movie"
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,10/10,"Cant say anything. It was just perfect.
I looooved it."
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,10/10,"They should do a Sequal about the accomplishments that Carroll Shelby did later until he cross the river, like he used to say
I own the Last car built by Carroll Shelby, that beat Ferrari. . GT350- R Concept. Built by Shelby and Ford racing Team to beat modern Supercars in 2011.
After they won, They interview Carrol, he said... I'm so happy, I am ready to cross the River........
Months later, the Legendary Carroll Shelby Passed Away.
If they do a sequel, that would be a great ending. Carroll on the track, doing what he loves. Beating Ferrari one last time. The image freezes. Letters come out on top...... Months later........ the Legendary Carroll Shelby passed. Away. He did what he loved til the end....."
FORD V FERRARI,14 April 2020,10/10,It'sa nice movie. I have never seen this type of race movie in my entire life.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Just back from Cinema and I'm soo Glad I experienced this Full on ""Pedal to the Metal"" movie masterclass on the Big Screen...An absolute gem of a film. Hat's off to Christian Bale (again) and Matt Damon.. Totally engaged emotionally with their story characters and their relationship.. I genuinely cant recommend this enough.. Jump in and enjoy the ride.."
FORD V FERRARI,5 December 2019,10/10,I love this movie from first minute. Amazing acting and chemistry between Mat and Bale. i lost trust that the American Cinema will come with amazing movie but here we are with this masterpiece. i think this will own Oscar.
FORD V FERRARI,21 September 2019,3/10,"It's not easy to make car racing look interesting on film, as shots of cars going around corners and faceless drivers shifting gears start to feel pretty repetitive. Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?"
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2021,10/10,"Bales performance should have gained him an Oscar. The intensity of racing was written on his face during the racing scenes. Matt Damon's role was the excellent cool counter weight to Bale and also an Oscar level performance. The other supporting actors finished it off in fine form. The writing and direction were right there, as well. Can watch this movie over and over."
FORD V FERRARI,8 August 2020,9/10,"Real story , amazing acting ( specially Christian Bale) , best movie in 2019 and that car's... mann
Everyone needs to watch this movie !!!"
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,10/10,No flaws. Everything is perfect. I would watching it again and again
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,It is great but it could have been shorter. Also Ken's death is sad.
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,9/10,"I must say, this is a movie that holds a perfect plot execution. Trust me, I watched a couple of true story based movies and not all of them succeed to deliver a fresh product while being 'a copy of something that happened in the past'. But Ford v Ferrari? The movie just nailed it. There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.The performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience. This movie was another example of his fine work.So, whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari will always be an enjoyable offer even for the muggles. 9/10 for a masterpiece!"
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,It's a story about two people and two star companies in automobiles. How life is full of ups and downs have shown in movie a great way. Some shots will give real adrenaline rush. Totally worth watching.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"Simply put, I LOVE this movie. Bale and Damon are next level, Mangold's direction is at his best, and the supporting cast is brilliant. If you do not know the story before going in, DO NOT RESEARCH. This was a story I had no idea about before hand and it blew my mind watching it unfold. If I have maybe 2 flaws, I wish some sympathy could have been put on Ferrari, as they seem like the stereotypical ""bad guy"" in the movie, and the 2nd half-hour does drag just smidge. Overall, in the words of Christian Bale's Ken Miles-- ""It's bloody brilliant!"""
FORD V FERRARI,26 January 2020,9/10,Movie that leaves you out of breath till the end.😎
FORD V FERRARI,17 May 2020,7/10,This movie is fun to watch. Only I wouldn't watch it again. It is better than the average movies though it is not the greatest.
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Went into this movie knowing almost nothing at all. I knew the two main actor, Christian bale and Matt Damon and that it was a true story about a race between Ford Vs Ferrari in a le mans 1996 race but I had no idea what happened or how it went down! However this movie was amazing for me and it told a story which was oh so much more than just a race. The chemistry between the two load roles were fantastic and really shined through, not even scared to say I may of shed a little tear during this movie! Defitnaly worth a watch for anyone who wants to be inspired."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,8/10,"I hadn't watched any movies of its kind before, and just saw it a couple of days ago. The acting was great, but a couple lines could've been better. The action was phenomenal, with some very intense and thrilling moments. The sound and soundtrack was very immersive, and really helped the movie out as a whole. The only other complaint I have is that one of the antagonists was very 'cookie-cutter', had quite a few bad lines.All around a fun and exciting experience."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,6/10,"ALMOST everything about this movie was so good. The acting, the dialogue, the sound design, the cars! It also just looks so beautiful. Whatever is shown on screen matches with the tone at all times, and the colours are gorgeous throughout. The sound track was also really good, especially during the race, and the race scenese had clutching my palms the entire time.The thing is, though, the story is just so weak! To me, the ending is just super depressing without reason. A tragic ending like that should feel deserved, but it didn't. If the movie ended with Miles losing first place, it would been a bittersweet ending, but I felt like they had to just shove his death in there. (Why is there a major plot point in the falling action?) I usually get so emotional during movies, but I literally felt nothing here.They changed the story so much already, couldn't they have just changed it a lil' more to make narrative sense? I really wanted to like it because I'm such a big fan of the actors, but the more I thought about the story, the less sense it made to me."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"I loved it, that chemistry between Damon and Bale was fantastic. If you like cars and races this is a grail."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,"By far the best racing movie in decades!! The racing scenes are incredible and the acting is award worthy. Being a dihard car guy, I believe I noticed a slight flaw in one scene, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 rating. During an early race scene (1963?) it showed several Corvettes competing, however one of them had a 1967 stinger hood. Anyway, since I'm planning on going a second time, I'll keep an eye out for it and correct my review if I was wrong =)"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,This movie is a roller coaster ride from start to end it will bind you. Christian Bale is outstanding in this movie. Matt Demon and Christian Bale steals the show. Go for it a must watch for everyone.
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"It's been a long time since I went to a movie that was so good it stayed with me for days. I, being a automotive enthusiast knew this story well yet the outcomes of the story still brought a tear to my eye. So well played. Nice that so many real cars were used and so accurately. It would seem Steve McQueen's Le mans would have been like this is if it was done today."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"If you like cars, this is a must see! It was also fun to watch Jason Bourne and Batman fight each other."
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,9/10,"This is a great movie with incredible race sequences and acting by the 2 leads - Christian Bale and Matt Damon. The sound effects are really awesome, please do go and watch this movie !!"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,10/10,"Decided to make an account and write this review just because how much I liked the movie, the acting was spot on and so was the cinematography.
watch the movie, you won't regret it."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"Incredible. Oscar worthy. The best movie on automobile competition with intense racing sequences and heart throbbing soundtracks. And last but not the least, incredible acting. 10 out of 10"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,10/10,"Finally a good movie in the last many many many years. Great camera, great actors, great scenes, great dialogues, and incredible chemistry all around. Damon is great as per usual, Bale carried it our fantastically. Warm, sad, brilliant, passionate movie. Just go and watch, no need to review it."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,"In my opinion Ford v Ferrari is a masterpiece, it is the first movie to ever make me cry and it is my new favorite movie."
FORD V FERRARI,30 November 2019,10/10,"The movie was hust great
I was in an awe of the way both christian bale and matt damon portrayed the charred
It was a balanced mix of action, drama, and comedy
The driving scenes were breath taking as wellI can say i just enjoyed each and every minute of it"
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,8/10,"""High speed's and thrilling bumper to bumper sequences aren't the only things this movie has to offer. With it's touching bromance and charismatic characters Ford v Ferrari is an homage to the truly great Hollywood films of old, as it brings to life a great cinematic representation of one of racings most historical events and truly becomes a must see for everyone.""On the surface, Ford v Ferrari is portrayed as a touch and go film for motoring enthusiasts, but after seeing the film that couldn't be further from the truth. Director James Mangold who's name is widely appreciated after films such as Logan and 3:10 to Yuma has really proven to the audience racing films are no longer just for a certain audience, but can be enjoyed by all in this exhilarating biopic. The movie really stands out through its main characters' bromance between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, delivering some of their best acting yet.The movie opens up with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby winning the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 for the Aston Martin team before explaining that the victory was short-lived, as Shelby's racing career comes to an end due to heart complications. After being forced into retirement Shelby focusses on his vehicle design and sales career whilst at the same time the audience is introduced to the big boss of Ford: Henry Ford II played tremendously by Tracy Letts. This scene sets up the entire drive of the film as the big boss explains to all of his working staff that ford is coming to an end at the hands of bad business and poor vehicle manufacturing leading to Fords diminishing reputation. From here the movie kicks into gear as the idea of buying out Ferrari runs across Henry Ford from the marketing man Lee Lacocca (Jon Bernthal), but goes south and a rivalry is born as Ford wishes to beat Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) at his own game. At the 24 hours of Le Mans, which Ferrari has dominated over the years.Matt Damon produces one of his best performances throughout his acting career within this film. Showing the audience a very likable, charismatic and enthusiastic Carroll Shelby who will stop at nothing to overcome the challenge laid out to him by ford. Another nice addition to this film is Ken Miles' wife Molly (Caitriona Balfe), who stands out as a badass in her own right as she knows what makes Ken really shiver in his boots, and in one great scene really makes the soon to be famous racing driver crap his pants. This movie holds a plethora of great characters and fantastic acting that will definitely have the academy keep a keen eye out heading forward towards the Oscars.Another fantastic outline within this film is its score composed by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders which really captures the feeling of racing, from the intense drumming and guitar riffs to the loud trumpets of victory the score doesn't feel the slightest out of place as it sticks to the instrumentals that you would find in such a time period.As much as this film is great there are some flaws that audience members will definitely take away with them. One glaring flaw is this films run time clocking in at two hours and thirty-two minutes. The film at some instances does feel like it begins to drag on a little, but this does thankfully become resolved as once the boredom begins to settle in it shoots back up to a thrilling pace which does seem to be great, but maybe a cutback on some of the more slower scenes would really help this film shine more within the audience. Another glaring flaw I noticed wasn't necessarily the movie itself, but it's marketing. The marketing seems to highlight one thing and one thing alone, and that is it's a car film. I understand yes it is essentially a car-based film, but it is also so much more with a great narrative about true success and fighting for a goal as well as just what it means to show fantastic sportsmanship. However, most of these highlights within the film are overshadowed within the trailers and previews with just racing which leads to only one certain audience really discussing this film, that audience being motor enthusiasts when in reality this movie is for everyone.And finally, we come to the verdict of this film. As much as I enjoy this film I understand that people have differing opinions so instead of giving out a solid number out of ten I will leave a quick overview so you can decide whether to see the film for yourself. This is a high stake sports film with intense scenes and loveable characters that show great development as the story goes on. The film has an enigmatic score and really captures the feeling of racing in the 60's that really puts you on the edge of your seat as the characters resonate with the audience making this experience something amazing.Written by:

FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,8/10,"Indeed a watch worth the wait. Nail-biting drama and an out-and-out edge-of-the-seat experience one could possibly want in a Christian Bale and Matt Damon starrer. And the sound effects!!!! Gosh!!! Truly exhilarating and fascinating work of art displayed by the sound design team. Perhaps watching it in IMAX just added to the experience tenfold. Bale was as stupendous as could be; possibly one of the best we've seen him in in quiet a while. Damon was no less astounding in his own right.
It won't be wrong to say that one of its greatest technical achievements lies in the fact that you don't necessarily have to be a ""car-guy"" to be able to commend this marvel. Another commendable fact was that despite being based on a true story, it had us giving a slight feeling of unpredictability at points, which was, in fact, a sight to behold. Also, in spite of being a tad bit long, it never even seemed to lose grip of the plot.The monstrous sound of the roaring engines could be felt throughout the entirety of the theatre, so even if a ""non-car-guy"" feels bored, these blaring sounds won't let him sleep. The final act was a bit of a let-down which was not what I expected to be the outcome.
All-in-all a feature rife with intensity, emotions, breakdowns (technical and emotional) and an over-the-top sound design which suffices for an individual to enable him to say that he is a member of such a cinephilic community that prides itself on being able to witness such level of filmmaking. Long live cinema!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,10/10,"This movie is going down as one of those classics that never let you down. They got the action right , they got the history right ! A truly mesmerising watch for the petrol heads."
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,9/10,"Bale (Driver) and Damon (Car designer) spun magic on the viewers with their tremendous chemistry, stellar performance which seems very real ! Bale's acting requires a special mention which seems to make the movie even more top class ! Great story and portrayal .. The cars roaring on the tracks will linger for sometime .."
FORD V FERRARI,9 December 2019,1/10,"I gave this a 1 start because of the historical inaccuracies. It would seem that a large part of their target audience would be race fans, and I hope they'd know this history. Just a couple of points ... it took Ford 3 years (not 2) to beat Ferrari, and, Shelby America came up with a system for changing brakes without changing the whole front suspension (which isn't what they showed in the movie). Sure, they changed out the caliper, but the rotor and caliper, and that was it. This seems like making a movie about the moon landing and claiming Apollo 10 got their first. If you're going to make this movie, get the facts straight."
FORD V FERRARI,11 December 2019,10/10,"After Rush, became one of the best films I've ever seen. I definitely recommend you to watch."
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2019,9/10,What a revelation and so refreshing to watch a film where Hollywood tells a story close to the truth and has a Brit who is the (joint) hero.
FORD V FERRARI,28 December 2019,9/10,"A superior racing movie with friendship at its core.At the very beginning you will sense an amazing chemistry between two main actors,surely an Oscar winning potential for both Bale and Damon.
Movie has really mesmerising and energy-filled racing scenes that will make you feel like driver itself going through all the difficulties
of driving at highest possible speed.
A truly wonderful experience,for racing fans and non-racing also,nicely paced with right humour,smartly structured dialogues and atmosphere that will instantly drag you in!"
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,"First of all Happy New year 2020 everyone...we've entered the New decade and this is the first thing I'm doing...writing my first review for the last movie I watched in the 2010s...this movie is a MASTERCLASS in filmmaking...the performances,the direction,the score and screenplay is all perfect...this movie is 2.5 hrs long but doesn't bore you for a single minute...this will always have a special place in my heart!"
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2020,9/10,"Yes indeed, I say it; as good as ""Rush"" (the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda). This movie focuses on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.Christian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.If you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).The way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !I will definitely get this on DVD."
FORD V FERRARI,18 February 2020,10/10,Watching it a second time even though I only rented it because of the Oscar nominations. It simply is the full experience of all you could want in a movie.
FORD V FERRARI,13 January 2020,10/10,"A great movie pretty much in tune with the real story! This is how movies should be made, this had everything except a happy ending of course and it states out the reality of the world."
FORD V FERRARI,14 January 2020,10/10,I created the account only for the review. Title says it all.
FORD V FERRARI,21 January 2020,10/10,"However I am a big fan of Fantastic movies( especially Marvel movies). This movie so inspired me. It has perfect acting and the perfect made scenes which makes Oscar movie especially when Kenn beats his own record ( which shocked Enzo ferrari) it gives the audience excitement as you won the race on your own. But when you know that Kenn loses the race you get so angry .
For me this movie beat both "" Avengres: Endgame"" and ""Joker""."
FORD V FERRARI,23 January 2020,10/10,"Fast and Furious, no not the movie, the two words that best describe James Mangolds newest project, Ford V Ferrari. On the outside, Ford V Ferrari may seem like your run of the mill racing movie with a simple plot, but after watching you realize that it is much more than that. You see obsession, tension, and an overarching rivalry between The Ford Motorcompany and Ferrari. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), shows a compulsive behavior that radiates to those around him, he feels a need to win. For a chance at winning the 1966 24 Hours at Le Mans, Ford recruits Carol Shelby (Matt Damon), who then brings in Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as his faithful driver that has a bad rap in the racing scene but most importantly he can drive, and he can win. Starting out racing smaller circuits, Miles is afraid his racing career won't lead to success, and with a wife and a son, he is pressured to put down racing all together. This is until he is approached by Shelby about the plan Ford has to tarnish Ferrari's successful reputation in Le Mans.
Throughout the movie, Miles has a hostile relationship with Ford and its head executives. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) doesn't see Miles as being the face of Fords racing team. Miles and Shelby are constantly fighting with Henry Ford II and his team of executives to try to gain the freedom to create what they want. Shelby's outside the box thinking mixed with Miles' self centered attitude show how much they can influence a big brand, even if everyone is against them. Fords financial problems mixed with jabs taken at Henry Ford II by Enzo Ferrari encourages Ford to give Shelby the keys Fords new racing team.
Damon's cool southern composure and Bales witty thinking create a perfect chemistry that is hard to recreate. Although the team may fight, sometimes literally, they always seem to show respect and understanding for each other. Shelby, from the beginning, sees something in Miles and he can tell Miles will be the best driver for Ford. After getting the offer to race for Ford by Shelby, Miles quickly gets to work developing the famed GT40 race car, the only American made car to win the 24 Hours at Le Mans to this day.
Mangolds vision and execution in this movie perfectly encapsulates the golden age of racing. A time when teams did anything they could to win, when innovation was new and ideas were fresh. Everything from the sound design and visual effects to the pace of the movie flawlessly fuse together to keep you involved and interested. Everyone from gearheads that know every dimension of every part of the cars used in the movie, to those who have never thought to change their oil will be satisfied with this movie. Along with the cars, you also get to see relationships grow, watch hard times get resolved with hard work, and challenges get over come with persistence, making this a great all-around movie."
FORD V FERRARI,29 January 2020,10/10,I watch this only by seeing the title and did not exspect how good this movie is plus all the great actors. Ive seen it 4 time and its one of the movies I could rewatch over and over. Its also the untold story of ken miles. Plus at one time we owned a cobra mustang so my kids learned how ford and carol teamed up. Great job on this movie.
FORD V FERRARI,1 February 2020,8/10,A fascinating display of the biographies of car companies and famous drivers nice
FORD V FERRARI,2 February 2020,9/10,Fantastic movie! But I wonder what took it so long to make a film based on this true story? Thank you all who made this film!
FORD V FERRARI,10 February 2020,1/10,"I don't understand why this film is receiving so much recognition. It is a very bad movie with very mediocre acting (maybe even bad, cause too unrealistic and exaggerated), an unrealistic storyline, with dialogues that would never exist in the real world. I mean it's the classic american film that wants to glorify the american culture and all that. Maybe it was liked because of this. There are many stupid stereotypes too. This film don't deserve even a nomination at the oscars."
FORD V FERRARI,12 February 2020,9/10,It was really wonderful movie that you can go a fast journey with ford car with a goon driver. Let's go guys....
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,10/10,"Didn't get to see this in the theatre... wish I had because even on my big screen tv...acting, action, special effects and storytelling was GREAT!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2020,10/10,"One of the most beautiful movies i ever seen.
With so much exiting scenes"
FORD V FERRARI,28 February 2020,10/10,"Its been a while i did really enjoyed a movie.
I never expected such smooth story from this movie.I thought a casual movie turned out one of the best one i have watched in 2019.I didn't even knew the race existed before watching this movie .Totally awesome package."
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,7/10,"A slick, thrilling look back at the golden age of auto racing. Ford v Ferrari is an old-fashioned film, not only due to the fact it takes place in the mid-60's but also in the way it is directed, the story being told, and the experience delivered in the theatre. The film is a tip of the hat to old-school movies about people with real-life problems. Well-directed, well-written, well-delivered."
FORD V FERRARI,1 January 2021,10/10,Those emotions when you are watching these racers coming against each other - that's one hell of a ride! Very talented work put by the team and congrats on making it happen!
FORD V FERRARI,23 March 2020,9/10,"Screenplay at best .
Actors have done amazing jobs !!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 August 2021,10/10,"The final of the movie is a little bit stupid, even tho, the same team the said ken miles, kept a ""several laps"" ahead of the rest, they couldnt get ken miles in the last lap, and cross the finish line all together, and magicly, miles loss the advantage..
Wtf?"
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2019,9/10,"After what feels like an endless stream of appallingly made movies full to the brim of woke politicising, finally, finally a movie that just wants to tell a good story in a fluent and thrilling manner. Bale is absolutely perfect as Ken Miles, Damon less so as Carroll Shelby but still very decent. The racing scenes are totally engrossing, the settings are evocative and the film flies by despite coming in at more than 2:30hrs. Do yourself a favour and go see it."
FORD V FERRARI,2 April 2020,10/10,Love this movie . I regret not seeing it in the theaters !
FORD V FERRARI,28 June 2020,9/10,"First of all, I would like to say that I am not exactly a big fan of racing cars. For that same reason, it took me a while to see this film, despite all the great prizes and nominations it won. As I mentioned earlier, I was a little skeptical, but I can conclude that it really is an extraordinary film in all aspects. From the first to the last minute, I was completely glued to the development of the story. I also highlight Christian Bale and Matt Damon's excellent performances.
Anyway, I really recommend to everyone to see this masterpiece, I also confess that I became a big fan of car racing, especially the 24 Hours of Le Mans."
FORD V FERRARI,24 April 2020,9/10,"If you're not a car/racing nut, don't be put off by the title. Even though the storyline is about the real life battle between the two car giants, the best thing about this film is Damon's and Bale's on-screen friendship, the cherry on the cake being Christian Bales portrayal of Ken Miles. I couldn't stop watching this film and everytime I grinned from ear to ear. I'm glad I saved it for watching during the Covid lockdown."
FORD V FERRARI,13 May 2020,10/10,I gave 10/10 for CHRISTIAN BALE alone . The rest was like bonus to me. Go for it👍
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,10/10,A true master piece of this day and age. Sound mixing was magic to my ears!
FORD V FERRARI,22 July 2020,10/10,"I highly recommend this movie to everyone, is one of the greatest movies I've seen in my life. Being a true story, and in some parts sentimental, makes it hard not to cry and feel a lot of emotions while watching it."
FORD V FERRARI,3 October 2020,9/10,"After watching this movie the only thing you wanna do is hold the clutch and press the accelerator off and kick 7000 RPM and shout at top of your voice... YES You go Girl!
It's a must watch movie if you want to feel the heat of Le Mans race 🏁 if you want to clap and dance for Christian Bale as Ken Mills ... If you want to see powerful acting of Matt Damon as Carrol Shelby.. If you love cars and see how powerful drivers and engineers struggle to bring such master piece up. Effortless acting by both the actors."
FORD V FERRARI,14 September 2020,1/10,"Name should have been ""Ford vs Shelby,"" or ""Ford Likes Money."" Movie had nothing to do with racing or Ferrari. Name Ferrari was just stuck in the title to dupe suckers to come to the theaters. If you like a movie like""Wall Street"" about corporate greed, larceny, and ego, this is your movie. If you like racing, go find copy of ""Grand Prix"" (James Garner) or ""Le Mans"" (Steve McQueen) and have an exciting enjoyable evening. Skip the Fast/Furious series. That's not racing. That's CGI. Saturday Morning Cartoons."
FORD V FERRARI,17 September 2020,9/10,"A real story based movie is always snatches my eyes. After a long time, a racing movie that's actually about racing. I felt race the whole two and half hours. A movie with bunch of talented actors. Christian Bale is an actor with versatility we all know, Matt Demon as well. Director James Mangold portray the movie with his own hand.
For an basic overview, this film recounts to the tale of how the Ford Motor Company was battling during the 1960s and hence went to hustling vehicles to give their images a lift. For quite a long time, Ferrari has been the best quality level in that theater. Yet, with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) directing the venture and the unpredictable Ken Miles (Christian Bale) steering the ship, they set out to bring down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.
The battle started when Ford went to buy most of the share of Ferrari as because of Ferrari was bankrupted. But Ferrari refused to sell their shares with them as they got more better offer from an another Company. After getting all the insult, Henry Ford the second decided to build the best racing car.
It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing.
I have to mention, this is a movie you can watch with your family, no doubt. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days.
Most of them complained about the movie time period. But I would like to say, you will never feel that you are waste your time. Each of the second, the director tried to utilize. Even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy.
In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging and emotional movie. I would recommended to everyone to watch this movie. I guarantee you won't regret after watching it."
FORD V FERRARI,8 November 2020,10/10,Such a great movie of 2019. After watching this movie i started loving ford so much.
FORD V FERRARI,28 September 2020,8/10,It was amazing shows ever I show because it was very excited and have more fun
FORD V FERRARI,4 October 2020,10/10,"I watch a lot of movies it's a good way to pass time especially during the pandemic. This movie was on in the background wasn't planning on watching a movie that night. Started watching and I couldn't stop. I haven't seen a movie in years that has done that to me. It was extremely entertaining, well done, and thrilling. This movie made me feel emotions, no movie has done that to me since I was 5 years old watching the wild things, I loved it. I'm not even into cars, this was just a masterfully told story that I enjoyed every minute of."
FORD V FERRARI,20 October 2020,10/10,"Even if you know nothing about cars and racing and stuff you are still going to love this movie.The performance by Christian Bale was outstanding , should have received an oscar nomination in my opinion."
FORD V FERRARI,1 November 2020,10/10,"This movie is very right to see all
needed
There are also 10 ratings for this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,4 March 2021,9/10,"It has a good reputation,and I finally decided watching it
This film has everything to be a masterpiece"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2020,8/10,"Ford v Ferrari is the business competition film which is explained negative and positive sides between both. From the part of the film, Ford's technician left the screw behind Ferrari's technician, this scene showed how Ford is very foul, moreover Ford's technician is the one who stole watch from Ferrari's technician. It was a great movie you would not have any disappointment and you will see different sides between Ford and Ferrari, you should watch once in your life."
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2020,8/10,Great overall film. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are amazing!
FORD V FERRARI,16 January 2021,9/10,"I was in the middle of writing a pen pal letter when my dad put this film on earlier tonight. At first I wasn't paying much attention. But, per usual, it was Christian Bale that pulled me in. I set my pen and paper aside for later and sat on the couch to watch what I expected to be just another sports film. By the end of it, both my dad and I were a teary-eyed messes.There are some truly beautiful performances by Bale and Damon, and the chemistry between the entire damn cast is incredible. Caitriona Balfe is so charming as Mollie and I honestly wanted to punch Josh Lucas in the face the entire time he was on screen (in a good way, that means he played his part extremely well). The story was exceptionally crafted and the overall aesthetics were stunning. And the cars. Oh, the cars. You can't watch this film and come out of it without saying that you want to ride passenger in a race car like Henry Ford II.Truly, this two-and-a-half-hour work of art was everything I wanted and more, giving me hope for the future of cinema. It was so much more than just another sports film. It was moving, powerful, and goddamn hilarious when it needed to be. This is a film I truly think I'll watch again and again in the future-and not just to giggle at Christian Bale's real voice."
FORD V FERRARI,18 December 2020,8/10,"Im a car guy, so I couldn't help but notice all the flaws in the vehicles (mostly the sound effects were completely wrong! the 427 Cobras have deep LOUD raw throaty power, the buzzy sound of the cars in the movie with the mysterious tuner whine sounds were disappointing. Christian Bales character was brilliant!! His enthusiasm for cars was addicting...Matt Damon just chewed his cud every scene, gum, food, whatever was in his mouth, chewing the entire time. One scene it seemed like he was borrowing from Oceans 13, (where his mom bailed him out of jail) same line delivery. He didn't even try to look like C. Shelby"
FORD V FERRARI,19 January 2021,10/10,"I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see some ol' school style movie!A few words about the movie. The movie was just amazing. I haven't seen such an amazing movie in years. The movie had it all. Feelings, action, adrenaline, personal - family life, drama and more. The way in which all this was connected was a sign that it had an impressive director. Good job! That's a thousand bucks! From me 10/10 stars! When there's another chance, I'll watch it live in the movies as soon as we're done with the corovirus. And when there's a chance, I really want to shake hands with the director, and the actors who played in the movie."
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2021,10/10,"The heroic story of how a massive corporation, somehow against all odds, beat the owner of a car company that was more passionate about winning races than turning a profit."
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2021,9/10,The cinematography to story to acting....... Everything is just so amazing... The setting is also really good... Best 💯
FORD V FERRARI,17 February 2021,10/10,"One amazing movie, really loved the story, music and perfect choice of artist selections"
FORD V FERRARI,17 April 2021,9/10,"I really liked the movie as the 1966 le mans is one of my favourite races. I like how the movie starts off with Carroll Shelby racing in the rain really fast. Although that he didn't catch fire in that race, I believe this was a good idea as it shows that Shelby is a man of commitment no matter the cost. The scene then changes to him being in the doctor's office and the doctor telling him that he should stop racing due to his hereditary heart condition. Not a lot of people may know this but Ken Miles' nickname was side bite as he used to talk with the side of his mouth. I believe that mentioning his nickname would've been a great addition to the movie. One thing that I didn't like was how the producers showed Ken Miles staying at the garage during the 65' Le Mans race. In real life, he was actually racing in the 65' Le Mans but had to forfeit the race due to the GT40 Mk1's gearbox problems. There are other inaccuracies in this film also but I believe that it makes the film an interesting film. I watched the film twice and to be honest, I'd watch the film a lot more as it's a very good movie, in my opinion of course."
FORD V FERRARI,8 May 2021,10/10,It's the kind of movie where you are constantly hooked to the screen and loving and living every moment of it.
FORD V FERRARI,20 June 2021,10/10,"Very impressed and didn't realize is a story that about dream,commercial also bureaucratism. Line from this movie is very sharp as well ,two actors catch the feeling of true friendship. I can't help feeling is a bit western cowboy spirit in it. Modern day of chasing the spark of dreams."
FORD V FERRARI,30 October 2021,10/10,"It's like watching F1 live from the side of the track. World-class sound effects, picture quality and player performance. Watch without thinking. The best racing movie."
FORD V FERRARI,17 August 2021,9/10,"An all-star cast tells us how Ford dethroned Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans after Henry Ford gives himself the goal to beat Ferrari for which he enlists former Le Mans winner and car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale). This is not a movie I initially wanted to watch. I cared about who won the 1966 Le Mans about as much as I care about who won the 2009 Air Guitar World Championship (for the record: Sylvain ""Gunther Love"" Quimene). I can now tell you that this is the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, held annually since 1923 near Le Mans, France. It is considered one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. Unlike fixed-distance races whose winner is determined by minimum time, the 24 Hours of Le Mans is won by the car covering the greatest distance over 24 hours.

I ended up laughing out loud, being on the edge of my seat and tearing up. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are so good that when they start fighting like 2 middle age friends, I didn't even think about Batman and Jason Bourne getting in a fistfight until the movie was over, watching interviews with the actors. Once again, Christian Bale had to lose a considerable amount of weight to play Ken Miles having just finished Vice (2018), where he played Dick Cheney and had 7 months to go down from 240 lbs to 170 lbs. Not only to match Miles's physicality but also to fit in the GT40. I did not know the backstory, so in case you don't know what happened, I will not reveal most of the critical events as living them in real-time was fantastic.

FORD V FERRARI,29 August 2021,9/10,Awesome movie! I watched it a while ago and will not forget it soon!
FORD V FERRARI,8 November 2021,9/10,"No matter you love cars or not, but this movie will make you so excited whenever you will see a Ford Car. It will make you remind everything. The movie highlights the history of the ford of how Ken Miles efforts made won the Le Mans tournament. A must watch movie once in your lifetime."
FORD V FERRARI,8 April 2020,8/10,Such a solid movie all around. The reviewer who pointed out that Ford was Goliath hit the nail on the head. And Ken Miles got steamrolled by them. The photo-op victory where Miles sacrificed his achievement for Ford's ego was heartbreaking and disgusting. I couldn't help but think how this exemplifies America's version of capitalism.
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2021,10/10,One of the best movies I have seen in years. Great script and acting. The best part about the movie is real life events.
FORD V FERRARI,27 January 2020,10/10,"Interesting story played by good actors.They overdid filters so that colours look rather unnatural and weird, but otherwise it a great movie."
FORD V FERRARI,2 August 2020,9/10,"I've enjoyed every moment of the movie. Great casting, acting, script... overall a great experience"
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,9/10,"The movie is more than what the title tells you ,more than a competition between Ferrari and Ford owners, it's the passion for racing and the connection you develop with your car when you build it from scratch. Highly recommended. When you leave the cinema you want to take your car for a perfect lap"
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Great movie from an another age...
... an era, when there was no computer assisted driving aids (ABS, ASR, etc).
When there was no climate change hysteria, no pc-culture.
When man's was masculine, women's was feminine, and nobody mixed up things.
Mat Damon and Christian Belle are gorgeous.Ps.:
In the movie Ken Miles wife, Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) was a big, heart warming surprise for me.
She loved her husband till the very end, and support him in good and bad times well.
It is very hard to find a woman like her, these days...
She still loved and support her husband, when he told her that they lost everything, and they are broke as can be...
The IRS closed down the garage, etc...The '60s...
Another times, another world, another moral."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,"One of the amazing movies I've ever seen 😍 I recommend all car lovers to watch it, also the classic cars looks really nice, where did they get all those cars from"
FORD V FERRARI,25 March 2020,9/10,"Brilliant acting, great flow of the story, awesome. Music"
FORD V FERRARI,24 May 2020,5/10,"Imagine making a movie called Ford v Ferrari, and giving Ferrari driver Bandini just a constant evil grin, no lines. Not one. Making Ferrari boss Enzo an a-hole. He uses translator, but when it comes to insulting he becomes Hamlet. As for the Le Mans 66', the racing scenes are weak. Miles behind Bandini, he passes him. And he is still one lap behind. The gap is 8,5 miles now. Then boom! He is right behind him again on the very next scene. And this is a 2 and a half hour movie by the way. Some other scenes are ridiculous. Leo Beebe calls a guy on pit and makes him show the sign EZ to slow Miles. He makes million more terrible things like that. Better call the movie Ford vs Leo Beebe. Only good thing about this movie is acting by Bale, as expected. Other than that, it is just another big Hollywood production to make big money by stupifying everything in the story (1917 does the same), because the Hollywood formula demands it. Dumb movies make money. What a time to be alive..."
FORD V FERRARI,25 January 2020,2/10,"Stupid plot, labeling the characters as ""good"" or ""evil"" in a superficial manner. The main characters' victory is overrated, as the Ferrari team didn't even finish the race. Total waste of time..."
FORD V FERRARI,11 November 2020,8/10,"I am neither a big fan of motor sports nor I fancy Ford as a brand. Nevertheless, I had a great time watching this movie. First, I hesitated to watch the movie because of its duration and just decided to watch it being a great fan of Christian Bale. But once I started to watch, I immediately got into the movie and watched every second with great pleasure. Christian Bale rocks one more time. Matt Damon is also good but when compared to Bale, his acting is nothing close to Bale's level. Don't hesitate to watch this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,9/10,"Beautiful cars, superb story, great acting and fantastic action and suspense. . Did I mention the cars?"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Starts off a bit slow, but gets better along the way."
FORD V FERRARI,15 January 2020,10/10,"I'll give 100 stars on this movie, Better than newest Fast and Furious."
FORD V FERRARI,16 July 2020,10/10,"Does anyone else get serious RacerX and Speed Racer vibes during the Le Mans racing scenes? This movie is gripping from the word ""GO!"" And they couldn't have picked a better cast to do this story justice! Ken Miles will go down in history and one of the best racers ever and this movie is a beautiful tribute!"
FORD V FERRARI,7 December 2019,10/10,"You'll laugh, suffer, love, and feel every corner raced. It is an accurate story, and the cast is near perfect. I'd see it again!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"So good! We loved it. The history was great, the cars were so cool."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,6/10,"This is not about Ford vs Ferrari. This is not about 24h Le Mans. This is about Shelby and Miles, dramatized Hollywood style."
FORD V FERRARI,26 March 2020,8/10,I love true based movies and this is also a special movie of this type!It doesn't need to be a car lover to enjoy this movie! Another outstanding performance from Christian Bale and Mat Damon
FORD V FERRARI,16 February 2020,10/10,"I am not a race car fan. In fact, I know nothing about it or even cars. They do not interest me. However, this movie was fantastic. The acting was superb, storyline interesting, and great characters. I even enjoyed the car racing scenes. Never grew bored. Can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this movie!"
FORD V FERRARI,6 December 2019,9/10,"Great movie Amazing performance and acting, The Amazing soundtrack"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,8/10,"Screenplay and directorial decisions are not something that would help make it a classic movie, however great acting really pulled my vote up"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"Can't say enough about the acting, pace, driving sequences, attention to detail. It's as good as Rush."
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,10/10,A wonderful movie! Well written and beautifully acted! Damon and Bale are spectacular! I laughed. I cried. I got angry. I was on the edge of my seat! Be ready to experience a rollercoaster of emotions when you see this film. Wow!
FORD V FERRARI,19 November 2019,10/10,"Hand clapping and tear drops when Miles was slowing down, waiting for other 2 Ford cars and touch the finish line together"
FORD V FERRARI,7 February 2020,10/10,"Very Good, and realistic film.
I enjoy from this film.
Thank you"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,The best movie of 2019!And finally a real car movie! Not like fast n furious who started as good car movies and just turned in to another action movieI want to see it again!
FORD V FERRARI,26 November 2019,10/10,"I simply love this movie, what a great story to be told and Matt Damon and Christian Bale are magnificent in their respective roles as Shelby and Miles. It's one of the greatest moments in racing history and I'm happy it could be shared in this fashion."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"In spite of being a Motorsports fan I can truly say this was a great film. Brilliant casting of Matt Damon and Christian Bale and Ken Miles wife Mollie was spot on also. But it was the story that held you in suspense, especially during the racing scenes unexpected climax to the Me Mans race but still true to the real story. Dramatic ending when Ken died but again true to the story. Try to see this film even if you are not a Motorport fan"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,8/10,"This is the ROCKY of car racing movies.You'll smile, you'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll pump your fist, and by the end, you might even cry.Matt Damon and Christian Bale are reliably great, and the racing scenes adrenaline-:inducingly exciting.Highly entertaining, highly recommended."
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"Great acting! OMG! Every actor/actress was on point, absolutely no dull moments! Finally a real story about real people, real super heroes! And real villains! Our family loved it and we've been talking about the most memorable scenes ever since. Well thought out. The movie is genius. More like this please!"
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,9/10,Thrilling experience of the battles between men and machine
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,Amazing movie... As usual Christian Bale and Matt Demon are amazing in their characters Ken Miles & Corroll Shellby.... Direction is awesome as well from James Mangold.... On of the best movies I have seen in longtime
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,"This academy award star studded fact based is a must watch. Even if you are not motor racing fan, you will like the brilliant performance of Christian Bale (Playing Ken Miles a racing car engineer), Matt_Damon (Playing Carroll Shelby American automotive designer, racing driver, entrepreneur) even less familiar Jon Bernthal (Playing Lee Iacocca- man behind Mustang) will never fail to engage you. In terms of racing movies this looks more real, thrilling with great sound, excellent cinematography and meticulous directions. It's several notches ahead than fast and furious. It is now one of my favorite 5 movies.For me It's a must watch again."
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,9/10,Shows fast and furious how race movies can have some quality as well.
FORD V FERRARI,18 March 2020,9/10,The depiction of the story was spot on the only thing that drove me nuts was the voice where not with th mouth movement which made me spend more time watching that the. The story it was like watching a Bruce lee movie trying to figure out how they got sound of the year. But over all great story for carrol Shelby and Ned Miles
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,"One of the best car movies i have seen in a while.Amazing performances by the lead actors,wonderful cars,thrilling atmosphere,pounding soundtrack.
Hearing just the roars of the engines makes your body shake,close your eyes and you are there,on the racing track,just this close to the magnificent Ford.
Will you win or lose,
first or second on the finish lane,
the racing begins and you are on the front seat,
enjoy it.
One hundred percent worth the experience."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,8/10,Fascinating look into the race to get a Ford into let mans. Good storytelling and acting from the leads. Ending is rather abrupt.
FORD V FERRARI,14 April 2020,10/10,I am an automotive fan to begin with and this film told one the best automotive stories in history and did it well!
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,9/10,"It is a beautiful human adventure very well told. I'm not a fan of car racing because I think it's stupid. But in this adventure, the important thing is the innovation influenced by this great race at Le Mans and to push the limits. Great story."
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,10/10,Bit surprised to see the overall Box office collection... This movie deserves more....
FORD V FERRARI,13 November 2019,10/10,"Awesome cast, awesome acting, awesome action. Best movie of the year for a motorhead.
Enjoy"
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2020,10/10,Oscar deserving performance by both Matt Damon and Christian Bale... but Bale is absolutely at his finest!
FORD V FERRARI,15 November 2019,10/10,"What an incredible film, great pace, amazing acting, a story that sucks you in and takes you on a ride. I thought that it may feel too long but the time flew by and I didn't want it to end!! The 4d staging was perfect too. I'm heading back for this at the cinema again for sure!"
FORD V FERRARI,30 December 2019,10/10,"This movie got me glued on the chair the whole time. I was so much into the movie that it felt like I was inside the screen for the entire time. Outstanding one. Undoubtedly one of the best movies I have watched so far.
Will be waiting to see Peter on the wheels ASAP."
FORD V FERRARI,7 April 2020,8/10,"Fantastic movie, with hints of comedy, it's a story well told and great parts played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale."
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,10/10,I loved every moment of this film! Fantastic acting and on screen chemistry. Light comical moments mixed with nail biting action and touching tenderness. For me this is an instant classic with everything you could want from a film and not one moment of boredom considering it's quite lengthy.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,"A cracking good film made in as close a style to old-school Hollywood (back when they made good films consistently) as you can possibly get.It's got good old-school messages about sons and fathers and what it means as an artist to fight against the corporate mindset, and WIN. And this film is a WINNER through and through - all the way to the checkered flag.Long after the roar of high octane carburetor mixed engines and the scream of burning rubber and brake gaskets leaves you, you'll be left with a film that took you on a journey through the absolute best of the American dream.And a film that deals with both the lows of poignant loss and the highs of incandescent heroism.Nothing will ever diminish this film, it is timeless."
FORD V FERRARI,26 July 2020,8/10,"I am not a racing fan, but this movie still could instill thrill and chill in me. The way the chase sequences were filmed is outstanding."
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,Excellent acting by the entire cast. The race scenes convey the power and danger of the races.
FORD V FERRARI,12 December 2020,10/10,"Awesome movie, it's a Must Watch for all race lovers"
FORD V FERRARI,4 September 2020,9/10,I have no interest in fast cars at all! has also not been interested in racing movies. But thanks to christian bale fantastic achievements in his role as the slightly crazy and absolutely fantastic mechanic and driver. It also attracts a non-motor interested audience. Definitely a movie that everyone should see!
FORD V FERRARI,8 February 2020,10/10,Zeer geweldige en mooie film.Vol van spanning en emoties.
FORD V FERRARI,8 January 2020,6/10,"Almost hard to tell the differnce between this movie and Cars (Lightning Mcqueen Etc), so much CGI and awful speed sensation. Doing 200mph down a straight on a racetrack or 40mph on a sunday cruise? No one can spot the differenc.Bale and Damon rescue this movie from being a 3-4 rating. Its a decent to good movie but all those CGI stuff just takes you right out off it."
FORD V FERRARI,18 April 2020,8/10,Must watch.. superb acting by both Matt and bale..
FORD V FERRARI,18 January 2020,9/10,"Brilliant acting, brilliant storyline and the way it was done. Have the feel for old school and being there feeling the betrayal and emotions"
FORD V FERRARI,7 November 2019,10/10,"I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,"If you've ever seen one of these iconic cars, or like the Cobra, or just like a gripping movie, then this is for you.
I'm not gonna write a critique of the movie, just to say both my wife and I were engaged for the full length of time this went on.
Also to the makers, thanks, it truly is a brilliant film.
Oh and neither of us are motor racing fans, we just like beautiful cars!"
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,Went into this completely blind and thought it was fantastic!!!
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,"Slightly Understated because of the direction and the pace but once the characters are introduced, the lineage of plot is perfectly executed not only providing breathing space to the latters but also to the collision of Captitalist Fordism and the thrill of competition, simultaneously. A perfect nail-bite in a long time.
Watch out for Jason Bourne and The Dark Knight soldiating chaos on the screen."
FORD V FERRARI,19 December 2019,10/10,If a racing movie that can give you heartbreak then it's this one. Loved each and every frame of the movie. Love Bale and Matt.
FORD V FERRARI,25 October 2021,10/10,"From the beginning till the very end, I was hooked in my chair completely in awe of the level of detail both in cgi and the script. Bale and Damon both perform at their very best and also the supporting cast too. Sound design and cinematography were both immaculate. 10000% guarenteed. It's so sad watching all the sub 6/10 reviews for this film... Like... We get it you don't like quality films aight😅"
FORD V FERRARI,22 February 2020,8/10,"It is true that not everyone taking their rights in life
Ken was the one who deserves all the credit but he died having nothing
Sad ending"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,1/10,Truly awful. A more appropriate title would be Ford: the meaningless death of Ken Miles. Nothing is done to make any characters meaningful or interesting. Ferrari is absent from the film almost entirely and Italians in general are portrayed as foolish caricatures. Ford management is made to look so dumb it is a wonder the racing program even existed. This movie is not fun or entertaining. Cinematically it is also a dud. I have never been so bored looking at a GT40. The driving sequences are nonsensical and without consequence. Save yourself the embarrassment and watch James May's Grand Tour GT40 film instead.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,9/10,Overall great movie with strong character development and a complex yet easy to follow storyline. Highly recommend.
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,This movie is a must watch for car lovers! Infact everyone.
FORD V FERRARI,1 September 2021,10/10,I watched this movie just because of Christian Bale.And I absolutely Loved it.
FORD V FERRARI,9 February 2020,10/10,"Ok this is only my point of view why they have to show the dead scene of the main character I think they should have end it when the race end , and maybe wrote a line of his death cause at the end of the movie just to not bring down the feeling, overall it is a masterpiece there are not many film about racing and car , just a small detail that I don't like again just my perspective 10/10"
FORD V FERRARI,14 March 2020,10/10,"I wasn't sure about this film at first, i thought it was going to be a bit of a documentary style film, well how wrong was i & i am so glad i did go to see it, it's nothing short of edge of your seat stuff, the actors bounce of of each other & it just rolls along & did make me laugh a lot,Tremendous effort on the part of all, well directed good camera work & quite beautiful in parts. not going to say anymore apart from i judge a film by this, do i want this film in my collection,,,,,,,,..oh yes."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"When a story speaks to you, it silences you. That's exactly what it did.
It silenced my mind.It has the quintessential moments of a mainstream drama film. The film and especially the star cast create a beautiful setting as the story progresses.Christian Bale stands out! Matt Damon is brilliant in the role!Go watch this film with your family and friends in theatres"
FORD V FERRARI,27 November 2019,9/10,"Fantastic film. Raw, gritty and peppered with humour. The film gives you a really sense of the unspoken bond between man and machine. Genuinely heartfelt at times, all brilliantly cast. Definitely worth your time!"
FORD V FERRARI,1 December 2019,7/10,"Enjoyed film very much.
It showed a lot of the wrangling that the build team had with the management team just getting to Le Mans."
FORD V FERRARI,18 March 2020,8/10,"Without knowing the subject, I just started to watch the brand names by attracting my attention. Exciting scenes are available at every moment of the movie. Competition and ambition are important factors. Plain and understandable language is used in the movie. Like the 'Rush', this movie really impressed me."
FORD V FERRARI,31 March 2020,8/10,"Normally, i expect with 2.5 hour movie with some part that i skipped it. But every minute of this movie is enjoyable. That ending though, kinda let me down. I have no problem that miles didn't win the race. But c'mon, he literally own the race by broke the lap record. Instead congratulate him, people that watching there running to the fake winner. Aside that, fantastic movie."
FORD V FERRARI,1 March 2020,10/10,"What a fantastic movie, I don't even like racing movies but I love this one! Great actors and soundtrack, Matt Damon and Christian Bale classic, also gotta love the era! Have watched this movie twice and would watch it again if I had to! Highly, highly recommend this movie! Don't miss out!"
FORD V FERRARI,2 January 2020,5/10,"Knowing the full history of the event, this movie is more about American pride and heroism than cars. As an huge racing fan and a Formula 1 fan whom enjoyed the original Grand Prix and Rush, this movie does not hit the spot, rather childish."
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,"The whole story line is electrifying.
I love the acting of the cast crew and the vibe designed by the director.
The ending of it moves everyone in the cinema."
FORD V FERRARI,19 September 2020,9/10,"It is a very well made film, good chemistry and acting, however I would change the title, since in my opinion it doesn't fit the film. The sad part about the movie is that it reflects way too perfectly that unfortunately the corporate killed the racing..."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,10/10,This was an awesome movie to see with my sons and talk about for hours later. You feel like you are right there with them through ups and downs.You also feel the rush and the speed of the cars.Just a great movie all around and so much fun.
FORD V FERRARI,29 November 2019,9/10,I really like the movie .. its a movie which will stay in my memory for long time
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,9/10,"I'm not a motorhead or fan of motor sports at all. Yet, I found this to be a very compelling story. Well done, from he performances of the cast, the cinematography, the writing, everything was spot on. I was a bit skeptical when I saw it came in at 2 1/2 hours, thinking there was going to be a lot of self indulgent scenes, but I was surprised to find none of that. The time flew by faster than the cars."
FORD V FERRARI,13 August 2021,10/10,"Highly recommended for a different kind of thriller movies, and for the overly competitive.So I don't usually write reviews, and frankly setting to watch this movie, I would have never thought it would be the one to prompt me to start writing reviews. But this movie has just completely blown my mind. Despite being a bit discouraged at the start by all the mechanics and cars talk, once i got past trying to understand it I really enjoyed the movie.First, the acting is phenomenal, how Christian Bale has missed am Oscar for this performance just elides me. I don't like Matt Damon that much but I have to say that I was throughly impressed by his role as Carole Shelby, and the chemistry between him and Christian Bale in the movie. Also, despite the predictability of the plot as it is a biography, the movie managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the whole 2.5 hours. In fact I was a bit discouraged by the length of the movie aat first, but once it was doen I couldn't believe how fast it went. I was not bored for a second. After doing a little research also I was happy to see that the movie kept a lot of the true story's details.Second, something that I don't see many reviews commenting about is the lightning..
Like seriously, the lightening in the movie is amazing, the outdoors' scenes has perfect recreations of sunlight, and the night racing scenes ar shot with a perfect balance between authenticity and practicality.Finally, saving the best for the last was the sound effects that were so immersive, it set my heart racing for every second of the movie. Thye were beautifuly complex and minute, you would feel as if you just brought the races home."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,9/10,"Great movie, very entertaining, would have scored a 10 if some things weren't changed in the true story."
FORD V FERRARI,21 November 2020,10/10,"Just when I thought there's no more hope for the film industry, here comes Ford V Ferrari - not sure if to name it a masterpiece, but it's surely close enough."
FORD V FERRARI,31 January 2020,10/10,This is probably the best movie I have ever seen the attention to detail is second to none I am an avid racing fan and the depiction of Ken Miles and Carol Shelby couldn't be more perfect and acted to perfection. This movie is amazing to say the least. Truly amazing
FORD V FERRARI,3 September 2021,10/10,After watching this movie I came to know that Henry Ford-2 was stupid.Ken Miles is super genius with god skills Hats Off to that Man.
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,9/10,The scenes from the track as the cars running are phenomenal
FORD V FERRARI,4 December 2019,9/10,From start to end the movie was really good. Christiane bale and Matt Damon nailed with their stunning screen performance. Last 30 mins racing screen were brilliant. Must watch movie if u r a fan racing.
FORD V FERRARI,4 July 2020,10/10,"Best film I've seen in years. Had me hooked from start to finish. Made me laugh, be happy, terrified and cry. Everybody should watch this film if they get the chance. Quite simply....wonderful!"
FORD V FERRARI,29 May 2020,9/10,"So as we're currently in lockdown with nothing better to do, I'm working my way through the top 250 films on IMDb. I've seen a fair few of them before but I've still got around 175 to watch as I start my journey.As I write this, Le Mans 66 stands at 191. I can honestly say apart from maybe the invisible guest, that this is my favourite film I have seen so far. From the superb performance by Bale, Damon and co, to the story itself, this film is amazing from start to end. So amazing that this is the first review I have ever felt the need to write on IMDb.I was utterly hooked from the start and could just not tear my eyes away. I've read a fair few reviews of this film from other people and they sum it up much better than I do but I can't honestly stress how much people should watch this film.I've watched rush as part of my journey and I think that this film tops it in every way. The 2.5 hours absolutely flew by and I don't have enough praise for how good this film was. It made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me sad. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I can not recommend this film enough"
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,9/10,"Outstanding acting, Great movie very refreshing to watch, watch this twice rather than watching Charlie's angels."
FORD V FERRARI,11 January 2020,8/10,"One of the better movies I have watched out of the last 15hours of recent films I've endured through.
Great acting, natural dialogue that's super relatable.... all up an entertaining film, with racing scenes that any rev head would appreciate."
FORD V FERRARI,17 September 2020,10/10,"Great movie, with some laughs. Spoiler: it's a tragic what Ford did to Ken and Shelby!"
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Just finished it, they absolutely killed it! Christian Bale and Matt Damon deserve awards for their performances."
FORD V FERRARI,1 May 2020,10/10,"Wow!! What an exhilarating and emotional one hell of a ride!! Spectacular in all aspects. Truly well deserved Oscars.
Also I feel this movie is really an amazing tribute to Ken Miles. A stirring inspirational story of true champion portrayed by Christian Bale in yet another brilliant performance.
Definitely a must watch for every cinephile (not just car enthusiasts...if having any misconception). Go for it an thrilling energy packed cinematic beauty."
FORD V FERRARI,28 November 2019,9/10,"If you love the cars and the stories that there are between those and his manufacturers like Ford (Ford GT40, Ford Mustang) and Ferraris, this is the movie.
The scenes with the first prototypes of the Ford GT 40 are amazing."
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,9/10,Good movie. I would recommend it. Matt daemon did a good job
FORD V FERRARI,11 April 2021,9/10,Great movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat all.move.
FORD V FERRARI,15 February 2020,10/10,Easily one of the best movies I've ever watched. The movie had a few gripping scenes but the ending is the best part in the movie.
FORD V FERRARI,29 February 2020,10/10,The movie is based on the True story. Bale and Matt are amazing! And the driving scenes are perfectly shot!
FORD V FERRARI,19 February 2020,10/10,"Great Movie. Great performance from the lead actors. Great chemistry between our Jim Jawkins and Private Ryan.
Feels like going to meet the real Peter and give him a great hug."
FORD V FERRARI,23 August 2020,10/10,"Hands down the best car movie ever. Christian bale delivers one of his best performances. Top notch direction. The subtle acting of matt damon, the speak your mind straight fwd egoistic acting of bale, the portrayal of how brutual and cheap the corporate world is, all of these are shown in such an excellent manner."
FORD V FERRARI,16 May 2020,9/10,Great movie; carried by strong acting and marvelous camera work. It's how movies and acting are supposed to be.
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,Best car movie I've ever seen! Really true to the time and with the right cars at the right time. Cast is great and a good sense of humor as well!
FORD V FERRARI,25 March 2020,10/10,"Bale has an incredible performance,in this days you forget all of your problems while watching this movie."
FORD V FERRARI,3 December 2019,3/10,"Disappointed ! Matt Damon might be a good actor but the script he was given is a dud. Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect."
FORD V FERRARI,4 November 2019,9/10,"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film."
FORD V FERRARI,25 January 2021,9/10,"Loved the film.
Great story, humour and history
Will definitely which again"
FORD V FERRARI,20 April 2020,2/10,"Bale's good. He plays the role, he's engaging. He's good.But the film..,,my god what a snooze fest. I love cars and I love car films but this is just slow, tedious and painful.Worst part is the American depiction of 'bloody English stereo bloody types cor blimey av a cuppa tea' so full of cliches.At the end of the day USA has never touched anything close to what the italians can build despite the outcome of the race.Boring."
FORD V FERRARI,27 April 2020,10/10,"Man no words.. such a great movie!
I was thinking would not be a good movie!
Such a tragedy ken miles dies on the end!
Such a great movie! awesome!
YOU HAVE TO WATCH!"
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,Few will understand the dynamics and commitments necessary to be in the league that this movie portrays. Enjoy the ride and learn about what it takes to perform at the level of winners!
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"I will be honest... I was totally blank while entering the theatre... I did not even know that it was based on a true story! It was after the movie was over I searched for it on Google coz the movie felt so real.
I went in because of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and I wasn't disappointed. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I am not that big of a speed/race kind of person but damn I loved every single minute of the movie from start to end... The performances stand out, the Direction is perfect and the seemless CGI effects and stunts used made me wonder how did they even shoot those racing sequences with that level of continuity... All in all this is one of the best movies this year. Definitely go check it out on the big screen!!!"
FORD V FERRARI,2 December 2019,10/10,"Never a dull moment.
Christian Bale steals the show
as Ken Miles! Matt Damon was ok as Carroll Shelby.
Excellent!"
FORD V FERRARI,11 February 2020,10/10,It's an amazing journey! Great cast! Christan Bale what a man! What acting! Fantastic ! absolutely loved it !
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,"Fantastic movie!! Christian Bale nailed his portrayal as Ken Miles. Worth every penny. Far too good from Rush.
May be the best Racing movie ever made.
A must watch movie, and guys u should go for it without any hesitation.."
FORD V FERRARI,31 December 2019,10/10,"I expected a good racing movie and that's just what I got. BUT, I didn't expect it to have so much humor, family, friendship, and persistence while overcoming the impossible. A perfectly balanced and well developed film! My entire family enjoyed this movie. A+"
FORD V FERRARI,22 November 2019,10/10,"I love the story, the cinematic experience, the assemble casts."
FORD V FERRARI,18 November 2019,10/10,"Great film, great directing and production. Matt, Christian, Caitriona, Noah and Josh did a brilliant job. The film held me from start to finish. Loved the racing, the fight on the street, loved Mollie making Ken be honest in her driving scene. Noah one to watch in the future
."
FORD V FERRARI,17 November 2019,10/10,A must see for anyone who knows a little about cars. Matt and Christian were great together.👍🏻👍🏻
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"Drama
I don't feel like crying from the drama in the film, the death of the protagonist is presented as something not very tragic.Soundtrack
It is terrible, it does not fit, does not immerse him in the atmosphere. Successful only the sounds of the races themselves.Scenario
There are quite a few deviations from reality, but this did not ruin the picture.Actors
No questions, so goodCharacters
In the film there are a lot of character branches, secondary characters are disclosed quite well. But Shelby is practically not disclosed. The villain is too stupidGraphic arts
Everything looks pretty good, but the camera work does not reach TaxiAtmosphere
The atmosphere of the races is well conveyed, the film immerses well"
FORD V FERRARI,25 November 2019,10/10,One of the best movies in this year. Oscar please!
FORD V FERRARI,30 January 2020,10/10,Nothing to say much i took my heart again after batman.u high.much love
FORD V FERRARI,16 November 2019,10/10,See this movie. Exciting ! Great story. Matt Damon is outstanding!
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,10/10,The premise of the film is quite obvious. But the story is very interesting and it was both entertaining and inspiring. It's worth watching at the cinema the sound is captivating.Overall great film.
FORD V FERRARI,24 November 2019,9/10,"Didn't watch any trailer or didn't know anything about the movie. Considering the title I first thought Matt Damon and Cristian Bale would be representing Ford and Ferrari respectively or vice versa.Enjoyed the movie from the start to end. Brilliantly written and directed. Loved the dialogues about about the 7000 RPM. Brilliant cast who obviously act great. Loved the sound design of the engines, brakes and tires screeching at the curves.A brilliant movie, would suggest not to miss watching in a theatre. I guarantee you would love the movie even if you are not a Motorhead."
FORD V FERRARI,14 February 2020,10/10,"I love everything about this movie. How the acting, the storyline that's right on with how it actually happened, the music & cinematography. It's all just do good."
FORD V FERRARI,20 November 2019,8/10,"Trust the Americans to not acknowledge the major contribution made by the British.
The film leaves you with the impression that the car was entirely American designed and built.
The Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III variants of the Ford GT40 were designed and built in England based upon the British Lola Mk6."
FORD V FERRARI,17 December 2019,9/10,This was such an accurate description of what happened at the 24 hour race. Every detail was there. They even put in adds from the 1950s and put orange tint to make the movie.
FORD V FERRARI,4 January 2020,8/10,"One of the best movie in 2019, well crafted, but still fell short on some part of story telling."
FORD V FERRARI,28 January 2020,10/10,"If in your vein runs gasoline instead of blood, it's a 10."
FORD V FERRARI,4 February 2020,10/10,"Excellent movie to watch plus the casting is well accurate according to the characters, secondly this movie pulls you in to feel it."
FORD V FERRARI,23 November 2019,6/10,"I mean it's great and all, but i found myself rooting for ferrari most of the time.
Doesn't help that the ferrari 330 is probably the best looking car ever made."
