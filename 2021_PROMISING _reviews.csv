PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 August 2021,8/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a co-production between the UK and USA in the English language and a fairly new release. Well, it is released these days (two weeks from now with the wide release) here in Germany, even if the world premiere happened a long time ago already, last year in fact. This film that is not considerably under two hours long was one of the big players during the previous awards season and in the end it ended up winning one Oscar and many other awards. Could have been more Oscars, could have been less. It took home the screenplay win in a category that was truly packed with movies that would have been contenders almost every year perhaps. Carey Mulligan was considered a frontrunner for a long time as well, but Best Actress was really wide open this year and in the end, Frances McDormand took it, the lead from the Best Picture winner. I like her too, but I think I would have been happier with Mulligan winning. Followed her since her breakthrough in An Education over a decade ago. It's okay though. Really nice to see her back so strongly and I hope one day she will win the Oscar. And I hope even more that she will keep delivering quality movies like this one here. This was a stunning example of how she is definitely among the very best actress from her generation. Just like how she was in her 20s. Still a bit unusual for me to see her with long blond hair this time, but hey it makes sense. Works better with the story than the tame brown hair she usually shows. So she is one of two key women attached to this movie. The second is Emerald Fennell, the writer and director and a prolific actress herself in fact. She was a recent Emmy nominee for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles on The Crown and also appeared in the Oscar-winning The Danish Girl for example. Another actress to manage a really successful transition from acting into writing and directing. It's not just Greta Gerwig. Her Best Director nomination this time was also a bit of a surprise, but probably not a negative one. Same goes for her Bets Screenplay win. There the nomination was always safe.As for the rest of the cast, nobody is as much at the center of the film as Mulligan. (I still find the meaning of her last name kinda funny. Sounds like ""mullet"", but means something entirely different.) Burnham also has a lot of screen time and may be the closest to a co-lead. He scored no less than five Emmy nominations this year for his variety special, actually six if you count the biggest nomination too, but came short in all of those. So also a man with many talents apparently. He has such a familiar face. Every time I see him, I keep wondering where I know him from and it feels as if I have watches a series with 100 episodes and he was in each and every single one of them, but I didn't. Alison Brie I must admit I did not recognize here. Surely one of the biggest names from the cast. Mintz-Plasse is another one always easy to identify, even if he has only one scene and he was creepy and funny at the same time somehow with how disgusting his character really was. Fennell herself has a really small cameo in here. I did not know the actress before, so I did not recognize her either. Molina is a delight as always, especially if he plays kind-hearted characters. Also nice reunion with him and Mulligan from An Education. Greenfield ugh I think he was one of really not many weaknesses here. He has a key scene basically, the night after the tragedy, and he really does not nail it. They should have picked a more talented actor there. I also never saw something special about him on New Girl. At least he played a really unlikable character and it was fairly easy to hate him with the actor in charge. Britton some will recognize. I did not really recognize her, even if her one scene was not bad and kinda challenging too. Many familiar names and faces here, even if most do not have a lot of screen time. Cox plays the best friend. Tolerable, nothing special and mostly in it for slight comic relief, exactly her niche you could say, but maybe receiving the protagonist's chain in the end was a bit too much. And Coolidge I have to mention as well. Love her in everything. She was good her too, with the drama and lighter moments. That dinner with the two parents, their daughter and her potential boyfriend was an absolute riot. Pure comedy gold.As for the movie itself, it was very nicely done. Needs a little bit to get going and you wonder what she really does. I mean she could not have killed all these men if you look at the amount in her little book, so yeah she just exposes and humiliates them somehow to deal with her suffering and grief and her past with what happened to her best friend. Even the latter's mother says she must stop. But once you know about her motivations, it all makes sense sort of. Mulligan played the part so well. Also interesting to see a high-quality movie delivering not only an awesome ""It's Raining Men"" cover, but also turning Paris Hilton into a somewhat creative artist, even if it's more of a guilty pleasure to be honest. I also liked how this film was really unexpected when crucial events happened. It gets you. It really does. Be it Burnham's character being part of the group of men who watched the abuse back then or be it only how he reacts and openly calls Mulligan's character a failure when he realizes that he won't get her back with what happened. Okay, maybe him running into her in front of the club was a bit too much of a coincidence honestly. But the killing at the end sure was really unexpected for me. Not at the very end. I mean you can really discuss if she started the entire thing with the idea to get killed, so in terms of a planned suicide. How she is fighting for her life under that pillow does not mean that she did not want to die. Everybody would do so there because it's a reflex. But they (or she, namely Fennell) found a good way to close the film with the closest to a happy ending there could be. The offenders are caught, again Greenfield's running away was rather cringeworthy, even if it was meant in a funny way, and they will be on trial for murder and also her potential boyfriend (Burham) will get his fair share because he lied to the police and was part of the group back then too. I guess how Greenfield and the male antagonist (the groom) disposed of the body made it easy to see there will be a murder charge, even if you could also make an argument of course that honestly if somebody is about to attack you with a scalpel and one of your arms is still tied to a bedpost, it could be considered self defence. Or at least spur of the moment. We don't find out as this is not a courtroom drama.The one thing this film has on almost every other movie dealing with a similar subject is that it feels really creative and inspired. And of course that these other films do not have Carey Mulligan in the lead. But these other films almost always feel for the sake of it. Like they elaborate on #metoo, on violence against women, on gender discrimination etc. But this is what they rely on. They rely on the film being seen as impressive and relevant because of said subject(s). And often the story, writing and overall outcome could not be any more shallow and simple sadly and the films are still praised because the mainstream media simply want to keep the momentum going when it comes to these inclusions. And also because they are maybe scared to say that a film on these issues can indeed suck. Suck a lot even because many do. This one here is the exact opposite. There is no hesitation for me here at all when it comes to decising if I should give the film a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. The only question was if it is a good or great film. I actually go with the latter now because I really enjoyed it. I don't think it's a flawless film and it was a really close call admittedly, but for now I'd say it's great and it's even my favorite 2020 release. So big thumbs-up here. The attention to detail was also overwhelming at times.This is also not only on these currently very relevant issues I just mentioned, but also compleetly aside from that a quite interesting revenge thriller. And a very different one. I mean it's not bloody, even if they (Mulligan and Fennell) played a little bit early on with us when we see ketchup on her mouth and can wonder if it's blood, but her recenge is just an expression of misery you could say. The character wants others to feel as bad as she does. One after the other and eventually her revenge is not only against men in general (come on, at least the name we remember, most other stuff too probably), but against those directly linked to what happened with her best friend. She meets all kinds of different reactions there. Professionalism, indifference, regret etc. And her reactions are also different. Looks like she hired a guy to beat up Molina's character? But the latter is one really showing remorse saying how he cannot sleep anymore, how he has not been able to sleep properly for years. I feel him. I don't fucntion without enough sleep either. Anyway, drifting away now. One of the best things this film delivers is how it renders the ""we were still kids"" element pointless. And how she makes it personal. How she does not let the boys get away with their actions this time again. And how she lets nobody in the audicen leave the cinema without a lump in their throats, but also with a feeling of satisfaction because the good guys win in the end. Police in this case. Or justice, even if again I must say we do not see anybody found guilty inside a courtroom in this movie. That is all now. I highly recommend checking this one out. It turned really dark in the last half hour, maybe 45 minutes even, but it just got better this way. Big thumbs-up! Oh and Margot Robbie produced this btw. Fitting. Nurse Carey looks a bit like Harley Quinn. Still glad Robbie did not star, even if I don't dislike her anymore like I once did."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,6/10,"Promising Young Woman is a messy glossy revenge picture. At times it is as chaotic as the mind of its protagonist.Cassandra (Carey Mulligan) is a medical college dropout who works in a coffee shop by day.At night she goes to bars, appears to be paralytic and gets picked up by men who see her as an easy lay. In fact Cassandra is conscious and keeping count of all the sleazebags who have taken her home.Cassandra teaches these men a lesson of the error of their ways. A darn risky move in my opinion as she places herself in serious danger in the process.Her trauma is related to her best friend who was raped at medical college. The rapist got away with it and the college administrators backed the guy's word.Cassandra has had issues and seems to have dropped out of life, going back to live with her parents.Yet romance is in the air when she meets a fellow medical student Ryan from her college who is now a doctor. Maybe happiness is around the corner for Cassandra.Promising Young Woman is full of cynicism. I thought it might be a female revenge movie in the style of Ms 45; in the middle it develops into a rom com.Then Cassandra's thirst for revenge seemingly puts a young girl at risk, the daughter of the college dean. Later she might have placed another woman in jeopardy leaving the audience to wonder if Cassandra is a sociopath.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, who was the head writer of Series 2 of Killing Eve.The movie shifts several genres and was never going to be straightforward. I just knew Ryan was too good to be true and would somehow be implicated in the college rape.The final act is a cynical cop out. Once again showing that the men would do anything to save themselves.Tonally the movie is grubby and it does fall apart with its muddled message at the end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 May 2021,9/10,"Cassie (Carey Mulligan ) works at a coffee shop and lives with her parents, having dropped out of medical school. At night she pretends to be drunk and have guys pick her up. When they try to have sex with her, she wakes up and scares them and then nothing. We discover her peculiar behavior stems from a college incident.The whole theme of the picture is to show how women's lives are destroyed by college rape and the guy gets off. The particulars may be exaggerated such as the victim would have been at the top of the class and afterwards the attacker was at the top of the class, but it was done to drive home the point. It was also entertaining.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 August 2021,10/10,"I reckon it is or will be easy to dismiss what happens here for some. Unfortunately that does not make the things that are depict in here untrue. From a male perspective you may see different valid points throughout this ... you may feel that certain things do not apply to you. And maybe they don't - that doesn't mean that they don't exist. I know it feels like I'm repeating myself ... something the movie does avoid.Which is quite the feat, considering what it is about and how she goes on a hunt (prowl?) at nights ... I was not sure what she was doing and the movie did leave it upon a bit ... but it does clear up during the runtime. Now she is broken and we slowly get why that is. It is revealed in the right way, even while we do sort of know or feel that we know most of it.What is a nice touch, we never see anything in that regard. There is no sleaze, there is no (visible) exploitation going on. That does not mean it is easy to watch ... or listen to what is happening. I personally am not a fan of the term feminist, but this movie may change your mind regarding that or other things.There are borderline things happening and our main character is not perfect. That does not mean she does not deserve something good ... and it does look like she can have. If she can bring herself to let go ... on the other hand, there is more than meets the eye. Way more ... and the ending ... I'm not going to spoil it for you, but let's say I did not expect that at all.Very well told and truths that do hurt ... but are essential to be seen ... and learned from (hopefully)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 April 2021,8/10,"About mid-way into the movie I had to come to the conclusion that Cassie (Carey Mulligan) was dealing with mental illness in a way that stoked her necessity for revenge against those who humiliated her best friend Nina while in medical school ten years prior. Somehow she internalized some sense of guilt over Nina's death, even though she wasn't at the particular party where Nina got drunk and subsequently raped. It's not made clear how Nina died, but one assumes that she committed suicide as a result of the trauma she suffered with an inability to carry on. What cinched the mental illness idea for me was when she stopped her car in the middle of the road and took a lug wrench to the guy's truck who was taunting her for his inconvenience. The reaction there was over the top and out of proportion, even if the driver was a jerk. There was also that comment from Cassie's mom (Jennifer Coolidge) to the detective investigating her later disappearance when she said that Cassie was 'getting better'.What's immensely clever about the screenplay and the acting is how matter of fact Cassie could be when dealing with friends and her family. Actress Carey Mulligan as Cassie wears so many faces in the story that it's a tribute to her ability to charm or scare the hell out of someone by simply switching gears the way she did with Dean Walker (Connie Britton). The revelation of her potential boyfriend Ryan's (Bo Burnham) presence at the fraternity party years ago is what pushed Cassie over the edge. Many won't agree with me on this, but it's my feeling that Cassie's revenge mission at the bachelor party was her way of committing suicide, partly over grief for her long lost friend, and partly for her inability to move on in life, as was well depicted in the scene with Nina's mother (Molly Shannon).Why come to a suicide conclusion? At the wedding of the man who killed her (Chris Lowell), Ryan receives timed text messages as if they were coming from Cassie, who by now is already dead. Those would have to have been planned by someone who felt that they might not be around to send or deliver the message in person. So at least the thought of being killed had to have been on Cassie's mind when she concocted her revenge plan. And by walking into a situation where death might be imminent, Cassie was at least complicit for the disaster that befell her.I can't really say that ""Promising Young Woman"" is strong enough as a film to garner this year's Best Picture Oscar, but of all the contenders I've seen so far (and I'll see them all), this is the one that I feel will last in memory the longest because of it's dreadful impact. It's conclusion is one I don't think most viewers will see coming, having been entertained by Cassie and Ryan's humorous banter throughout the picture, thereby setting up an expectation that Cassie would emerge a likely hero. The story could have been written that way, but then, who would remember it?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,7/10,"The Oscar and Golden Globe nominated directorial debut for actress Emerald Fennell (Call the Midwife, The Crown) was making news not long before it got caught in Awards Season, because of its ""female empowerment"" theme, and the controversial story to bring it to light, I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Thomas (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Carey Mulligan, also producing) is a thirty-year-old medical school dropout who lives an uneventful existence, still living with her parents Stanley (Clancy Brown) and Susan (Jennifer Coolidge). She also works a dead-end job as a waitress at a cheap coffee shop with her only friend Gail (Laverne Cox). But secretly, Cassie spends her nights pretending to be drunk, and helpless in clubs, allowing men to take her to their homes. When the men are about to take advantage of her, she reveals her sobriety and shocks them, making them think twice next time they approach a vulnerable woman. At the coffee shop, Cassie is reunited with a former medical school classmate, Ryan Cooper (Bo Burnham). After some banter, Cassie spits in Ryan's coffee, but he still drinks it anyway and asks to take her out. She gives him a fake phone number. Meanwhile, Stanley and Susan continually express concerns over Cassie's lack of ambitions and hint that she should move out. Ryan returns to the coffee shop after realising Cassie gave him a fake number, she has a change of heart and agrees to go out with him. Although Ryan appears nice enough, Cassie doesn't let him get too close to her. During a conversation, Ryan mentions his old colleague Alexander ""Al"" Monroe (Chris Lowell), who is getting married. Years earlier, Al raped her best friend Nina Fisher, who was too drunken to know what she was doing. Cassie and Nina reported it, but it was not taken seriously and there was no investigation by the school or legal system. This led to Nina committing suicide and Cassie dropping out of medical school and faking drunkenness in clubs to catch out other predatory men. Cassie is disturbed and begins a plan to exact revenge on Al and the other people who she knows were involved in the aftermath of Nina's rape. She meets another former classmate and friend, Madison McPhee (Alison Brie), who did not believe Nina was raped. Cassie gets Madison drunk and hires a man to take Madison to a hotel room. Madison has no memory of what happened and leaves several distraught voicemails for Cassie, concerned she was raped herself. Cassie next lures her teenager Amber into her car by posing as a makeup artist for her favourite pop band. Amber is the daughter of Elizabeth Walker (Connie Britton), the medical school dean who dismissed Nina's case for lack of evidence. She meets Walker pretending that she wants to resume her education, and questions her about Nina's case. When Walker explains away her actions, Cassie tells her she dropped Amber off at a dorm room with a group of older drunk male students. Walker is terrified for her daughter's safety and tries to call Amber, only to see that Cassie has it. In fear, she apologises for her inaction and not believing Nina. Following this, Cassie admits that she only left Amber at a diner where she is ""stupid"" enough to believe the boy band will be, and Cassie leaves. Cassie forgets to meet Ryan for a date, disappointing him. That night, Cassie lures another man into taking her home man. Whilst leaving, Ryan catches them, who is hurt over being stood up, and leaves. Cassie's next target is a former lawyer, Jordan Greene (Alfred Molina), who harassed Nina into dropping her charges. Greene is remorseful, having had a nervous breakdown over his guilt, and Cassie forgives him. After visiting Nina's mother (Molly Shannon), who urges her to move on, Cassie abandons her revenge plans. She apologises to Ryan and they fall in love. Madison confronts Cassie outside her house, desperate to know what happened after their lunch. Cassie reassures her that nothing happened. Madison gives her an old phone containing a video of Nina's rape that she kept before warning her to never contact her again. Watching it, Cassie is shocked and devastated to see Ryan among the rapists. She confronts him and threatens to release the video unless he tells her where Al's bachelor party is being held. Ryan tells her and insists she forgive him, but Cassie refuses. Cassie arrives at Al's bachelor party posing as a stripper, dressed as a sexy nurse with a colourful wig, spikes the drinks of all Al's friends, and takes Al upstairs. Assuming she is giving him a private dance, and accepting her reason for putting on handcuffs, he is cuffed to the bed. Once cuffed, Cassie reveals her identity, showing Al the rap video, and demanding that he apologise. Terrified, seeing she has a knife, he tearfully apologises and insists it was a long time ago. As she starts carving ""Nina"" onto Al's chest, he manages to break free and fatally suffocates Cassie with a pillow. The next morning, Al's friend Joe (Max Greenfield) finds him with Cassie, he realises that she is dead and consoles Al when he explains what happened. Joe convinces Al that no-one knows that she was at the shack, and they drag Cassie's body to burn it in a makeshift furnace. Her parents file a missing person report, and the police begin to investigate. Ryan tells them Cassie was mentally disturbed and does not tell them where she was going. The wedding takes place, with Ryan in attendance. During the ceremony, Ryan receives several scheduled texts from Cassie. At the same time, Greene receives a package from Cassie with a video of Nina's rape and instructions to give it to the police in the event of her disappearance. Also, Gail finds a half heart-shaped necklace with Cassie's name under the cash register; Cassie was wearing the matching necklace with Nina's name on it when she was killed. The police discover her burnt remains and the necklace, and arrest Al at his wedding for the murder. Cassie's final message to Ryan reads ""Enjoy the wedding. Love Cassie and Nina."" Also starring Adam Brody as Jerry, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Neil, Sam Richardson as Paul, and Ray Nicholson as Jim. Mulligan gives a brilliant performance as the young woman flitting between sweet and spiky and often being wildly persuasive and then unnervingly threatening to the characters that deserve punishment. This film has a superbly acid-tongued script, that makes important points about why claims of rape should be taken seriously, the lead character is both fascinating and at times scary, but we always remember her pain and reasons for what she is doing. You are gripped throughout as to which direction it will go, it is darkly funny when it can be, the ending is shocking but equally smart, and the pop music soundtrack (including an orchestral version of Britney Spears's ""Toxic"") makes for good listening, it is a great stylish take on the revenge movie, a clever black comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Emerald Fennell, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Original Score for Anthony Willis, and Best Casting, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,,"Carey Mulligan is Cassie. She had been a promising young medical student some 7 years earlier when something happened to her best friend, also a promising young medical student. Now approaching 30 Cassie works as a coffee barista and seems adrift. Until the old male nemesis from medical school comes back to town to get married.The writer-director says she wanted it to play as a very dark comedy, dealing with a very serious issue but with some humor in the scenes. Mulligan is great in the role and was nominated for Best Female Actor.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library, a very interesting and entertaining movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,7/10,"Fennell's script crackles with good dialog and an excellent structure, with a few turns that made me go ""dang, I should've seen that"" and that was fun. And she realizes it with strong wide-angle compositions. As for those chapter headings.... Eh, no. If I'm to choose between two stories of people on the edge of life and about to crack, ie this or a Joker, I much prefer Fennell's spark and creativity (I know Josh Larsen compared her to #metoo Pfieffer Catwoman and I can see that as well - she's like a very selective but warped vigilante who should have become an actor).At the same time, it takes on the hard task of being a revenge movie while subverting them, and it doesn't get there (is it wrong for it to go Full Femme Fatale Death Wish, or, yeah, Ms 45? if you're going to go for pulp, go for it, but don't also do the ""revenge is a dead end"" thing, as it makes it feel a little muddled). Fennel also I suspect has been around a *lot* of drunk people, and gets actors who know how to play it well (Brie a stand-out).As for the rest of this, Carey Mulligan's best since ""Blink"" (she and Evan Rachel Wood are almost tied for best acting in a Focus Feature in 2020, random category I just made up cause I'm me), and Burnham is superb casting. All of the supporting cast bring it, in particular Chris Lowell from GLOW. I liked it, but it didn't blow me away or say anything particularly insightful about the culture of rape and the survivors as well as the perpetrators. That's ok sometimes, and that's my review."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,,"What a gripping story! The ending is triumphant, and the journey to get there is very intense."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 May 2021,7/10,"A young woman, Cassie, is on a revenge spree, with her victims being male sexual predators. Once a high-achieving medical student she now works in a coffee shop and lives with her parents. Something happened in her past, something that radically changed her life.An interesting and thought-provoking revenge-drama. Ultimately it doesn't really go anywhere new, directionally, in terms of the revenge-drama genre but is quite entertaining and the plot does take a few unexpected twists and turns. In addition, there is a fair amount of intrigue as to what happened in Cassie's past to cause her to be like this.Writer-director Emerald Fennell tries to make the plot as balanced as possible as it could easily have degenerated into a polarising ""all men are bad"" scenario. However, this exposes some of the flaws in Cassie's thinking and actions, leaving you less than 100% engaged with her: while mostly on her side, on occasion she does seem more a villain than a hero. On the plus side, this adds to the edginess and unpredictably of the plot."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 December 2021,9/10,"PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN (2020) ***1/2 Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Jennifer Coolidge, Clancy Brown, Laverne Fox, Adam Brody, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Alison Brie, Connie Britton, Max Greenfield, Molly Shannon, Alfred Molina. Filmmaker Emerald Fennell scored a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this dark, psychological drama with Mulligan (nominated for Best Actress, justifiably so) as the titular character, a former law school student, whose traumatic past encapsulates her future by planning vengeance upon those who perpetuated a crime against her and her late best friend. Dark, black humor and unsettling to the point of disturbing the film penetrates toxic masculinity with pin pricking intensity and deeply felt undertones of despair."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 May 2021,9/10,"I've seen many comments written by men about ""Promising Young Woman"" complaining that the film doesn't go far enough, that the protagonist doesn't punish her victims enough, and that basically they would have been more satisfied by the film if the confrontations in it had ended in blood baths. These comments seem to be written without acknowledging in the slightest the irony of complaining that a film criticizing the aggressiveness of men isn't violent enough.Writer/director Emerald Fennell and her leading lady, Carey Mulligan, have created something completely unique with this movie. A comedy about male predation. A movie where the catalyst for the entire plot is a gang rape but where the word ""rape"" isn't mentioned once. A sociopathic character whose inflicted wounds are entirely emotional, never physical. And all set to a soundtrack that makes perfect use of songs from across a dizzying array of genres.This movie is clearly a howl of rage inspired by the MeToo movement, but it's not preachy, it doesn't feel like homework, and it avoids the finger wagging lecturing that so often comes with other movies that have an activist spirit. The emotional power of ""Promising Young Woman"" sneaks up on you because you're so distracted by having a good time while watching it.Mulligan is sensational in this, her Oscar nomination richly deserved. Her character is on a mission to hold mirrors up to the faces of people who've done bad things and make them reflect on the kind of people they are. It's like a gender based version of the recent attempts to make people aware of white privilege. In this movie, it's male privilege that's revealed in all its ugliness, and the attitudes imbedded in our culture that cause people to justify literally anything a man does, no matter the consequences of his behavior.Fennell won the Original Screenplay Oscar for this film, and it was also nominated for Best Picture, Director, and Film Editing. Fennell joined Chloe Zhao and Sofia Coppola as the only women in Oscar history to be nominated for producing, directing, and writing the same film.Grade: A."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 December 2020,7/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold."" The protagonist in writer-director Emerald Fennell's (""Killing Eve"") feature film debut is a woman on a mission to avenge not just what happened to her friend, but also change the mentality of predatory men ... one ""nice guy"" at a time. She is a #MeToo heat-seeking missile.Carey Mulligan stars as Cassie, and when we first see her, she appears to be nearing blackout mode while drinking alone on a bench inside a bar. Most people have hobbies like crochet or golf. Cassie's hobby, or maybe mission is a better word, is to lure men, with the appearance of a drunken easy score, and then scare them straight into respecting boundaries. She's a non-violent vigilante (as opposed to Beatrix Kiddo) for morality and respect towards women.As the film progresses, we pick up bits about what traumatized her to this extent. It turns out her best friend Nina was victimized by a group of men from their law school class. See, Cassie is the titular 'promising young woman' whose career dreams were dashed over what happened to her friend. Now, Cassie works in a coffee shop with a supportive and wise-cracking friend Gail (Laverne Cox, ""Orange is the New Black""), who knows nothing of Cassie's hobby ... and neither do Cassie's parents (Jennifer Coolidge, Clancy Brown) who can't help but wonder what happened to their bright, ambitious daughter, and why she still lives at home with them.Cassie's mission gets momentarily de-railed when former classmate Ryan (an excellent Bo Burnham, THE BIG SICK) pops in to the coffee shop and awkwardly proclaims his long-time distant crush on her. The two are clumsy and believable together, and their relationship has more ups and downs than a pogo stick. For most movies, this would be enough to hold our attention, but not for ambitious filmmaker Fennell who has much more to offer. There is a cleverness to the presentation with four specific segments: a friend who didn't believe her (Alison Brie), the law school dean who didn't want to ruin a boy's future (Connie Britton), a regretful defense attorney who took the money (Alfred Molina), and a bachelor party that gathers those who make up her nightmare.Ms. Fennell is also an actor (and has a cameo in this one), and it's clear she has a real feel for putting actors in the best position to maximize a scene. Of course, Ms. Mulligan is an outstanding actor on her own, but the actors benefit from Ms. Fennell's work. Other supporting work is provided by Adam Brody, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Molly Shannon, Chris Lowell, and Sam Richardson. The color palette is similar to an early Tim Burton movie, and in fact, Cassie's home looks like a museum or possibly a middle-class Liberace setting.There is a lot going on here, and some of it is quite uncomfortable - and sprinkled with dark humor in unexpected moments. Advice like ""move on"" and excuses like ""we were kids"" ring hollow to Cassie, who carries some guilt over what happened to Nina, and remains focused on attacking a system that enables inexcusable behavior. Ms. Mulligan embraces a character who possesses raw nerves and emotions she sometimes hides, while other times flashes in neon. This isn't about a guy here or there who takes advantage, but rather a faulty system that protects these guys at the expense of victims. The ending is unusual and unexpected, and kudos to an exciting new filmmaker.

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 July 2021,8/10,"Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,,"""Promising Young Woman"" unfolds in a series of four acts, each of which is carefully crafted by the avenging angel named Cassandra ""Cassie"" Thomas. Cassie has never recovered from the death of her best friend Nina, who was brutally assaulted and ultimately died while she and Cassie were in med school. For Cassie, it is now payback time.The filmmakers strive for an element of humor in the banter between Cassie and Ryan, a fellow student from med school whom she is now dating. But there is a relentless edginess to the relationship that gives the clear impression that Cassie and Ryan really do not have a future together due to baggage from the past.In sequential order, Cassie first sets up her old schoolmate Madison McPhee for a taste of her own medicine, entrapping her with a man in a hotel room in which the drunken Madison cannot remember what occurred. Madison, who had shrugged off the rape of Nina, now has the sensation of helplessness from her escapade in the hotel.In the best scene in the film, Cassie's next victim is Dean Elizabeth Walker, the authority figure at the med school who chose not to file charges against Alexander Monroe due to primarily to Nina's state of intoxication. By the end of the scene, the Dean has been traumatized, thinking that her daughter Amber has been placed in grave danger in a situation similar to that of Nina.The third act stretched credibility in the tortured attorney, Mr. Jordan Greene, who actively seeks Cassie's forgiveness for what he knows was injustice in his manipulating of evidence in Nina's case.The final act is a scene that could almost be out of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" The tawdry drama of a bachelor's party unfolds in the hunting lodge with a sequence of sustained brutality. .The film's denouement offers a posthumous settling of accounts in the carefully planned act of revenge on the part of Cassie. The outstanding lead performance and the carefully constructed revenge plot did not quite achieve a balance between dark comedy and the seriousness of the subject matter. But there were some unforgettable dramatic an visual moments, culminating in a tragic heap of ashes in the forest."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"Call ""Promising Young Woman"" what you want a little bit rom com, little comedy, little drama, little dark thriller or suspense like still the film is interesting and entertaining as it's a spin and take on society that involves social norms with revenge being the main theme.It involves Cassandra(in a fine turn from Carey Mulligan) an ex med student who's dropped out of school after something happened to one of her best female friends. And Cass feels those that are responsible should pay the price. So her behavior is odd at home around mom and dad and even at work pouring coffee at the diner. Only thru research Cass has a game plan to seek and discover info thru dating various guys, while all of this leads up to her again being with her ex male med students. The film is moved along by the lead character's determination and win at all cost justice seeking it's like old style revenge. Plus the music played during the film helps as Juice Newton's ""Angel of the Morning"" is so fitting to Cass and the film plus it helps smooth the surprise end only things twist and turn for the best as Cassandra had the game plan all mapped out for good! Overall well done film that mixes many themes as it blends both a day and night like feel."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,8/10,"""Fennell's execution puts her female identity at the forefront, not a masculine film masqueraded by a female director holding the rein, like Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCK (2008), PYW basks in many tropes from female-fronted genres, a combo of sororal slasher, silly romance (dancing to tunes of Paris Hilton's STARS ARE BLIND in a drug store, noughties pop gems is Fennell's blatant manifesto of girl power!) and oddball comedy (Cassie's birthday gift from her parents is a modish suitcase), with the appurtenances of Fennell's fabulous choices of decor and palette, it is a girlish-looking movie, but its thematics are grave, urgent, important and PYW makes a cogent case of it.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,8/10,"The imdb description reads ""A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path."" This is completely accurate, and yet is a superficial description. Yes, this is a movie about a woman attempting to create justice where none exists, but it's also about a deeply traumatized woman desperately doing things to give her a sense of control. This is why it's not a good criticism to say that what Cassie's doing doesn't make sense. It's true (like the IMDB description is true) but it's also the point. Cassie isn't Batman, and this isn't a cleverly thought-out system to make a better world. Cassie is broken but very smart and resourceful, and she is treating her inner wounds in an external way.The cast is very good, particularly Carey Mulligan as Cassie. The movie does a good job of keeping information from you and then dripping it out in order to create mystery and suspense then slow understanding. It's filmed stylishly. It's deeply disturbing, with a *very* dark view of human beings, and it leaves you with a lot to think about.It took me a while to watch this because I suspected it would be hard going and it is, in its own dark way, quite entertaining. Definitely worth watching."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 April 2021,5/10,"This was a pretty good movie but just didn't get there for me. I don't know if i'm more used to more extreme versions of this type of movie, but it seemed fairly tame. And for the most part, it was completely predictable from beginning to end. It was funny and charming but in the end i wasn't satisfied (1 viewing, 4/7/2021)SPOILERSi just couldn't buy into her dedicating her life to what amounts to making predators feel guilty so that hopefully they won't do it again. Maybe this is more realistic than a crazy revenge scheme that ruins ppls lives or even ends them. But realistic doesn't mean entertaining."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 October 2021,7/10,"The more I think about 'Promising Young Woman (2020)', the less I like it. That's not to say that I don't like it, just that its issues become more evident in retrospect. The main problem with the piece is that it, essentially, feels as though it undercuts itself at every turn, alienating almost every part of its target audience at one point or another. Ultimately, it's a little difficult to tell exactly what it's trying to say - even though its broadest messaging is certainly evident - and who it's actually for. Most of these problems arise in the third act. The last scene, in particular, is disappointing because, though satisfying on a surface level, it removes almost all the bite that the previously subversive final third could have had, replacing a hard dose of reality with yet another heightened nod and wink. This wouldn't be an issue if the third act didn't make a point of pivoting away from exaggerated dark satire; if the entire film operated on that level, the ending would work just fine. By that same token, though, it wouldn't be necessary because there would be no subversion for it to subvert. As such, the late-game twist that's meant to signify a powerful and apparently inescapable 'truth' loses all meaning, reduced to nothing more than shock value that basically goes directly against one of the points the piece is trying to make. It's difficult to describe without spoiling things, but basically the third act is essentially rendered moot by the climactic scene and feels wholly unnecessary if the flick was always going to end up in a similar place to where it does. Without the final scene, the last act would work well as an unanticipated gut-punch. However, the final scene reverberates across the entire experience, reducing its overall impact and making it feel as though it doesn't quite know what it wants to achieve. Aside from this legitimate undercutting, though, the movie is typically engaging and enjoyable. It has its moments of keen satire and is also unafraid to be challenging, unafraid to present a flawed protagonist whose actions don't always sit right with the audience. It also has a surprisingly effective, unexpectedly sweet romance that feeds off the legitimate chemistry between Mulligan and Burnham. Its broadest message is an important one, too, and it's incredibly relevant in today's cultural environment. In the end, the flick is an entertaining surface-level thriller that takes a distinct approach to its subject matter. It unfortunately undercuts itself and reduces its wider thematic impact, which then causes it to sour slightly in retrospect. Its in-the-moment experience is a good one, though, and it's something that should start a conversation. I'd ultimately recommend it. 7/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 July 2021,9/10,"A mostly different film in many ways, but my reaction to Promising Young Woman reminds me of the first time I saw Gone Girl and how I thought at first that I hated the ending but in fact, it's the perfect closer to an incredible ride of revenge from the lead character. Exquisitely directed by Emerald Fennell and led by the performance of a career in Carey Mulligan, PYW is a force to be reckoned with in 2020/2021. The wait was well worth it.9.5/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 August 2021,8/10,"""I'm a nice guy.""
""Are you?""Carrie Mulligan is, as always, fantastic, and I love how 'Promising Young Woman' mixed in some elements of comedy and even romance into what was such a searing indictment of rape culture. For a film making such a strong statement, it's layered and intelligent, bringing out emotional aspects not usually present in revenge-type films. Instead of indulging in the bloodlust of a killing spree, it has her character trying to make others feel something - what it's like to be deceived, frightened, vulnerable, exploited, humiliated, or scarred for life.The film goes after not just the bros who believe themselves to be nice guys and offer pathetic excuses for their behavior, but also the power structure protecting them, and it does so in a stylish way (that soundtrack!). The conversation with the dean of the medical school who looked the other way because she didn't want to """"""ruin a young man's life"""""" was particularly devastating, and yet isn't that what happens all the time? The film plays out in unexpected ways which is a part of its strength, and I was impressed that it threaded the needle between being depressing and uplifting. It felt emblematic of the era, and powerful."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 March 2021,8/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is remarkable for mainstreaming the rape-revenge flick by removing the exploitation in the exploitation subgenre. No gory murder, torture or rape typical of such body horror and nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture. The word ""rape"" isn't even mentioned, although there's no mistaking that's what's being avenged. What mainstream variations on this that had been made it seems identify with a father figure who enforces law and order on the bad-acting men. Hardly something that could be confused with a down-with-the-patriarchy feminist critique. The ""Taken"" trilogy, for instance, or even the latest ""Rambo,"" ""Last Blood"" (2019). Macho violence against macho violence in the ""Death Wish"" (1974) tradition, perhaps, or if they were more arty one could recall ""The Virgin Spring"" (1961) or something. ""Promising Young Woman,"" on the other hand, focuses on the female protagonist, although, notably, not the principal victim. Still, it's certainly no ""The Last House on the Left"" (1972) or ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978).I'm sure others have and will want to focus on the real-world social problems such a picture elicits, as if the genre hasn't been around for decades--and really probably older than even when D. W. Griffith first began enacting his violent fantasies on Lillian Gish via nitrate in the 1910s. And, that's not to say there isn't interesting feminist and other readings of the genre, but it may be telling how far ""Promising Young Woman"" goes to avoid either the violent and pornographic or cathartic expectations of the genre. I'm not very familiar with body horror in general, either, as I tend to prefer my exploitation cheesy instead bloody, but ""Promising Young Woman"" is intriguing in a vein that seems to go back to some of its women-centered revenge tales and is reflexively about that.Basically, it's another movie starring an actress-playing-an-actress, and very well by Carey Mulligan. She was never the victim, but she structured her life since around playing the role of her late friend who was. She pretends to be inebriated at clubs, to be taken home by predatory men who try to take advantage of her, as they say. That's when she drops the act and delivers the lecture to the men regarding their criminal behavior that some seem to expect from such a movie. She also does this with the enablers of the rape culture: a gossiping fellow former female student who pretended not to believe it, the school's dean who similarly dismissed it in favor of graduating the rapists, and the lawyer who knowingly defended his client at the expense of tarnishing the victim. All actors in a sense, except they don't turn on and off the facade with such ready acknowledgement that they're frauds--tending instead to rationalize their evil deeds.One or two twists in the picture I found predictable, but that's fine, as the point isn't to be some M. Night Shyamalan surprise; it's about the acting exposing the lie and the ultimate coverup of her friend's abuse. I also rather enjoy the temporary misdirection by exploiting the tropes of the biggest fraud of all genres, the rom-com. There's even the sassy black friend to encourage the romance, the meet cute, temporary breakup, revoltingly ostentatious display of affection to a Paris Hilton song in a drug store (to answer one character's question, much of this is ironic, including the score), and the parents who try to get their 30-something to leave the nest as if in ""Failure to Launch"" (2006) or some other cinematic abomination. ""Promising Young Woman"" is quite funny at times in that way, not to mention well edited and photographed, despite its disturbing subject matter. It does the same thing with body horror and faux feminist films in the opening act, as what appears to be blood on her as she walks the streets turns out to be food and as she stares down the cliché of sexually-harassing construction workers, and there's the reversal of the ""male gaze"" with the first shots on men wearing khakis.I can see where some might have a problem with the almost anti-climactic final act, too, but remember what Mulligan's Cassie has been doing throughout her avenging. She's been inhabiting the revenge part of the character of her friend, Nina, by exposing the actions of those who acted upon Nina in the past. We don't see the ""real"" video within the movie that's a record of the crime, because that's not what this is about, or at least not entirely. This is Cassie going so into character, beyond pretending a drunk or stripper or even rape-revenge, to becoming Nina. It's the name she finally assumes, one half of a doppelgänger heart pendant. The ""Single White Female"" (1992) reference isn't too far off. Doubling, on top of the acting and genre engagement, further alluding to the cinematic artifice. Perhaps, even the chapter titles and the ""Careful How You Go"" title in book form reinforce this. Clever stuff, for what might be dismissed as mere black comedy and social commentary elsewhere, from first-time feature writer-director Emerald Fennell."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,,"Powerful, potent & provocative, Emerald Fennell's feature film debut is as vivid as it is vicious in its storytelling and is greatly elevated by Carey Mulligan's ferocious showcase. A bold & brilliant revenge thriller that's unyielding in its intensity yet is aware of what lines to not cross, Promising Young Woman is undeniably amongst the better films of 2020.Also written by Fennell, the story is riveting, unforgiving & timely plus the drama only gets more interesting as it progresses before culminating with a finale that's going to polarise its viewers. Fennell's tactful direction makes sure the dark mood & reckoning feel never leaves the room and the way it builds up to its inescapable climax is thoroughly engrossing to watch.The neat camerawork, vibrant lighting, tight editing & splendid musical choices are no doubt impressive and bring a certain richness & depth to the imagery as well. The real standout however is Carey Mulligan's show-stealing performance that hits all the right notes and is up there with her best works. The supporting cast is no slouch but Mulligan's strong act easily overshadows them all.Overall, Promising Young Woman is gripping, thrilling & thought-provoking from start to finish and commences Emerald Fennell's feature filmmaking career on an incredibly promising note. A refreshing slice of abuse, trauma & retribution that's expertly crafted & confidently narrated by its debutant director and is catapulted to new heights by Carey Mulligan's fierce & fervent act, Promising Young Woman is a definite must-see."

This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won't forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to ""movie"" for me. I really liked it, but it wasn't like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, ""Promising Young Woman"" is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise. The more it revealed the more i felt for our main character. Here is a one movie you won't forget soon after seeing it."

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan is exquisite she deserves the nomination for golden globe even if she doesn't win I'm glad she's up for it at least. Promising Young Woman is beautifully filmed, great dialogue that is well written, the soundtrack is so awesome, and the acting is top notch! I kinda understand if people didn't like it there's a couple frustrating aspects. I love this movie the way it is ironically I've been watching Law and Order: SVU which is similar to this movies story and I'd happily own when available!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,,"In her directing debut, Emerald Fennell (who plays Camilla in ""The Crown"") turned out a piece of stylish moviemaking that makes you take note. The liberal genre scrambling is something to behold. You start thinking femme fatale revenger story and it soon turns into rom-com. Dark comedy starts as touches here and there, and becomes more prominent. And all the time, you can't help feeling nuanced subtleties and depths marking a character study.
It is difficult to say something meaningful about this movie without some degree of spoiler, and therefore here's my extra spoiler warning.
Cassie (Cary Mulligan) is a med school dropout, the reasons for which, like the other plot elements, are revealed only gradually throughout the movie. She now works a mundane job as a barista, as three parallel narratives develop around her. Sounds a little complicated? Let's take them one at a time.
The simplest one is entirely about the present although it probably reflect traumatic events the past. Pretending to be completely drunk, Cassie lures male predators in bars at night, and turns them into her prey. What exactly happens is tantalizingly obscure. We only see one of these encounters all the way through and this one does not involve physical violence, just psychological bashing, so to speak, of the scumbag. But there are hints of violence in another case, suggesting the ""menacing presence of a sociopath"". Then, at the midpoint of the movie, during a traffic dispute in broad daylight, it is shown in no uncertain terms that she is capable of physical violence. In all these cases, it is her subtly menacing confrontation, just like a face-off of the two centers at the line of scrimmage, that makes men twice her size backs away.
The rom-com arc starts with reencountering med school classmate Ryan (Bo Burnham). A little carelessly, he lets slips his unflattering opinion of her current job, regrets it immediately, apologizes and suggests that she spit in his coffee. She does, and he drinks it up. The slightly dark humor continues when Cassie's boss, upon finding out that Ryan is a pediatric doctor, quips ""Killed any children?"" Taking her time, director Fennell allows the relationship to slowly develop from ""not a date, just friendship"", to his calling her ""you miserable axxhxxx"" preceding their first kiss. It looks almost as though they are going to live happily ever after.
Which takes us to the third and last plotline. Appearance of Ryan is catalyst to bringing back disturbing memories that have hitherto been simmering. It's all about Cassie's best friend Nina, what happened to her that culminated in both of them dropping med school together. Nina finally killed herself while Cassie all but disappeared from the human race, gnawing in hatred and plotting her revenge. This is now accelerated by information updated by Ryan. Two of the lesser culprits (played by Alison Brie and Connie Britton) were taught a lesson, poetic justice style, without doing them any more harm than a scare. One of them hits back, revealing Ryan's involvement as an observer, whose inactivity can be construed as condoning. This would be the nearest to a moralistic message in this movie, especially if you remember Jodi Foster's ""The accused"" (1988) (not suggesting that ""Promising young woman"" has a brutal intensity anywhere near to that movie).
I suppose it can be considered a spoiler (so my warning again!) to say that there is no final surprise twist in the sense of something turning out not to be what it seems. The surprise is in how Fennel brings the story to a conclusion. That, you may not have guessed. Or you may. It may bring frustration to some, and delight to others.
""Promising young woman"" boasts of 4 heavyweight nominations for Golden Globe: Best Picture (drama), actress, director, and screenplay (both of the last two for Fennell). It would be interesting to see how it will do in Oscar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 October 2021,6/10,"I get that this film isn't made for me, and based on the reception of others, it more than satisfied the target audience. As a revenge fantasy, I'll defer my judgement and accept that it succeeded on that level.But as a film that covers a serious topic, I don't think it succeeded. My main problem is that the film is a mess of caricatures. Every character is not a real human being, just a contrived role. There's ""the predator"", ""the clueless administrator"", ""the cowardly bystander"", etc. And of course, Cassandra as the near-infallible ""tough teacher"" (it's even in her name!). Every second line is a standard clichéd excuse, as if the screenwriters had a checklist and tried to fit in every single one, no matter how clunky it seemed. Sure, people unfortunately say such attitudes, but they don't spout endless streams of them during every conversation.I was initially glad about the Ryan character because it showed that normal men and normal lives are possible, and Cassandra might be able to heal. The revelation that he's yet another predator connected to the original crime was very disappointing. It's like there's a whole conspiracy that every single person around Cassandra must be a terrible person who needs to be taught a lesson. It felt too convenient for the script. When dealing with such a serious topic, the audience should feel like they can understand and sympathise with the scenario to some degree, so they can connect it to their own lives. But if the characters in the scenario are too overtly villainous, it creates a disconnect.Then there's the problem of Cassandra herself. Some commentators have complained that the film portrays men too negatively, like they're all predators (I partially agree, but the women aren't off the hook either). What about Cassandra? She's not exactly a flattering portrayal of a feminist herself! She's obsessive, hateful and hurtful, trying to fix the original problem by revisiting the very same thing onto other women. At times, she almost felt like a stereotype written by an anti-feminist. Some say that she's mentally unhinged on purpose, because she's a victim of the system and it has broken her. But to that I would counter that she's simultaneously supposed to be a hero pursuing her own will, and we're supposed to cheer for her plans. So is she forced by circumstances to punish herself and others in unhealthy ways, or is she the sober one bringing justice? There's no clear answer. This paradox undermines the very premise of the revenge thriller and muddles its message, even though it should have been quite clear from the start."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 April 2021,8/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch a young woman trying to get revenge from some people after a tragic event that happened in the past. She has to do her best in order to succeed and she has also to be concentrated and focused on her goal.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot, consisted of some plot twists that I did not expect and did not even imagine. The direction which was made by Emerald Fennell who is also the writer of it, it did an excellent job on both and I enjoyed the way she presented her main character and her past along with the connection between her and some other people. Regarding the interpretation of Carey Mulligan who played as Cassandra, I have to admit that she was simply amazing. To sum up, I have to say that ""Promising Young Woman"" is a nice, interesting and unpredictable movie that I am sure it will amaze you so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,7/10,"While there are elements of Promising Young Woman that feel familiar, make no doubt about the fact that actress turned director Emerald Fennell's feature debut is a beast unto its own, one that gives its star Carey Mulligan her best role in years and announces its creator as a force to be reckoned with as we witness the birth of fresh new voice in the film making industry.As confident of a debut film as you're likely to see, Woman sees Fennell introduce us to the world of Mulligan's New Yorker Cassandra, a victim of a traumatic experience that we slowly begin to understand and a 30 year old that still lives at home with her parents (humorously played by Clancy Brown and Jennifer Coolidge) and seems to live solely for the purpose of unearthing sleazebags in the city that prey on those most vulnerable to fulfil their wants and desires.There's times were you feel as a viewer that you have everything figured out, whether it be what's occurred, what's about to go down or what makes a character tick but Fennell to the films benefit ensures that most steps that Woman takes are unpredictable and even at times utterly confronting, even if some may be disappointed by the type of film Woman becomes when weighed up against what it appears to at times be.No matter where the story or Fennell takes us, sometimes these destinations feel slightly over the top or unbelievable but the core message of the film remains resolute throughout and Woman features one of recent memories most impressive female performances as Mulligan brings Cassandra to life in vivid and thoughtful detail.A character that could've turned out too cold or strange in the hands of the wrong performer, Mulligan is as good as she's ever been in Fennell's film and the two make for perfectly suited partners in crime here as they explore Cassie's quest for vengeance and retribution in a landscape that appears to be utterly unjust.From her seemingly boozy opening scene, a joyous segment featuring of all things a hit Paris Hilton song right through to the films shocking final stretch, Mulligan is dynamite here and even when the film threatens to take a few too many convenient or over the top turns the awards worthy performance of Mulligan towers over everything else, including the films strong sense of visuals, a noteworthy performance from comedian/filmmaker Bo Burnham and an important message that may've been told before, but never quite like it is here.Final Say -It's themes may not be as original as the way in which they are bought forward and the narrative may falter at times but the topical Promising Young Woman is still highly commendable and recommendable thanks to director Emerald Fennell's fresh delivery and a fantastic central performance from the awards worthy Mulligan.3 1/2 oil rig workers out of 5"

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,6/10,"Though I appreciated a lot about ""Promising Young Woman"" I feel, particularly having just finished ""I May Destroy You"" that it feels mild in comparison, rather than the biting topical revenge thriller I was anticipating.Cassandra (Carey Mulligan) is emotionally scarred by the consequenceless rape of her best friend at medical school, which resulted in her suicide. She spends her evenings pretending to be drunk in clubs and bars and then turning the tables on the predatory men who look to take advantage of her. A reunion with an old school friend, Ryan (Bo Burnham) offers her a chance at moving forward with her life, but also opens up a way of specific revenge against those involved in the crime and those who covered it up.It's a really good performance from Carey Mulligan and she definitely deserves the Oscar nomination that she received for it. I'm less convinced that the film deserves its Best Picture nod though. I found it a little toothless compared to what I was expecting/hoping for. There's no real clarity on what happens to the men that she exposes - they don't appear to be revealed to a larger audience, or even, as I considered might have been the case before I saw the film, murdered. When Cassandra hatches begins her plan she has comeuppances for an old school friend, played by Alison Brie and for the Dean of the medical school, played by Connie Britton - neither of which she fully goes through with. It felt like these were orchestrated to keep me on her side in the film, which wasn't necessary as the ""other"" side is rapists or people covering up for rapists.There were some aspects of the film I felt were a little telegraphed, such as the reveal about Ryan and though I didn't dislike the ending as much as others have, I'm not sure, if you take the next logical steps after the conclusion, its going to go as the movie suggests (I wish I could explain more, but I'm trying to write without spoilers).I didn't dislike it, I liked the score, the imagery, the palette and most of the performances, I just feel like this is the sanitised version of a better film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,9/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" (2020 release; 113 min. brings the story of Cassie. As the movie opens, Cassie is slomped over in a bar, very drunk. It's not long before a guy comes over to check on her, and volunteers to drive her home. Except that instead he stops at his place, where, just as he is about to rape her, Cassie snaps out of it, not drunk at all. Cassie notes this latest 'incident' in her little diary. We then get to know Cassie: almost 30 years old, she still lives with her parents, and she holds a job at a coffee shop after having dropped out from medical school some years ago, along with her classmate and friend Nina... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the writing and directing debut of British actress Emerald Fennell, who pitched this story to Margot Robbie's production company. And what a debut it is. The timing of this movie couldn't be better in the age of #MeToo and all that comes with it. Remember the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh... The mobie is plot-heaving so I really don't want to go into further details. Of course none of this would have had the impact without the stellar performance by Carey Mulligan. I am going on record already that Mulligan is a shoo-in to get a Best Actress Oscar Nomination (and may indeed win the Oscar). I don't see how Emeral Fennell could be denied a Best Original Screenplay Oscar Nomination. The screenplay is original, funny, serious, and more.""Promising Young Man"" premiered exactly 10 months ago today at the 2020 Sundance Film Festical, in what seems like a difference century altogether. It was originally scheduled to opne in theaters in April, but a little thing call COVID-19 had different ideas. The movie finally opened on Christmas Day, and I couldn't wait to see it. The screening where I saw this at was not attended well: exactly 9 people, including myself. The theater complex itself felt like a ghost town. A darn shame. Meanwhile if you are in the mood for a hard-hitting social commentary served up wuth black humor and a thrilling performance by Carey Mulligan, I'd suggest you wun, don't walk, to your nearest theater, or eventually seek it out on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"I watched a lot of films in 2020 (167 to be exact) and gave only one of them a perfect 10/10 score. It took exactly one film in 2021 to match that. A sign of good things ahead hopefully. 'Promising Young Woman' is one of those rare treats of a film where you simply don't want it to end. Every aspect of it is perfect. Here's the kicker though - I couldn't wait to find out who the writer/director was afterwards. To my astonishment it was a debut effort from Emerald Fennell. Incredible stuff.Where to begin with this film? I think my single favourite thing about it was the dialogue. It was so exquisitely written (and performed for that matter). So many films lack any imagination in their dialogue these days, but not this film. It can be charming, charismatic, intriguing, thoughtful, funny and a hundred things in between. Also the music in this movie was perfect. I particularly loved the Toxic instrumental and the use of Angel of the Morning at the end. This is a soundtrack I would buy.I was aware of Carey Mulligan before this film, but incredibly I had never seen a single one of her films or television shows. I was blown away by how talented she is. The range she shows in one single character in 'Promising Young Woman' is almost beyond belief. I'm not sure if this is the type of film the Academy would ever recognise a performance in, but they absolutely should.I can't say enough goods things about this movie. It hits every note perfectly. 'Promising Young Woman' was an absolute pleasure to sit through and a film that you simply can't afford to miss."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 June 2021,7/10,"Promising Young Woman (2020) is a movie my fiancée and I caught in theatres as soon as it came out. The storyline focuses on a woman with a level of resentment towards men because of a historically poor interaction. She lays out a plan to address the concern. This movie is directed by Emerald Fennell in her directorial debut and stars Carey Mulligan (Shame), Adam Brody (Jennifer's Body), Jennifer Coolidge (American Pie) and Clancy Brown (The Shawshank Redemption). The storyline for this had a great set up. The character development and dialogue was very good and clever. I also liked the full circle ending. The message is very well delivered. My only complaint was I think they could have taken certain revenge scenes a step further. I would have loved some more gruesome scenes. Overall I'd say this was above average but is getting a little overrated. I'd score this a 6.5-7/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan is Cassie, a thirty year-old medical school drop-out who picks up men at nightclubs, pretending to be drunk and then exposing them to shame. Her best friend Nina had left medical school after being raped. Because she was drunk at the time of the assault, she was not believed. What follows is a series of twists and turns I never saw coming. Promising Young Woman is a revenge thriller, and one of the best that I have ever seen. It is a roller coaster ride from start to finish. First time writer-director Emerald Fennell is a major talent. Carey Mulligan will be in competition with Frances McDormand(Nomadland) for Best Actress at the Oscar's. It would have my vote for Best Film of the year."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,10/10 - this incredibly well-made and remarkably fresh thriller features a plethora of strong performances (particularly that of Carey Mulligan) and bravely goes where few films before it have in utterly blasting rape culture
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 December 2020,8/10,"I saw ""Promising Young Woman"", starring Carey Mulligan-Suffragette, The Great Gatsby_2013; Bo Burnham-Zach Stone Is Gonna To Be Famous_tv, Hall Pass; Laverne Cox-Charlie's Angels_2019, Orange Is The New Black_tv and Chris Lowell-Glow_tv, Private Practice_tv.
This is a movie that might make people think about relationships between men & women. It's written & directed by Emerald Fennell-an actress in The Crown & a writer for Killing Eve-who also has a funny cameo as a woman doing a make_up tutorial video. Carey plays a woman that dropped out of high school because of an incident that happened to her best friend. Carey was going to be a doctor before she dropped out of school and now works at a coffee shop with Laverne. Carey is now 30, and she still lives at home with her parents-Jennifer Coolidge & Clancy Brown in cameos. Bo plays Carey's confused boyfriend-she won't even let him kiss her-and Chris is one of the boys that caused the incident in the past that messed up Carey's life. When Carey hears about Chris being in town-getting married-well, it just starts the old vengeance motors to start turning in her head and plans start to take form. There are lots of other cameos that pop up; I remember seeing Connie Britton, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Max Greenfield, Molly Shannon, Christopher Mintz_Plasse and Alfred Molina.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity but sexual assaults are shown-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,10/10,". . . of all-time Cinema History. Nina and Cassandra are AT LEAST best friends, from Age 4 right into Medical School. The former is on track to graduate at the top of her class, when one small lapse in situational awareness leaves her at the mercy of the envious laggards bringing up the academic rear of her cohort. These malingering miscreants apparently all share the cave man orientation, rather than a trendier 21st Century persuasion. Cassandra is left to pick up the pieces of she and Nina's Eternal Love Locket when tragedy inevitably ensues, and the predatory jackals try to laugh all the way to the blood bank. However, masquerading as a lowly coffee shop server, Cassandra steels herself for a final duel in stilettos. For the love of Nina, she sacrifices everything so that so that she and Nina's final reunion can be celebrated in an Eternal Flame."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 April 2021,5/10,This is a film that is more engaging the less you examine it. Ultimately I think the film suggests the only way for women to get justice-especially in relation to sexual violence-is to die. The film is also deeply conflicted if it thinks Cassie is a (flawed) angel of vengeance or a deeply damaged human being in need of help. The script tries to play this both ways and fails. But above all the script is *extremely* predictable. Every single major twist was guessable 20 or so minutes into the film. As a thriller the large story beats being telegraphed rob it of all the heat.This is really too bad; the acting-especially Mulligan-is striking and it papers over much of the script's faults. Likewise the direction nails the dark comedic vibe the film is going for and if nothing else the film has a visceral thrill now and then. But it doesn't add up too much. I strongly caution people with (sexual) abuse and/or trauma in their histories to *not* watch this film. It will land poorly and may bring up deeply unpleasant emotions. The #metoo movement deserves better than this.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 May 2021,1/10,"This film start with three men talking at the bar, and one of the man ""Jerry"" hitting on a girl ""Cassandra"" at the couch scene! As turnout, this film is about Cassandra need to take revenge on a doctor ""Al"" for the death of her best friend ""Nina"", and she unintentionally kill by Al at the end! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the marking on the book scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the driving scene, and overuse of the staring at the phone scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Cassandra damaging a man's truck at the intersection! At the end, after the death of Cassandra, the evidence she obtain earlier sent to the lawyer ""Jordan"" to capture Al! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,7/10,"Mulligan's character has been affected by a disturbing attack involving her friend Nina and as a result goes around pretending to be drunk, allowing men to pick her up and then challenging them - rather ferociously. When she comes across those who were directly responsible for the assault she seeks revenge.Great to see Mulligan acting brilliantly against type as a grumpy, up tight, angry cynic, take out the most glorious, largely non violent revenge on the guilty ones. It is also done with tremendous pace and great humour, with fun and witty support from the one guy who genuinely seems to care for her, played by Burnham. Not entirely convinced that the rather theatrical climax completely worked, but that didn't take away the great satisfaction it gives, leaving a smile on your face."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 January 2021,8/10,"This film is like Heathers meets Cruel Intentions. It's dark, funny and has a great story. If the above films you enjoyed you will not be disappointed in this one."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 May 2021,7/10,"Haunted by an event involving her best friend Nina, medical school drop-out Cassie uses herself as a honeytrap in her attempt to make men re-evaluate what they should and should not do when dealing with women who have had one too many. However, as the film progresses, it is quite clear that Cassie has a long memory and also has bigger fish to fry...If I'm totally honest, Promising Young Woman was not quite the film I expected it to be; I did think it would be more of an ass-kicking revenge type film; but in reality it leans more towards psychological/implied violence. This, however, does not make Promising Young Woman a bad film because once I was on-board with the slightly different slant on the genre that was presented to me I did find the film to be quite enjoyable.Carey Mulligan's lead character and performance are the crux of the film and a big factor in making the film work so well; sure she may seem cold and possibly a tad sociopathic, but beneath all of that there is clearly a broken person who has felt that she has needed to adopt a completely different existence as a way of gaining some justice for her friend. As with most vigilantes her heart is in the right place even if her mind, certainly at times, isn't...As I've already suggested Promising Young Woman is not the most action-packed of films and a bit of patience is required (it definitely becomes more interesting in its second half). The curveball ending is likely to bring mixed results and basically leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions; I have a theory which, at the very least, makes sense to me lol.This is very much Carey Mulligan's film and she is a very commanding screen presence; fragmented, assertive, ballsy - she can do it all and she is fascinating to watch. Supporting characters such as Clancy Brown and Jennifer Coolidge are worlds apart from how we're used to seeing them which admittedly provided a nice change of pace, but as parents they were a little ugh and quite hard to take seriously. Bo Burnham is rather bland and nobody else makes much impact on the film; it's only Carey Mulligan that gives the film any memorable qualities at all.In summary, this film was not quite what I expected, but sometimes I like films that surprise me and this film was one of the good surprises. Like a badly planed piece of plywood the film has some 'rough edges' but for those who enjoy a 'thinking man's vigilante film' Promising Young Woman should fit the bill."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,9/10,"A shocking revenge fantasy that will break your heart, Promising Young Woman is perhaps a touch too strident (and extreme) for some tastes, but it is an indelible souvenir of our ongoing moment. YES I RECOMMEND IT. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 3/21/2021"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,10/10,"Best movie I've seen this year and I'm a feel good green mile , shawshank, or scifi type guy which this movie is none of those. Wont give anything a way as this needs to be enjoyed to the fullest without any help. The best review I can give is to just simply watch the best film of 2020!! If you don't its completely YOUR loss!! BRAVO fantastic job to the whole cast and crew!!!easiest 10 this yesr."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 March 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman is a dramatic thriller on the pulse of time that deserves the attention and acclaim it has gotten. The movie revolves around Cassie who was once planning on becoming a doctor. When her best friend got raped and the investigation got dropped, Cassie's life changed forever. She dropped out of school, still lives at her parents' house and has no friends. Instead, she regularly feigns drunkenness in clubs, allowing men to take her to their homes, and revealing sobriety when they try to take advantage of her. Cassie's life changes yet again when she meets a former classmate named Ryan who wants to go on a date with her. The initial romance is cut short when Cassie learns that the man who raped her best friend is getting married. She decides that those who committed the crime and those who dropped the case must pay for their actions. She encounters former witnesses, perpetrators and lawyers who react very differently to those past events. Things take an even more sinister turn when Cassie learns that the rape was filmed and that her new romantic interest was one of the bystanders.This dramatic thriller convinces on many levels. The issue of rape culture is exposed very directly and honestly and offers food for debate and thought. The lead character is particularly fascinating because she is brutally vengeful but also steadfastly loyal to her best friend. The movie cleverly meanders from sinister crime scenes over pitch-black comedy to hopeful romantic moments. This makes the film unpredictable and especially the final forty-five minutes will keep the audience on the edge of its seats. The acting performances are authentic as the actresses and actors become one with their roles. The soft, nostalgic and melodic soundtrack creates a stark contrast to the gloomy story. The camera work is calm and precise and recalls the cinematic works of the late seventies and early eighties on more than one occasion. The light and sound effects as well as the locations and settings further give the movie a slight vintage vibe.In the end, Promising Young Woman is a movie that is professionally crafted, thoroughly entertaining and most importantly exposes an important issue that still exists in the twenty-first century. Some viewers might find that message exaggerated, inappropriate or offensive but it's important to discuss it, get information about it and ultimately tackle that issue in our real world. From that point of view, this film is perhaps not the very best but certainly the most relevant Hollywood film in recent memory."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"I was into this one all the way through. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. It's full of surprises. I accept that there are criticisms of the story, but they didn't bother me. The whole thing looked fantastic, and Cary Mulligan deserves to win the big one for this. It's hard to describe the kind of performance she gives here--it's not typical award season fare. This is more subversive and challenging. Well done."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,8/10,"This is pretty good actually. Nuanced, textured, brilliant directing. Nonstop motion and twists. Ending not what I thought it would be."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 December 2020,10/10,"This recent release will surely be the talk of the town for some time to come (let's see if it'll garner some Oscar buzz as well) as we explore the revenge laden journey of a former medical student (who now lives at home w/her parents) as she habitually pretends to be drunk at night clubs, gets picked up by a suitor hoping for a hook-up, only to be put in their place when she reveals all her faculties are still there, primarily her acid wit & forthrightness, which deescalates the situation. Carey Mulligan (already an Oscar nominee for her performance in An Education) will surely cop a nom here (maybe a win too, mark my words!) is our anti-heroine, laser focused in her goal (which will gain clarity as the film progresses) in taking down these various bargain basement Lotharios (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, McLovin' himself, is one of his victims, Adam Brody is another) w/her co-worker (Laverne Cox) & parents (Clancy Brown & Jennifer Coolidge) worried that life is passing her by. Into said life comes an old medical school student friend, played by Bo Burnham, who may shake her from her mission but when Mulligan's raison d'etre reveals itself (a past school mate was raped by students & then subsequently committed suicide when the crime was not punished) we see where the eye of her particular hurricane stems from. Not a film which will be embraced by bros, incells or the like but not since Linda Fiorentino's turn in The Last Seduction has a thoroughly unlikable misanthrope garnered enough audience sympathy for her cause rooting her to win at all costs...& what a cost it is (you'll have to see it for yourself friends & neighbors!). Also starring Molly Shannon as the lost girl's mother, Connie Britton as the school dean where the incident took place, Alfred Molina as the attorney who handled the case, Alison Brie as an old friend of Mulligan's w/a mini Veronica Mars reunion, Chris Lowell & Max Greenfield, popping up as the purveyors of the foul deed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,8/10,"Right from the jump I have to say I feel like this film became victim of the hype beast for me. I tried to avoid hearing anything about it, I wanted zero details so I could go into it as fresh as possible and yet all I heard anyone say was how phenomenal it is and, while I really enjoyed this movie, I don't feel like it lives up to that hype. Weirdly, I was expecting a much bloodier affair. I thought the exceptional Carey Mulligan would be butchering men who did wrong and while I was surprised to see that's not what happened, I think the actuality was somehow more affecting and more damaging to her victims.Lets start there. There are scenes in this movie, prolonged moments that feel like an absolute gutpunch. Mulligan's character calls out the sexually biased treatment of individuals in a way that is brutal, honest and somehow never feels preachy to me. It is just so poignant and so raw that, as I was watching this I had to call into question some of my own behavior in the past. To be able to pull that off is remarkably powerful and I think, in a lot of ways, exactly what we need right now. Mulligan is wonderful in this and she really has to be in order to pull this off but, weirdly, I almost felt like she was upstaged by a surprisingly strong performance by Bo Burnham who seems like he came out of nowhere and absolutely crushed it. Now, he has much less to do and a part of that may very likely be because I expected nothing from him and that surprise may be pushing him higher than deserved but he really is great here. That said, this is 100% Mulligan's movie and I honestly don't know that there are many others that would be able to capture the nuance she brought to this character.Weirdly, as much as I enjoyed this film, I can't say I adored it the way I'd like to. Now, it may well grow on me in the future but for now there were a couple of issues I had with it. The biggest issue being how predictable aspects of it were. From the moment we meet certain characters you know what's going to happen to them and that can rob the film of a little of the shock and wow factor. Also, it does feel like another ""every white/man/American/etc is terrible"" story and I'm a little tired of those at this point. Decent people may be in the minority but could we maybe get one every now and then?Minor issues aside, this really is a powerful film and one I strongly recommend for everyone with the only caveat of trigger warnings for people that have been victims of assault because I could see aspects of this being hard to watch. Barring that, everyone should go and try to watch this film. It's exceptionally done and has an incredibly powerful message delivered in a impactful way and I think that is the definition of worthwhile cinema."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 March 2021,8/10,"I'm not sure if I'm getting paranoid in my old age but is it just me who thinks there are more and more anti men movies being released?Whatever the answer is , I don't really mind if the result is that there are films as clever as Promising Young WomanThis is about a woman who is traumatised by a sexual crime against her friend , so she seeks out vengeance against those who we're and weren't involved .This woman is full of anger . She spends her nights entrapping men by pretending to be drunk and then shaming them ( or more ?) when they try to take advantage of her.Carey Mulligan is brilliant as Cassie , a woman who can't forget or forgive and everything and everyone suffers in her life because of what's eating her up .The writing and direction by Emerald Fennell is outstanding. She deserves all the awards she will undoubtedly get this year .The twist at the end is almost of Usual Suspects proportions and it put a massive smile on my face.There aren't enough films released anymore that have storylines this clever .This is one of those films that sticks in the mind for days afterwards and that's the sign of a really good film for me ."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 May 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman is an incredible thrilling that's really funny, timely and unpredictable. Carey Mulligan gives a perfect lead performance and has perfect chemistry with Bo Burnham who is great. Emerald Fennell's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and expertly paced. The music by Anthony B. Willis and the soundtrack are both excellent. However, it is slightly undermined by a predictable twist."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"IN BRIEF: A sexual revenge fantasy that uses dark humor to tackle the serious repercussions of male toxicity and its trauma to its female victims.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Promising Young Woman is the definitive dark comedy thriller about the #MeToo Movement and its aftermath. Emerald Fennell, a British actress, makes an audacious writer/ director debut and she is a talent that bears watching. Not only are her blistering words about male toxicity on point, but her visual style has an off-kilter edginess that makes her film all the more memorable. That she has Carey Mulligan in the central role as the traumatized Cassie elevates this satire to a whole other level. (More on this masterful performance a bit later.)However, this imaginative screenplay loses its credibility as this revenge fantasy hits the third act. It is there that the movie falls apart with inconsistent timelines and far-fetched plotting. Granted, one needs to suspend their disbelief in the film's complicated story-line as Cassie's scheming becomes too contrived a plot device which may move the action forward, but not the weaker logistics of the narrative.Flawed as it is, there is so much to admire in the film's innovative and timely message. In all of this sordidness, there is a glimmer of offbeat humor and quirky characters that take moviegoers on this unconventional love story with action thriller overtones.At the heart of this movie is the performance of Ms. Mulligan as our avenging angel. Her emotional range from vulnerable victim to female predator is astonishing. She stalks her male prey by pretending to be drunk at bars and being lured into uncompromising situations, only to spring into action to rectify the wrongs. Her quick turns are masterful acting choices. Playing opposite her as her true love is Bo Burnham as Ryan and their chemistry is wonderful. He brings a charming goofiness to his role that is endearing and gives moviegoers some traces of hope despite all the surrounding madness. Their song and dance routine in a drug store reinforces their whimsical courtship most delightfully, making their relationship quite convincing.There is also fine support from other cast members including Alison Brie, Laverne Cox, Alfred Molina, Clancy Brown, Jennifer Coolidge, Connie Britton, and Molly Shannon. Portraying the assorted cads are Adam Brody, Chris Lowell, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Max Greenfield, all going against type.Promising Young Woman is a promising debut by writer / director Ms. Fennell with a sensational performance by Ms. Mulligan that tackles sexual harassment with wry humor and repeatedly hits its moving target. (GRADE: B+)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 March 2021,8/10,"WOW!! There is simply nothing I can say about the plot of this movie that won't mislead you or give away its trajectory. It's uncomfortable, unpredictable, inevitable and intense. It will be a different experience depending on your gender and intensely evocative for 81% of women. Be prepared! Carrie Mulligan is superb in this role. She defies chronology. I give this film an 8 (evocative) out of 10. {Thriller, Drama}"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 November 2021,5/10,"While this pic may get slightly better as it progresses, it also comes across as a manipulative 'gotcha' moment, somewhat concocted for the me-too movement. While that may not be all a bad thing, writer/director Emerald Fennell can get away with a lot of emotional leading, and she takes every advantage of doing so - as far as its Awards go, its PC credentials go before it. The script wavers between coy and highly crass, lurching uncomfortably between several genres. Fennell's 'lesson' may be well intended but her methods are often too grotty to keep some of her audience on side.Her main character, Cassandra (Mulligan) repeatedly puts herself in seriously dangerous situations to lure a variety of opportunistic men to pick her up - while she appears alone & smashed-paralytic at various sleazy bars. Not a smart way to supposedly 'teach' men a lesson. She also goes on to place other women in desperate situations to 'teach' them a lesson (another risky business) But, it's when she poses as a stripper at a raucous buck's party that she crosses the line - definitely placing herself in a foolishly dangerous situation.It all looks good, with most performances being fine and perhaps with a script that might have offered a broader appeal, this may have been accessible to a larger audience - instead, it aims mainly to the juvenile 'R' rated trendy set.Prismark 10's posted review (on IMDb in March '21) sums it all up perfectly."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,7/10,"The good:Carey Mulligan's performance is stupendous. The way she portrays a woman with a troubled past (and a not-so-great present), and as someone looking to exact revenge, she shoulders the film with an interesting palette of expressions.The thrills in the second half are solidly placed. While the revenge plot is a bit clichéd, the way Cassie (Mulligan) goes about executing her moves is slickly conceived and shot by debut writer-director Emerald Fennell.I liked how Cassie holds her own against the people (men and women alike) in the film. At 30, she couldn't care less about what anyone thinks of her post-med-school-dropout life. When we first see her, she's running her own social experiment where the lines of consent get crossed way too many times by the men who are (only) sexually interested in her.Cassie's equation with her dad is also beautifully pictured. In fact, in the entire film, he seems to be the only person who understands her completely and stands by her. I felt this bit, while not adding much to the central plot, added nuance to her character.The middling/bad:Tonal transitions happen without any warnings whatsoever. If you started watching the film thinking it's a crime-drama-thriller, it takes a good while before it eventually gets there. So, if you expect a water-tight thriller from the get-go, you may be turned off a little by its subtle romantic-comedy overtones.The climactic twist doesn't exactly shock you. It was always going to be either plan A or plan B, from the moment the last act began.The mostly pop soundtrack did little (for me) to meld with the film's overall dark, downbeat theme."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,7/10,"This is a slow paced, tedious film but if you hang on for the full ride, it is somewhat fulfilling.Let's talk positives. There is a great snarky comedic tone to some of what we have going on here. The actors are decent and while this has a familiar subject matter, the story is told in a unique way.Let's talk negatives. It is, as I mentioned, tedious. It sorta drags along in the beginning. There are no high, laugh out loud moments or super dark low moments. It is a very steady drama for the most part but I am a horror buff and I would've loved to have seen some darker moments.Overall, I liked it. A bit too safe and slow for it to be amazing, but not a bad watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,7/10,"Promising Young WomanThe promising young woman of the title encompassed both Cassie and Nina as their destinies were inextricably intertwined from when they were children. As identified by the two halves of the friendship locket.This movie had many good things about it that I will conclude with, I want to identify the problem areas that ruin this movies chances at the Oscars for best picture.These areFailing to recognise the pragmatic reality of a sexually charged environment and then throwing into the mix copious amounts of alcohol.Cassie blaming herself for the best part of ten years for not being with Nina when the crime was committed, this would have been the first thing addressed by a psychiatrist.The Principle did not have the ""damming"" video, so her crime of failing to investigate and take action against the perpetrators is not the egregious event the movie presents.Cassie's repetitive action of passing out in a club to ""out"" predatory men, was demonising all men as Cassie's notebook had not a single exception. When in reality many men would have helped her, but this unfortunate fact would have contradicted the political overtone of the movie.When Cassie crossed the trust line with Ryan by dressing as a prostitute with a ""John"", it would not have been possible to recover this position to suggest otherwise is a contrivance.The movie was so overwhelming political the characters became superficial and ephemeral to the story that we really didn't care about them at all.The ending was more of shock value, Al did not murder Cassie it was self defence against a psychotic murderess who had drugged his friends to attack him with a scalpel.I did enjoy the movie but it's political conclusions were superficial and it characters shallow, Carrie Mulligan, (whom I dislike with a vengeance from that body part movie) was entirely convincing and her accent faultless. Whether she showed sufficient range for an award others will need to judge. Ryan played by Bo Burnham was brilliantly underplayed, and really acted as a good foil for Mulligan's ""weirdness"".Overall I can only give this a hard 7 as I felt no sympathy or engagement with Cassie as she was a psychotic nut job and instead we should have be cheering to the rafters her act of retribution."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 June 2021,7/10,"Carrie Mulligan does much of the heavy lifting in this film, she displays such a range throughout the film, from comedy to romance to horror. Also co-star Bo Burnham performance as Cassandra's love interest, Ryan was noteworthy. He's such a fun character. The soundtrack was great. I also liked the cinematography. There were some amazing shots with great use of angles and amazing use of colours and lighting. Although this film is effectively a dark story, the cinematography contrasts that with the use of brightness. However, I struggled to know whether we were supposed to be rooting for the main character. Of course she has my sympathy, but some of her actions throughout the movie were questionable. The fact that she puts herself in danger unneccesarily is bad enough; but she puts others in danger (even when she doesn't intend to). I found her character's behaviour unacceptable - even though we're supposed to be rooting for her. And I have mixed feelings about the ending. Overall, I think this is a good movie, although a bit overpraised."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,8/10,An innovative and all too relevant take on the dish best served cold genre as Carey Mulligan represents all women in the fight against the craven and cowardly who take advantage of and prey on the vulnerable.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,6/10,Fist off they don't form search parties this swiftly nor do they arrest those murderers quickly in real life. Cassandra was vengeful because her best friend from medicine school took her own life after being raped while she was too drunk. They both dropped out of school. She took revenge on the woman who testified against Nina like many others by having her get drunk and wake up in a hotel room. She showed up later on at her place to give him the video of Nina's getting raped. She also went to the attorney of the rapist but he was so full of regret already so she didn't hurt him. She showed up at the rapists' bachelor party as a stripper disguised as a nurse. She cuffed the rapist groom to the bed upstairs in the forest cabin. He uncuffed one of his hand and smothered her with a pillow. His best friend said it's not his fault and burnt her body in the forest. The schedule message sent to the seemingly good guy Ryan who said he knew nothing about where she might have been although he gave her the address of the party after Cassie threatened her with the video because he was also there watching her getting raped. The newly wed rapist murderer got arrested at the wedding. I liked it but it was a bit boring at times and such an annoying ending that I wanted to punch everyone in the wedding in the face.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 March 2021,9/10,"One of the best movies of the last 12 months, Promising Young Woman is at once a dark satire and a romantic comedy. Carey Mulligan is quite superb in the lead role with a fine supporting cast. The plot is one of revenge, no more needs to be said. The direction, cinematography, especially use of vivid colours works brilliantly together with a great soundtrack. No many movies stay in my thoughts days after, but this did. Watch this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 April 2021,,"There is no denying that Emerald Fennell's scabrous PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN gets under one's skin. In many ways it cuts straight past the intellect and attaches directly to one's emotions. It strikes the kind of wallop that almost defies critical thought. Almost.On the plus side of the ledger is Carey Mulligan. Her performance traverses so much territory that each individual scene presents her with a unique challenge. The supporting players are also adept at adapting to each scene's requirements. The art direction and music (including several pop tunes) are bright and candy-colored. There are sharp jabs and lines that deliver.On the downside, is the fact that all the positives can also be read as negatives. Fennell's writing and directing is tonally unbalanced. Mulligan's Cassie is almost schizophrenic, if not actually clinically so. The boldness takes away more than it adds to the message. There is no question that the misdirection is a large part of Fennell's intent, but, it's in a constant struggle with logic and coherence. There is little doubt that Fennell didn't expect that the movie be taken as fully realistic, but it also dulls the impact, since we are also asked to take Cassie's pronouncements as stone cold serious. The screenplay is biting without being genuinely witty. Cunning, but not truly incisive. The entire final act hinges on something that - while not a total coincidence - is extremely and conveniently serendipitous. Without it, the movie would collapse. And, Fennell writes herself in such a corner that she has to use a hoary old cliche (if in more modern guise) to get out of it and still leave on a high note.PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN to its credit, doesn't let the viewer off easily (particularly, men*). It forces you to sit up and watch. To experience. The climax of the opening sequence where Cassandra addresses the camera - the viewer - snaps you right to attention. I can foresee many more think pieces being written as the movie gets wider attention (its 5 Oscar nominations have already begun that process). Whether one finds the work fully satisfying is something that, more than usual, will rest with individual viewer.* It's interesting that some of the most scathing criticisms have come from women."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,9/10,"So this was excellent.Full disclosure though: had a less than ideal experience watching it. Entitled old ladies got really angry at me and aggressively shushed me back when I was like ""please be quiet"" after they talked multiple times throughout the whole opening scene.
Fight or flight kicked in, and I'm never a fighter when it comes to confrontations, so basically ran out of the cinema.
A 5-10 minute breather later, I figured I had to go back in, as it was the last chance to see this in a cinema, and I'd been wanting to for ages.Thankfully, the movie was amazing, and I'll revisit it soon and likely enjoy it even more without any annoying cinemagoers around. Honestly, might even end up being a 10/10.The direction is almost perfect, Carey Mulligan's performance is insanely great, the pacing never lets up with an immensely satisfying build to a powerful conclusion, and it handles the subject matter in a way that's hard hitting yet nuanced, never preachy, and also does so without sacrificing the entertainment value of the film (because it really is gripping, super intense stuff).I do owe 2020 in movies an apology. Films like Promising Young Woman really do demonstrate that even with so many big movies getting delayed, there still were a number of smaller scale ones to deservedly take their place."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 May 2021,9/10,"I heard quite a lot about this movie before watching it. In fact, I listened to a podcast that spoiled the entire movie. Despite all of this, I still found Promising Young Woman to be extraordinarily enjoyable and somewhat surprising. (Sometimes I don't retain certain details in a spoiler podcast discussion when I haven't seen the film and can't connect all the dots.) I loved the way that the main character was working out her demons and that it wasn't what it seemed at first. The entire plot defied what you'd expect from this kind of revenge movie, and did a great job of keeping the audience guessing. Carey Mulligan was superb in the lead role, and pulled off the nuance of a character who acts one way but is feeling different on the inside.The other thing that stood out to me about Promising Young Woman was the visual style of the movie. Everything was shot expertly, and the framing of the shots was also spot on. Likewise, I have to give a nod to the set designers as they did a great job of creating different spaces that perfectly fit the tone of each scene, and made them unique from other places we see in the film. I think the biggest complaint people have about the film is the ending. I guess I can understand how some people would rather not have the epilogue at the end, but being the type of film fan I am, it was just the kind of satisfying conclusion I wanted. All around, Promising Young Woman is an enjoyable film and deserving of the accolades it received."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,6/10,"I salute the effort to treat a topic too few movies are willing to tackle. But everything from the teasers to the promotion (imagery, posters, etc.) led me to believe the movie would push the concept a lot further than it did.. In the end I feel this would have made more of an impact if it had either gone a more serious/conservative and realistic route (some situations are quite implausible), OR the complete opposite, with someone being pushed over the edge and devolving into madness/violence a la Joker/John Wick. As it stands the movie is too middle of the road, not knowing what it wants to be, just like the main character and it left me unsatisfied."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,8/10,"Despite some weak performances and some badly developed moments in the script, this one is r4pe revenge perfection. It's smart, well-humored, and ironic."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 May 2021,9/10,"There was a time when a movie like Promising Young Woman (2020) couldn't be made because it deals with a difficult subject. However, in the wake of the #metoo movement, the narrative has shifted and allowed space for this eye-opening masterpiece to exist. Rape is never an easy topic to cover, but Promising Young Woman handles it with such blunt-force precision as to make itself required viewing, despite being difficult to watch. If it makes you mad, you should check to make sure it's making you mad for the right reasons.Of course, this film wouldn't work were it not for the excellent performance of Carey Mulligan. Mulligan has come a long way as an actress since An Education (2009). Her worn-out and tired portrayal of Cassie Thomas captures the essence of a woman who has made it her personal mission to teach men everywhere about consent. Equally strong performances from Bo Burnham and Alison Brie merely help to accentuate how solid Mulligan's acting is in this movie. Some may claim the deadpan acting is easy to pull off, but this context demands such an emotionless response that it couldn't have been done any other way without lessening its message.In the end, the message of Promising Young Woman speaks the loudest. Every excuse in the book is dragged out into harsh daylight to show how ridiculous they are. This is almost Monte Cristo levels of revenge here to show that, until rape happens to someone you love or care about, the weak excuses thrown about always protect those at fault and have no empathy for the victim of this heinous crime. The fact that Promising Young Woman goes to the lengths it does to debunk these claims should make us all think twice before denying justice for the victims of rape.A difficult but necessary destruction of the excuses of lack of consent, I give Promising Young Woman 4.5 stars out of 5."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,9/10,"Emerald Fennell's feature length motion picture Directing debut, PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN, is a difficult film to categorize. Is it a Dark Comedy? A RomCom? A family drama? A portrait of a character's descent? A hard critique of sexism and sexual predators? A revenge fantasy?The answer is - it is ALL of these and thanks to a wonderful script (by Fennell), strong Direction (again, by Ferrell) and a terrific, Oscar-worthy performance in the lead role (by Carey Mulligan) it is a very effective, very powerful film.PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN tells the tale of Cassandra who we are introduced to at a bar, obviously drunk, getting picked up (and taken advantage of) by a ""nice guy"" at the bar. Once back at his place, it is clear that she is NOT drunk and she confronts the ""nice guy"".To say anything else would spoil this wonderful film.At the center of this film is Carey Mulligan (deservedly) Oscar nominated turn as Cassandra. This is a tortured soul who is looking for some sort of catharsis from a previous trauma and seeks various ways to achieve this. You see an intelligence and sadness in Cassandra at every turn and Mulligan's performance seemed rooted in reality and was, ultimately, an effective, chillingly and (yes) sad character brought to life. It is the type of performance that I will be rooting for in the Oscar race, it's that good.Most of the other characters in this film fleet in and out of Cassandra's life but all are strong performances, seemingly willing to bring their ""A"" game to match Mulligan's performance and the strong script. Kudos to Jennifer Coolidge, Alison Brie, Laverne Cox, Bo Burnham, Christopher Mintz-Plasse (yes, a McLovin' sighting!), Alfred Molina, Moly Shannon, Connie Britton and, especially, the great Clancy Brown. They all enhanced the film with their performances, working off of Mulligan effectively.But, credit to all of this must go to Writer/Director Emerald Fennell (probably best known for playing Camilla Parker Bowles in THE CROWN) who's script is smart and thought-provoking and who's Direction is crisp and sure. She clearly had a certain type of film in her head - the type of film that does not easily lend itself to definition/classification and packs a powerful punch at it's conclusion. Without spoiling anything, she ""ups her game"" at the end of this film and I sat in thoughtful silence as the end credits ran.Fennell is up for the Oscar for both Best Director and Best Original Screenplay and I, for one, would vote for her Screenplay hands-down.An intriguing film that is sticking with me a few days later...always a mark of quality.Letter Grade: A9 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,10/10,"I was like very happy to watch this from beginning to end. I enjoyed the whole thing! I can't believe how good it was. I have to say the ending was so unexpected and made me feel like I was watching some hardcore Asian film genre with a dash of QT in it or something so cool, very very very nice. The ending is definitely one of the best anti-climax scenes I have ever ever seen. Number 2. I gave something number one and now I forget what it is but this is right up there surely! definitely! I really hope whatever this lady is doing, she continues on this journey of creating and directing and all that because she is def an all around filmmaker for real! Very very cool!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,8/10,"I wasn't to sure about this one before watching it, but the high ratings intrigued me. I am glad I went ahead with it. It's funny and dark. Very well shot in HDR and every shot well composed. The actress did a great job. I like the soundtrack. But what ultimate sold me was the very creative ending. The screenwriters could have been lazy and made a predictable ending, but gratefully they did not take the easy way out. The ending really did subvert my expectations. It is what made this film memorable. To future screenwriters, when tackling a common theme in film, this is the way it's done! Surprise the audiences."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,10/10,"Don't expect a ""thriller"" as so much a drama that has thrilling elements. Ignore the trailer.This film is fantastic. Storytelling at its best.Carey Mulligan is tremendous."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 May 2021,7/10,Just when you feel you know whats going on the final truth is far worse.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 December 2020,10/10,"REVIEW - PROMISING YOUNG WOMANMen can be scum especially those who prey on drunk women and basically this is the entire premise for the film.A women pretends to be drunk so she is taken home by a good semariton but the guy has other things on his mind, basically taking advantage of her while she is drunk but the story then delves into why she doing this and how she seeks revenge for a friend of hers.Great film and quite disturbing at times to see how men are / can be around women but especially good is how the entire story develops.Great film, great watch and definitely one to see.Rating 10 out of 10"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,10/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" sees Cassie (Carrie Mulligan) out to wage war on predatory men sexually asserting themselves on vulnerable woman in bars. But with the chance mention of a name, her mission takes on a whole new level and becomes very personal. How far will Carrie go to right a wrong?Positives:
Where to start! This is an astonishingly engrossing story from the multi-talented Emerald Fennell. It's rare to find a movie script where you have no idea in which direction the plot will take you. Some of the twists in this movie (no spoilers) are quite Hitchcockian in their execution. And Fennell cocks a wonderful snook at the 'Hollywood ending' that takes your breath away.Fennell also directs superbly, never letting the viewer get bored for an instant (the film doesn't outstay its welcome at only 113 minutes). The ""show don't tell"" approach shows respect for the audience's intelligence. (What happened after the boozy lunch? Who's voice was it on the video?) The use of 'chapter headings' as well is clever and reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino.And Carrie Mulligan! A simply stunning performance. What WAS that 'Variety' critic on about in saying she was ""not hot enough"" to play this role? Had he not fed his Guide Dog or something that day? Mulligan first drew my attention and respect when she was just 20 years old playing Ada in the BBC's ""Bleak House"": she had ""star"" written all over her. And so it has proved. Arguably - since there are so many stunning performances on her CV - this is a career best for her.Again reminiscent of Tarantino (and indeed ""Killing Eve"") is the wonderful use of music (by Anthony Willis). As well as some deliciously 'bubblegum' tracks (for example, one by Paris Hilton) there are some seriously ""out there"" choices. For example, ""Pearl's Dream"" (about the ""pretty fly"") is taken from the 1955 movie ""The Night of the Hunter"". It's haunting and evocative, reflecting the shattering revelation for Cassie within the story.Hair and Make-up (Angela Wells), Costume (Nancy Steiner), Cinematography (Benjamin Kracun), Editing (Frédéric Thoraval): all top-notch.Negatives:
For once, not a single one!Summary Thoughts:
Sex without consent is rape. A woman, intoxicated through drink or drugs, cannot give consent. The rules aren't difficult are they? Anyone who's been to a city centre bar or nightclub late at night will have seen - or suspected they've seen - this sort of slow-motion car crash in progress.This movie will inevitably be seen as the 'poster-child' for this aspect of the ""Me Too"" movement, and rightly so. And because the movie is so fabulous, it is inevitably going to have a positive effect in highlighting the issue.Those woman who have had these experiences (and I'm sure there are a LOT of them out there, many of who will have never gone to the police) will probably not want to be further traumatised by watching the movie. But, for everyone else. If the first five minutes make you feel queasily like ""this one's not for me"" then it's worth sticking with it. It's all done in good taste.One of the reasons this movie is so good is because of Emerald Fennell. What a talent she is! In acting mode, she plays Sarah Ferguson in ""The Crown"" and - in an uncredited cameo - the ""blow job make-up"" video blog lady in this. In writing mode, she's delivered the brilliant BAFTA-winning script for this as well as series two of ""Killing Eve"". And now in directing mode, she delivers this stunning directorial debut. She's even writing a musical version of ""Cinderella"" with Andrew Lloyd-Webber! (Come on love, you're just making us all feel wholly inadequate!)""Promising Young Woman"" is the easiest 10* movie I've rated in a while. And it soars straight to the top of my current long-list for my ""Films of the Year 2021"".(For the full graphical review, check out One Mann's Movies on t'internet or Facebook. Thanks)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 December 2020,7/10,"Its stark tonal shifts and uneven plot structure might be distracting at times, but Emerald Fennell's 'Promising Young Woman' consistently offers a powerful portrayal of rape culture and sexual assault with a narrative full of surprises. Carey Mulligan shines as the lady nightmare dressed like a daydream, constantly challenging the audience to rethink their perceptions of the character. Her performance is devilishly delightful to watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 August 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan stars as Cassie who left medical school several years ago under a dark cloud that is revealed as the film develops.One of the best revenge style films I've seen for a long time. The story is shot in parts that leads to a quite shocking crescendo at the end. Revenge can really be sweet.It deserves viewing and I can't spoil the full details.I first saw Mulligan in a 2011 film Shame, starring Michael Fassbender that deals with similar 'adult' issues to this film.In parts black comedy in other scenes psychological revenge. Reminded me of a Paul Verhoeven film in parts with the way the subject matters were psychologically shot in some scenes.The soundtrack involving several artists including The Spice Girls is good and is a good mix of several genres.Though primarily a UK production it was filmed in the U. S. Thinking about it that was probably a good idea because I couldn't imagine the film having the same shock effect had it been shot in the U. K.In the year of cinemas being obliterated this film was one of the best films streamed on the small screen and rightly was up for Academy Award Best Picture nomination.The director, Emerald Fennel also received awards recognition. Not bad for a debut feature!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 February 2021,9/10,"Films that make a statement and are done very well tend to stick with me for a while. Whenever big things happen in the world, movies about those topics are usually not far off. Promising Young Woman is the prime example of a film that very much needed to be made in today's day in age, but I wasn't expecting it to take things as far as it did. I will absolutely be replaying this film in my head when looking back at my favourite films of 2020. Reflecting on how this film plays out, there are some viewers who will probably hate the outcome of the finale, but I thought it worked very well for the most part. Here's why I believe Promising Young Woman deserves all the praise it's receiving.Haunted by her past, Cassandra (Carey Mulligan) makes it her mission to go after those who are unlucky enough to pop back into her life. For reasons I won't get into here, these people deserve to be in the spotlight, but this film almost plays out as a fantasy as to what should and shouldn't be done about this kind of scenario. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Mulligan's portrayal of Cassandra here, simply because her performance captivated me in ways I haven't seen in a while. She was both frightening and hilarious all at the same time. Her portrayal alone held my attention for the entire run time.Take what I'm saying about her character with a grain of salt though because I'm not sure if I felt sympathy for any of the main characters by the end of the film. The way this film chooses to reach its climax felt a little messy to me. I appreciated the message and agreed with it overall, but the way the final moments played out just felt off to me and almost anti-climactic. Still, I found the rest of the movie to be pretty spectacular, so the conclusion was honestly a minor complaint to me.Emerald Fennell both wrote and directed this film, and for a first feature film, I think she has made it very difficult to improve on her own work here. The statement she makes with this film, along with the razor-sharp subject matter, all tallied up to an incredible experience for me. I really liked the editing by Frédéric Thoraval as well, but I believe the cinematography by Benjamin Kracun was a big reason the editing looked so good as well. This is easily the biggest film he has filmed to date and I can't wait to see these framing skills continue.In the end, Promising Young Woman briefly suffers from a conclusion that I'm still unsure about, but am otherwise utterly impressed by. From the second this film began to the moments that made it seem conventional at times, it does a great job in keeping you guessing. Certain aspects of this movie play out as you would expect, but I would check your expectations at the door in terms of where you think the character of Cassandra is going to end up. This movie sucked me in and didn't let me breathe until the credits rolled. Again, I can't say it's perfect due to the ending, but I otherwise think this is one of the finest and most eye-opening films released in 2020. Promising Young Woman is now available on-demand."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"My Review - Promising Young Woman
My Score. 9/10
Some movie goers ,especially I hope a minority of male members of the audience who are taken to see Promising Young Woman will hate this film it has a real sting in its tale. I thought it was brilliant I went not knowing very much about the plot and you won't know much from me either as it would ruin its impact.
I went because I adore Carey Mulligan in my estimation she is the likely successor to Dame Judi Dench praise indeed I hear you say.
Just look at her roles so far on stage and film starting with An Education (2009)
Carey Mulligan's breakthrough performance where she was cast as a 1960s schoolgirl in the coming-of-age drama film for which she received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her leading role in the dystopian romantic drama Never Let Me Go (2010) earned her the BIFA Award for Best Actress. In 2011, she earned further acclaim for her supporting performances in Nicholas Winding Refn's action drama Drive and Steve McQueen's erotic drama Shame, the former of which earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 2013, she starred in Baz Luhrmann's romantic drama The Great Gatsby and the Coen Brothers' black comedy-drama Inside Llewyn Davis. In 2015, Mulligan was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in the Broadway revival of David Hare's Skylight. In 2018, she starred in the Netflix limited series Collateral and in Paul Dano's directorial film debut Wildlife. In 2020, Mulligan garnered universal acclaim for her performance in Emerald Fennell's thriller Promising Young Woman.
This is why as soon as I read that Carey Mulligan was starring in Promising Young Woman and the script writer and director was the brilliant Emerald Fennell who wrote 6 episodes of the top Rating series "" Killing Eve""and is also the actress who plays Camilla Parker Bowles in 7 episodes of The Crown and Elsa in The Danish Girl I had to see this movie.
All I'll say about the plot is it's a fascinating tale dark in parts humorous in others concerning a young woman Cassandra's repeated efforts to revenge her best friend
Nina who is now deceased . Nina and Cassandra Were both Promising medical students who left College prematurely. Both were Promising Young Women but due to the unwanted sexual advances put upon Nina when she was drunk and helpless . The resulting shame and humiliation had tragic consequences when the young men involved whose stories were believed and backed up by classmates meant Nina was branded as promiscuous and ""Asking for it""
Sounds very dark but don't be put off it was a coincidence I was thinking the character Cassandra played brilliantly by Carey Mulligan reminded me a little of Harley Quinn which starred our own brilliant Margo Robbie then I read that Margot Robbie was one of the Producers of Promising Young Woman.
Think Harley Quinn meets # Me Too this film isn't subtle in its message to men who don't take a NO or STOP seriously or think it's appropriate to prey on women under the influence of alcohol or drugs and take advantage of their powerlessness.
Even the title of the film is a reference to sexual misconduct concerning Brock Turner, a Stanford University student who was convicted of sexual assault in 2016. Despite his conviction, he was referred to by some as a ""Promising Young Man.""
There's some very good performances apart from Carey Mulligan's ,which I think is worthy of an Academy Award nomination. I liked comedian Bo Burnham who plays Dr Ryan Cooper a young man very keen on Cassandra and Jennifer Coolidge and Clancy Brown as Stanley and Susan Thomas ,Cassandra's parents.
This is a fine and I believe important movie it will polarise audiences who don't get it and delight audiences as it did this movie buff .
Congratulations Carey Mulligan and Emerald Fennell and everyone involved in "" Promising Young Woman """
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,4/10,"It's safe to say I'm out of line with my opinion on this one. But I do think, however, this really had potential that's as luminous as its fantastic glossy pastel colour palette. It's such a shame, though, the movie's handling of its subject matter is extremely heavy-handed. It seems to assume that by merely touching on the social issue in hand would be enough to solve it, something that's misguiding in itself. Moreover, instead of directing its energy at conveying its message, it unapologetically celebratory basks in its perfunctory manifesto without offering any real insights. Still, I believe it really could've been better, given the promising ""Dean Walker"" subplot in which we could see only a glimpse of the depth this movie, sadly, has forsaken for reveling in its underdeveloped premise with great panache. Props for the superb cinematography and the fact it's an enjoyable watch are due, nonetheless.(4.5/10)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 May 2021,10/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is an awesome film, a deep script based on actual events, it's time for gender equality. The performances are great, mainly Carey Mulligan's one, I could feel her feelings. The soundtrack is cool, the cinematography is perfect, the production design is beautiful and the direction is amazing. A beautiful sad film!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 April 2021,8/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Since Sundance 2020, everyone who saw Promising Young Woman never once stopped talking about it. From very early Oscar predictions to a guaranteed spot in numerous Top10 lists, Emerald Fennell's directorial debut of a feature film unquestionably impacted every viewer. As usual, I was able to avoid spoilers and managed to escape images, clips, and trailers. Right before the movie started, the only thing I knew about it was that it had a revenge arc. I didn't know what drove the protagonist to pursue this path or what type of revenge I was going to witness. Therefore, I was baffled by the amount of supposedly spoiler-free synopsis in well-known websites that give away so much of the character's motivations and overall narrative. I'm not going to do the same, but if you haven't seen the film yet, beware of these summaries.I needed a good night of sleep to process this movie. Fennell's screenplay carries many undeniably impactful moments that left me confused about what I loved and what I didn't enjoy so much, so I waited for my thoughts to settle before I started writing this review. Fortunately, I stand on the positive side for the majority of the cases, most being related to Carey Mulligan's character, Cassie. Several comparisons have been made with the latest version of Arthur Fleck in Joker. While I understand where these come from, the two characters couldn't be more different. Both character arcs are triggered by our society's despicable behaviors, but the protagonists follow a tremendously distinct path.One of the best examples is the depiction of violence in both films. Viewers will be surprised by the development of this topic throughout Promising Young Woman, contrary to the expectedly explicit murders in the comic-book movie. Fennell's film transmits a persuasive, eye-opening message about society's view of rape accusations and men's ability to somehow escape these troublesome situations partially due to the ""innocent"" compliance from our world. From ""the woman shouldn't have been drinking"" to ""they were young and naive"", these ridiculous excuses - and countless more - are inserted deep down into our society's mentality.People tend to judge the same situation differently depending on who's involved: men, women, straight, gay, white, black, family members, strangers... Fennell's exceptionally clever script develops this idea in a brilliant fashion that never stops being extraordinarily interesting. The absence of lazy exposition scenes elevates every dialogue, giving these an authentic, realistic setting. Every piece of information regarding a particular character's past or a plot-associated revelation is never filmed with the goal of explaining it in detail to the audience but instead as a natural progression of the story. This method of storytelling proves effectively intriguing throughout the runtime, culminating in a shockingly impactful third act.Once again, without spoiling anything, Promising Young Woman is one of the most unpredictable movies I've seen in the last few years. It hit me with a drastic turn every time I believed to finally figure out where the narrative was headed. Cassie is a fully-developed protagonist who sort of goes through a hero journey but doesn't really hold the characteristics viewers usually associate with that type of character. As I mentioned above, I needed more than twenty-four hours to interpret and decide which character actions I actually stand by and which go beyond the line of reason. Despite Cassie possessing emotionally compelling motives, some of her actions mustn't be taken as something that women should do.Fennell has tremendous care with the messages she's trying to spread, but the inconsistent tonal balance hurts this specific task. To avoid an eventual misunderstood, this film is genuinely hilarious at points, but the transitions between lighthearted, humorous, even romantic scenes and dramatic, emotionally heavy moments are far from perfect. On par with the extremely divisive last ten minutes of the movie, these are my main issues. I could nitpick a few sequences concerning Cassie's vendetta, but honestly, these are so insignificant and irrelevant that I neither want nor need to. Though, I'd have loved to see one scene where things don't go as planned by the protagonist during her introductory act.From the use of bright, rainbow colors - these pop off the screen - to the interestingly odd variations of popular pop songs, Cassie's arc is accompanied by an outstanding production design (Michael Perry), exquisite editing (Frédéric Thoraval), and a not-that-subtle soundtrack (score by Anthony Willis). Every technical aspect plays a vital role, including the excellent costume design (Nancy Steiner) and makeup work. Even the casting choices of actors who usually portray ""nice guys"" possess the significant purpose of warning the audience that dangerous people do not always look like dangerous people. However, Fennell and Benjamin Kracun (cinematographer) save the best for last.A brutally shocking, unforgettable two-and-a-half-minute take will leave every single viewer stunned and in awe of such a challenging scene to film. I can't express by words how much it impacted my viewing of the time left after this particular moment. It's a beautifully shot movie, no doubt about it. Every camera angle has a purpose, as well as the length of each shot. Fennell delivers one of the most technically impressive directorial debuts I've ever seen. Her fascinating storytelling and clear vision are qualities that I hope she'll never lose. It's an extremely risky story that Fennell never gave up on, and that deserves to be acknowledged and complimented.I could be here discussing everything and everyone, but in the end, Carey Mulligan is the most crucial non-technical element of the entire project. There aren't many actresses that could pull off this role as she does. In fact, she might be the only actress able to take Cassie to where Fennell really wanted. From her amusing facial expressions and funny one-liners to the emotionally draining, devastating scenes that Cassie suffers through, Mulligan shows a mind-blowing commitment to one of the best, if not the best performance of her career. If some viewers don't think her display was anything special, recall that two-and-a-half-minute scene I tacked on above? She did all of it, but that is just one of several reasons why she'll get nominated for every ceremony.Promising Young Woman holds one of the best directorial debuts I've ever seen. Emerald Fennell delivers a fascinating, unpredictable story that impressively subverts the (rape) revenge subgenre by brilliantly approaching our society's compliant, biased behavior in these sensitive situations. Despite some tonal inconsistencies, the astonishingly captivating storytelling leaves no one indifferent, especially during the ruthlessly shocking third act. From the weirdly unique pop song choices to the colorful look of the film, passing through exquisite editing and powerful cinematography, every technical aspect has an unquestionable impact on the movie's success, including the smart casting choices. Carey Mulligan is able to be extremely menacing but also quite funny, offering a career-best interpretation of a fully-developed protagonist with emotionally resonating motivations, but also with a dangerously elaborated arc that could transmit the wrong message for some viewers. The last ten minutes are... well, you'll have to see it for yourself. A well-earned spot in my Top10.Rating: A-"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,8/10,This smells like a trap.Who asks someone in that state for a drink?!You are gonna get orange liquid all over your couch.Your safe except for the raping!!!I assume it will be raining the blood of men.I'll get the check?!

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,8/10,"Unveiling the oppressive persuasion of Male-dominated Society, ""Promising Young Woman"" showcases an act of defiance against all the appalling misdeeds done to Women. Being a Revenge Drama at its core, it sets out to defy an incessant animosity residing deep beneath this patriarchate.""It's every man's worst nightmare, getting accused of something like that.""
""Can you guess what every woman's worst nightmare is?""Getting nominated in multiple categories across various awards all over the world; apparently, this feature has garnered a lot of attention! Presumably due to its rather dauntless display which mainly focuses on the plight of women. Fleshing out all the anguish & torment, they endure day in day out!Love the fact that it never goes overboard with such a delicate subject at hand. Even if a tad slower in certain places, Emerald Fennell; The Director been able to hold a pragmatic tonality all along. By dint of ostensible subtlety, the satirical incentives do come forth in a more efficient manner! Thereby leading us towards a chilling finale that I personally didn't anticipate.Regardless of my overbearing positivism, there are indeed some imperfections. For me, the indispensable part of the whole canvas was this close-knit relation between Cassandra & Nina. It must be acknowledged that the script assesses different pages of this affinity yet it doesn't seem enough as we barely get Nina's perspective here. Barring tiny details; there is absolutely no presence of her crucial character whatsoever!As per its technicalities are concerned, there is nothing to complain about. The clever use of Vivid Colors & Wider Angles does add up to its eccentric charm! The Background Score is seemingly relevant too. Relatively leaning towards contemporary tunes; better suited to the occasion!Talking about the performances, Carey Mulligan as Cassandra Thomas is simply remarkable! She resonates with an unsettling yet enticing aura around her. An imposing conviction in her eyes that captivates every time she's in the frame. For some reason, she did remind me of the Joker! And that itself is a great deal of praise I bet! However, if we keep aside her stunning contributions, others couldn't really match up. There goes another setback!Despite the implementation not being entirely perfect, let us not forget the importance & weight it carries. An imperative piece of art nonetheless!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,7/10,"An ambitious and audacious film, the director mentioned wanting to combine the ""horrendous and the humorous"" which in any film would be a challenge, more so here.The tone of the film thus is a challenge, but remarkably nailed at times. The colors in it, hint at the lack of extremes. Cassie's easter egg fingernails serve as a cross-over from her good girl to Goodbar tending in the nightclub scene.Carey Mulligan's performance is fantastic capturing the dichotomy in ways well beyond her wardrobe. She is not the only outstanding actor here, Alison Brie, Bo Burnham also stood out, interesting that they both may represent opposing sides in the ""argument"" although keep an eye on which side they wind up on.And really there should be no ""argument"" but the sexual double standard as an industry standard obviously persists. I cannot tell how much recently reading Chanel Miler's ""Know My Name"" affected me while watching this. Could it be Emarald Fennell wants to take some scenes in the film way too far because we should be outraged even when things go a little too far?Waking up the next morning, and considering the slap of the film helped me appreciate it more. One hopes that is the case for Chief Justice McLovin and many more. Alas, it does not bring Nina, and so many other daughters back.One other small note on the clash of extremes: the original soundtrack set against the pop numbers underscored the sense of uneasiness. And to be clear, it is an important uneasiness."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,8/10,"If you haven't watched 'Hard Candy (2005)' yet then you absolutely should. This film is essentially the same and just as good.This film is great, except for the ending. I really would have rated this film a 9/10 instead of an 8/10 if they handled the ending of the film differently, but that's really the only big critique that I have of the film: the ending is 'meh' and very abrupt.But the poor ending aside: The acting by Carey Mulligan is excellent and the overall pacing of the film is great as well. I enjoyed the film quite a bit, although I would have liked it if they actually showed more detail (like they did in 'Hard Candy (2005)'). Still, it's a must-watch for 2020 and one of the best films released in 2020. A solid 8/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,8/10,"A different kind of revenge story. Creative, twisted and with a very unexpected ending. It is dark and kind of cold but does have some moments of humor, often dark humor but it gets funny. At times. Its a nice mixed bag that actually works without being all over the place.
The most important reason that this recipe works is leading actress Carey Mulligan. She not only portrays a femme-fatale of the Me, too area no she also absolutely especaped her own stereotype. A great performance and surely one of her very best. There are some fine performances too like by Clancy Brown, Jennifer Coolidge and to a lesser account Bo Burnham who at times was a bit annoying but also had really good moments. The screenplay is well developed with fisty dialogue and quite a few surprises, also escaping the typical Hollywood formular.
The soundtrack is one of the best and most fitting of the year.
A really good indie turn with a leading actress performance that will go circles. Glad that Carey Mulligan finally got that role she deserves before almost fading away. Good to see she is back and stronger than ever."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 April 2021,8/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a revenge thriller film written and directed by Emerald Fennell. Starring Carey Mulligan in the lead role, it rises above the typical revenge fantasy to become one of the most unique and intricately plotted films in quite a while.As she approaches her thirties, former medical school student Cassandra ""Cassie"" Thomas (Carey Mulligan) struggles to cope with the horrific assault and death of her best friend Nina several years prior. Still living with her parents and working a menial job at a coffee shop, Cassie tries to fill the void by going out to nightclubs and pretending to be drunk so that when men try to have their way with her, she can sneakily reveal to them she was sober the whole time. One day, Cassie's former classmate Ryan (Bo Burnham) visits her coffee shop and asks her out on a date where he informs her that the man responsible for Nina's death is getting married soon. Using this revelation to her advantage, Cassie comes up with a cunning plan to finally enact retribution on the person who killed her best friend and ruined her life.Revenge films have remained a popular, albeit unchanged genre among audiences for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they allow the viewer the satisfaction of watching the victim gain the upper hand over the perpetrator(s) and secondly, they show how much a traumatic event can turn even the most mild mannered person into a force to be reckoned with. ""Promising Young Woman"" doesn't simply follow these tropes for the mere sake of telling a story, but also as an ingenious commentary on how modern society perceives victimhood and injustice for those responsible. Despite there being a multitude of proof that the culprit in question is responsible, it is shown that he has managed to evade punishment due to an apparent ""lack of evidence"", which sets things in motion for our protagonist Cassie in taking a more personal approach to bring him down. This echoes how things must be for many real victims out there whose pleas have fallen on deaf ears because of the negligent higher powers who do practically nothing to offer their assistance. Because of this, Cassie's vigilantism feels justified for the most part, as it is quite interesting to watch her piece together a brilliant scheme that is likely to be the fantasy of anyone who has had to go through what she did.Making her directorial debut, Emerald Fennell handles this film with a surprising amount of confidence. Of course, Fennell is no stranger to the industry, serving as a writer and producer for the hit TV series ""Killing Eve"", but I think she feels right at home here in the director's chair. I liked her use of symmetry throughout the film, particularly during a scene where Cassie is contemplating if she should move ahead in her relationship with Ryan, reflecting how she is in two conflicting mindsets over whether or not she can still trust men. In addition to this, Fennell also displays her abilities as a writer, showing that she has clearly done her research on the sensitive topic of assault and murder. Several characters throw around the excuse that they were ""just a kid back then"" as though being at such a young age completely absolves them of any wrongdoing, much to Cassie's irritation. Such an excuse must be tiring to hear for real victims who have to deal with the pain of what happened to them for the rest of their lives and it is moments like this that remind the viewer of why Cassie is carrying out her elaborate plan in the first place.After dropping off the radar for some time, Carey Mulligan comes back with a vengeance in the role of Cassie Thomas. Although her character didn't grab me at first, as she seemed like a sociopath who vents her frustrations on any man within her vicinity, I was pleased to see how over time she develops into a well-rounded and sympathetic woman whose actions become increasingly more fun to watch. It would have been easy for the film to have gone down the simple route of having every bad person be of the male gender, but we see that there are just as many women who are equally as responsible for the way events play out. Mulligan frequently shapeshifts her way through different costumes and makeup, some of which I didn't recognise her in right away, putting on a facade for any of the unsuspecting pawns in her scheme. Here, she demonstrates a range I never knew she had as an actress, which has me hoping to see more of her in future productions.As far as revenge films go, ""Promising Young Woman"" is one of the most memorable ones to grace our screens in recent years. This is mainly due to how it is able to transcend the cliches and provide something clever with its biting social commentary on our justice system. Whether something will result from it is anyone's guess at this point but for now, we should just sit back and enjoy this entertaining romp for all its worth.I rate it 8/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,7/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a psycho-revenger where 30yo Cassandra sets out to avenge her med school colleague, Nina (NPC), against a group of guys that sexually assaulted her 10+ yrs back during a night of drunken revelry. Carey Mulligan delivers a deliciously psycho performance as Cassandra who picks off those responsible - including femmes - one by one. It's enjoyable only to a point where you're like, really?!, how has she not slipped up or gotten caught esp since she still lives with her parents who are already suspicious of her activities. There is a twist near the end that brings some plausibility relief but the final wedding scene is wholly implausible since all involved would've been aware of the police investigation. Would NOT advise guys watch this with their gals, that won't end well for guys."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 October 2021,10/10,"This movie is phenomenal and heartbreaking. Unfortunately it can't bring back the innocent women we've lost along the way but God I hope it makes people think. Protect the women in your life. Stick together, watch your drinks and don't let anyone leave anything drunk. Shame on the reprehensible men who've harmed women and shame on the system that allowed them to. We need to do better. I'm choosing to look at this as a love letter to all the ""Nina's"" we've lost and to all the loved ones in their lives who can't go on without them. This one will haunt me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 March 2021,7/10,"I heard there was a surprise ending. I'm still waiting. Maybe if you never saw a movie before. That being said, this is a nifty little thriller. Carrey mulligan is very pretty, at times. Don't expect a lot. Hey, matthew."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,7/10,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*Promising Young Woman follows Cassie, a young woman who seeks vengeance against those that caused a tragic event in her past.Emerald Fennell tackles sexual assault with Promising Young Woman and she tells this story with an interesting aesthetic. The film has a very glossy feel to it with bright colours bursting from the screen. It's like you stepped inside a candy store. It makes the film look gorgeous and appealing to the eye. The film is consistently engaging as it paces well and it's largely due to Carey Mulligan's incredible performance. Her character has a lot of emotional baggage but her character doesn't really show it off and Mulligan does a terrific job finding the perfect balance to convey that. She could have overdone it but thankfully that wasn't the case. This just might be my favourite performance from her and I'm glad she got an Oscar nomination for her work here. The soundtrack is also fantastic. The song choices were interesting and I can see why Emerald Fennell went for songs like Toxic by Britney Spears. The songs were enjoyable even though they caused tonal inconsistencies. At a point you would hear or see some dark material but you would also see characters sing along to a Paris Hilton song. The score was decent even though at times it fell on the dramatic side. When the big reveal of Bo Burnham's character occurs, the score becomes louder for dramatic effect which didn't work for me.The ending is something I feel conflicted about. The film has an unpredictable quality to it and it ended in a way that I didn't expect. I liked it at first where Fennell takes a risk by killing Mulligan's character. I loved how it was executed, it left a cold feeling within me and gave me a moment of clarity as to how many problems there are in the world regarding this subject matter. However, I was quite disappointed when the film didn't fully commit to that ending by having Chris Lowell's character arrested. After some thought, this ending seems to also undermine the message of the film. We learn how the justice system failed Nina so it doesn't make sense to me as to why Cassie would rely on the police when they couldn't save her best friend. It seemed like the film was trying to have the best of both worlds but it didn't work for me.Overall, Promising Young Woman is a promising feature from Emerald Fennell. There are aspects to like, with Carey Mulligan being the best part, and there are areas to improve on."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,7/10,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, this dark crime drama combines several genres in an interesting way. It's controversial, alarming, and uncomfortable. This is Emerald Fennell's first film and she's off to a promising, young start.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Rape cultureTHINGS I LIKED:
Carey Mulligan is incredible in this movie. We've never seen her quite like this before. She's such a tremendous actress and also stars in a new movie called THE DIG, which premieres on January 29 on Netflix. She's sure to be nominated for an Academy Award.
The stylish color palette looks like candy. The bubble-gum aspect of the film really masks the dark subject matter in an interesting way.
It's very unpredictable.
I love twists and turns.
The story is divided by Roman numerals, making you think differently about each section.
The musical score wants you to feel a certain way, but I wasn't always on the same page.
Lots of cameo performances, including Molly Shannon, Adam Brody, Alison Brie, Max Greenfield, Connie Britton, Laverne Cox, and Jennifer Coolidge.
I actually liked the ending, although I've read reviews from other critics who hated it.
I love that more women are jumping into the waters of directing films.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie was marketed as a comedy. There was nothing funny about the content to me. I thought the behavior of most of the characters was horrifying.
The tone of the movie changes. Acts 1, 2, and 3 are very different from each other.
Everyone loves Bo Burnham, but I thought he looked way too young for Carey Mulligan's character.
The character arc takes the viewer on a journey that doesn't quite make sense.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,8/10,"I really liked this much more after my rewatch. I had many problems on the first view and now the movie really grew on me.Mulligan almost perfect (but that was already my conclusion after the first watch), a very good score, but I really liked much more now the screenplay and the directing, as well as the editing. One of my biggest complains was related with the pace and now I didn't feel that (even if I still think the 2nd act could be condensed in less 5-10 minutes)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 October 2021,7/10,I wasn't sure what the premise of the story was on first watching but it became clear that the lead actresses BFF while at college had been subjected to rape and as often seems to happen was not seen as a victim resulting later in her suicide. The writer took a different route in this story focusing on how this affected her best friend and the road it took her down to have justice which made for an unexpected ending .
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman is an absolute powerhouse of a film.It boasts a very unique and intelligent plot with a fascinating central character. Carey Mulligan brought this character of Cassie to life perfectly, with such a layered and captivating performance. There were lots of subtleties in her acting, but also some gloriously outrageous and powerful moments. The supporting cast were good, particularly Bo Burnham who had terrific on screen chemistry with Mulligan, but this is 100% her film. She takes centre stage and is truly magnificent.The story is very powerful and poignant, exploring the devastating effects of sexual assault and the predatory behaviour of men. Emerald Fennell played this film perfectly. Her screenplay found the perfect balance between addressing these issues with the severity they need and somehow making this film an energetic revenge thriller with strong elements of comedy and romance. There were a lot of balls to juggle, a lot of themes and genres to grapple with and she nailed it.I also don't want to spoil anything but this film builds and builds and builds into a mighty crescendo. I was toying with the idea of giving this film an 8 but the final 20-30 minutes propelled it into a solid 9/10.A terrific piece of cinema."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 February 2021,6/10,"It is a well directed piece with some good comedy and nicely dark in places. It is however torn by what it wants the audience to believe, some scenes are just laughable, whilst you can readily believe others. Unfortunately explaining further would give the story away and that never seems just, which is the irony of the film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,7/10,"What woman hasn't fantasized about doing some of this stuff or WORSE??
Wracking works great! Sadly, a lot of women forget that, and your perfume and hairspray can double as mace, even a damn bottle of Windex works. And sadly, there are a lot of females in higher positions who are happy to brush these horrible crimes against other women under the rug and use that boys will be boys BS line. So i REALLY ENJOYED how that was dealt with. Ha hahahahahahah ;D The ending wasn't what i was hoping for, but still a fun watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,7/10,"Interesting movie, using normally nice guy actors to portray the assaulters to give you that feel it could be anyone. Found the plan she had a little choppy on screens and her revenge of what was done in beginning. But overall a worthwhile watch of a creepy subject and revenge around out."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 August 2021,8/10,"Fennell knew exactly what women feel most anger toward predators and what point should be criticized the most. 'I was young', 'I was drunk', 'I didn't know anything', and 'It was a mistake' are INEXCUSABLE. 'Promising Young Woman' screams that we should put a stop to all the crappy excuses and the blame on victims. I understand in men's point of view, this movie can be uncomfortable because all men are villains in the story even the one we thought 'a nice guy'. However, as a woman, I face uncomfortableness every single day and cannot find the place to complain, yell, or just burst out. This movie does all this for me.Music in this movie is something. It increase the thriller aspect of the film. In the beginning, when she walks out from Jerry's place, 'It's Raining Men' by DeathbyRomy's voice forecasts ambiance of what's coming next for two hours. 'Toxic' played with violins and string instruments with a loud beat exactly when Cassie closes the car door makes audience reach the highest point of adrenalin. It sums up her confidence and attitude of no-regret and of bring the justice back.Mulligan's performance is applaudable. Cassie has gone through traumatic event even to the point of not being able to maintain her past life. However, she takes all the pain and sorrow inside while she looks calm and confident outside. What she went through is insuperable, but she does not overdo it, making pain more real and acute."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,8/10,"A young woman's campaign of revenge on the man's world. The film is a moral club, but it is also fun and wonderful entertainment. Carey Mulligan plays phenomenally complex and makes the film absolutely worth seeing. The female revenge on the educated man. Definitely worth an Oscar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,8/10,"A fascinating mix of (butt)cheeky feminist satire, incredibly tense vigilante thrills, and complex character drama (Mulligan chews licorice and scenery). Questions of justice and forgiveness are tackled at each level within an unpredictable, detailed narrative (see the contrast in address-procuring between Jordan and Ryan). Not everything works (Ryan's turn felt a bit unfounded; just the ""happy"" wedding would have been a more impactful ending) but the whole remains compelling. Great soundtrack.
7.5/10"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,9/10,"Promising Young WomanMovie 9/10An absolute scintillating performance by Carey Mulligan makes Emerald Fennell's twist on the revenge thriller all the more thrilling. This is Mulligan at her best delivering a performance that sometimes makes it hard for the audience to root for her character. The supporting cast are all excellent too delivering the superbly written dialogue with aplomb. Fennell's script oozes wit and sophistication. Only a few immature characters at the end of the movie seemed a little jarring. Almost as if they had been lifted straight from an 'American Pie' sequel. That said this minor discrepancy does nothing to harm the movies flow. This movie deserves all the accolades that are being bestowed upon it. It really is a treat for fans of good cinema and is a refreshing take on the genre.A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path. Taken straight from IMDB this synopsis sounds like a movie made countless times before. Fennell's film is anything but run of the mill. The premise maybe familiar but the execution is fresh, inventive and immensely gripping. The controversial ending totally worked for me and was the icing on a rather dark cake despite a few irritating characters that help deliver the movies climax. This indeed is a dark movie and our lead character is anything but a heroic. Her methods of revenge can cut a little close to the bone.Picture quality 7/10This film is dark in tone but not on the eye. The colour palette pops with vibrancy. Almost like the cameras have a candy coated filter. Available on Sky Cinema in the UK. Presented in 4K where available the picture quality is soft and cinematic. Not a 4K crisp image but one that does reveal a surprising amount of detail. Facial close ups look good and I think the eventual Blu-ray release will look even better. There's a fine layer of grain to the picture that gives it that big cinema screen feel.Sound quality 8/10The Dolby Atmos sound mix accompanying the movie is somewhat of a big surprise. This is not an action movie filled with effects but the sound mix is massive. Low frequency effects are really impressive. Bass gets deep. When Mulligan's character is leaving the nightclub at the beginning of the movie the bass will rumble your floorboards. The plot is delivered in chapters displayed by Roman numerals onscreen. Every time this happens there's a bass drop which is thunderous. Anthony Willis's score is also elevated by the use of Object based audio. The Atmos sound brings the score to the forefront. The choice of music is superb. From floor filling dance music to pop classics, music sounds great. Female Vocals on the other hand sometimes sound a little bright. Sibilance in vocals was sometimes an issue.This is a minor niggle. The excellently written Dialogue is always audible but sometimes unpleasant on the ear. Surround sound effects are unobtrusive. A more ambient mix than one to grab your attention. There's no precise effects moving from speaker to speaker.So to sum up 'Promising Young Woman' is an excellent movie and for AV enthusiasts this is a good looking movie with a surprisingly good Surround sound mix to accompany the drama.A film well worthy of your attention."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 April 2021,10/10,Favorite scene withCassandra Thomas (Carey Mulligan) - Her Revenge against Al Monroe at his Bachelor Party gone wrong - being suffocated to death by him.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,4/10,"I remember seeing this trailer multiple times the last few times I went to the movie theater before the pandemic started, and I found the trailer pretty exciting. I thought, ""Really interesting cast for this type of movie. This looks like it has potential, but it could go both ways...""Well, ummmmmmm, it definitely went one way, pretty intensely. Not in a good way. The characters are so hollow it almost feels weird to even call them characters. They all feel like parodies of stereotypical archetypes. The protagonist is fully unlikable, and it's the first time I've seen Carey Mulligan in a role where she's as such. Like. yeah, obviously she's ""fighting for a good cause"", except she does it in a really horrible, counterproductive manner. It's difficult to tell what the director intended for the audience to feel while watching this film. At first, it feels like it's supposed to be a fun revenge-style B-movie, but you quickly realize that it's almost never funny even when it tries to be and it has almost zero violence, so, it actually has none of the characteristics that would make a B-movie fun. I also figured it would be campy, but it's mostly camp-free as well. It feels like they attempt camp on occasion but it falls flat, especially because it's so seldom and does not match the tone of the rest of the material. I feel like the movie would work way better if these dudes were getting their heads chopped off. On a similar note, there are a lot of attempts of creating either tension or emotional resonance by way of very serious subject matter, but due to the fact that the characters and script are otherwise so one-dimensional, they mostly all fall flat as well. There's not really anyone on the cast who does particularly well with this material, but I'm gonna chalk it up more to the writing and directing here. I'm sure they did the best they could. Alison Brie probably did the best out of anyone, but she's only in two scenes.The last half hour was perhaps the only compelling part of the film, and the only part that features anything beyond surface level concepts. However, it had some pretty big plot holes IMO. You'd think the point of this film would be to make you cheer for the woman getting revenge on men, but the way it wraps up doesn't really give you satisfaction in that department, or any other for that matter. The wrap-up is intriguing and there were a couple of elements I was not expecting, but it also felt like it didn't actually make enough sense as an ending.So, not many redeeming values here. What I do appreciate about the movie is its ambition. Other than that, almost nothing. I would not recommend."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 November 2021,1/10,"They have drinks and there has to be a token there. It's 6:48am far too early for their kind in my face. Boring, uneventful and boring. Women need to take responsibility for their own problems. They cause all the problems anyway. This movie sucks."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 May 2021,10/10,I have seen in a while. So well done and deserving of it's awards.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 July 2021,8/10,"That old saying ""art imitates life"" is true enough, but what happens when the art that imitates life is less than positive? In 2020's thriller 'Promising Young Woman,' we see the ""Me Too"" movement personified - a complicated yet important story to tell on the big screen.What makes 'Woman' a standout film is its star - Carey Mulligan. It's fair to say the role of Cassie is Mulligan's career highpoint to date, as the actress brings to life the sullen, defeated yet biting personality of the med school dropout. Everything from her scratchy, sarcastic tone to her ""devil may care"" appearance is assembled masterfully.'Woman' succeeds on a number of fronts, from keeping viewers guessing where this runaway train is headed to leaving some details up to their imagination rather than spelling everything out verbatim. There are more than enough scenes that turn your stomach in ways you didn't think was possible. Of course, the grand finale is one that comes as a sucker of all punches, complete with camerawork that would make Hollywood's greatest cinematographers green with envy.No, it's not an uplifting film in the slightest, but 'Promising Young Woman' deserved its best picture nomination as an incredibly well done film that doubles as a commentary on the double standards that unfortunately still exist."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,7/10,"Vibrant looking movie with a sad and sinister undertone (in more ways than one). If you have seen the trailer, and you are interested in the topic, this is a movie worth watching. Moves forward at a good pace and more importantly, has a memorable ending. Saying more would probably constitute spoilers, and this is one of those movies that I wouldn't want to spoil because I really enjoyed it.
Good cast, lighting, sets and clothing. There's rarely a boring shot or well placed contextually. But more than anything, the emotional tone of the movie throughout is very very good.I was on the fence, but it is one of those that you are glad you watched by the end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 July 2021,8/10,Carey Mulligan is without a doubt the best actress of the decade. I've seen her in most her movies and her diversity is second to none. And the movie was great... she made it though.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,8/10,"This movie is very good, it has to fight the Oscars. The script is very original. Good performance by Carey Mulligan."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,So far this is my favourite film of 2020. The acting is perfect and the characters are spot on real. The story is too notch. The story is funny at times which is good the turn the hard subject matter into something entertaining to watch. They did a great job with the subject matter of the story. I hope it's nominated for Oscars but I have a feeling it won't. Overall it's an amazing film that everyone needs to see.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 July 2021,7/10,"This movie just gets crazier and crazier the longer it gets. Just when you think this movie finally calms down, it pulls a 180 in the best and worst way possible. The story is strange yet it still works. The acting is solid all around, and the main performance by Carey Mulligan is great. The film is also very colorful, which strangely works well with its extremely dark themes.But, there are some pacing issues in movie, but it's not so serious that it ruins the movie. There are also some major plot holes within the film. Like the entire ending of the movie being dependent on Al Monroe murdering Cassie when the odds of that happening are slim.Depending on who's watching this movie, it may be a 1/10, or it may be a 10/10. I generally liked the film, even though it's not exactly my cup of tea. There are also some great twists at the end, and the third act is absolutely insane. It's a 7/10 from me; decent enough for me to give it a recommendation."

Director: Emerald Fennell.Starring: Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, Clancy Brown, Adam brody, Jennifer Coolidge, Laverne Cox etcOverall rating 100/100Promising young woman is about a young woman called Cassie (Carey Mulligan) who is pushing thirty and still living at home. She is traumatised and defined by a hideous crime involving her best friend Nina. She seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path. Wow that's all I can say about this film, promising young woman was one of the best movies I have ever seen it was just masterfully constructed.First of all, I loved the cinematography and the script, it had a great dark and uncomfortable tone, a fantastic soundtrack and great usage of different characters to fulfil a different purpose. The cinematography for this movie was just incredible, the use of costume and props was unique and incredible, and there was just some incredibly creative filmmaking and shots that were so well thought out and interesting to see. I have to give huge praise to the screenwriter and director of this film Emerald Fennell because wow this was one of the best scripts I have ever heard. The dialogue was incredible. It was unique insightful and always had an underlying message that you had to figure out and there was some truly powerful lines that stuck with me, I was in awe from start to finish at the power and creativity that Emerald manage to construct within a script and I envy her talent. I also thought the movie managed to execute an excellent dark and uncomfortable tone, with the subject matter of rape and sexual assault the film was bound to be dark and uncomfortable in parts, but I was not expecting the movie to go where it went. I genuinely felt scared for Cassie as a character but every time a new guy attempted to do something to her it had the same impact, it was disgusting and extremely dark, but it needed to be shown as the events in this film happen too often in the world. I also thought that the movies soundtrack was absolutely fantastic, each song reflected the themes and tone that was within each of the scenes perfectly and really helped with creating a more intense atmosphere which I thought was amazing, the orchestral version of toxic will stay in my mind for a long time. Finally, I also loved that different characters served different purposes in how unlikeable they were, the different guys that Cassy targeted reflected different reactions and reasons for why guys think its ok to have sex without consent or to commit an assault, and I loved that each of the guys were incredibly unlikeable and served a different purpose which was bought out excellently with the dialogue.My next few positives would be the interesting main character, the character background, the chemistry between actors. The very important themes showed and finally the rising of tension. I thought that the character of Cassie was so fascinating throughout the whole movie, she was written so you were never truly sure of whether to support her actions or not but you understood how she thought and how traumatising it must have been for her and I loved being on edge about a character I personally supported her and sympathised with her character even when some of her actions were a bit on the edge of being reckless. I also really loved the character background for Cassie, they established her life really well, with still living at home at 30 with a poorly paid job and no relationship it really showed you how unmotivated and isolated she was as a character due to being so traumatised which I thought was really effective. I also thought there was great comedic and romantic chemistry between Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham, they bounced off each other really well they had a believable chemistry that came off naturally on screen and their relationship aside from the plot twist was really heart-warming in terms of the character development of Cassie. I thought that the movie raised so many powerful and important themes on sexual assault. The movie had so many layers to its themes, the way in which sexual assault is so easily brushed under the carpet or the man is so easily believed, and so often excuses and victim blaming is used and I applaud the film for showing all of these different themes so powerfully and sensitively. This is why I love films so much because they have a strong message and make you stop and think after watching and that's exactly what this movie did. Finally, I also loved the rising of tension as the film progressed and developed, the events and the plot twists kept on getting bigger and bigger and darker, each time making you feel more on edge and sympathetic towards Cassie as a character, the reveals were so shocking it really raised the stakes excellently.My next few positives would be the performances, balance of perspective, humour, heart-warming moments and finally, the great internal conflict created for Cassie. The performances from the whole cast in this film were fantastic, but of course the lead performance from Carey Mulligan was simply phenomenal. This for me has to be her best performance to date and she 100% deserves her Oscar nomination. The depth she gave to her character, the subtle nuances to her acting and the way she delivered her lines were just perfect. And the way she could slip between dark and happy was just incredible. I also really liked how they did balance out the perspective, in terms of implying and showing that not all men behave like a lot of the characters did. Cassie's father and a few other supporting characters offered a healthy balance to the dark message the movie was portraying. I also liked that the movie balanced its much darker tone with a funny and heart-warming tone as well, I think the relationship between Cassie and Ryan was really great and it was really sweet that just for a little portion of the movie Cassie had moved on and opened herself up a lot more which was a really great development to her character. Finally, I also loved the internal conflict that the movie showed with Cassie, the fact that she was so unwilling to be in a relationship with Ryan and her having certain trigger points was an excellent part to the first half, she was struggling to let go and stop isolating herself from her trauma and this internal conflict was well constructed and conveyed well through Carey Mulligans performance.My next few positives would be the teasing and execution of the character depth, the character development as well as the structure of the film. I thought the film did a good job at teasing the audience at more depth for Cassy, it shrouded the audience in mystery about her past and what happened to Nina which I loved it built suspense and it made the payoff when they eventually told us what happened that much better. The depth they did with her character was excellent, her character was so detailed in how she was written, the way she isolated herself from society and any men in fear of history repeating itself and her getting revenge on sexual predators and stopping people from committing assaults was so great. Her character went on such a personal journey of letting go of the past, but also making sure that everyone connected with Nina get's what they deserved and they both intertwined so well. How her character developed was excellent as well, this was largely due to how well the film was structured, it almost had different parts to it as her character progressed through the movie, switching from her stopping predators and learning to let go to the massive plot twist and the repercussions of that, it was just masterfully constructed and there was never a single dull moment.My final few positives would be the emotional weight, plot twists and incredible final act. The movie was actually fairly emotional in places, the heart of the story was someone who couldn't get over the loss of her best friend and couldn't let go of the past, her relationship with her parents really helped convey this when they reconnected when she learnt to let go and opened up to them again and it was often beautifully handled. I also loved the plot twists, the movie did an excellent job at deceiving the audience into believing everything was fine with Cassy due to her relationship with Ryan. But the twist with Ryan and Nina was unexpected and took the movie in a completely different direction which I loved. Finally, I thought the final act was incredible. It was intense, the soundtrack was excellent and despite the unexpected ending I thought it worked well. Killing off the main character is a controversial move, but they made it work through different props and visual technique and it was done to convey the bigger themes of the movie and for me worked excellently.Overall, promising young woman is smart, clever, and incredibly well written. Which has a career defining performance from Carey Mulligan. And its themes are so powerful and important to todays society about sexual assault of women and how its still to this day brushed under the carpet way too many times. This is why I love films so much, they have something to say and make you think during and after watching it, my favourite movie of the year so far and for me one of the best films I have ever seen."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,,"Promising Young Woman is a daring mix of a handful of genres - part revenge flick (think Kill Bill), part bubble gum flash piece (think Edgar Wright), part black comedy, part rom com - this movie swirls together several genres into a wild ride with plot twists and turns I didn't see coming. I found the climax of the film to be particularly risky, and the risk pays off. The cinematography was harsh at times, though I think this was the intended effect. The film never seems to let up and let you breathe, even calm scenes seem bubbling with chaos or darkness. I am happy this film got nominated for Best Picture."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,7/10,"Decent enough dark thriller about a important subject matterCarey Mulligan was good in the main role, though American accent was slightly annoying . Support wise Bo Burnham stood out."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 October 2021,4/10,"I watched the movie predominately because of Carey Mulligan. She is a wonderful actor, and does a great job on this. I also enjoyed Bo Burnham's skilled performance. Unfortunately the other actors did not do a particularly great job, and the plot was so thin.I could not wait for the movie to be over."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 August 2021,9/10,"All around. Not much left to say. Especially from a first-time feature director.Very original, especially omitting her doing violence on the men. I expected that to be a given. The grey areas of the characters were more and more intriguing the more I thought about them.Felt a bit rushed and melodramatic in brief places after the romance began. The morning after she's killed played as lightly comedic, which I found odd. But his kicking and trashing around on the bed was comedic, too. And the brief scene of her being cremated (nudging her hand back into the fire). I really didn't feel the ""horror"" of it all others have expressed. (I eventually thought she planned for him to kill her.)Didn't mind but was sure it would be male-bashing all the way. Not really. The bad guy(s) really were not as classically bad as I'd expected. Actually felt like it was forgiving of the men in their early 20s when it shouldn't. Being that it was written by a young woman, she couched the relatively short time between early 20s and being 30 as far longer. (As she's 35 NOW, I'd assume she wrote it no later than early 30s.) As if the age difference was huge. But I felt the same, I suppose, when I was that age.Her doctor love was a nice guy and the lawyer was contrite. The actual rapist, also, repeatedly attempted to do ""the right thing."" In the end, her actions seemed excessive vs the attitudes of those characters. Odd as she so readily forgave the lawyer and not the two younger men.Although it wasn't shown (but heard), the rape scene asked a lot of questions. (Glad it wasn't shown.) We hear the sympathetic doctor shocked but not alarmed at public sex with a drunk woman. At that age, I might also had that reaction if I was also drunk. I would find it garish and obscene at the time, but not sure I'd figure out it was rape. I would question it, but wouldn't find an answer. I never went to a 4-year college and wonder if it was accurate and more common than I think. I hope not. (And was also mitigated by a female character and bringing up the heroine's sexual activity at the time, too.)It might require some further thought on the subtext or it was so perfectly accidental."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 November 2021,4/10,"This film is ridiculous, not believable and the acting is terrible!!!! The protagonist comes off as a whacko and a parent's greatest fear. She's a TERRIBLE actress. The script reads like a bad lecture about bad people. I only watched it because of the ratings. What's the matter with you people????"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 March 2021,10/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Well done Emerald in her directorial debut. And I am not surprised for her Oscar nomination, a damn shame that she did not win it. I am sorry but only idiots can criticise this movie! How stupid to bring Margot Robbie into this by that idiot film critic!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 March 2021,7/10,"Unique story, refreshing to to see something different."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 January 2021,6/10,"While this is a decent film, I went in thinking it was horror, as I saw it advertise on a horror feed. It's not a horror at all, it's not even really a thriller. It's more like a dark comedy with this really quirky soundtrack. And although I liked a lot of the ideas running through this....there could have been so much more done with this film. It could have been a bit edgier, a bit darker. So many famous people in this film who have like 10 mins screen time which was a waste.The ending was quite unexpected and I did like that. It wasn't a typical happy ending situation which was good."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 May 2021,8/10,"A revenge movie is nothing new, and this movie's awareness of this makes it both better and worse off for it. Choosing to update the format to include a modern, nuanced concept of sexual assault was a clever turn. Even though it's a very ""of the times"" topic, it's still a very vital point worth making, and the movie handles the issues with class. It also sets itself apart from it's predecessors by having a more lighthearted feel throughout. Much of the movie focuses on the possibility of redemption for our protagonist and keeps the violence to the bare minimum. In the end, instead of delivering a final satisfying bloodbath, it offers something more bitter sweet, which may be subversive, but just isn't as satisfying."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 May 2021,8/10,Wow - an acting masterclass from Carey Mulligan. And if this film can make one person think twice about taking advantage of someone who can't defend themself it has done it's job. But it's a lot more than a film that sends a powerful message. It is sinister entertainment at its best. Wonderful.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,7/10,"This film had me, then lost me, then totally grabbed me again... and right at the end, completely lost me a second time. Carey Mulligan is terrific. The visuals are superb. The plot is, at times, absolutely riveting. The message is one I agree with wholeheartedly. However, the contrivances, especially in the final 10 minutes, are so absurd that it became laughable. If the film had had the courage to end before the big ""satisfactory"" reveal... it would have been far more powerful."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,6/10,"I was never really interested, some interesting ideas are prodded here and there but only one is explored further than a line or two, the moral dilemma Cassie is facing throughout the entire film, this is easily my favourite element to 'Promising Young Woman'.I like most of the performances, the rendition of 'Toxic' was really fun and the use of pre-existing music added a layer of irony it needed, I like how Cassie's trauma is presented, it's quite tasteful and could have easily been played as a bit of a joke. Finally I also think the commentary on how women are generally viewed, mostly by men and how so many people (of all genders) feel completely fine shrugging off or making excuses for terrible acts committed, having this message doesn't not mean this movie is exempt from criticism.Now the bad things. Lots of the supporting cast are bad, Alison Brie is absolute trash and so is Chris Lowell. The sound mixing is dreadful, some of the worst of the year and the presentation of everything is so overdramatic and irritating. The plot never progresses organically, something fairly unlikely has to happen in order for the film to actually take a step forward, there are also quite a few continuity errors, the most obvious one if that during the close up of Cassie's necklace the smooth edge of it is facing the right, and when she's just wearing it walking around casually the smooth edge faces the left.Despite being fairly conflicted about it I'd still recommend 'Promising Young Woman', it's pretty easy to like if you're not like me and don't get pissed off by small details or when there isn't background noise at the restaurant."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"I've been watching a movie a day since the new year, and ""Promising Young Woman"" is no doubt the best film that I've seen thus far. Starring Carey Mulligan with a powerhouse of a performance, ""Promising Young Woman"" has everything movie lovers dream of. Let's break it down!First things first: Carey Mulligan is phenomenal as Cassie, a young woman who seeks to punish those men who would take advantage of too-drunk girls at a bar. Cassie hides a deep, deep layer of pain behind her beautiful exterior, and Carey Mulligan is so good as a woman who hides that pain to everyone she holds dear, expressing it only when she decides to put hurt on others. Cassie is laser-focused on something very specific that guides her every move - she seeks to find catharsis through being judge, jury, and executioner, but more than that, it is obvious that she wants to find a way to move on, perhaps by herself, or perhaps with someone she can trust and love. There are a lot of layers to Mulligan's performance, more so than the one-note trailer would have you believe, and she's riveting to watch navigate through the movie's color-soaked climate.Yes, this movie pops like lip gloss, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. Vibrant, lush colors fill the frame, casting an almost fantastical feel to the film. From neon reds and pinks to bright greens and subtle pastels, colors bathe the screen, coupled perfectly with a delightfully poppy soundtrack. Music from Charlie XCX and Paris Hilton will grace your ears, all very catchy and upbeat, contrasting perfectly against the tragic subject matter that the film deals with. It's all very purposeful and tongue in cheek, and makes ""Promising Young Woman"" a total blast to watch.""Promising Young Woman"" may focus on Cassie, but it also centers around the lives of multiple other characters that Cassie knows in some capacity. Old friends and old enemies make their way into the plot, with mostly shocking results. One thing I loved about this movie's story is how it handles its revelations; nothing that is revealed to the audience feels like its shock for shocks sake. Every beat progresses naturally and is portrayed perfectly. Also, this movie does an exceptional job of constantly subverting audience expectations in a way that doesn't feel cheap or thrown in. My jaw dropped at multiple points due to an unexpected twist; similarly, I found myself sitting up, white knuckled when a scenario suddenly started pivoting in a direction that I did not expect and could not predict beforehand. This is a thriller in the truest sense of the word, and from the first scene to the last I was on the edge of my seat.There's so much more I want to say about this movie, but I cannot divulge much more without going into spoilers, so I'll just say this: Before going into this movie, I heard complaints about its end. Of course I will not say what happens, but I will say that, while I didn't expect or necessarily want the movie to progress in the way it does, everything wraps up in such a satisfying and true-to-form way with the beats that the movie sets up, and it didn't detract from my enjoyment whatsoever. In fact, some of the film's most memorable and exciting sequences happen toward the last act - so if you're in any way on the fence about watching this movie because of things you've heard about its ending, don't be; in the words of Luke Skywalker, ""This is not going to go the way you think,"" and in my opinion, things didn't go the way I thought in the most thematically satisfying and entertaining way possible.""Promising Young Woman"" deals with dark, disturbing topics in a way that is suspenseful and thrilling, but ultimately relentlessly watchable and entertaining. Stomaching the subject matter may be difficult, but if you can do it, I really think you'll have a great time with this one."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,7/10,"Hmmmmm.I like a lot about this, but I also really need to think about it more. I mean, for one thing, it's not exactly hard to figure out that I, a straight cis white dude, am not the target audience for this.But I still get what it's saying, and I liked a lot of what it was saying...right up until the end. Upon getting to the last 20 minutes or so, I have no idea what it's saying. Without spoilers, at first I thought it was actually a pretty clever commentary on how rapists nearly always get off scot free, maybe in a way not everyone would like, but that's how I saw it and I thought it was actually really brave to do that.Then the actual ending happened, and I was very confused. Maybe I would never completely get it unless I was a woman, but it seemed to walk back on everything that I thought was really clever from the last few minutes.So I'll stick to the stuff I can be sure about - Carey Mulligan is awesome in this, while everyone else is...good and not really much else, but she makes this film. While I didn't think it was directed amazingly, the cinematography is really great, the colours really pop in a gorgeous pastel aesthetic that suits this story perfectly.However, while I like the story, it could maybe stand to be a bit more subtle. The pharmacy scene was ridiculous, the opening scene has a bunch of creepy guys literally saying ""she's just asking for it"", and other lines include ""it's every man's worst nightmare, getting accused of something like that"", and ""you're not even that hot"" upon being rejected. Like, yes, we get it, bad excuses for rapists and fragile male egos.And speaking of subtlety, goddamn is the music obnoxiously crammed into some scenes that don't need it at all, and especially don't need it to be so bloody loud.So yeah, I'll need to think about this more for sure, but I definitely like it. I could like it more, I could like it less, I don't know. Either way, if you're hoping for it to win Best Picture, um...you probably aren't that familiar with the Oscars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 April 2021,8/10,"Great job by director Fennell because this is her first feature film. Almost unbelievable. A special and original film, with interesting topics, but also genres, or better to say combinations of genres. The film is shocking and not easy for me to watch, and it contains virtually no visual violence, which speaks to the great work the director has done, and the script is also top notch. The downside to the film for me is that all the male characters are made on the same mold, and some scenes literally scream feminism."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,9/10,This was not what I expected! That is good because I am rarely surprised these days.The part that sticks with me is Cassandra's relationship with Ryan... how a ghost from the past destroyed them... And how it goes to show you do not know who you are with no matter how much you feel you know them.The film also begs the question... Are we who we are regardless of passing time? Do people change? Do they??Highly recommended!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 November 2021,5/10,"Director Emerald Ferrell creates some devistatingly brilliant visual imagery and pairs it with a great soundtrack. There are some terrific one-liners that would make great skit punch lines. But the narrative is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The ending is so bizarrely brilliant and ultimately almost makes it all worth it but not quite.This film tries to follow the perspective of someone who was traumatized from her friends rape and eventual suicide. It unfolds in a manner that you are not sure whether it is going back and forth in time and it's hard to stay with. As it turns out, the movie's trailer was a tease. She's not as lethal as it looks throughout - She vents her rage within more than getting any actual revenge . Until she does - but getting from Point A to Point B to Point C is more visceral than believable.Many people thought Mulligan should have won best actress for this turn for the way she changes personas. I thought she 75% pulled it off but not quite completely. Certainly worth watching for your own perspective. To me, I was alternately entertained and frustrated - which may be just what Director Ferrell was going for.Brilliant art? Perhaps so. Do I ever want to watch it again? No, not me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 January 2021,6/10,"Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman is one of those films where I must ask a few questions of its admirers. This is a movie I've seen listed in the ""Good for her"" collection, where pictures like Gone Girl and last year's The Invisible Man also appear; movies that are loved because they feature once-downtrodden women exacting gruesome revenge on their abusers - and by extension, the proverbial Patriarchy.People are free to love these films for whatever reason they see fit, but it does make me ponder: what did these movie-goers think of films like Joker? Are they the same journos who claimed that Joker either ""glorified violence"", or (if they recognized that Arthur Fleck is decidedly more than an entitled white guy written for right-wing incels) tacitly held the problematic belief that marginalized groups are serial killers waiting to happen? If so, why are they not similarly afraid of the effect that Promising Young Woman might have? (Armond White worries this movie is gonna have the same effect as Breaking Bad, which apparently ""condoned twisted revenge"".)Obviously, Joker didn't lead to any violence - even if both the 2020 BLM riots and the recent Capitol coup bore some resemblances to its climactic events, which is part of the film's ACTUAL points about radicalization and perceived justification (and the reason both sides are certain it's either lampooning or celebrating the other). I don't think this one will either, mainly because the character of Cassie Thomas (Carey Mulligan), like the Joker, isn't written as wholly likable or excusable, even as we understand what sort of system created her. There comes a point where she's well over the line - even for those who may initially admire her.The third act also makes me wonder why someone thought this was a ""Good for her"" movie. Is this really a happy ending that communicates no wrong-doing on the part of Cassie? Could such a case be made? Could this movie (judging by Cassie's more zealous fans) prove to be a 13 Reasons Why scenario, where the work actually did lead to horrible things? I suppose I won't spoil too much.I'm yet to fulfill my main mission, which is to talk about how good the actual movie is. Having just finished it, I don't believe it's gonna be too harmful, nor is it bad! The opening made me fear for the worst, but I soon began to enjoy its editing, visuals, musical choices (featuring such composers as Wagner and XCX), and central interactions.And yes, the characterization of Cassie Thomas is more multifaceted than it might have been. She dupes men into taking advantage of her by feigning inebriation and then punishing them accordingly, believing herself to be going against the system that destroyed her best friend many years ago, but it becomes clear that her catharsis won't come until she attacks the true source of her torment. After a particular turn of events, she gets her chance.It's ultimately an original and engaging story with fascinating characters and conflicts. Mulligan is consistently believable, even at Cassie's less sensible moments, and she has perfect chemistry with Bo Burnham when Cassie's life seems to get brighter. Supporting players like Clancy Brown, Jennifer Coolidge, Alfred Molina, and Alison Brie are also very good, never going as cartoonishly black-and-white in their depiction of the ""gender wars"" as some audiences feared (see Armond White again).Some characters (many of them male) are strawmen and caricatures, yet I still feel like this movie does a more honest job than most. The first scene in which we see Cassie fool someone is too rushed, and the ""nice guy"" archetypes being mocked are the kinds I've already scene parodied in 2013 Tumblr memes (same with Christopher Mintz-Plasse in a later scene). If her first victim seemed more convincing in his friendly façade, and maybe if the promos hadn't spoiled what Cassie actually does, imagine the punch we could've started on.The tonal shifts in Promising Young Woman will be jarring to some, but critics like Brian Tallerico insist that this is intentional, reflecting Cassie's mental state - dealing with trauma can be quite the rollercoaster indeed. That said, there's too much whiplash in certain scenes. And yet, I'm certain that you'll remain entertained. Just try to remember that the Cassies of the world might not be the answer to the system; just a result of it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 October 2021,8/10,"This film portrays a perpetual cycle of damage. Damage leading to damage and round and round. It left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. None of the main characters including her parents will escape it until they die. For me it wasn't a comedy after I completed the viewing. It would be a comedy from the perspective of intelligent aliens looking down upon our fragile little minds though.Well done filmmakers, and thanks for the reminder. We have to be nicer to each other in this world :)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 April 2021,7/10,"Perhaps I was expecting too much after reading much hoopla, but while this will certainly hold your attention from beginning to end as it's hard to guess what is going to happen next, I was a bit disappointed. It's original, but I thought some of it, particularly the ending, to be rather preposterous. The performances are good, especially the two leads, Mulligan and Burnham. Mulligan is always very good or at least good & Burnham is a real charmer here. It has a very relieving & uplifting section, but when all is said and done this is a movie in which nearly every major character is destroyed in some fashion. Can't really say it's a downer though as most of them deserve it in one way or another."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,9/10,"The first challenge I find writing this film review is in what movie category to place it in, according to IMDb this is a Crime Drama and a Thriller, yet the plot is similar to the Horror sub-genre of Rape and Revenge. But unlike its predecessors, this particular film does not rely on nudity or gore to be shocking, the subject matter is real enough to be shocking, which makes this film nothing short of amazing in my book.Carey Mulligan shines in the lead role of Cassie, a med student who dropped out of college due to a traumatic event, and writer/director. Emerald Fennell has an astounding storytelling talent, as the film captures you from the beginning, and the plot is shrouded in a mystery so captivating it will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end.There are movies that beat you over the head with their message, and there are stories so compelling the message shines through, and this powerful film is definitely one of the latter, and even though some scenes can be frightening, every one should watch it, as it is a great film with a lot of things to say."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,10/10,"This movie is just insanely good. In a sad/dark way, it's for 70% of the time a ""oh my God, the world is full of jerks"" mind boggling good kind of movie. But, good Lord, the movie is awesome.Ok, I will try to call down a bit. Let's start this.First, just the atmosphere of the movie is incredible, the use of color most of the time, makes you feel like they are jumping out of the screen, and you just get transport into the world from the jump. Great cinematography, as really most of this year's Oscars nominated are, but with its own and unique style that I loved.The acting is phenomenal, Carey Mulligan... man, I mean, she's fantastic. You feel the weight of Nina's story from the first times she is mentioned in a conversation, just through Carey's performance here, you are, as the jerks in the bar, easily fooled into thinking she's really drunk in the first scene of the movie, all throughout you get at the same time empathic for her, but you are also scared to death lol. Such a well written character, with so many layers to it. Amazing.And honestly, pretty much everyone here is great, Alison Brie is awesome as always, Alfred Molina, and even McLovin himself, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, is here, been awesome. Great cast.Bo Burnham tho is also amazing, and his character in a weird way, sort of is a mix of most of the things about this movie that got into my core the most (in a good way). Cause, for the most part of the movie, you really like him, he's a great dude, you are happy they are happy, and, well, I will have to say pretty early on I was like ""yep, he's gonna be involved in the raped in some way"", but man, it's just heartbreaking when you see the finale plays out the way it does, that, with Cassandra been killed is just like ""holy moly, we do really live in this world, right?"". And it's a gut punch, but I know that was the point of the whole story, and well, they couldn't have done it better.At the end of the day, the movie's story is powerful, it manages to throw a light in... well, how messed up the world can be constantly, if you really stop and think about it. It has such a freaking bittersweet ending, cause, well, she's murdered, I think Nina... killed herself? That's at least implied, basically every single man there is a sexual predator or something similar, but, it manages to also leave a little bit of hope at the end of the tunnel, cause, they are almost certainly all arrested at the end, which is great, and through the Molina's character, that doesn't really have that much screen time, the message is like ""ok, you will probably never be able to repair the mess you made, but that doesn't mean you can't regret it, pay for what you've done, and start been a better person moving forward"". Which is honestly all we can hold on to, while thinking about the things this movie makes us think, we can do our part, impact people positively so they do their part, and hope that, even the jerks out there, at some point become a better person, hopefully at a point when it isn't too late.So, yeah, the movie talks about some really screwed up stuff, but it manages to keep you on the hedge of your sit the entire time, even tho I sort of figured some of the story points earlier (like Ryan been involved in the rape), I was blown away but other stuff that I couldn't ever see it coming, like her actually dying at the end, and you go ""wow, well, that's dark af, and I guess the message will truly be 'the world sucks, and there is no hope'"", but then... boom again! The lawyer redeems himself, and Cassandra, in a dark, and truly awful away (cause, well... she was murdered) get's the last laugh, and her friend finally gets the justice she deserved. And, even tho the world still sucks, there are half of dozen less jerks out there (plus the other dozens of jerks she hopefully made rethink their actions during the movie).Also, I almost forgot, the soundtrack is amazing! The instrumental classic version of Toxic... man, when that plays, I was, like, ok, that's creepy af, but captures so well the movie's vibe.I get the criticisms I saw some had with the ending, and... well, sure, you clearly need to have a suspension of disbelief, if you will, that her text messages would arrive, at the same time the cops would, and in such a dramatic way lol, but I mean, is such a small detail, and, the fact that I respected everything the movie had done up to that point, and the message It was making, I'm fine with it, and it doesn't bother me at all, in order to change the score or anything.So, to sum up, I loved this movie, I love the atmosphere of it, I loved the performances, the directing, the script, and of course, the message here is truly powerful, important and a hell of a sensitive issue we must talk about it constantly. It's insane that this is Emerald Fennell first feature film, this is incredible."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 December 2020,7/10,"Wow !! I do really mean wow. I personally don't say that often after a film but ""Promising Young Woman"" definitely left my jaw dropped. This is the sort of film that is 100% needed in our times whether you like it or not. Even more sad is the fact that I feel this might be divisive, it shouldn't be, instead it should be commended for its brutal honesty about really really dark subject matter.Lets deal with that first, the subject matter of the film which more or less covers sexual abuse. This film delves deep into how young men take advantage of young women in such a simple and honest view. It is written so well that this film isn't banging you over the head with a feeling of pity but with a strong message of people should be waking up to reality. It is 100% not lecturing on just why men are all bad (although yes a lot of us are) it looks at both men and women's reaction to this topic, its a societal problem. Some fantastic scenes involving Carey Mulligan and Alison Brie. Be warned this film is dark and then you think it cant any darker the final act is just.......*insert chef's kiss*......I don't know how else to describe it. I thought it was bold, shocking, totally unexpected that this film had a dark ending. So pleased it did because it served the characters extremely well.Other positives. I would say the this might be the best film I've seen Carey Mulligan in. Its not so much that the character demands a lot, its just a real breath of fresh air to see her do something very different. She carried the film from start to finish and you, as an audience member, become very attached to her very quickly. I really hope this is the start of her doing more out going roles because in years past I've always thought she was a safe actor. Mulligan has always been solid but I've never seen her challenge herself, until now.I do have one problem with the film and although after seeing the ending it isn't as annoying in retrospect. There is an attempt to build a romance between the lead character and one of her old school friends. For between 10-15 minutes the film almost completely changes into this romantic/comedy which really really didn't work. It was almost like a completely new director and writer had been allowed to shoot a scene in the film. It stuck out to.......something about it didn't fit. Thankfully though it turns out the ""old school friend"" wasn't as good as he seemed. A sheep in wolves clothing. I'd say thats a big part of the film, trying to challenge you of what ""being a good guy"" actually means. All us guys think it but we need to look in the mirror and actually prove we are.Overall I surprisingly really enjoyed it especially the ending..........please please wait until that last 30 minutes because it is the best part of the film. Carey Mulligan was terrific in the role as Cassie, to be honest I think the film was cast really well overall. As I've mentioned before though in the divisive/tribal times we live in, I think people might just label this film without giving it a chance to example itself. It has a brutally honest message about something extremely horrible and real. We all need to listen. 70% out of 100%, I'd definitely recommend it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is a stunningly original revenge drama that shocks you, offers loads of dark humour and the same time makes you reassess every mildly sexist or politically incorrect statement/thought you have made/had in your life.Director Emerald Fennel turns the mirror on all of us, ripping her narrative right from the headlines of famous sexual harassment stories happening around us.Carey Mulligan is electric as the troubled 'Cassie', still reeling from the shock of losing her best friend. It is no surprise she got the nod for an Oscar Best Actress nomination.Bo Burnham and Jennifer Coolidge shine in the supporting roles.The best revenge thriller since Django Unchained for me. Two hours went by so fast, I didn't even realise it.A must watch!#MovieReview #SpoilerFree #OscarsBinge #PromisingYoungWoman #OscarNomineeForBestPicture."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 March 2021,5/10,"First she pretends to be drunk to go to men's houses, but nothing really happens because the scenes are cut short. Then she falls for a customer at her job after spitting in his coffee and they go out, but not much happens between them. Then she strikes revenge on those who murdered a childhood friend, but we don't know what happened and supposedly there's a tape from years ago that no one sees regarding her friend's death. Then she dies from suffocation and yet she sends text messagrd to her ex boyfriend's cell phone and the police arrest the groom with no proof that he killer her. It doesn't make sense."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 June 2021,9/10,"Superb film, petty more aren't made with this class, and it's a 1st debut for writer and director, very original and some classy cinematography, all acting is top notch.Watch out for snippets of music written for the classic ""the night of Hunter"" Robert Mitchems gothic classic.A must watch for fans of darkest black comedy! Just Watch it ! You won't regret it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,8/10,"I'm not too much of a fan of rape-revenge themed movies, because they're just so unbelievably depressing and too triggering for my taste.Although this film does have its uncomfortable moments, it is engulfed in a confetti and rainbow coloured palate that is extremely pleasing to the eyes. And despite dealing with the subject matter of rape, suicide and injustice, it does it in a way that is never hammy, never overt. It has a certain pop culture charm, ringing in cheesy songs such as Paris Hilton's Stars are Blind, to a classical ominous version of Britney Spears's Toxic.The main character is a woman riddled with trauma and cannot get over what has been done to her friend Nina, whereas her attacker lives the high life without any consequences whatsoever. Such is the way of the many rapists or murderers who escape justice, like Nate Parker, Brock Turner or Breonna Taylor's killers . They get away absolutely scott-free while their victims suffer or take their own lives - and their loved ones continue to suffer as well.This is a call to arms and a powerful film featuring a wonderful, fiery, yet vulnerable performance by Carey Mulligan. Don't miss it!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,10/10,"This is a masterpiece. The story is amazing, with a very nice and powerful topic, and it is very well written. The storytelling is interesting and enjoyable. Cinematography is nice and the color palette is catchy and beautiful. Carey Mulligan gives a superb real performance. Promising Young Woman is very well written, directed, and acted and is highly entertaining. It's easily one of 2020's very best movies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,10/10,"Some people are just too dumb to appreciate a complete reverse on the genre film like this. This movie is a reverse revenge story. Its not a horror movie, its not a thriller, its not a drama or even a comedy. Its not romance or a mystery either. What it is is all of these genres in one as we follow a damaged 30 year old as she attempts to cure her own demons in what is a true cinematic experience and a sultry assault on the viewer. Carey Mulligan is Cassie and she is confused as to what she truly wants in life. She works as a barista of sorts while she holds several grudges from her past that are driving her insane. She blames these past incidents for where she is today just like maaany others. Honestly, though, it's possible that a little motivation and commitment on her end could go a long way. Cassie is so wrapped up in feeling like a victim from something that happened 10 years earlier and not even to herself. She thinks she wants revenge but maybe its a little over the top. She thinks she is the baddest b around. This set of traits propels Cassie to a blistering climatic encounter. This movie shows what it is to harbor such resentment and hate and what it should be to let go and move on. It basically slaps every other female driven revenge story in the face and tells all the girls to stop crying and get over it.(in some cases that is, there are still cases that warrant the bloody female retribution that is delivered in many movies). There is a truth to every lie and a winner to every fight. Some common sense over being propelled by seeing red can mean all the difference sometimes and some planning could put you on top. However, I wouldn't normally expect a man to defeat a giant bear with his bare hands in real life, but anything can happen in the movies..........right?? Orrrr."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,8/10,"First thing's first, this movie says so much that's needed to have been said for a very long time. It's difficult to watch but says so much that need's to be said, and to have been said for a long time, and to continue being discussed.I highly support this movie and so many of the choices by the producer's and the directors and I won't waste any more time other than saying the performances were all around great, the script was brilliant and the twists were just about in all of the right places... For a dark movie that does so much right, the ending feels very unsure of itself, and, for me, was wrapped up in too much of a neat little package(?) or something?I like more to be left to the imagination, but this movie, as a male, may not have entirely been made for me, and I loved it. Since other people are as happy as they are with it, that's very relieving to me and it certainly deserves all of it's praise and then some."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 May 2021,4/10,I don't really know why people think this is a comedy because it really doesn't come across that way. The way the music in the movie plays like its meant to be funny when the subject matter is pretty horrid is little more than just bad taste. So we have some chick that's doing bad things to guys who have wronged her but you never see or find out exactly what she does to them which to me is terribly weak.It's probably worth hanging for the ending mostly because the protagonist in this movie is such a mess you are pretty much left feeling you should have guessed the way it was going when it gets there. Identifying the antagonist is a kind of childish gotchya kind of move that isn't hard to pick. Could have been better.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 September 2021,8/10,"This movie does what many movies fail to do- take an important societal message and make it entertaining. It doesn't feel like the message was shoehorned in- rather, it felt like a natural part of the plot. I liked that the made the protagonist black and white as opposed to a cheesy, cartoonish heroine- some people are saying the movie doesn't know what it is, but I think that's the whole point... it's not black and white. And finally, it's not predictable like many of these movies are. I think a lot of the people leaving negative reviews are men who act like the ones portrayed in the film and are offended by it. If that's not you, you'll like this and maybe even learn something from it!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,2/10,"The Pros: Carey Mulligan is a fine actress. Touches on some interesting and valid points around the delicate subject matter.The Cons: The storyline is a interesting concept, but it is a work of fiction that lays it on a little too thick."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,7/10,"I'm afraid there are going to be spoilers in here, as they're necessary to make the point.The opening shows a guy being thoroughly decent, trying to get a drunk girl home safely. But on the journey he changes his mind and decides to take advantage of the situation for an easy score. And after he's manoeuvred her onto the bed and removed her knickers, she suddenly becomes stone cold sober and asks him what he thinks he's doing.At this point, there are two possible ways one imagines this will go. Either his Mr. Hyde side erupts and it gets nasty. Or her revenge trip goes all the way and it gets even nastier. And initially the film teasingly suggests the latter, as the next scene shows her walking home and there seems to be a streak of blood on her leg. Then we see what looks like blood down her arm. And then we see her messily eating a hotdog, with excess ketchup oozing out of it.That the film chose neither path, but the third option of the 'victim' simply providing a very blunt wake-up call to the 'perpetrator' shows the beautiful light touch in handling a very dark subject.Cassie didn't join her bestie Nina at a frat party where Nina got drunk and got raped in front of a laughing group, while the rapist's bestie filmed it for college circulation. But the story didn't end with the rape and public humiliation. There was also the injustice of the way female friends, college authorities and police treated the situation, culminating with an aggressive lawyer bullying and intimidating Nina into withdrawing her accusation. The combination broke Nina and drove her to quit medical college and a very promising career and eventually to suicide. Yet none of this is shown, but gleaned from the script as the story evolves - again, the beauty of the handling, avoiding the temptation to appeal to sensationalism; we do not need to see it to imagine what that girl must have gone through.Cassie was devastated by the piecemeal but total destruction of her close friend and riddled with guilt that she didn't accompany her to the party. And so she set out to mend the damage, not just to Nina and herself but to a society that has come to accept such things as 'normal'.It is very revealing that the guys she shocks by holding up a mirror to their behaviour all react by calling her a weirdo, psycho and worse (as if she'd actually cut off their testicles or tried to murder them). Male sexual arrogance and sense of entitlement is a very ugly thing!Jumping to the ending, which has apparently disappointed a lot of people, of course we would all have liked Cassie to find happiness with her beau; after all, they got on so well and seemed to be so happy together. But any chance of that was destroyed when the video showed that Ryan was one of the laughing group witnessing Nina's rape and doing nothing to help her, but rather egging Al on. That final disillusionment pushed Cassie over the edge, to the point where she didn't really care what happened to her, as long as justice was done. It was very sad, but by that point probably inevitable.Congratulations to the writer, director, actors and other contributors for an intelligent and thought provoking job well done!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 May 2021,1/10,"As revenge flicks go, this one is just as bad as the rest. And while the screenwriter could have opted to make Cassie a superhero, she chose to make her another victim instead. Oddly enough, I'm reminded of Kill Bill, not because I finally got around to reviewing it, but because it falls into the same genre.Cassie sets out seeking revenge on a man who raped a friend in college, leading to the friend's suicide. From there the plot thinnens as Cassie finds other victims of her vengeful wrath to torment. The main problem with this film is that despite all of her efforts to exact revenge upon 1 man, Cassie only manages to have herself cancelled, permanently. Can you say ""Disappointment""?At this point, my thoughts concerning the acting and dialogue are moot, so I won't bother sharing them. But if you like unexpected plot twists that lead to the death of the Heroine, then this is the film for you!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 November 2021,9/10,"WOW did I not expect a movie to go like this and be this good. The directing, the acting, the soundtrack, the story are absolutely incredible.This movie really outdid itself. First off, it's extremely well acted by everyone in it, notably the lead actress. Nothing felt out of place or ''that one actor that didn't work''.The directing is top notch, combined with the color grading and visual style, the pastel nature, the growing darker tones throughout the story. The visual storytelling.Now the concept of this movie might trigger you into thinking this is going to be some feminist piece that has no nuance, that just throws ''men bad'' in your face without concern for the fact that it'' never that easy. It's thankfully never that shortsighted. It's balances in the middle of right and wrong, intention and exploitation.The score is fantastic, worked really well, nothing felt out of place and the final score is mesmerizing.Now the acting I have to give Carey Mulligan credit for a incredible performance. But it would be dismissive to not give the others credit as well, everyone worked in this movie and it shows.The story I loved, it's dark, and I never expected the twists and turns we got, as in I expected them in some form, but not what finally went on screen. The finale is beautifully somber and dark. Where in everyone loses. I also didn't expect it to make me as emotional as it did. Not as far as tearing up but it'll get to you for sure.As for what this movie really is, it sways into a rom com, then a thriller, then maybe even a horror, but it keeps you incredibly intrigued and immersed. Highly recommend this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 February 2021,3/10,"I have to admit that this movie had serious ambitions as it clearly selected an important societal topic to discuss. What's more, the director had some sort of an artistic vision as she tried to experiment with different themes, colors and even genres. Seeing all these nominations got me excited for what unfortunately turned out to be a parody that not only feels like an utter waste of time but also a film that tragically belittles the seriousness of the issue that it is trying to portray.The movie is about a 30 year old med school dropout who dresses like a 90s teenager, lives with her parents and works in a coffee shop. We learn that she has a mental trauma from a past incident and as a result, she spends her nights unrealistically luring men by pretending to be intoxicated while somehow serving no consequences for her actions. This all sounds quite promising but regrettably, the movie tries to seem a lot bigger than it actually is and in the process, resembles nothing but dull mediocrity. I expected the age related miscasting to maybe turn into a psychological twist but alas, it was just another hole in the narrative.Carrey Mulligan has recieved praise for her acting but the only reason she looked above average is because everyone else felt hollow. What saddens me is how such a disturbing and relevant topic was smeared to resemble a romcom with ridiculous aesthetics and flat attempts at humor. Nothing in the plot feels even remotely compelling as the film fails to establish any kind of tension or emotional weight. How can this be nominated for best picture, director and of all things script?The movie tried to be like Nightingale, Unbelievable, Hard Candy or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but instead, it felt more like Mean Girls with pepper on top. Watch the films I mentioned if you want a proper tale of revenge and don't waste your time on this false promise.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and TV shows."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 January 2021,9/10,"Cassie who has had a bad incident in her past pretends be drunk at bars every night and when the guy takes her home turns the tables on them and hurts them. Carey Mulligan plays the role to perfection, she is so smooth and cunning and funny. Cassie one day meets a guy called Ryan and you think maybe shes found a nice guy finally but things dont quite work out they way you think they would. I think this film is fantastic, really witty and sharp dialogue and really omg moments you dont see coming. Carey Mulligan deserves an Oscar nomination. This is one of the best films of the last year."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,10/10,"This movie is insanely good. I think the strongest reason for this is how much Emerald Fennell cared while making this movie. It is so detail oriented.The story is so real while also playing on revenge fantasies. It knows it's story backwards and forwards and works like falling dominos. Nothing is done just for the sake of it and everything is like a chain reaction that pays off perfectly in the end.People don't like the third act and at first I didn't until I saw the ending and I thought it was perfect.The style of this movie. It is like a candy coloured nightmare and I love it. They light up the screen and the sets in such a perfect way. It makes every scene pop.The score and soundtrack are amazing too. I really loved that Emerald payed so much attention to the soundtrack. She wanted to make it full of all these ""guilty pleasure"" songs and like ""girly"" music to show that there is nothing wrong with that music and it is good as well. I thought it was fantastic.I honestly think that everyone should see this movie. Especially men. I like that it tells you that even people who think they are ""good people"" still can hurt others.I think this is a near perfect movie. Watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 October 2021,9/10,Good film. Some real twists and turns inthis. Sad too. Great acting too! Totally not what i expected. Think i was thinking i spit on your grave which is pretty brutal!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 May 2021,7/10,"Good, nearly great movie.There are some issues with the plot like.-
The lawyer's epiphany (when do lawyer's have feelings?)
The reconciliation with Ryan happens too soon after he sees her coming out of the club
Since when do frat bro's go to to shacks in the middle of nowhere for stag do's, anyone heard of Vegas?Otherwise, thought provoking stuff."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 August 2021,9/10,I went through so many emotions and ratings during watching this film that it was hard to finally decide on the final score out of 10. All I will say is it starts strong is great in the middle before it turns bad and you think Nooo! But then it got back my final rating (or maybe I'll be changing it back and forth for ages) in the final climax which is one of the best endings to this kind of film to the most appropriate song of 'Angel in the Morning' playing. In other words everything about the construction of this film is perfect and it doesn't even matter the subject - a lot has been made of the subject matter and it's a great one to have. But it could have gone pear shape but it went to the upper level instead.I totally recommend this film to everyone and I don't often do that anymore. But when a film is this satisfying how can't you! Now I understand why it and Emerald won all the awards.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,7/10,"Carey Mulligan is the Bernard Goetz of date rape as she gives male predators the comeuppance they deserve.It's a bit tonally uneven as it flips between comedy, drama, horror and the satisfaction of revenge, but Mulligan puts in a femme fatale performance to die for."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 April 2021,8/10,"I'll keep it short:Miss Mulligan is definitely one of my fave. Actresses these days, and can pull off an American accent with ease. I first caught her acting chops in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", and have enjoyed her work since then.I was really invested heavily in this all the way through, and can't recommend it enough. It was also nice to see a revenge movie where the pain inflicted was more psychological than physical.Check it out when you can."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 October 2021,6/10,Honestly it was hard to like this movie because Cassie (Carey Mulligan) wasn't a very likable character. I completely understand being devastated about what happened to her best friend and wanting revenge but she totally let it consume her life.I was pleasantly surprised by Bo Burnham as he is actually a pretty good actor. I'm sure many were upset about the ending but I think it was the only way to go.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,5/10,"This film is an indie dark comedy/thriller about a young medical school dropout, Cassie, who seeks revenge on men by trying to lure them, only to put them in their place. Shaped by past traumas as well as the experiences of her friend, she feels the need to be heard and understood. While the concept of the film could have been utilized very well to create a clear parable for the #MeToo era, the film feels tonally erratic. The screenplay does mix some engaging dark humor with social commentary, but I didn't find the characters to be particularly unique or interesting in terms of their development. The static nature of some of the characters further makes the plot less engaging, and some of the attempts at ""revenge"" ultimately get a bit repetitive.The story does clearly show the moral repulsion of sexual violence, as well as the tragic psychological toll it takes on survivors. Yet the attempts at twisted humor often fall flat, and sometimes feel rather tone-deaf given some of the seriousness of the rest of the material. The film's quirky aesthetic also did not do too much for me. Its visual and musical style could be defined as ""candy-colored,"" and the pop music in the soundtrack can sometimes be a bit off-putting. While I admire the audacity of the director, I think the jarring tone and aesthetics don't always feel conducive to the much more tragic and grounded social themes embedded in the story. The ending also seemed to negate the film's tone from both a thematic and moral level, and leaves far more questions than answers (but not in a good/ambiguous way.) I wish I could say I really admired this given the strong reviews it got out of Sundance, especially given the talented cast and Margot Robbie's production company producing, but I cannot. Not recommended. 5/10"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 March 2021,9/10,"I am not a fan of revenge movies, because they usually are very graphic and made me uncomfortable as a young woman. I had my doubts when seeing the trailer, but I was proven wrong. This movie proves you can make good revenge movie without having to be too graphic and have assault scenes, and have powerful scenes with just a discussion (the college dean scene) and kind of scary too, how real it felt. Carey Mulligan does a great performance as Cassandra, and portrays her smart and intelligent. It's tragic that even nowadays men can get away from sexual assaults because they are popular, have money or success, or all of these. Hopefully we are getting better, as a society. A banger ending, though."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 May 2021,8/10,"This is a scathing, dark film from writer director Fennell that gained critical acclaim and got nominated for five Academy Awards and won Fennell the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. It stars Carey Mulligan in one of her best roles in years. This would primarily be classified as a revenge picture, but that is doing the film a bit of a disservice as we have become indoctrinated when we hear revenge picture we think blood spattered, violent 'John Wick'/'Kill Bill' style of films but this eschews the fantastic for much more real world based film. The script is very smart and extremely worthy of the Academy Award it won. It has an amazing cast including Bo Burnham, Jennifer Coolidge, Laverne Cox and Alison Brie among others.This film centers around Carey Mulligan's character Cassie Thomas who had been a promising young medical student along with her friend Nina Fisher. When Nina is raped and the whole matter is swept under the rug/bullied into submission (i.e. Blaming the victim, etc.) by those involved including the university and the legal system both girls drop out due to the trauma. Nina winds up dead and Cassie lives with her parents working in a coffee shop without much ambition unable to move beyond those events that happened to her friend. She now spends evenings feigning drunkenness taking men home and when they essentially try to rape her due to her nonexistent inhibitions she lets the ruse fall and confronts them. Cassie winds up going on a date with Bo Burnham's Ryan who was among that circle of med students when all the stuff went down although he claims he isn't really friends with many of them, but he does reveal that Al Monroe, who was the guy who raped Nina, is getting married. This prompts Cassie to launch into a grand revenge scheme where she confronts many of those she blames for Nina's rape and subsequent death including the lawyer for Al Monroe and the Dean of the college who failed to believe her as well as a coed who did not believe she was raped. One by one she gets her brand of revenge by embarrassing those involved and making them feel how Nina must have felt to some degree. This all, of course, leads to her confronting Al Monroe himself. I will say that this does not proceed like you think it will and takes a twist for the macabre and bizarre at the end, but is no less powerful for it and maybe more powerful for the turn it takes. It certainly left me stunned to a degree.This movie really shines a bright light on the broken system surrounding date rape and how those involved seemed much more inclined to blame the woman or disregard her complaints completely rather than actually attempt to provide any measure of justice. If I have a qualm about the film it is that there are basically no redeemable men in the story. Every one of them is on some level an awful human being. They make that clear from the beginning of the story when we meet Cassie doing her drunk act and a group of guys is ogling her and making comments and it is the ""nice"" guy that takes her home and winds up trying to rape her. I understand what the film is trying to do but I think it is disingenuous to make a blanket claim that all men are like this in some fashion. That aside this is a very original film tackling tough subject matter but doing it with an overall wit and grace that is impressive. The whole film really holds around the performance of Mulligan. It is a bit of an odd movie to garner Oscar attention, but I love the fact that in recent years that we have seen more and more different kind of films getting Academy Award consideration including 'Promising Young Woman'.Eric's Grade: B+"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 September 2021,10/10,"I'm allergic to 'any' sociopathic psychological drama. But Oscars brought me here.I won't say that I 'enjoyed' the movie, cuz of course I didn't.But I 'liked' the movie, and needed to see it.This is a mind blowing great movie. For it's non-sensual horrific portrayal of 'rape' and sensitizing enough about the cause.Jus sums up how much our lives are made up of denials and those pseudo-truths we tell ourselves to make us feel good and morally upright, when we cannot walk-the-talk.JESUS! But what it make you see is significant!And jus a fellow reviewer summed up- ""as a man I needed to see this"".So did I. Maybe you do too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,8/10,"This was an excellent film that I didn't expect to be this good. It's insane that this is a directoral debut for Emerald Fennell because her direction is fantastic. Every shot and character is so incredibly well planned and thought it. I'm very excited to see what this director is capable of in the future. Carey Mulligan is incredible as the main character. It's easily one of my favorite performances of the entire year. Her reactions and how she delivers her lines is fantastic and I'm excited to see what she does with her career after this. Every performance here is great to be honest. I always feel skeptical when they cast comedians in films that are supposed to be dramatic but Bo Burnham killed it here. It goes to show that anyone can do an amazing job given the right material. This has some of the best framing and cinematography of the year. Each shot is visually pleasing in how it's framed and each shot knows what needs to be in it. Every shot felt to me like it was intentional in what it wanted to show. In other words, there was a certain aesthetic to the film that worked very well for the tone. The story of the film is powerful, emotional, well thought out, and relevant. The film has a lot to say about rape and sexual assault and How authority figures act on it without being overbearing or too on the nose but it can feel like that at points. The last 45 minutes of this film is just gut punch after gut punch and it's great. The film does a great job at making you feel for Mulligan's character. While some may find the ending a little over the top and dumb, I didn't. I thought the ending made logical sense and it was a huge pump in the fist for the main character as I was starting to root for her. I would highly recommend checking this out if you are okay with the dark subject matter."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 August 2021,9/10,"I now have a new unexpected movie on my favorite film list. Freshman writer - director Emerald Fennell crafted a dramatic - ironic production that really worked for me. The performances, soundtrack, and sets are campy in a way that serves the purpose of telling this sad societal tale.I'm generally a music documentary, quirky Indie film, and social activism viewer. I often to go against the grain with popular films. When I heard about Promising Young Woman, I was put off by the rape-revenge storyline; life is challenging enough. I don't seek out out dark, downer movies, yet after a friend recommended it, I streamed it. I figured I could stop watching any time. I didn't.Carey Mulligan is Cassie, a thirty-year old promising young woman who lost her potential; she's a medical school dropout living a dead end life in a low end job, staying with her blasé, concerned parents. Traumatized and infuriated after her best friend Nina was gang-raped and then thrust into the paws of legal wolves who sadistically shamed and blamed this victim to the breaking point of self annihilation, Cassie is out to teach lessons to misogynistic predators disguised as nice guys, and ultimately the bystanders, protectors, and colluders who are both male and female.Cassie's M. O. is to go out alone at night, play dead drunk, and take her supposed rescuers-turned-violators to the brink of their offences before snapping to full lucidity. Carey was unrelentng and unapologetic in this role.Bo Burnham as Ryan, Cassie's old med school classmate, now a pediatric surgeon, swoops in as the love interest who hits all the right notes and rocks her world, providing an opportunity for her to move beyond her noxious nocturnal revenge raves.The script twists and turns. The audience squirms. It's not a male hate film, it's a scathing societal indictment. As a survivor of this monsterous system, I loved it. It spoke to me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 June 2021,9/10,"Very different and definitely not everyone's Cup of tea. I absolutely loved it. Carey was just amazing, and I loved the several twists in the end, that I definitely didn't see coming."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 March 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman is a dark comedy/thriller that focuses on a 30 year old woman who is still damaged and traumatised about a tragic event from her past. Cassandra aka Cassie is unable to move on with her life and cannot have a normal relationship with a man without thinking about Nina and what she went through. The film touches upon sexual harassment, the male gaze, toxic masculinity, misogyny and the corrupt system we are living in.Carey Mulligan delivers a performance that not only is career defining, but may as well win her an Oscar. She fits perfectly to the role, and I cannot imagine any other actress embodying this complex character. Throughout the film, we see two versions of Cassie; one that is sweet, kind and innocent, and the other that is hell bent on getting revenge. There is something cathartic to seeing Cassie totally unhinged and taking her anger out on terrible and indecent men. I am in utter awe by Carey Mulligan's performance in this revenge-thriller.
I really love the color palette of the entire film. It serves as a motif and kind of represents the mood of the film.The acting, directing, screenplay, costume design, mise-en-scene, cinematography and soundtrack is astounding. It is definitely the frontrunner for the Best Picture award at the Oscars.The reveal that Ryan was a bystander at the incident was a tad predictable. I actually knew that he was not a good guy, and that he was hiding something behind this facade. This further proves that only a few good men exist. This revelation drove Cassie over the edge and made her even more motivated and hell bent on getting revenge. Cassie's final outfit where she dresses up as a nurse, is visually and aesthetically pleasing. The make-up artists did a phenomenal job.The only thing I disliked about the film is how Cassie's story was wrapped up (nitpick). By the end of the film, she did go through with her revenge fantasy, but not in the way I expected. Of course, I would have preferred for Cassie to be alive, and live out the rest of her life knowing that the rapist who raped her childhood friend Nina Fischer is behind bars. But the ending she got is still great and feels more realistic. Her final message to Ryan was so savage and badass, and further establishes Cassie as a strong and complex female character.The film does leave some plot details up to the viewer's interpretation. For instance, it was never revealed what exactly happened to Nina after the horrific and scarring incident. It has been pointed out though that she died. How she died is a question mark? The most obvious explanation would be that the traumatic incident drove Nina over the edge and led to her committing suicide. This would be quite dark, disturbing and highly graphic to showcase. I am glad they did not showcase Nina getting raped by those idiots and her probable suicide.To conclude, although Promising Young Woman touches upon a serious topic, it still manages to be entertaining and immersive from start to finish. As a 21 year old male, I was extremely disturbed and shocked by the film. It is thought provoking and will make you think long after the credits.Side note: By the way, Ryan and Al claiming that they were kids in college was deeply upsetting and made me want to punch them in their very punchable face. That is not a valid excuse to do such a heinous crime. They were adults in college, and were perfectly aware of what is right and wrong. Toxic masculinity and misogyny will be the death of men.Another side note: I love Emerald Fennell's directing style and hope to see her win an Oscar.One of the best lines in the film: Can you guess what every woman's worst nightmare is?Final verdict: 9.6/10"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 August 2021,5/10,"For the most part, the movie was pretty confusing. She going to night clubs acting drunk just for guys to pick her and when they took her to their place and tried to take advantage of her she ""got sober"" and had some speech and then left... and at home apparently wrote all bad guys with black and with red the ones that didnt took advantage of her i guess.The entire movie is a bit boring, with her doing same stuff over and over again... the only thing that we find out is that her friend was somehow sexually abused by a group of dudes when they were at med school, the girl died, idk how cuz they never said, and now Cassie her friend tries to revenge her.. this is the whole plot.Personally, the ending kind of disappointed me. All that work she put into making those guys to pay for what they did to Nina she ended up dead in the end, and only the dude that killed her was arrested, the others not. And shes dead... she somehow expected this to happen, why didnt she stashed some knife or something in her outfit and simply kill the ba$tard...
Not my kind of ending, the perfect ending for me would be with all those dead or arrested for what they did, and her alive."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,7/10,"After sitting with this for awhile, I feel like this films tone is conflicting, that combined with a jarring ending can leave some with a sour watch. However, the acting, score, story, and cinematography are such strong highlights I feel liked this film has a very offset balancing point and therefore makes this a polarizing watch.Carey Mulligan as Cassandra was absolutely electrifying on screen and I adored her character. Even Bo Burnham surprised me with how charming his character was.This film is really stylized and beautifully colored with some appealing, sometimes symmetrical, cinematography that was very pleasing to the eyes.The story was gripping through and through, it kept me questioning certain motives / events as the film progressed especially with a lead character like Cassandra who's very complicated and has her own motives.The ending of this film for me was very conflicting however. I kind of felt like I knew where it was going ... and then it turned ... and then it turned again. I still don't know how to feel about the last 15 minutes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 January 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan really deserves a lot of recognition for this role. She moved up a few spots on my favorite actors list for sure. Overall though, she's definitely not the only great thing about this film. The story, directing, music choices, everything works so perfectly well to create ultimately one of the best films of 2020. I can't wait to watch this again and see the story from a new perspective. I know it's a bit of a boring cliche to say ""this movie was necessary"" and whatnot, but truly, this movie has a lot to say about society. Even though that may have sounded like a Joker meme, Promising Young Woman truly deserves to be payed attention to and see if we, emphasis on *men*, can learn something from it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,9/10,"I was surprised by how well made and consistent this is. It's definitely a stand out movie in the sea of dreck cranked out by the movie mills. The writing, pacing, acting, and directing is all very good. I really have no criticism and I'm a total prick."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 May 2021,7/10,"A power-packed commercial type flick, Promising Young woman trekked through mind-blowing scenes and sequences. Completely a female-oriented subject and was directed by a female director the movie deals with revenge aligned plot. The central character Cassie is leading an unadapted life and she is haunting by the death of her friend Nina. That's why she discontinued her med school studies and lead a life in a coffee shop. She turns her life by opting for men that take advantage of her while she is at Bars or clubs. She notes down their names in her diary and denotes a tally there which gave her satisfaction. She wants to hang out with boyfriends but she doesn't find anyone because everyone that appears to her claims ""gentlemen' but looks like, moron. There she got a twist when she met Ryan (her old classmate), Madison which drew back to her past days and she put in an urge for revenge. Then the rest of the story lined up. Brilliant piece of writing and directing from Emerald Fennel and an exceptional piece of acting from Carey Mulligan. The movie is a clinquant gem to watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is a hysterical and a solid-well-placed film right from the start, with an effective direction, with perfect-written dialogues and an excellent screenplay, but at the same time it paves the way in a very dark story, more serious than the one that seems to sneak up at the beginning, hidden by smiles and lightness that leave satisfaction in the stomach as the film progresses. Promising Young Woman is one of the most smart and brilliant thrillers of recent years, with a fantastic and meticulous Carey Mulligan, which carries the film frame by frame, emotion by emotion. Simply brilliant."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 May 2021,4/10,"Promising Young Woman, unfortunately, is not a very promising film. It certainly has a promising premise, and likewise a promising turn by lead actress Carey Mulligan, but the final product leaves much to be desired, even more so than some other bad films out there due to it's prospects and potentials.The first and main reason in my opinion, is how the film is trying to do so many things simultaneously. One wonders during watching this film, that one is seeing a social commentary on misogyny and sexual misconduct, or a Oldboy-esque revenge flick, or a bitter comedy with with vicious characters doing vicious things and rapping vicious lines, or a cute and warm film with music and aesthetics evocative of 80s. Pehraps this blending and crossing of genres and themes would pay off wonderfully had the filmmakers been seasoned and matured enough, but at the hands of first time writer and director Emerald Fennel, the result is rather shallow and simplified.The second reason, being closely connected to the first aforementioned, is how the lack of experience and refinement from the director upsets the film, stripping off its consistency. There exist in the film some truly effective scenes which directly speak to the soul and inspires the awe, only to be disturbed by a handful of not-so-great dialogues and a couple of highly out of place and senseless parts which put the whole writing and editing of this film under question."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 May 2021,8/10,"An intense sort-of revenge thriller that puts a spotlight on predatory behaviour and the culture than enables it. It is bright, stylish and beautifully shot and uses a cast of charming actors all of which disarms the audience. I found myself wrong-footed at almost every turn which made it much more than a typical revenge movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 March 2021,7/10,"Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman is about preying on vulnerabilities and the negligence of society towards those who do so. I have to admit, the entire plot is somewhat exaggerated to effectively drill in the emotions it wishes to communicate, but it shouldn't matter because of how well it was handled. The enthusiasm and charisma of this movie comes one part from Carey Mulligan, who puts on an amazingly convincing and passionate performance, and one part from the movie's fantastic Editing which does a great job of keeping the pace consistently engaging. Had high hopes going into this movie, and it didn't disappoint!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,8/10,"In ""A Promising Young Woman,"" you get mystery, humor, vicarious pleasure, great acting, and a soundtrack with a punch. The one flaw of the movie is the Ryan character. Obviously he is integral to the unfolding of events, however the way he is introduced in a few scenes feels a bit contrived, in that there wouldn't be much of a plot if his character wasn't specifically written that way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,2/10,"Carey Mulligan is a great actress and I liked the music. But the script was just ridiculous and it was so boring. The overall plot sounded good. The ending was I'm assuming supposed to be powerful, but all she had to do was send that video to the police, he would've been arrested and she'd be able to move on (and be alive). Now I see why this film got mixed reviews. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,9/10,"This is one of the best movies in 2020/2021. Everything from direction, writing, acting, music, editing was almost perfect. Everything felt real, every sentence was authentic, as if taken from someone's experience. I laughed, I teared up a bit, there was a bit of horror & thriller, and it results in a complete work. Hope Emerald Fennell has plenty of success in the future."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 December 2020,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is a fresh black comedy which deals with a very serious issue and yet stays true to its morals and delivers an entertaining film for 113 minutes. Carey Mulligan carries the film right from the beginning, you could see that Emerald Fennell visualised Margot Robbie as Cassie when she was writing the script. Her performance is so similar to Margot's Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey.The opening scene is one of the best in recent years and instantly grabs your attention, you can see the direction the film was gonna head towards. A backlash on this film is inevitable, the incels won't be able to handle the truth. Don't wanna talk too much about the plot to ruin your experience, it's best watching this film without having any clue what's it about."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 July 2021,10/10,"I think this film is genuinely enthralling if you ignore the obvious problems and logic flaws. Communication or concern from people is obviously missing and especially ninas mom etc you'd think her behaviour was more noticeable. It's not as good as I spit on your grave, or peppermint. But it needs a 10 as this behaviour is real and needs stopping. Treat people as people, respect should be a given and there shouldn't be any bias in a world where we're all built the same."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,8/10,"Best thing about this movie is, it doesn't try to be clever or something it's not. Or maybe it's Carey Mulligan. Can't decide. It's a straight forward no nonsense revenge thriller that isn't like I spit on your grave or rather Hard Candy (which I expected it to be). It's just a very simple collective of 5 part story told cohesively and many people (on both ends and in middle) will find relatable.Special mention to the father daughter scene.Very well written, well shot, directed, scored and acted movie. And yes negative reviews are trying to sound clever but everyone knows they saw themselves in there."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,9/10,"I'll admit that at first, I thought I had this movie figured out. I thought 'Oh great... another film trying to be edgy by centering around a very serious, delicate topic.' Fortunately, as the movie progressed, I was proven wrong. There's no performative preaching, it's simply great storytelling. Admittedly there are moments that feel too outrageous to happen, such as the main protagonist Cassandra luring the dean of her old medical school's teenage daughter to a diner. I know most shallow teenage girls aren't the brightest, but someone would have stopped that right away. There's quite a few moments like these throughout the film, but they work perfectly. The outrageousness of these events aren't just done for good entertainment, but to get you thinking of the absurdity of it. She had to do so many maneuvers to prove the point that rape is wrong and that even the nicest men are capable of it.A lot of films in recent years have tried tackling this delicate subject matter, as well as others, but they don't do it correctly. It's usually a typical story that's so disconnected from the world we live in. This one on the other hand shows the realities of our everyday life and how predatory men can be found everywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. It perfectly shows how people refuse to address the situation until they're put in the position of the victim themselves. It shows how the predators are taken care of because they play the ""promising young man"" role so well and the cowardly act of victim shaming. All this done through proper storytelling and not in a ""look how woke we are"" manner.Carey Mulligan is fantastic. She gives an amazing performance as Cassandra. From the moments where she's on edge to when she's in love, Mulligan perfectly brings this character to life. She feels like a very real, modern woman and not some fantastical character that only exists on motivational posters or tumblr websites. That's thanks to a great combination of superb writing and acting. Bo Burnham does a great job in his role as well, another one who perfectly captures an authentic feeling character so that when the big revelation happens near the end, we feel just as let down as Cassandra.From what you can tell, I absolutely loved this film, it was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this film. If you think it's ""lib tard hogwash"" you can't be taken seriously and I'd have to wonder why this very real and serious topic gets under your skin so much. When a movie has that kind of effect on questionable individuals, you know it's doing something right."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,4/10,Wtf is this nonsense lol this movie legit did nothing and could of been told in 30 mins. Huge fail.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,8/10,"This is a perfect movie to remind us how evil deeds can occur in broad daylight and how the truth behind them is concealed behind a sea of lies, corruption, and deception. When I read the title - Promising Young Woman - it makes me think of someone with a bright future ahead of them, someone that is respected both by their peers and the community or field they are applying themselves into. That person is ready to change the world but either their arrogance or the arrogance of others can ruin that in a blink of an eye and that's what this movie reminds us, the viewers.I don't think there was a single male character here with significant screen time to be rooted. At first, I was kind of displeased since every male character was displayed as a horrendous person, taking advantage of vulnerable women and only portraying them as the bad guys, not mentioning that false assault claims haven't ruined anyone's life before. But as the story progressed, I realized this movie is not about that. The view that women who drink themselves into a vulnerable position are at fault for what happens to them is old now, the hate for people like Brock Turner, Austin James Wilkerson, Mark Hulett, and John Enochs displays that perfectly. All of those people have been convicted for sexual assault, some even on multiple accounts, but their sentences have been dismissed to a bare minimum with little to no repercussions. And for some reason, their actions are being justified in one way or another. In Brock Turner's case, his father pleaded for his release by saying that he just wanted a few minutes of ""action"" and he's a promising swimmer that could achieve a lot in the future, which is just abysmal and weak in a lot of ways. During several moments in this movie, similar energy could be felt from witnessing the actions of low-rate men. To think that people can actually go this low and justify their bad deeds by claiming to be good people is just gut-wrenching. That's like saying you're a good person because you go to church every Sunday but also verbally abuse a poor chain-restaurant worker every time after church.The biggest relief from this nihilistic journey that portrays everyone as the absolute bad guys is the ending. Me believing in humanity took a lot of punches left and right and I thought it was knocked out near the end but it stood up and gave a devastating blow to all those nasty characters at the very end. The 4th wall break was also really well places, asking both Ryan and us if we really thought that was the end. Usually, I'm not a fan of happy endings and I'm not sure if I can even call this a happy ending but it did felt like a small victory again people who think they can get away with anything without any repercussions. Perhaps bittersweet would be a better way to describe the ending. I watched the movie yesterday but I'm still thinking about the ending, as it just felt so accomplished to experience. I rarely get goosebumps like that when the movie ends and it can only be compared to Where is My Mind? playing during the final moments of Fight Club.Overall, this movie really moved me. I didn't talk about stuff that I didn't enjoy, like the awkward relationship with Ryan and how the notebook with the names of the victims in different colors are not explained (like seriously, did she kill some of them, or does marking names in red mean nothing?) because the ending overwhelmed me. It's not a perfect movie but it does more than enough to get a reaction from me and I've never been so happy to hate people before than by watching this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,10/10,"A magnificent debut from the director and screenwriter Emerald Fennell. Reviewing this movie, I keep ending with the same and even stronger emotions. I would not have words to describe this work that I did not have high expectations the first time I saw it and then I was amazed at the result.The story of Cassie (Carey Mulligan) is shown, a woman who does not overcome the loss of her best friend Nina, who was abused during her university stage. The protagonist pretends to be drunk to generate different encounters with men and test their behavior towards her state, each scene of these encounters are magnificent, with dialogues and images that you do not forget. Each step that advances in the plot we discover details and people who were with Nina from her direct abusers to those who were silent knowing what was happening. A reality is reflected that is easy to perceive in this age of accusations and what people do with it, such as continuing to leave a person who abused with impunity because they share a bond or it simply did not seem so serious. This is seen throughout the film, each character collaborates with this and people's decisions bristle. Each time it becomes colder and harder instead of hopeful and fun as at the beginning, a final scene that broke my heart and without thinking about it for 5 minutes, that is what we see every day about femicides on the TV news or networks , this makes you shiver more. It made me rethink as a man my attitudes or thoughts about all this, how I have behaved or how I can eradicate these misogynistic attitudes in others from my role. And that a movie achieves this seems incredible to me.Going to the technical, I do not see errors, possibly gaps in the script about the friendship with Nina, what happened well with her and what Cassie did with the men although the latter I feel that it was a very genuine and good directive decision to leave it in imagination to each. Anyway, it makes me a very good script, especially with the turns that the film takes without being forced and the good focus that they give it. Add that it has a spectacular photograph that highlights Cassie's states as well as the music, pop icon.Going to Carey Mulligan, I think what she did excellent. I take this woman to the level of a sociopath, if she can be called I prefer to call her a traumatized person with a tremendous naturalness, she does not fall into stereotypes of screaming and crazy laughter, on the contrary, and above all she shows that struggle of not being able to let go and live in a certain past. Each scene is unique, Carey with this gives the best interpretation for me of 2020 and one of my favorites in general referring to the personal. She really deserves all the awards this season, I am happy that this very unacademic but so magnificent performance has reached the Oscars nomination, THANK YOU CAREY.Without more to say, it is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned because it was one of those films that I did not care about the technical at first but I caught the plot and how it is carried, gives a message and denounces loud and clear. I feel like it is one of those films that is going to be revalued and transcended over time, truly an icon.The best of 2020 concerns me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"What a frightening ride! At last a movie to equal Bunny Burner (you know the movie..) This knocks it out of the park! Brilliantly acted, socially poignant and wow, it makes you think! Should be shown in all high schools! One scary movie. Well done! From a dad with 2 daughters!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 April 2021,8/10,"Overall, Promising Young Woman was a very good film that was told with originality and professionalism by debut director Emerald Fennell. The performance from Carey Mulligan, who I think is vastly underappreicated, was terrific as lead character Cassie. She gave a staggering realism to a film that has a harrowing subject matter. It's dark, very dark, but the story had to be told this way. But a great script, brilliant performances and nice editing made an enjoyable watch for me. It's also very beautiful to look at. But yes, like most films, it's not the most perfect film ever. Some narrative choices I thought were slightly over the top and the ending was hit and miss for me. But I would definitely revisit this at some point down the line, I'd recommend it to others so go treat yourself.Quote - 'Look how easy that was. I guess you just had to think about it in the right way. I guess it feels different when it's someone you love.' - CassieRating - 4/5."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,10/10,"Good acting, good cast, good twists, great ending.The kind of revenge a lot of women and girls wish they could take out on their abusers."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 November 2021,9/10,"The Good: What I appreciate the most about PYW is how grounded it feels. This isn't a simple revenge story where our hero goes around kicking guys in the balls as she struts away as a #girlboss. It's far smarter and more interesting than that.Carrie Mulligan is fantastic as Cassie, our PYW. Her accent is a bit slippy at times, but she really embodies this aimless young woman seeking purpose. There's a lot of humanity behind her eyes. I also love how she's written; we're not supposed to really ""like"" Cassie and her uncompromising moral stance isn't something the film really endorses, but we can UNDERSTAND where she's coming from. And that's what really matter. Bo Burnham is honestly just as good in this. He and Mulligan have fantastic chemistry and that's a good thing, considering their relationship makes up a large chunk of the movie. (Btw, the Stars Are Blind montage is honestly one of the best romantic montages I've seen in quite a while)If you've heard anything about this movie, you've heard there's a twist. Unlike other films that subvert expectations for the sake of shock value, PYW's ""twist"" is organic and fits with the story's themes. Burnham's character isn't a bad guy, but that's the point. He's grown as a person, but he's never atoned for his participation/inaction in this sexual assault. He too contributes the same social norms that killed Nina. Cassie isn't redeemed and ""made normal"" via the love of a man, as you'd expect in most Hollywood films. Her anger is so deep that she goes on (what she knows will be) a suicide mission for justice. When she recognizes that even this perfect gentleman is not a ""good guy"" deep down, and he reiterates the same excuses as all the other guys who've tried to take advantage of her, she realizes that her true purpose is vengeance. It's pretty simple.If the writing, performances, pacing, and themes weren't enough, this movie looks and sounds really great. It's stylish and intentional; the creative set design, shots, cinematography and costumes give the film a real identity (that identity is pastel, fyi). But it's the music that works as the proverbial cherry on top. Not only does the pop soundtrack fit the aesthetics really well, but the music would mean something the characters, given their ages. This one of the few films that feels like it was made by Millenials, for Millenials. It's going to age extremely well and I predict it'll be seen as a great ""time capsule"" movie in a decade or so.The Bad: This is one of those cases where I think the movie should have leaned into its style a little more. As I mentioned before, we do get great shots...but not as much as I'd like. If you're gonna go with the pastel, neon pop aesthetic sometimes, might as well do it consistently. I also felt some of the performances and characters were a bit lacking. Not that this movie needed to be much longer, but Cox, Molina and Coolidge kind of felt wasted a bit. They essentially have extended cameos.The Ugly: This movie was pretty divisive when it first came out, but needlessly so. It isn't virtue signalling ala Captain Marvel or Charlie's Angels. It isn't ""man hating,"" but it doesn't compromise to make men feel comfortable. Because at the end of a day, it's a better and more effective story for that bold choice. This is one of those rare occasions where I can legitimately say that people are letting politics (and empathy) get in their way of enjoying a legitimately great movie. But, as I say in the title, it'll get its due. Eventually."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,6/10,"I've been trying to think which film this reminds me of, I'm sure I'll get it sooner or later.The film itself was OK, I wouldn't say it was Oscar material but it's worth a watch.The montage in the middle of the film made me think back to the days of Spiderman 3 and how nauseous that made me feel, but I suppose you need some element of cheese.The main actress Cassie delivers a very cold display and does it very well, the film itself is very slow however. One time watcher for me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,10/10,"Wow - this movie leaves me speechless. So well done. It sucks you in and you are in the dark for a long time. Once you know, it starts again ..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,8/10,"Started out pretty juvenile but turned into a good and structured movie pretty soon. It was not shocking or anything, it was pretty straightforward and the twists were seen miles away. Or maybe I have seen to many movies. Of course the lead is amazing, she has been amazing in everything she has done.But, original screenplay oscar? Didn't expect that! Cheers!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,7/10,"It is a dark movie, you never think in the final, but it is a good work here, ok the movie is not a big deal or one of the best film of the year, no never close to that but the principal performance is amazing
watch it, it is a revenge movie, but not a silly movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,7/10,"Promising Young Woman' is a rare revenge movie that crosses several genres with one sharp sweep. Some parts are funny, other times it's romantic, but it can get DARK really quick. Halfway through the film she begins to understand that remorse might be the point: a point that she is desperately searching for and rarely finds, but had there been more of it, there might have been some redemption, both for Cassandra and for her complicit 'victims'. The great thing about Promising Young Woman is that everybody has a different reaction to it.
Over all this is a great film that you should definitely go and watch. The subject matter is done in such a beautiful and respectful way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,8/10,"Oh what a fantastic movie! With a very good writing and brilliant acting too;
The movie is about a girl who lives in a shock related to it's friend and she can't forget it; so by it's own way without hurting any one physically; I mean she teach the bad men (let's face it) a lesson for the last of their life; maybe the end is little confusing with a lot of why why?...but I think she found Peace in that.Many people said that it's a dark comedy, no it's not there is no comedy here; and others said it's against men, clearly it's not."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"This is a must see for parents, children and adults as finally a film tackles a different issue once that is taboo to often. Rape! Cassie played by Carrie Mulligan plays the part perfectly she is heartbroken over the rape and death of her best friend and seeks revenge by acting drunk at clubs and taking revenge on the men who try to rape her. Having pulled out of med school she meets up with a guy she once knew and falls in love. It's great to see her finally happy, however she then sees the video of the rape and he was a part of it and did nothing to stop it. Nina was drunk and passed out and although you don't see what happens you get an idea from the voices in the background cheering. She sets out on a war path which ultimately ends her life when she attends the bachelor party of the guy responsible. It was risky but she knew that and went anyway secretly I was hoping the ex would come and save her but he didn't and she's killed and burnt. The groom and his best mate think it's all ok until Cassie despite her death posted the rape to the lawyer along with where she was in case she goes missing so the police turn up to arrest the groom. The best part is she had texts coming through prepared for her departure in advance to her ex, so yes ultimately she got revenge but lost her life.
I wish she didn't but not all movies have a happy ending and this is reality it's happening all too often so every parent should ensure their teenage kids see this and educate them on the dangers of what can happen in one night that will destroy the rest of it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 March 2021,9/10,"It's 2021 and the quality of movies is just plain bad. This movie, however, restored my faith that great films can still be made. I have to admit though, I almost gave up on this thirty minutes in. Carey Mulligan was coming off as too cool for this world and it was annoying and unbelievable. That changed quickly and this turned out to be quite the classic.Once you realize what this movie is, it then just gets better and better. This movie delivers in so many ways. There's a strong message and meaning and it's delivered with powerful direction and acting. It made quite the impact on me and I'm glad to see it's getting the recognition it deserves. I have no doubt this film will be remembered and people will be talking about it for a long time, as they should. Well done, Emerald Fennell."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 January 2021,7/10,"I went into this expecting (based on some of the marketing) some splatfest revenge thriller. I was happy when I got in and discovered it was a much more sophisticated balancing act. A look at a character, exploring trauma, mixing in heavy amounts of drama and satire along with some very neat cinematogrpahy. It has interesting observations and things to say about lasting emotional damage and what it can do to a person. It's dark. But it's also really funny and sweet too. A black comedy with a bubble gum pop sheen and a lot heart.But the movie gets to a point where it has to make a decision about what kind of film it wants to be, and the direction it chooses to go at that point lost me a bit. I wanted the film to dig deeper into the character herself. In the latter half it feels like it throws that out the window and decides to revert to that more traditional revenge thriller, albeit with some ~twists~. But that just wasn't as interesting to me and went back on some of what it had accomplished up to that point."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 March 2021,8/10,"A Promising Young Woman starts slowly. And stays slow for quite some time. Worse still it seems that we've seen this before; the revenge film, this one involving an attractive young woman seeking revenge on men for a crime committed to her best friend. While Carey Mulligan - the vengeful woman - is no Charles Bronson ('Death Wish'), she does very well for herself without need for a gun.I have to say that through the first third of the film I was not engaged. But then a new character appears; a male friend of both our heroine and her victimized friend. And so the question becomes, will Mulligan's quest for vengeance be tamped down by her seemingly 'falling for' her male friend?But wait. With this new character's arrival the narrative's questions and concerns only increase. As do the stakes. The past and present of our characters suddenly seem to be merging, and that is a good thing. A great plot device. A tightening of the narrative.Many reviewers have written about the film's ending. Some pro, others not. In fact ending-wise I found the film had two. The first, a bachelor party, totally implausible. The second, equally implausible but somehow ... right. An ending that nearly had me cheering. And forgiving its implausibility.So. Stick with the film. I think it's worth it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 May 2021,10/10,"This is definitely a must-see. It's a little hard to watch because it can be triggering at times, but I love that the main character's not a killer queen, but just your average bad-ass trying to cope and get her revenge. And let's be real, it'll take a cultural revolution without precedent until the subject of this film is no longer necessary, urgent and very realistic. Worth the watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,10/10,"I like they finally made a proper movie about how the ""drunk girl deserves it"". I get it - you should not be as drunk to not remember or to let people do things to you, but the ""nice guy"" trope was explained so well here. I waited for this movie for probably a year not knowing what it is about exactly after I have watched the trailer and I am more than happy with it. You will not be disappointed. It is very much pissing you on and making you feel relieved at the same time. Very good start of the year! Plus this is the only movie that I have seen having a low rate here and then going up. I like that people appreciate it, because honestly if you are not, then what would we think of such people - are they the ones that would do that crime and think it is ok and just get away with it? Well, just give it a go. And i really liked the modern day influencer references"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 January 2021,6/10,"In a mans, mans world every girl needs a hobby.
Unfortunately Cassies is baiting so-called ""nice guys"" into taking her home whilst under the apparent influence of alcohol only to freak them out when these blokes try to take advantage of her when they finally realise she's sober as a judge.
The trailer would have you believe ""Promising Young Woman"" is going to be more of a revenge blood bath.
Director, Emerald Fennell, even wants you to believe she kills the first victim we see her stalk, but is she covered in blood spatter and why does she keep a diary of her prey?
This film is more Hitchcock than De Palma.
The movie deals with the very serious topic of date rape and for the most part handles it well.
The end product feels like a slow burn 70's cult classic with a twist ending.
Carey Mulligan as Casey is leading a secret night life she doesn't share with her parents or boss.
She could've been a contender as a brilliant Doctor/Surgeon if she hadn't dropped out of med school over an incident 7 years ago that changed the direction of her life and left her spitting in clients coffees as a Barista.
Her parents would have preferred she became a Barrister.
Still she gets her chance to try her medical skills and practice on some unwitting victims.
But who really is the victim in this movie?
Funniest scenes: Cassandra's parents not so subtle birthday gift/hint.
Actors Clancy Brown and Jennifer Coolidge remind me of a mates parents as they try to understand their 30 plus still living at home daughter.
The other fun scene is in the Pharmacy with Paris Hilton playing on the PA.
Her wise mouth boyfriend, played by Bo Burnham, comes unglued as do any males she associates with.
It's a very modern tale, but also one as old as time and well before the #metoo movement.
This is a movie that will resonate long after you've seen it.
Think ""Birds of Prey"" meets ""Bombshell"" and you'll get the vibe of the constitution.
After all Aussie/Gold Coast star Margot Robbie is behind this feature film.
Also watch out for both Alfred Molina & Connie Britton in pivotal roles plus the cast of the TV Show, ""New Girl"".
In an aside: when they make a biopic of Fleetwood Macs' Stevie Nicks, Carey Mulligan would be my first choice for the role."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 June 2021,8/10,"A movie shot in 45 days and written by a woman and only a woman could write the this script and . . . Truly . . . Give ANY viewer a woman's perspective on the ' boys will be boys ' MENtality at the root of so much of the male psyche when it comes to their treatment of women or should I say mistreatment and how it is taken as, if not socially acceptable , then tolerated . Script, direction and acting , funny , dark and so entertaining. A rare film that makes you think, see things from a different perspective and leaves you satisfied with what you just watched. Original, unique ,and well crafted in every respect."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,6/10,"The film is very well directed by this new director and it felt like a fresh idea for a few acts but the 3rd act started to really slow down and get dull and there are many plot holes that just do not make sense. Regardless Carey Mulligan did a phenomenal job and kudos to the director who surely has a promising career ahead.I watch it without seeing any trailers yet I knew it was another feminist revenge rape movie and it was very entertaining but mid way the characters just felt bland and the silly pharmacy scene was just plain stupid. Especially 'spoiler' once you realize that her boyfriend she is in love with is complicit in the rape as a bystander. It makes you realize he would never dare to try to be so desperate to date her, and the main bad doctor would never return to LA to get married. And the ending could have had a deeper impact since it was hard to fathom that the guy would kill her or be stupid enough to not remove the evidence far away from the scene. But hey, its a dark pseudo comedy but unfortunately it plays way too straight at the end which is a shame as there was so many other options the protagonist could have done at the end. Tarantino would have enjoyed a Kill Bill or Bloody Hateful Eight bloody scene with Nina blood written all over the guys body. Instead we get this lame ending which is a shame. Otherwise it was stellar first film....and very interested in seeing the next film from this director.
A solid 6 esp for Carey.. and yes she still looks hot!! ;)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,9/10,"It is pity Carey Mulligan didn't get Oscar. She is much better than the other candidates. The story is amazingly good with unexpectedly great ending, with feelings of waving sea. I've supposed what would be in the end, because I would do the same as she did in that case if."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,9/10,This was honestly a really really great film. Acting is out of the park and this difficult concept/topic covered brilliantly. It surprised me constantly and I was riveted the whole way!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 September 2021,7/10,"On the whole I think this is a really good movie. It has echoes of Falling Down, of someone who has just HAD ENOUGH.And rightly so. The writer/director takes on a very serious topic and tackles it face on. So it's amazing that it is done so without feeling preachy or a lecture. Instead it leans into the utter absurdity of a system that is so stacked against women and lets that do the talking.My issue is with the end parts of the film. And it troubles me in the same way that shows like 13 Reasons Why troubled me. And it's the glorification of suicide. And yes while she was actually killed in Promising Young Woman, but it has the same pathos. She went in to die. She could have just used the tape, but she chose to go there and planned for her death.It's that American 'mike drop' (although I know the writer/director in this case is British!). The desire to have the last word. The carefully orchestrated 'gotcha'. Sirens wailing, the timed messages, all with an audience...But it isn't like that. Suicide is lonely. Murder is lonely. That's it, finito. There's no last word. There's no crowds there to see your achievements. And I have issues with TV and movies that portray otherwise."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 March 2021,10/10,Liked this movie from beginning to end agree with the good reviews!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 April 2021,3/10,"Oh, what a bad ending. I suppose because I have a crush on Carey Mulligan. The film, although very well made, only 3 stars from me. The way it ends is not the way the story appears to be going, it spoiled the entire experience (my opinion)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 October 2021,5/10,"There's nothing great about this movie. All the hype had to be from folks being stir crazy during COVID lockdown. It had promise. Mulligan is great but it just falls short. The ending is less than shocking and predictable considering the age of cell
Phones, etc. A five is deserving cause it's just an average movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 February 2021,,"I knew Many people were unsatisfied with its ending. I knew it wasn't going to be perfect, but then I found myself enjoying it so much that its downfall really saddened me.
I could let the futility of her stunts go, I didn't feel it was dragging, I enjoyed silly things like the pharmacy scene because it made us think that she was willing to believe things might be OK after all, but then things changed... especifically at the cabin. The acting of the two actors who have played Veronica Mars' love interests is plain awful... especially the non-existing tears of Chris Lowell in bed. And then, we get to wedding text messages...(A) I didn't mind the tape reveal, but how is it possible that the man who said that loved Cassie would not remember watching the rape of the friend HE even brought up when they ran into each other??? and (B) how does he turn into a completely rotten seed all of the sudden? He said he loved her, he was pining for her (and hurt) but he wouldn't say a word to the police after her disappearence? Come on! Aren't there shades of grey in here? It feels like this only happened to allow the ""gotcha"" moment with the texts but that only works if she's dead.
Why do we need it then?Why does she have to die to make a point about society? I have read that it's because ""she hates herself the most"". Why??? We never have a full picture of her to understand why she would... was she feeling this responsible just because she did not go with her friend to that party? If she was ready to leave this world, I'm suuuuuuuuure she would have had plenty of options with the many violent creeps she surely ran into in one of her night ""stunts"". If it's a critic to the lack of response of the ""system"", why would she count on them for this final act?I just find myself filling so many blanks, which hurt the experience even more.And finally, I ran into the controversy around the Variety review written by a 60-year-old gay man, who Mulligan said ""was being sexist"" for stating a rather obvious thing:
""Mulligan, a fine actress, seems a bit of an odd choice as this admittedly many-layered apparent femme fatale - Margot Robbie is a producer here, and one can (perhaps too easily) imagine the role might once have been intended for her. Whereas with this star, Cassie wears her pickup-bait gear like bad drag; even her long blonde hair seems a put-on. The flat American accent she delivers in her lowest voice register likewise seems a bit meta, though it's not quite clear what the quote marks around this performance signify"". He is not wrong. It does not mean that she's bad at it (this is the second character of her that I have seen not at the brink of crying the entire time), but nevertheless one does wonder what Margot Robbie could have brought to the table, perhaps more joy? Who knows! But even the stripper costume screams ""Harley freaking Quinn"". The comparison is not far-fetched."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 September 2021,5/10,"A quality screenwriter could have made the great premise more plausible and seamless. There are just too many plot holes to overlook for an intelligent person to enjoy the film. For example, in the end, there is absolutely no way that dozens of police officers would rush to the wedding and arrest the groom. The investigation would take months or years. They had no idea that a crime had even occurred but they arrest him for murder of a specific person who they didn't even know was dead. The main character was also inconsistent. You cannot be a sociopath one day and caring the next day. The mind does not work that way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 March 2021,10/10,This was amazing move. Main character was born for this role. This movie had nothing to do people pushing feminism on people and making men look bad. I'm a guy and I've been around lot of things and been in collage and collage parties and did my share of partying. What you see in this movie happens pretty often. This was just an amazing amazing movie.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,7/10,"The movie has to by nature, respectfully toe the line dealing with this sensitive subject regardless of genre classification - which it does for the most part. Sexual predation especially during the time period of the main character's life and particularly in a post-secondary education setting, is something that is too common and brushed off to a point of desensitization. There are severe repercussions on the victims and those around them and this film is an impactful representation of how the mental consequences in victims can manifest in various ways. It cannot be described in any act of blame, shame, grief, or revenge - but in a whirlwind blend of ""all of the above"".As a former resident advisor at a university, any report of assault is to be taken extremely seriously. The supporting characters such as the Dean and Madison are the perfect metaphor that reveals ""crying wolf"" cannot appear in anyone's lexicon - be it a friend, figure of authority, or lawyer... there is morality and justice to be gleaned from all sides of the problem and I respect the film for its encouragement in bringing these conversations forward.While the overarching story is satisfying, the part where (minor spoiler) Cassie takes the Dean's daughter to the diner to ploy the Dean into breaking down and admitting indifference towards Nina's assault was a plot hole that I managed to suspend until after reflecting upon of the movie. You could stretch it to say that you can reveal flaws in the leading character (in fact the film encourages you to attach some moral ambiguity to her character at times à la Walter White, but not as extreme) and I comprehend the point it was driving home, but unfortunately I can only reflect on it and say...""isn't that just straight-up kidnapping and if I were the Dean I'd totally report that?"" Her character, while minor, was also not ""followed up"" on by the ending and served as consequence-free plot device.Story aside or any flaw within, I think Bo Burnham's acting was the real standout here. His character, while underdeveloped, was a perfect match. It would bode well for him to star in more genre films that show off his strange yet gentle humor and I think it's time for him to emerge fully from the ""New Math"" chrysalis.Production value was also on-point - at no time did I feel like there was a forced tonal shift and managed to balance out dark humor, drama without ever being too funny or disturbing - again, toeing those lines is a delicate balancing act and the film does it well."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 April 2021,6/10,"As I was watching the rating on this movie.. I was basically shock by all the nomination garnered by this oneIt was an okay film with lots of bubblegum pop song and certain plot is quite shocking but as a whole this is still considered a revenge movie where the girl her sweet revenge.After I watched it I can't stop myself comparing it to kill bill, I spit on your grave, Lady snowblood and a few moreIt was good but not great Carey mulligan were cast against type not her usual role. I haven't watched nomadland yet but of all the nominee other than nomadland she is just better than none of themThe movie is just like a CW teen series with a twist that all nothing really to shout about.. not one scene you can discuss with a friend after watching it may be the opening scene but that's it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,9/10,"It's very hard to review this movie without going into spoilers, so consider this a double warning. Watch this movie, you won't regret it.So this film is about rape culture, essentially, and how common it is in society. We follow Cassie, a woman who acts as a vigilante trying to catch out men who take advantage of drunk women at bars. The film is quite clever in that it doesn't reveal much in what she actually does. She keeps a log of every person she's caught, and uses different coloured pens, but we never know what the pens mean. Do they mean people she killed vs let go? Who knows?Anyway, we discover that while she works at a cafe, she used to go to a prestigious medical school and was, alongside her friend Nina, among the top of her class. However, when Nina is taken advantage of at a college party by a group of boys, and consequently commits suicide (it's not explicitly stated but heavily implied that this happened) that prompts Cassie to drop out suddenly, causing her to spiral into a depression, as well as her vigilante antics.At the beginning of the movie, she meets Ryan (played by the wonderful Bo Burnham), an ex classmate at medical school and current Pediatric Surgeon, who asks her out, and for a while gives her enough faith in men to drop her vigilante act, but when another female classmate gives her a video recorded of Nina's rape, she discovers that Ryan was at the party where it happened.I found this incredibly thought provoking, in that even the nicest guys, who always ask for consent and never directly treat women badly themselves, might be hiding secrets of the abusers. It asks the audience to really think to themselves about what is more important, and whether or not those friends deserve that sort of protection.Which leads us to the ending, where Cassie disguises herself as a stripper to infiltrate the bachelor party of the man who raped Nina, now a successful doctor marrying a model. This was set up as the ultimate wish fulfilment fantasy of every rape victim. It reminded me most of that sequence from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but in a shocking twist, she fails, and is killed instead. The rapist and his scumbag best friend burn her body in attempts to hide the evidence of the crime, and the wedding continues as planned.I have a personal pet theory that in the first draft, or maybe even the initial cut of the film, that it ended here, on a sour, glum note that is quite realistic, but that probably didn't test well with audiences, so they added a much more bittersweet ending, where Cassie, predicting that she might die, sets up a contingency plan that allowed officers to find enough evidence to arrest the men involved in her death and coverup.My main critique of this film is tonal inconsistency. This is a very dark film overall, but has several more light, comedic moments, with the casting of Bo as the loveable boyfriend with a horrible secret, and Laverne Cox as Cassie's friend and boss at the cafe she works at, and some goofy cameos of the scumbag men who try to rape her in her sting operations, which can throw some people for a loop. However, I really enjoyed it despite this. I think this movie is provocative, at times funny, and very clever in its subversions of expectations of the rape revenge genre."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 April 2021,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is a movie that starts with a question of character and ends with a satisfaction of story. Starting from the first arc, going through the second arc and then end with the third arc, director Emerald Fennell did a really good job with all of them. Mixed with the direction, the camera work and the cinematography put so much more soul into the
movie which was already filled. Carey Mulligan's acting is just phenomenal at every single point of the movie. Though this movie doesn't stand out as something really new in terms of story or the concept, but the way the director wrote and directed the movie and the way the actors portray their roles specially the lead cast, it makes this movie a unique one among it's companions. In the end it's a movie some people will just watch for once but for some people it's more than just one time watch. In the both cases the audience will definitely get connected with movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,7/10,"The first half was boring and slow. The main character is portrayed as always in a bad mood, unexplicably rude, never smiling, unambitious, unappreciative, and uninteresting.She spends her nights at bars and clubs pretending to be drunk and vulnerable. Only to see how many pigs try to take advantage of her. She spends her days working at a coffee shop being rude to the customers. All the male characters are portrayed as sex addicted predators who want to rape drunk women. Or as a self deprecating douchbag who, when he's not apologizing for being a loser, is begging for dates. I know from experience, no woman is interested in that. Not even those that have been physically traumatized.These are the unrealistic movie cliches you are dealing with for the first half of the movie.
I actually fell asleep during the first half of the movie because it was so slow and uninteresting. I turned it off, watched the evening news, read the reviews, and decided to give it another chance. I was in and out during the first half of the second viewing, just trying to catch the parts I missed.The second half was better when the main character starts exacting her revenge on the people who wronged her and her best friend.
Hopefully people understand this is not a ""how to"" on how to pay back those that have wronged you in real life. But it makes for good cathartic entertainment.The second half is good. The first half is boring, slow and uninteresting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,10/10,"I was absolutely devoured and blown away by this undeniably fantastic movie experience.
It's original, suspenseful, touching, thrilling, lovely, sad, funny ... and delivers one of the best actress performances I've seen in the last decade. Thumbs up for Carey Mulligan who finally showed us what is she really capable of.
Finally a movie depicting men as evil without being an anti men gender propaganda.
Hope we will see more movies, stories and characters like this one.
In the mean time I'll definitely re-watch it with my wife."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,8/10,"Initial Thoughts:
""Promising Young Woman"" promises to be a great movie. It takes a subject that is usually the subject of controversy and grabs you by the face and says, ""Do you get it now!?""The first thing that came to mind when the movie started is that the director is wasting no time in getting the point across. It brings us into the middle of the dark issue of rape right off the bat that there's no time to think about what you got yourself into. The movie then takes this energy and momentum and runs with it for a good portion of the first hour, at which point, it slows down just enough to enjoy the scenery of revenge. As the movie continues to truck along we get to a point where the scenery has become a blur. Emotions are on full effect as the finale nears, but as we get there we realize, we're at the end and there's no going back....While the film takes a good pace, I'd like to take a moment as Carey Mulligan, our lead, does a fantastic job of acting as a mischievous, almost delusional woman, who's anything but. The thing I enjoyed most about this film is that it took a dark, and sometimes, ""controversial"" subject and brought it to light with emotional power without ever having to depict the actual act. Yes, there are scenes which lead up to rape in some instances, but this film never has to needlessly put the actions in to get the message across. You know what's happening.***To note*** Saying rape is controversial in this review is due to the fact that there have been times when allegations of individuals has been true, but due to profile have failed to be convicted, or not convicted to the extent they should have been. I do not condone rape and would encourage anyone to not be a bystander should they ever be a witness to it.Overall:
This is a great film. If you're looking for a new movie to watch that's impactful and has a message that can speak volumes through emotional acting, this is for you.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is a resounding 'YES!'Enjoy the show!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 August 2021,10/10,"I think this is the first 10/10 review I have ever given but this movie deserves it in spades.It is beautiful to look at, fun and horrifying at the same time, and takes on a topic that we'd all rather look away from than confront. (Just ask anyone in Hollywood during the 90s. Everyone knew about Harvey Wienstein but it took a groundswell of women to take him down.)My longer, more thoughtful review was taken down (probably by some incel.)IMDB is turning into a severely angry and disturbing place."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 July 2021,8/10,"War of the roses, battle of the sexes, whatever you call it, it's a great movie with a subtle approach to sexism, feminism and everything related. Maybe a bit biased but in a world full of discrimination such approaches may lead to something superior, in all of us!A really unique flick!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,9/10,"I don't know where to start. I had zero expectations going into this movie. I knew very little about it EXCEPT that Carey Mulligan and Emerald Fennell are both very British so imagine my surprise when I saw that the movie takes place in the US.So many things struck me. Cassie's parental home felt so huge and full of old fashioned decor yet felt so empty. And when her old friend comes over you see her looking around the living room almost in disgust. Spitting in the Ryan's coffee. Ugh. The use of music esp. Brittany Spears' Toxic in a violin version I've never heard of but which was extremely effective. The revenge scenes with her female friend, the Dean at the university and the lawyer. So good!The ending truly shocked me. I see that Emerald wanted the scene to be authentic and last 2.5 minutes like it would in real life but so many emotions went through my head. Very chilling yet so well done. I can't stop thinking about it.Also shocking to me is seeing what we would consider ""nice"" guys going over to the dark side inc. Ryan, who protects himself, his rapist friend and accomplices over Cassie whom he purports to love. But the rich white guys with great careers ahead of them do get away with crap and terrible behaviour. We've seen that play out time and time in real life. But it did seem that all men - except maybe Cassie's Dad - really got a bad rap in this movie and it made me feel uncomfortable.However, it was very well done and I'm proud of Emerald, someone I've only seen in Call the Midwife and The Crown, that she both wrote AND directed such a thought-provoking and strong film. I am very pleased she won Best Screenplay at the Oscars and was nominated for Best Director. I can't wait to see what she does in the future."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,8/10,"A dark yet engaging approach to a very serious topic, I can't lie I was hooked from the start, regardless of how controversial this will be I actually felt this was a good way to convey its message.I had no expectations going into this movie, it's award season and I saw this as one of the nominees for best movie in the upcoming Oscars so I wanted to check it, Promising Young Woman tells the story of a you woman (of course) on a revenge path against men that take advantage of vulnerable women. Her reasons are explored throughout the movie, essentially she is an almost vigilante individual who pretends to be vulnerable every night in various clubs and bars, in order to punish predators.Seems cheesy? Well actually not, as the story unfolds we not only understand the main characters reasoning behind her life choices but also, we begin to understand how accepted behavior in our society can actually be quite cruel and twisted. It's not news that misogamy and gender inequality is real and systemic, we are sometimes unaware of how strongly these concepts are still present unless maybe if we are personally affected by it - but this movie for me at least, actually reminded me in a way of how bad things still are.I want to point out Carey's performance, I had seen her in previous works but she didn't leave an impression to me, but she is the force that drives this plot, the emotional range she demonstrates and the badass persona she had to become, make a perfect balance to the character and Carey delivers.
You might argue that such a serious subject should be taken lightly but I disagree, I believe that movies as an art form can and do have the power of statements, and to different audiences, that statement can also be delivered in a different format, and to me the message on this one was loud and clear, and at no point I felt it was exaggerated or politically motivated.The ending is indeed a bit shocking and after some thoughts I am still uncertain on how I feel about it, since the tone of the movie was so well between the dark comedy and the serious tone, I felt that the shock effect might not have been well placed - or maybe it should've, I am a bit divided, hence not a highest score.
Still, a fantastic and entertaining flick!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 May 2021,5/10,Didn't finish Nomadland.Minari made no sense.Better than both those movies.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 July 2021,,Every young woman should watch this movie. The message behind this movie is real. 7.5/10 for the movie 8/10 for acting.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,4/10,"I agree with other reviewers here. This movie had a lot of potential but it pulled up short. What we needed to see was the lead pushed to the extreme and degenerating into a psychopath. Either that or see her go down a braver, more positive route. In the current form the movie is uncomfortably middle-of-the-road, not cartoony enough, but also not realistic enough. Essentially it's a story about human failure, none of the characters are likeable, nobody does the brave thing, and ultimately the viewer is left feeling cheated. Basically I didn't take anything positive away from this.The movie needed to either:
a) Make Cassie out for justice in a real way, but not at the cost of ruining her life.
or b) Make Cassie a vengeful heroine, a warrior.
Unfortunately they went with c) Cassie is a disturbed victim in a weird mash of a movie with romcom elements."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 February 2021,7/10,"Usually I don't like this kind of movies, but this one was extremely well made so I cannot complain about anything. The casting is great, Carey is absolutely perfect in this movie. Definitely a 7.5 movie. I recommend it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,7/10,"This movie starts with an intoxicated woman who can't keep her legs shut. That is all you need to know. This movie teases you for two hours that it's going to do, show or twist you in some kind of way, but it builds up to a big disappointment.Carey Mulligan is about as sexy as you can get and is oozing crazy, but again, I just wasn't sold. Despite was reviewers are saying, I would have made this way darker, almost like a female ""Joker"". I would have followed through on the promise of threat and harm and showed that I have the intent to be everything I set out to be.This movie had true classic potential, but lived up to none of it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 March 2021,9/10,"As a general rule, you can look forward to a film, but you should never go in with expectations that are too high. In the case of Emerald Fennell's black comedy revenge-thriller Promising Young Woman, however, any expectations are justified and it must be with the devil if you leave the cinema disappointed. The story about 30-year-old Med School dropout Cassie, who leads a kind of double life after a traumatic event long ago, is original, involving and deals with a very important social issue.Carey Mulligan is known to most from her breakthrough film An Education as the kindly but rebellious Jenny or from her somewhat dimwitted role in The Great Gatsby. Here she takes an absolute quantum leap in terms of acting and Mulligan succeeds brilliantly. She plays a poor soul who actually longs for love and affection but, because of her mission, doesn't let any real emotions get to her. Casey Thomas is a fascinating character in that, despite her questionable and sometimes bitterly evil actions, she is always aware of the situation. In one scene she responds to the statement ""You're insane"" without batting an eyelid with ""No, I honestly don't think I am"". No line could describe Casey better. In a world full of sexist machos, she's out for revenge for much of the film, except when confronted with her sudden love interest Ryan. Played by Bo Burnham, the young doctor comes across as the perfect Good Guy, completely refraining from physical advances in order to gain Casey's affection. Mulligan and Burnham share electrifying chemistry in every scene together, highlighted with their witty and almost toxic dialogues. Rounding out the all-around stellar performances of the cast are characters like Casey's parents Susan (Jennifer Coolidge) and Stanley (Clancy Brown), who are distraught with their daughter's condition but love her dearly. Alfred Molina has only a handful of scenes as the depressed lawyer Jordan Green, but shines with much vulnerability. Chris Lowell, Max Greenfield and Alison Brie all play certain antagonists from Casey's mysterious past. Interestingly, they are all usually seen in straight comedic roles.Not too much can actually be said about the plot of Promising Young Woman, because the film is one of the most unpredictable and shocking thrillers in recent years in the way it is made. It is very fast-paced and always colourful and flashy, which gives you a somewhat distorted picture of this genre. In general, it is not a pure thriller. It has many funny and even sweet, rom-com-like moments. Beneath its surface, however, it is bitterly nasty and Fennell manages to reflect the theme of sexual abuse in both subtle and obvious ways, which is very good for the balance of the film. The ending is probably one of the strangest of the year and will leave some confused and possibly even underwhelmed. However, Mulligan's best career performance, the multi-faceted and brilliantly written script and its uniqueness and imperfection make Promising Young Woman one of the most important films of the year that will be in discussion for a long time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,9/10,"It is incredible that women still need to prove over and over how much man violates their rights of being a woman. This is another movie to remind man like me that we are dealing with human beings who carry scars throughout their life when they are sexually, mentally assaulted."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 August 2021,9/10,"This movie unravelled so well. Kept you wondering and so invested in the main character throughout. Kept you guessing and wanting to unpick the story at foot. But also makes you reflect on yourself, social situations and what defines a ""good guy"". It reminds you that there are so many layers to people and you definitely can't judge people off of appearances and first impressions. Really good movie. Good ending but I was left wanting even more justice/retribution which was my only gripe."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 September 2021,7/10,"The subject matter is still sadly something that still needs to be taken seriously in today's society. Needs to be shown especially to college & high school students. Carrie did such a great job, I've never seen her play anything similar to this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 May 2021,9/10,"I'll have spoilers here!!Loved this movie. I'm a man, fortunately never been a victim of sexual abuse, yet was shaken by the end of the film. So many powerful things about this movie- both Cassie and Nina lost their lives to this crime- Nina by suicide and I can argue Cassie lost it before her actual death- it happened when the system didn't give her friend justice and she slipped into depression and apathy. That's the story of many women who don't report rape or don't get justice when they do.I don't remember the word ""rape"" ever mentioned once in the film even though the whole film circles around it. Sometimes the word sticks to your mind longer when you think of it rather having it said to you, I assume that's what the writer thought?I loved the emphasis on ""good guys"". Many rapists are often otherwise ""nice guys"" with stable relationships and happy children yet they committed their crimes and got away with it because they seemed like good guys or ""promising young men"". Even her boyfriend Ryan seemed like an amazing guy until he started giving excuses for what happened to Nina and defending his own friend.I remembered the words of Egyptian activist Mona Eltahawy who once asked ""how many men must we kill before they stop raping us""?Seeing Cassie getting murdered was hard to watch, but a necessary part of the movie. It's interesting how they kept the scene of her murder to the minute she took her last breath but they didn't show a second of the actual sexual assault on tape. Is this a message that death by asphyxia is still less painful than rape?Excellent thought-provoking movie in my opinion. I question if it would've been more powerful if Dr. Alex Monroe wasn't caught at the end, and he continued with his wedding as usual? Perhaps they added that bit of satisfactory ending to please the audience a little bit and give them some hope."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,9/10,"Once upon a time Cassandra was a promising young woman who was a brilliant medical university student. But it was all gone overnight. Now Cassie wanders the city streets at night, letting herself be taken home by strange men - all a part of an elaborate revenge plan... as people from her past re-surface and a chance of romance comes her way, will Cassie be able to leave her grudge behind and start anew?It is hard to write a synopsis for PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN as almost everything may be considered a spoiler. It's that kind of story! The film has generated a lot of anger as it shows men in the worst possible light. However Director Emerald Fennell must be applauded for showing that abusers have no gender (two of the four film's main villains are female). Even our heroine Cassandra is a sort of an anti-hero, although our sympathies are always on her side.This story is made complex by its script, that gives us only bits of information about what happened to Cassie in the past and what her intentions are.An important part of the film is its soundtrack- clever upbeat covers of famous hits have an interesting double meaning, enhancing the scenes.If not for the snappy dialogue, quirky characters and a sharp, not-a-scene-wasted script, this would be just one in a row of many rape-revenge thrillers that come cheap by the dozen. Instead PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN is wickedly funny, sometimes shocking, often sad, but always an irresistible thriller that pretends to be a comedy about the war of genders.Constantly reinventing itself, building on its irony and comedy sketches, the movie delivers its sucker punch when you least expect it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 January 2021,9/10,"I literally went into this not really knowing what it was about. I also thought from all of the buzz that this was going to be another overhyped award nominated movie, which for me usually ends up being a letdown.This little revenge drama, thriller and at some points despite the subject even humorous totally blew me away for a few reasons. I won't spoil anything, but this was truly unique, shocking, surprising with an amazing cast, great soundtrack and you wait for the kicker at the end.Hands down the best movie I've watched in such a long time. The reaction I felt is how I wish I felt about every movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,6/10,"Mulligan is brilliant in this one, she is cute and funny, and her character is likable. However, she is not enough to save this movie from a weak screenplay."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 March 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman is my new favourite film of 2020/1. A huge part of what makes a 'great film' is to take a topic you do not necessarily enjoy or a topic that is seldom tackled, and turning into something objectively enjoyable. Thanks to Emerald Fennell's direction and a phenomenal Carey Mulligan performance, I can safely say that this is a great film. I think the pacing and buildup in this film is under looked. Having just watched The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) as part of my best picture nominee binge, I will compare it to that. To me, Chicago 7 suffers from too many halts in the progression of the story, making scenes memorable instead of the film as a whole. Promising Young Woman is the opposite. The entire film works as a steady build up, using both the soundtrack and story development to take us to the amazing final scene, which you just can't not love. Speaking of the soundtrack, it's just awesome. It fits the tone perfectly, and it is filled with songs that I haven't heard in a while, but nonetheless are all great. I'll be honest, I think this doesn't stand a chance against Nomadland for best picture, much to my dismay. However, if Carey Mulligan doesn't win best actress, I will be personally offended. There you go Academy, that's an incentive. Seriously though you have got to watch this film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 March 2021,7/10,"Vengeance is rarely so patient and clever. Mulligan gave it her best, but this is not the film that will get her the Oscar. This is the #MeToo movie that shines light on men's power versus women's word and the film is most powerful when revealing the tragedy of that fact.Using a glorious Wagner interlude during the roadside hissy-fit scene was an amusing bit, although Wagner himself would be outraged."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,8/10,"I knew a little about the film just from an interview and it wasn't that much of a spoiler per se.So when the film starts and goes on for the first half hour, I found it unsettling, as if something really nasty was about to happen.Whether it does or does not is not for me to say.What I can say is that as the film develops, the story becomes more intriguing and starts to come together.The ending is unexpected but satisfying in that it concludes and ties up the story well.I really don't want to say anything more than simply how it deals with the male characters who, on the whole, are real ****ing a*** h****.I am a man and I did stupid things in my life BUT never as awful as some of these people and I know many people whom are like me. We are not a*** h*** men.BUT that is not the point.The film is a hyper look at the issue of how society treats women. How we treat men with kid gloves and women as lying. It has to use a*** h*** men to exemplify the points it is making.In the #METOO generation, which has shone (and rightly so) a bright light on the issue of misogyny, this looks at all parties who are complicit in the destruction of women's lives and careers (simply by not believing them) and allow perpetrators to simply walk away (even when evidence is so readily available).And that unsettling 30 minute start was just that, I am glad they never went into the actual event in explicit detail. The mere fact it occurred and all the repercussions, of that event, is what the story is about.I'm a child of the 70s (so not a young whippersnapper) and those who have the opinion that this film is woke, feminist, BLM, antifa propaganda for a snowflake generation, when in the past you just got on with it, to those people, I feel the movie made it's a point.Which is simply Go **** yourself....and frankly You should if you are that person.What happened in the past should be accounted for. Guilty individuals should be brought to task.I thought, overall, it was an interesting and different film. Worth watching (unless of course you are an a*** h*** - then find a Steven Seagal film to watch)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 October 2021,4/10,A good concept weakly done. Very little to keep one's interest. I fell alseep a few times. Ending is disappointing and unfulfilling. So much so that you feel cheated.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,The ending leaves you a bit disappointed but I guess that's the catharsis. A fun watch. Carey Mulligan is great. Sometimes the films surprise you. It's one of those films that surprise u specially in the end. Left me kind of like 'oh'.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,7/10,"The movie seems ok, I absolutely thought it's going to end a lot sooner. It would have been a drama. A one timer, but it was fine.But to give us a twist at the end, it kept going.. I was wanting it to end, but the end kinda saved the movie.
Why? Because the directing was ok-ish. The characters were bad beside the main character and the dean.
I say that the actors were bad except Carey, she was doing good.Otherwise the story was not good, not a well-written piece of art.Yes, I'd say that the ending and Carey saved the movie.
It is a very weak 7 for me.
I highly disagree with any nominations this movie received.
It would be a shame if the movie would receive any Academy Award nominations."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,8/10,"I really enjoyed this film . It was not what I expected . I expected Last Seduction but got more I Spit in your Grave and The Brave One .
The film also had elements of Looking for Mr Goodbar with Carey's character going out to nightclubs .
The film does contain several twists and although I didn't like what occurred just before the ending the final scene of the film was excellent.
The music in the film is very good . Performances by Carey Mulligan ( It wouldn't surprise me if she wins best actress at the oscars ) and Bo Burnham are very good while Alfred Moina does a great job in the small and important role that he has in the film .
Well worth a watch ."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,9/10,"Emerald Fennell's directional debut plus crew brought an unforgettable triggering thriller. What a movie! but at first I didn't think it was going to be good because, in the first few seconds of the film, the dancing scene was not captivating especially with that song. Though after those quick seconds, I was so engaged in the story. The first shot of the main character and the chosen song gave her a menace presence and I just knew at that moment that it was going to be a film to remember. The pace of the story was perfect it gave such a strong build-up to the suspense, everything was unfolding with a creeping chill on every corner.This was a dark theme in which touches reality, men take advantage of women, and how they get away with it. It explores the way how men excuse themselves for being targeted and making women the fault of their actions by the way they get drunk or the clothes they wear. People have the right to drink or to wear what they want, what this world needs are not men who prey on them, it needs gentlemen. This story was a work of art, how it flips the switch on making her prey on those kinds of men. There were two high points in the film the first was predictable but the second it wasn't and how brilliant it was. I also love all the things she did, not only in the name of women, but it was also all due to the strong friendship and that love made her do so many thrilling things. I was in awe of her and the length she has gone through for her revenge. The message of this film was powerful and greatly projected.The composer Anthony Willis sets so many emotions with his music. He delivered the sinister and the romance with such beauty and also a thrilling atmosphere.The cast was all magnificent especially Carey Mulligan! Her performance was one to always remember, her presence of intimidation was greatly felt and her revenge for love was so consuming. I have watched her in other good films, and she is a good actor but this one was the one that I was completely engaged in her performance."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 June 2021,8/10,"Not perfect and it definitely had it's slow moments but you could tell this movie was done with a lot of passion by people who really care about the subject matter. I think all the negative reviewers are missing the point though - this was not meant to be a ""feel good"" kind of movie. It's sole purpose is to teach guys a lesson. To make them pause for a second and think twice about their actions. It's not a big budget production but I think they did the best with what they had and I really enjoyed it. Worth the watch for sure!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 June 2021,7/10,"I honestly can't understand where the censors saw strong violence in this film .... Violence is practically absent and even sex is always off screen and it's one of the reasons why I liked the film, but not the I loved, now let me explain:
The film, in the trailers, in the interviews is presented as a revenge movie in the wake of the much more interesting Hard Candy by David Slade, in fact I expected that the character of Carey Mulligan (very talented and extraordinary, nothing to say about her) was a executioner who imprisoned and killed sexual predators, but none of this happens, the film is not a thriller, perhaps a crime drama, but it has little or nothing of thriller, except perhaps the ending.Honestly, despite being a good movie, I don't think it deserved the Oscar, the academy awards is no longer reliable since 1998 (when it awarded Best Picture Life is Beautiful directed by that idiot Benigni and did not award Saving Private Ryan MAESTRO Spielberg) and also the Oscar a Young promising woman is proof of this, besides there is really too much feminism and inequality in this film, the men are ALL bad and slimy, the women ALL good and heroines.Overall my rating is 7/10 for the direction of Fennell who is solid and rhythmic and the talent of Mulligan, but it could have been done much better."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 November 2021,9/10,"What a ride this movie is. For once i honestly had no idea where it would take me. And that ending... damn.I wont say much else cause you need to watch it yourself, but if you like revenge movies and want one that is a little bit different, this is for you.It can be a tough watch for some and it is an emotional rollercoaster, but i for one like when a movie really hits you and this one does.... hard."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 February 2021,10/10,I really liked the movie. Made me think how women have to deal with such kind of men in the society. Great acting by the actors and the ending left me speechless. I wonder what she had planned to do with Al and would have happened after that cause ending was unfortunate and unexpected
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,8/10,"I'm 41 and I love mostly thriller, action and horror movies. I don't watch romance and many modern comedies as they are just too phoned in nowadays.This movie isn't horror, but more of a thriller/dark humor.Carey Mulligan's performance was incredibly solid. She's a great actress and has been in a few movies I really liked. The story is broken up into 5 ""acts"", labeled as I, II, III, etc. At first, I thought the movie was good. Good pacing, solid acting, good characters. Toward the middle I was like, ehhh...she's a sociopath and needs help. Kinda had mixed feelings about it then. But kept on trucking. But then act IIII blew me away with a great ending and overall very satisfying feeling. As a whole I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Oh and thanks HBO Max for giving me 6 months for 50% off otherwise I probably would've never had the chance to watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,9/10,"I so love watching Carey, she is brilliant. Sad tale but so watchable."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,"What an outstanding script, acting (Carey especially), a dark contemporary story that will make you think, feel compassion and vengeful at the same time.
Definitely a psychological masterpiece, a must to be watched through till the end.
Well done to the director too!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 May 2021,3/10,"Sadly, we are back to the 80s and 90s when directors thought that music and sound effects should SCREAM and dialog should w..h..i..s..p..e..r. And this is not the first one of the late crop to do it. But it loses 4 stars for forcing me to keep the remote in my hand to ride the gain up and down continuously. Then, we are also back in that same time period with a story that just starts cold. You don't know the people, you don't know the motivation and you have no idea where the story is going so you are distracted by all of that and have lots of trouble collecting all the players and facts that you need to enjoy the story. So we are here with our eardrums under attack and our brains left out of the process by a backstory that only happens an hour into the movie. The, it was so very weak till the end. Just kinda phoning it in as they say. I almost quit watching but wanted to see where the writer took it. Reasonably satistying ending, I guess, but I was left unimpressed since there was such potential here. Nice photography, good looking actors that were doing their jobs but the script left them lacking anything to bite in to. Sad. Like Even Horizon. Excellent sets and acting but no story. I came to be relax, enjoy and be told a story. They have forgotten that these days. Now you have to work and dig and come out tired of having to do the work the writing was paid to do. I PAID, you do the work and give me a good proeuct! Not here, sadly..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 November 2021,9/10,"This is a movie that, like it's main protagonist, played brilliantly by Carrie Mulligan, creeps up you unexpectedly, and then totally amazes with audacity and imagination. I must say, for the first half an hour I wasn't so sure. It all seemed a bit self conscious and one sided, but once the plot got going it became a brilliantly perceptive movie which has a lot to say to us all about modern relationships and attitudes, though particularly in colleges/universities in the US. It's also a cleverly original thriller with tremendous screenplay and direction by Emerald Fennell."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 February 2021,7/10,"Promising young woman isn't your typical popcorn revenge thriller. It requires your attention, your brains and doesn't really spoon feed you anything and that I really appreciated and loved. It is clear that there were higher artistic ambitions involved and in that way I think the movie really succeeds. The cinematography is really beautiful, loved the camera work, locations, emphasis on colours, costumes and great soundtrack. The topic is handled very delicately, plot is engaging, the movie has a nice flow to it but there is something missing for me. The characters were a little undeveloped and some actions and motivations of the main character seemed unlikely. We never really find out much about anyone including her. Did I care for her though? Absolutely I did. Cassie is so unorthodox, magnetic and funny yet very emotionally competent and morally developed and most of all brilliantly portrayed by Carey Mulligan who gave an amazing performance worthy of academy award."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,8/10,"Well done for a debut! Revenge is indeed a dish served cold. Great acting, directing and story. At the end I realized she's been dead for years, so dying was just expected and why not even planned?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,9/10,Emerald Fennel wrote a great screenplay and did a fine job directing her work. Most writer/directors are too close to it and can't see the mistakes.Carey Mulligan shone in this role and played Cassie to perfection. I bet she had a blast doing it too.It is interesting to get a female take on a situation that just about every woman has had to deal with at least once in here life. The behaviour behind closed doors of so called nice guys. Cassie knows how to deal with them. A very sweet revenge flix that had me cheering for her.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,7/10,"This movie had soo much potential but somewhere along the way it gets confused with what it wants to say, what it wants to do and what it wants to show. And even though it starts strong it starts to unravel with an unrewarding conclusion.The lead was well portrayed and from the outset (without knowing too much about her past) felt that after she lost her friend she also lost herself. In some regard this set the tone for her subsequent actions and life choices but at some point you wanted some answers, to know the purpose and the why which is never really given or explored. This is also reflected in the direction and timing of events in the film. If she was out to avenge or get revenge then shouldn't the focus be on those responsible not the mishmash of randoms that don't matter as much?The introduction of the love interest also seems a bit trite, is over-acted and obvious of intent with its outcome setting up the final act (the film is split into five) which unfortunately is a bit of a letdown.Appreciate that she effectively 'died' when her friend did, and if her convoluted actions resulted in her death then it wouldn't be an issue for her. Her life was over anyway. What didn't make sense with the conclusion was that she orchestrated it knowing that she would die which didn't match the actual event (which she was completely in control of) or the impassive journey that she had been on for so long."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 July 2021,1/10,"This movie is repetitive, immature drivel which barely scratches the surface of its own subject matter. A previous review of mine was deleted, for whatever reason. The reviews for this movie are being heavily curated. Just a warning."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 November 2021,9/10,"This was just so god damm good and as a debut work, bloody exceptional. The fact that the politics of Hollywood meant that Nomadland and Zhaou took the prizes is criminal; Nomadland is boring, this is enthralling from the opening scene, Zhaou's direction is pedestrian, Fennell directs with a crispness and assertiveness that is a joy to behold.The basic plot is as described by IMDB so nothing else to say but Fennell's take on the revenge thriller is unique, avoiding the clichés and mixing humour, romance and kitsch with the dark. Carey Mulligan is exceptional giving reign to the whole range of emotions, the joy of love, the psychosis of repressed grief, the enjoyment of power, definitely an Oscar winner.If you are a bloke you might feel threatened by this and you might say guys like this don't exist, well don't be threatened and yes you do know guys like these."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,I love unique stories and indie films but this one takes the cake! Haven't seen a truly good movie that forces you in and takes you on an emotional ride. So good! Worth every cent.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 April 2021,10/10,I hated the ending but then I loved it!!!! Well done!!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,7/10,"A beautiful but damaged woman pretends to be drunk so she can trap men trying to take advantage of her and fills a notebook with scores without one of them beating her to a pulp, raping her or laughing her out of the room. Massive suspension of belief required for this one plus plot holes you can drive a truck through. Other than that, of the 5 Best Picture nominees I've watched this season this one is by far the most entertaining and received my highest rating, which kind of gives you an idea of the sad sack kind of a year we had in movies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 November 2021,5/10,"In this film, almost all men are rapists or those who enable rapists. Yes, there are men that are that way and shining a light on that is important, but I much would have preferred a more realistic, balanced view of things. At times, I wasn't sure if it was meant as satire. The first 2/3 of the film is alright but the messaging is super heavy handed. We get it, we get it. It's really too bad because the last 1/3 is actually very good and very smart. The way things come together and the outcome of it all would have been so much powerful if the first 2/3 had been done in a more realistic way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 December 2021,1/10,"This movie is exactly what WOKE and PC Hollow-wood is all about. A slow burn movie that will take you in a dull mood, you just wait impatiently for the cringe to finish. So in a nutshell, just blame Men for all the problems, ofcrse the SuperWehman RevengePo++ is classic and the ending is idiotic x 10.Poor acting and the direction is as lame as you can imagine, avoid watching at all costs and leave this movie for the Wokeys!WASTE OF TIME NONSENSE."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,5/10,Good start but boring ending. Real disappointment.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 May 2021,9/10,"One of the best revenge movie I watched in a recent time. I think modern time best revenge movie in my opinion. So, Now I'm talking about this movie. This movie premise is very simple 30 years old woman who lost her best friend in school time. Then she wants revenge her best friend's death. But the most special thing about this film is that Whenever you are watching this movie then you think that it will happen now it will happen but it does not happen. Which I think is the best point of this movie. Especially when you see the end of this movie then you think that its end will be like this but it is not the end of this movie, which I think is the best thing in this movie. This movie direction is brilliantly done, No Doubt. If you watch something new in revenge movie genre then this movie for you and this a really a good movie in 2020. I Recommend this movie. WORTH WATCHING MOVIE
My Rating: 9/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,2/10,Just a boring movie with an interesting premise. Pacing is slow....difficult to actually care or focus on the movie.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,9/10,"Do you remember how good Hard Candy was? This is even better. It's painful to watch specially for females, but it's a MUST-WATCH. Everyone has got to see this film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,7/10,"I have no words for this movie but just DISTURBING and REAL, so real that it's scary."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 June 2021,10/10,"Perfectly narrated, beautifully acted, excellently executed! The storyline about the essence of feminism, which everyone can interpret differently. Basically, the story wasn't about a broken-hearted girl with great ambitions and aspirations, but about seeking justice and vengeance for unforgivable wounds from the past. Also, this movie was full of unexpected twists and peculiar details that draw your attention instantly. I presume this was the best performance of Carey Mulligan!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,8/10,"I did read most of the comments here. Most of them seem to agree that both the performance of the lead actors, as well as the topic and the script where outstanding. A few thought that the movie was to much man hating. Well I am a man and in no way do I see this movie as feminist and man bashing. The story is good, no gratuitous scenes of violence, sex or nudity. I gave it an eight just to balance ratings. I get terribly annoyed when I see ratings at 10 and 1. As soon as that happens I know it is fake. There are always some flaws. Either in the script, the acting, the special effects or whatever, but as soon as a movie seem to be worthy of a 10 by some and a one by others I know that I can ignore the comments."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"I think this is a movie everyone should see, particularly men (and I am a man). Great, interesting story with amazing acting from start to finish. The ending was both unexpectedly satisfying and confusing. Mulligan was incredible and her voice acting was crazy good and different from her past characters. Definitely check this one out."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,9/10,"This movie is about how many men see women, and how difficult it is to get any justice as a survivor of sexual assault. It's also a movie about the power of friendship. It's well plotted, with surprises. Carey Mulligan gives an outstanding performance. I also liked the sets and costumes. It's part thriller, part black comedy and part tragedy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 October 2021,7/10,"Bit of a sad story, not realistic, acting is pretty good, don't want to spoil anything, but personally I didn't like the ending, although I get it.It's not an action packed thriller kind of movie, it's pretty slow, a tiny twist I didn't see coming, although I could have known;).But it's pretty good, not the best out there of course...for me a 7/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,,"This film is unique and breakthrough in many ways. It is also a disturbing portrayal of all people in the film who are mean, vindictive, evil, and abusive. At one moment, the characters seem normal and the next minute they are evil. An entire group of friends turn out to be plain evil. This messy attempt at drama will make you sad and feel dark about humanity. The film give you 3 choices in life... Evil, psychotic vindictiveness, or total naivety. There are so many sloppy and illogical progressions that you have to assume much of this is farce. But, the director spends an immense amount of time and effort trying to convince you that each character is real and 100% authentic. This film will do well during awards season because it deals openly with serious topics of college life and turning your back on bad and criminal behavior. You might also wonder of enacting revenge is worth the risk of your life and family. Disturbing and dark this film might impact you, but it's also at risk of having the wrong impression on a large percentage of viewers by being sloppy filmmaking and a ""music video"" like approach to serious drama. 5/10 is generous if you compare this film to The Shawshank Redemption, a real 10/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,9/10,"No spoilers here beyond the basic IMDB plot details. Bottomline is: go see it!
This is a funny but bitter revenge story beautifully told, with of course a twist and catharsis in the end.
I cannot remember a movie that had all the ingredients sprinkled so well in it to make this movie not just about revenge but also as being about at least an attempt to come to terms with the past, the past that keeps on coming up with surprises, to start the revenge all over again. Kill Bill or the older equivalent The Bride Wore Black also had women in it that fought back to those who wronged them in the past. But no matter how great these movies were (Kill Bill especially on dialogue that got us into the twisted minds of violent people), the protagonist played by Carey Mulligan stands out. Carey has delighted us before showing she is more than a pretty innocent appearance, from the incredibly sweet angel opposite Ryan Gosling in what I think is the best movie of this millennium: Drive, to a tough DI in Collateral, and more. Not only is she bitter or potentially violent at times (like Jeanne Moreau and Ulma Thulman were in their plots), in A Promising Young Woman she is constantly visibly damaged, vulnerable, sad, tender and lovely at the same time, and what's more: in every scene she is convincing in being all those parts at once. Her perfomance deserves an Oscar win."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 January 2021,8/10,"I saw ""Promising Young Woman"" with no idea of what it was, only that Carey Mulligan was in it. It is a sort of crime/thriller movie that becomes a horror type of thing. It has the female empowerment and messages of sexual assault, and being a bystander. Carey Mulligan does a very good job playing a twisted, creepy character, along with the charming Bo Burnham. I thought this movie was well done, it looks well put together despite it being sort of ""indie"" and had nice colors. The movie has a lot of twists and turns, and because of that it does go a little bit overboard. Structurally, it has a few problems, and could have easily been rewritten to become more of a drama/thriller instead of feeling like a horror movie at the end. When I say it went overboard, I mean that some of the choices made by our characters don't really make sense, especially in the third act. The third act has the most problems, it wraps up ""nicely"" and doesn't make a lot of sense. It gets pretty unrealistic in the last 30-45 minutes. Despite these flaws, ""Promising Young Woman"" is an entertaining and quite intense movie that is worth seeing."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 October 2021,10/10,"This is a masterful modern suspense film that crescendoes into black comedy gold. ""Believe all women"" makes a statement here, but it brilliantly serves as the motivation driving the antihero's psychopathy.Writer/director Emerald Fennell truly earned her Oscar for best original screenplay and her Oscar nomination for directing. The fact that you're unsure whether Cassie kills some of her victims or not (why are some names and hash marks written in red, others in black?) is what makes the suspense work, and makes you think about the movie long after the end credits roll. (We know she doesn't kill all of them, but does she kill any of them? She seems certainly capable of going all the way. Didn't she hire an assassin at one point? I guess ""it depends"" on the situation.)The scene where Paul mentions Al Monroe's name to Cassie for the first time and her expressive reaction as she internalizes this, all the way through the sequence in her bedroom as she plans her revenge with the strong viola score playing over it- this is excellent work from the director, the cinematographer (and lighting assistants), the composer, and Carey Mulligan. I will be following Emerald's work from now on because of this outstanding film.The casting is perfect. Great performances from every single cast member. Christopher Lowell (Al Monroe) and Max Greenfield (Joe) receive special mention for their comedic performances, as does Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Even Emerald Finnell had a hilarious cameo in the YouTube makeup video.The brilliant use of music does not go unnoticed, either. From the pop tunes to the eerie violin instrumental cover of Britney Spears' Toxic, every tune is well selected and the string compositions really ratchet up the suspense."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,3/10,"As with many movies lately, this one traverses (too) many genres and loses its focus. Starting as a black comedy turned drama then evolves into revenge story sprinkled with romance ending with dark twist only to close in stereotypical fashion. While the idea is okay, it should've chosen either the realistic(dark) approach or a more comic(gory fun) one. Acting is good, points for the grim part, minus(es) for being all over the place. Not a bad movie but definitely not what the rating suggests."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,10/10,"Far too easy to spoil I think. It left me feeling quite bothered. I feel rather affected by this movie. Remarkably good. Carey Mulligan is spectacular in this. I would expect this will knock around my head for a good long while! Dark, twisted, with lots of light too, and I wonder if it's safe to say A-typical. I'll leave it there, but if you plan to see it, try not to talk to anyone who has. Would be a shame to know how it all plays out in advance!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,8/10,"The film talks about a very delicate matter and does it very well, the key word for this movie is revenge, Carey Mulligan does a amazing performance, and Emerald Fennell also shows a lot of talent and boldness in her first feature film, written and direct by her.The only negative point is the way some characters are putted in the movie to become essential to the history, but at same time they are also there to show more humanity on Mulligan character, so this is nothing that are going to ruin the experience to watch it.Promising Young Woman is a film that have a strong message and need to be appreciated for it boldness and stile."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 October 2021,7/10,"The story follows Cassandra who has difficulties adjusting to life after what happens to her friend. All
the promise she had for her life comes crashing down and she engages in troubling activities.Even though this is a revenge thriller, it' NOT a blood and gore type movie. It is a a roller-coaster of a movie which pulls the viewer into Cassandra's troubled mindset, then teases by providing an optimistic possibility which then fizzles out into sad hopelessness.Don't worry, this is not a dark soul-crushing movie, but it will definitely make you sit back and think. Carey Mulligan is excellent as Cassandra.A major misstep for this movie is the portrayal of every college male as a violent sex offender, where even the ""good guy"" in the movie is also a deviant that encourages sexual assault. This is factually not true and is an unhelpful message to propagate."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,10/10,"Excellent revenge movie. Reminiscent of a film I saw long ago ""Hard Candy"" only way better in style and so well written. The ending was iconic and a real stunner!!! Great job to the director and screen writer. 👍🏻"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 October 2021,8/10,"I was never a big Carey Mulligan fan and often found her the weakest link in most movies I saw her in. The only other performance I liked her in besides PYW was The Great Gatsby.But here, she's just fantastic. She's deadpan, she's vulnerable, she's strong willed, she's aggressive, she's cunning, and plays a wonderfully complex if still flawed human being who gets wrapped up in her own quest for vengeance.The supporting cast is pretty good too. Clancy Brown and Jennifer Coolidge play her parents and for once, they're just human beings. Coolidge is not playing a comedic role and you can see the sadness and frustration she feels about her daughter. Clancy Brown plays her loving father and this is probably the nicest and most sympathetic character I've ever seen Brown play.Bo Burnham gets to flex his dramatic chops in a role you think is just the quirky nice guy love interest but like most of the characters (even the terrible ones) he's a bit more complicated than that.Laverne Cox is just sort of there as Mulligan's boss. She's not distracting but it's a part that could had been played by anyone.The script shifts back and forth from a black comedy thriller to a romantic drama depending on the mood and changing motivation of Mulligan's character. The ending is not what I expected things to go and it will certainly leave an impression on viewers."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,7/10,That 4th Act & 5th Act was like daaaaamn😬Gr8 directing debut by Emerald Fennell. A very tough subject matter which she takes a unique route with comedy and a smart female score with the music.Carey Mulligan ;) Solid PerformanceParis Hilton Stars are Blind 😂👌🏾
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 October 2021,8/10,"I don't want to give anything away because this compelling, gripping and powerful film doesn't go where you expect it to and doesn't pull many punches. I'll just say that the men Cassie meets are out there, possibly in your office, in your college classroom or sitting next to you and buying you a drink. Cassie's out there too and its great that, after however many centuries, she's finally standing to be counted! Watch this film. And single eager, pompous and entitled young males, or men of any age, watch your behavior from this moment forward!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,10/10,"This movie is so smart and deceptive. I don't want to say too much or give anything away. It starts sadly and simply enough and progresses in a satisfying and vengeful fashion. The ending will get you, if you catch my drift!I don't think any other actor could've carried this story. Carey is just that freaking fantastic. I loved the Harley Quinn vibes I felt while watching. The whole movie is full of this juxtaposition between sweet and innocent & edgy and immoral.Let no man think it's ever okay to take advantage of a woman when she's drunk or weak. Karma does indeed come around. Young men, when coming of age, should perhaps watch this movie as a lesson. Just a thought!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,8/10,"PYM was pretty good, better than expected. I was anticipating some kind of 'I Spit On Your Grave' revenge flick; thank God it wasn't. The vengeance was well thought out, the build-up to the story was pretty good. Carey Mulligan did a fantastic job, Christopher Mintz-Plasse & Alison Brie had awesome cameos.Yes, the movie has flaws, you'll predict the twist around half hour mark and they messed up the climax; it's still pretty entertaining. Crisp editing, remarkable dialogues and acting makes it worth your time. Do watch it. Highly recommended."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 January 2021,8/10,"I admit to pretty much scoring this one based on my wife's review as I was fairly ""tired and emotional"" by the end, having to rewind and watch the end twice and still missing bits from my memory today. She loved it however, and it was very engaging the extent I saw"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 February 2021,6/10,"As a man and (for a lack of better word) - feminist, I sincerely kept hoping that I will see the Whole more than the some of parts here...something more than an average joe revenge thriller, but nopes pretty mundane stuff. Not sure why the gung-ho and award nominations - except that Carry did a good job of portraying a women hurt, obsessed with revenge and unnecessarily stuck in the past (a great line from another concerned woman in the movie - pls move on, for all of us, only if she did!)I want to admit, that we men can never fully understand what a woman goes through when she is molested, but then a fake product packaged as a feminist struggle can't help this age old nuisance prevalent in the humanity,,, more manipulative and nihilistic than it should be and after a while I just lost the interest. It has nothing new to say, nor it is perceptive or considerate much...It has some gotcha moments though, but that's about it. Even those seem shallow and inconsequential...We all have gone through our pains, but suffering is a choice...Spiritual teachings, especially eastern philosophy advocates compassion and forgiveness. We can't have eye for an eye, and this world need more Warriors - with Courage and compassion. And if you say I am preaching, then look at this movie, what is it showcasing? - some very specific set of situation and childish behaviors for the sake of proving its point on an important topic...Women deserves a better dialogue and movies on this topic."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 August 2021,9/10,"I seriously didn't expect it to get into horror genre, With a good climax. Enjoyed till the end. It seems they just don't select for oscar nominee anyway. 😉"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 March 2021,9/10,"This is a strange film about a beautiful woman who suffers from PTSD for an event that we slowly learn about over time. We learn she is 30, earlier quit medical school, lives with her partents, works in a coffee shop. And she has a problem with men for a past wrong. And it haunts her. Deeply. And she is intent on determining how those who committed past wrongs feel about them - remorse? Regret? Forgetful? Denial?There is little more I can say other than this is one very, very dark film. Carey Mulligan's voice, physical acting and overall screen presence is terrific. Some of the script is a bit exaggerated, but perhaps that is part of the art of the movie and Mulligan never lets you forget about her inner pain and strength, which was very effective and parts will bring about wry grins.I'll say this much - at least it's oriignal. And the performances are overall good, (Bo Burnham being OK) with Mulligan seriously standout. It's a little fantastic, perhaps a bit of fantasy, but it's quite a trip. And I liked the ending, which this film stuck. Unquestionably a better entry in the year of straight to video and when most felt like they deserved it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,9/10,"*This review doesn't contain any spoilers, but does go over some broad parts of the movie in general*
So, in the beginning of the movie (until about 1/3) the storyline was going as I expected it to go, and I really liked how the movie was continuing on. However, starting from about 2/3 of the movie, the movie seemed to turn more into a romance movie? So I was kind of worried it would just end up that way, but it did not! The ending was very unexpected and powerful, so I think the movie really portrayed a powerful message to the audience. Also, LOVED the movie soundtracks!!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,10/10,"Films that garner controversy and polarize audiences usually intrigue me. However, none of them even compare to Promising Young Woman. It's a dark comedy-drama thriller that hits every note perfectly. Easily one of the best films of 2020.Cassandra Thomas (Carey Mulligan at the top of her game) was once the titular endearment but tragedy struck. Now she's almost 30 and out for revenge against not only those in the wrong but those who could become, namely men who prey on vulnerable women. Cassie makes her way through a number of potentials (played by the likes of nice guys Adam Brody and Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Then a ray of light enters her life in the form of Ryan (Bo Burnham).Saying much more would need a spoiler alert, but this is the kind of movie that I'd recommend going in blind to (or, at the very least, the trailer featuring the haunting strings version of Britney Spears' ""Toxic""). The topic at hand, toxic masculinity, is one that's been handwaved too often for far too long. PYW will be talked about for a long time, and its notoriety is rightfully earned."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 September 2021,2/10,"This is a revenge movie in the American style: everything either simplified or over-the-top. If you want to see a real revenge movie made by a woman try ""The Nightingale"". It's real, serious, and pertinent to today's issues. It is set in the black-white wars in Tasmania in the late 1820s, when Australia was treated as a prison by England. The story is so well scripted, cast, and acted that it is more relevant than ""Promising Young Woman"", which tries so hard and yet fails to succeed. If you want a serious story about revenge -- real issues about real people reacting in real ways -- forget about ""Promising Young Woman."""
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 April 2021,6/10,"Shouldn't have been 2hrs long. The film seem to drag alot and the poor dialog didn't help either.Most of the acting was mediocre and the editing seemed janky. Would love to see a better execution of this plot. A perfect example is Kill Bill. A much better acted and executed revenge plot.This film, in my opinion has no reason to be nominated for an Oscar in any category."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 October 2021,8/10,"I thought this was a great movie. I just wish they didn't have actors that looked way too old to play a 30-year-old. An appearance of like half the B and C list actors out there. Adam Brody, Molly Shannon, so many more."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,8/10,"This is a wonderfully put together 'revenge' film, with a difference. Carey Mulligan is beautiful, strong, fragile and broken. A truely breathtaking performance. And one which I was transfixed by for the duration of the film. It remains in the mind for a variety of reasons. Thank goodness that Hollywood can still create such great cinema, even if it is one of the few boats worth sailing on in a sea of junkers."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,10/10,"There have been a very few amount of films in the past year that I can remember so vividly because of so many things suck as story telling, characters & acting, music and costumes etc. This film perfects so many aspects. Carrey Mulligan gives us a performance of mixed genres. Comedy, thriller, drama, romance, she does it all and keeps the audience hooked, even when she's not on screen but is mentioned or seen in a different way. The plot has aspects that have been seen before, but overall it's an original story which surprised the whole audience in the cinema. The ending in my opinion made the film. For the audience to stay so engaged and focused in the film without its leading character for about 15 minutes just shows that the story works perfectly. The theme of revenge is one of my favourites, especially in kill bill, which I got some feels and vibes from that film in Promising young woman. The music was great as well, mixing some well known songs with a blend of dramatic beats made for some repeatable streams on the official playlist. I hope this film is recognised during award season. For me (a 17 year old guy) to love a film that's intended towards women older than me, shows how this film could please and entertain a wide audience range. The strong direction, unique script and strong lead hopefully wins awards at the oscars or golden globes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 February 2021,8/10,"A movie full of great actors and actresses, this movie has its great moments. The soundtrack alone is grade ""A"". The script is along the best I have seen in 2021. A movie that starts slow, but finishes strong!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,7/10,"It's a little disjointed and a little too obvious to get a higher score. But it's a good piece still. CM's acting is okay. Okay... Great cast. Plot? Plot, plot. What plot? Ah, the vague VS thingie? Cool. I'm cool with it. Directing? Oh there was some fumbling about on that front. Definitely. Still. Good, honest weekend entertainment. I can appreciate that all day long, thank you!
Loved the allegory towards the end too.
7.5/10 exactly"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 January 2021,9/10,"It's been a long time since a movie triggered something deeply unhinged in me, for me that's what film does, it provokes feelings and emotions in a way that's passive and you pretty much don't have any control of over it, ""Promising Young Woman"" does just that.
I've seen my share of emotionally tormented rendition on the screen to know that what Carey Mulligan pulled off here was sheer brilliance, you have this deeply saddened character haunted by a dark and painful past aptly showcased and portrayed, It is extremely hard for an actor/actress to display a set of emotions so unique and complex, but Carey does it with ease and absolute command, you'll feel so invested and drawn to her life.
Emerald Fennell, the writer/director threw at us a genre curveball, when you think you know exactly what's gonna unravel, you'll be thrown completely off and it doesn't disappoint one bit as it connects most of the time.
Okay, this covers about 90% of the film, it's the last part of the ending that I feel completely indifferent about, I mean I get it, I completely understand its functionality and what it brings to the story but damn it caught me off guard I had to stand up and try to process it, this is just the kind of filmmaking I absolutely adore, it genuinely doesn't care about your feelings and certainly not how you would react to it, but it delivers its core message in style.
It's exceedingly rare these days to find a film that can challenge you and create controversy within your mind and for that, I'd say that I absolutely loved this film and would like to see more of its kind."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,The best and most original film i have seen in ages. Carey Mulligan shines as very troubled young lady who seeks to exact revenge on those responsible for a despicable act.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 April 2021,9/10,"I really liked this & not quite sure why folk are whining about it being slow or boring.If you want a highly trained assassin slicing and dicing her way through everyone who ever wronged her in high octane fight sequences or hillbillies being picked off one by one via increasingly gory means - it's already been done to death.If you want a highly intelligent, traumatised woman getting justice for her wronged friend via careful plotting & delicious manipulation, you're in the right place.As a survivor myself, I love a good female revenge film, but do tread carefully if you feel you're likely to find this triggering (everything related to what the protagonist is avenging is largely implied, but still - be careful)You're probably well aware from reviews that the ending is something of a shocker, but I saw it coming - again, probably because of my own experiences of the long aftermath of sexual assault & related mental health issues.The (obviously intentional) flimsiness of the handcuffs used in the big showdown & the final 'eff you' via text confirmed for me that this was less 'I Spit on Your Wedding' and more along the lines of 'Thelma & Louise' - a kamikaze mission to get justice, escape a stagnant existence, end years of crippling depression & (if you believe in that sort of thing) see her BFF again.It's definitely one to watch a few times as there's so much to process, but I thought it was wonderful."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 February 2021,9/10,"Finally we see her in a starring roll, and does she shine...! The narrative takes you along at a good pace, but is never predictable which is what I loved most. Excellent writing, they weren't afraid to get down and dirty with the content and character development, and the pacing was also on the mark... Best not to know too much going in, just watch, enjoy, and discuss the plot with your friends after... Believe me, you will need to..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 June 2021,10/10,"The protagonist is a devoted friend of Nina, her classfellow Medical student who was raped about 7 years ago, unable to bear stigma Nina died ; the drama nowhere depicts Nina in direct manner except her framed photo .Cassandra painfully realizes the futility of law to catch up and punish those responsible ,she sacrifices her promising medical career, resorts to her own ways of reforming the ""status quo"" in the process she eventaully gives up her own life .The black humour remains throughout the drama, our protagonist remarks:-
""who need brains?They never did any girl any good."""
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 August 2021,9/10,"I was waiting to watch this movie for a long time with high expectations and they were not disappointed yesterday, when I finally went to see it.Carey Mulligan is absolutely wonderful, the pain and loneliness, the fragility in the character she's playing is heart wrenching. I wanted to see her winning and taking revenge on the cruel and chauvinist world she's suffering from so deeply. But the dark and shocking twists in the end make clear, that we haven't reached the time yet, where such a movie could offer an ending with a triumph for a woman like Cassie and not with a tragedy.The finale might be bitter, but at least I've seen a fresh and provoking movie offered by Emerald Fennell, a well deserved Oscar for her brilliant script!Mulligan should have won one too!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,10/10,"The film is very good for the thriller genre. It is dark even if the humor is also present during the narration.
I will not give details from the film to keep the suspense that is also present throughout.
It is about the abuse that many men exert on women, about the consequences of this abuse, it is about the feeling of guilt and its lack, about where revenge can lead, about the lack of humanity and the falsity that surrounds us."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,10/10,"We all are familiar with hearing news of sexual assault, this film is based on that. Nina, best friend of Cassie(protagonist) gets raped by her classmates, Nina was drunk and her classmates took advantage of that. Nina committed suicide due to humiliation. Thus, Cassie is set out to avenge those who caused this to Nina. Cassie lives a double life, a worker at a coffee shop during the day and a drunk woman in bars and pubs at night so that some guy will come to pick her up thinking that she's drunk, Cassie's acting will be so realistic, once the guy starts doing it she will let him know that she's not drunk! Yeah she's kind of like a psycho(but not really!).This revenge tale is well written by Emerald Fennel. Carey Mulligan did really good. Cinematography was all-perfect, Certain camera angles in several scenes had great symmetry and composition. Emerald Fennel did a pretty good job in directing too.Highly recommending..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,9/10,"The cinematography, scenes and music are reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick or Ken Russell films."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 August 2021,1/10,"Promising trailer then promising first half then end up as a cheesy tv movie, predictable moves so disappointing! With a different director this could be a cult movie even shamalayan could end this better! Tarantino could make this a bloody good film. What a shame."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 May 2021,7/10,A clinquant revenge one. Unexpected A twist you don't see coming The movie is dark It's original though a bit contrived Avenging Angel in the Morning Caught a Little Wagner During the Roadside Hissy Fit Scene.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 July 2021,9/10,"I had no idea what this movie was about, but just watched it on a plane. Very intense, incredibly thought provoking film; a true revenge fantasy. Very well done and very well acted by a Carey Mulligan.Yes, there are some plot holes. But given the fact that this is a fantasy take on the subject, I think it works well. Loved it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 July 2021,7/10,Yeah it was good movie.Not great but good.Some parts feel'd little bit rushed and still there were some scenes that weren't that important to the story.I don't know. Maybe there were something off with the structure.Somewhat hollow.Nothing groundbreaking.Pretty light revenge story.It wasn't anything like The Nightingale or even Kill Bill.Acting was mainly good.There were still some not that good performances.I enjoyed it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 April 2021,8/10,"I love it, but would be happier with a different ending. Was justice served? 🤔"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,9/10,"Doctors, men we suppose to trust our lives with ?! A film for every girl & boy to watch about the real consequences of actions. Story brilliant and acting even better . I just love. It"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 June 2021,4/10,A silly revenge movie attempting to do something different but just dull. I expected this to be a real thriller but just a dud. Terrible writing and plotting.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,10/10,"As soon as Brother Bro of The Oscar Expert made the comparison to Get Out this all clicked for me. Jordan Peele brought a story to life that was a microcosm for the Black experience in this country in many ways and in the process crafted a universe that was so well made it forced people to pay attention to it. Emerald Fennell does the same thing with Promising Young Woman, everything about this movie is perfect down to the title and the poster.Carey Mulligan is my Best Actress right now for all the small places Viola doesn't need to snatch she is so amazing I didn't want to take my eyes off her every second she was on screen. Stars Are Blind will always hold the magic it held in that dancing scene with Bo Burnham which is a feat in itself that this movie manages to accomplish, likewise it is a stunning accomplishment that it transformed Toxic into a freaking anthem moreso than it already is. And as it has been stated this film is the perfect example of 'there are no small roles only small actors' because each and every cast member delivers tenfold on what would be expected of them in a lesser film and the script utilizes them all so well they have a lasting impact long after the movie is over.Hoping to see nominations in duh Actress but also Director would be groundbreaking, Screenplay like Get Out come through quirky writers section, Cinematography a stretch but it was good Soundtrack was moreso than Score but I wouldn't complain, BAFTAs better come though for the British main brass and the Film Twitter favoritism hype if it all coincides could spell a Best Picture nom and even win that I wouldn't be mad at at all though my heart is set on One Night in Miami now."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,10/10,"This was a suspenceful rapid paced movie on a modern topic. Strong storyline, well developed characters with brilliant casting and spot on acting by ALL. Cinematography was clean and settings were beautiful. I haven't got one complaint to voice. We rented, DVD only available, bet blue ray would be amazing."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,1/10,"This has so much potential to be an amazing psychological thriller, but overall was so watered down and just didn't deliver.It didn't go dark enough and barely scraped he surface of the seediness it was giving off.I also would have liked more back story to the characters and at least some flash back scenes.All in all I was really disappointed with the mood set in the film and would not recommend to anyone."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,8/10,"It reminds me a lot with Beautiful Bones.. This movie gives you satisfaction but feel sad at the same time. When a movie can give you two opposites feeling at the same time, you know that it is a good movie"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 February 2021,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is definitely a highlight from the films that were released in 2020. I recently just watched it and I was shocked with the outcome of this movie.Carey Mulligan steals the show with her dark/humorous presence and performance. She is full of vengeance and unpredictability. Her character has so much great chemistry with her family and friends and even enemies. This movie is very pretty-looking too with very bright colors and gleeful cinematography despite of how dark the subject of sexual assault is in which the movie evolves around.However, sometimes the movie can suffer a bit from rom-com cliches, which didn't bother me, but it is noticeable. My biggest issue is that there are moments that feel a little bit too far-fetched to be realistic.The last 20 minutes of the movie feature the most gruesome yet satisfying ending ever. With so much anger built up I felt so relieved at the very end and it will be very polarizing for so many people. Despite the ending, Promising Young Woman is a must-watch for it's subject matter and twisted story! Score: 8.5/10; Grade: A-"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 June 2021,7/10,"I was slightly disappointed to find Promising Young Woman utilising stereotypical characters to help move the plot forwards, as well as struggling to establish a particular tone for the film. There's no undermining the uniqueness of how the film deals with such a dark subject matter in an enjoyably stylised and satirical manner, though personally there's a giant question mark leering over character motivations. Carey Mulligan is a force to be reckoned with and literally carries the film, which stands as both a pro and a con for me. There's much to be left to discuss in terms of controversial moments within the film, one being the portrayal of men that I didn't really appreciate. I'm honestly torn as despite really enjoying the film I have quite a few gripes with it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 June 2021,8/10,"I remember this actress as the ""Drive"" girl and little else. Carey Mulligan ends up building a solid and unexpected character and that fact changes everything. Besides the quality of the actors, it's easy to find great ideas here - from the dialogues to the art direction (Cassandra's parents' house is really fantastic), almost everything is disruptive enough to make us like this kitsch-chic fantasy about someone who has suffered trauma and wants others to suffer too. This excellent work by Emerald Fennell is really worth seeing."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 February 2021,8/10,"This isn't ""I Spit on Your Grave"". And it isn't a romcom with a splash of revenge.This is an offbeat movie with some wonderful actors and characters that will definitely spark conversations.It's funny in a (very) dark way. It's a little unnerving at times too. But overall it's an enjoyable couple of hours with a good story, some nice twists and a satisfying ending"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,8/10,This movie is enough to make you never want a date if you're single. Itself sign of to make you never send your kids to private or ivy league schools where they turn their head to sexual assault
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,1/10,"It does the job that it's supposed to do: be a cathartic revenge flick on the men who have committed evil, served by a brilliant, calculating woman. In the case of Hard Candy it was pedophiles, in this case its fratboy rapists and the institutions that support them. If that's something you need to see, this is the movie for you. If you're looking a bit more, it falls short."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 January 2021,10/10,Different and refreshing take on a revenge topic. Excellent acting by Carey Mulligan who never disappoints. Strong message and supporting cast also hits the spot. Brilliant.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,8/10,"Whatever genre you ask for. Thriller, dark comedy and romantic. It has all these elements. Everything is in a good balance.The screenplay is powerful and delicate. So much effort was put on the line. The character developlment is mature enough for the audience to feel the sense of attachment. The casts were just superb.The movie provoke me to think a lot after it is end. When something bad happened to someone with bad reputation, can we see the event impartially? Or we will downplay the unfortunate event just like everyone did? This movie is a masterpiece and gonna cling on my mind for some time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 October 2021,7/10,A great thriller and comedy film that's twisted with friendship and love making you enjoy every single second with Carey's amazing performance and a lovely women empowerment story line keeping you hooked and at the edge of your seat throughout with its smart aspects even if sometimes the pace feels a bit off. Promising Young Woman comes off as one of those movies that deserved the Oscars.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,10/10,"An interesting plot that makes you think, great acting, drama, comedy, action, what else could you ask for?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,8/10,"It is a bit slow moving and less exciting than the trailer suggested, but it was a very unique premise for a movie and it was done quite well. The ending was a shock!It was a great move to cast such likable actors in the roles of the predators/rapists, depicting the idea that these kinds of people hide behind their smiles, popularity, and success.It was also interesting to note that no details are elaborated about the sexual assault incidents-implying that we don't need the details to understand that sexual assault is reprehensible across the board, no matter what type.Some people say this is movie was ""anti-man"" because men are primarily antagonists, but clearly they are forgetting the female dean (represents the system), her mother (who is emotionally unavailable and self absorbed), and Alison Brie's character (willfully ignorant). Many different parties were responsible for what happened-men and women-especially when it came to find justice. The protagonist herself was in a questionable gray area too with some of her vigilante actions. Also the lawyer could be considered a redeemed character, the only one really, and he's a man.The ending was unexpected and satisfying in its own way, but definitely shocking and left me reeling for a bit after. Bold move by the creators! I'd recommend this film, it was a good watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,8/10,"I struggle to define the genre. Not a ""great"" film but a well spent couple of hours and I highly recommend it. A serious subject given the 'Hollywood treatment,' almost lightly presented bubblegum which should (but doesn't) undermine the message. The plot kept me interested enough , never knew where it was going. I'd like to see more of the lead, she was accomplished. Thank you for this film!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,10/10,"Unfortunately in the times we live in not many movies are released. I was starting to get more and more disappointed with 2020's releases until I saw this movie. The reason I first watched it was because it's one of the award season movies but it turned out to be on of my favorite movies of all time. I didn't watch any promo so I went in with no expectations. The movie handles a very sensitive matter with respect. It has a sence of justice and I will never forget how I felt the first time I watched this. It made me tear up. The plot is rich with exciting things happening in every act of the movie. It can be slow from time to time but in a way that doesn't make you bored. I'd say it rather builds up the tension for the final act. The acting is spot on and the score is amazing. The characters, even the minor ones stand out with nice punchlines. But most importantly Carey Mulligan shines as Cassie an iconic character that should be remembered from every cinema lover forever. Even though this is a revenge story Cassie definitely has morals and makes sure to give everyone in the movie what they deserve and only that. Maybe in my eyes she goes a little too easy on them but hey that's just my opinion. I think people dislike this movie for the wrong reasons and they just scratch the surface of what the movie is trying to say. I believe that if you watch this movie with an open mind there's no way that you will dislike it. The only thing I regret is not watching it sooner. It's a thrilling experience that I will never forget. A true winner for me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,5/10,"I have to say this movie was a bit boring, despite the admirable and necessary crusade against rape. Very cartoonish characters, a bit like a mafia movie where everyone has acne scars, wears black and talks about popping people all the time. The scene in the restaurant with her ""friend"" from university is so full of chiches it's nauseating - did they really have to use every single phrase that horrible people like her use some of the time - all at once? I got sick of looking at this parade of despicable people, from bad to worse, relentlessly. It's as much fun as homework in calculus."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,8/10,"This is the story of a 30 year old woman who seeks justice in her own way for the rape and suicide of her best friend.This film shows how she has felt the trauma so deeply herself that it has taken over her life. She has no relationships and has no ambition. Her soul goal in life is to punish, but not by like physically harming them, men who abuse woman who are drunk. The day an ex classmate by chance enters into the coffee sho where she works and tells her of how the people who directly or indirectly were involved in the demise of her friend are doing, she realises she needs more and sets out to teach them the lessons they never got.It is an emotional journey and Cassy is attaching . The music was a perfect addition and really helped provide the feeling of the moment.I know I'm not selling it well but I can assure you it is a really good watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"An all-star cast does an excellent job relaying the story of a college rape that was covered up. This movie is so well executed, that I found myself crying and laughing at the same time - nodding in agreement at Cassie's calling the men out and feeling sick at what these men (and women) did to Nina. Creatively, the writer uses a revenge comedy to tell Nina's story - a genre that has mass appeal. We a treated to the lawyer's perspective, and how they destroy women's reputations to clear accused rapists. We witness what it would be like to be person of power who clears a rapist, and then thinks it's happened to their own daughter. We witness the horror of the rapist realizing he's been exposed. Lots of heart pounding moments! Cassie is a superhero with a mission to punish those who rape women, and those who cover it up. Never has a movie magnified the gruesomeness of raping a woman and the aftermath is causes. This is the movie women have been waiting for."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 August 2021,9/10,"The ending is *chef's kiss*. I can only imagine the bad reviews are from people who didn't really watch it or got upset because there were no superheroes, cheap CGI and 200 million dollar budgets. Watch it, this is a real and wonderful movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 March 2021,10/10,I just loved this movie! Good chemistry with the actors but also the movie is so well written and directed that it's unpredictable. It has these twists and turns that I just didn't expect. It's very well done and I just really enjoyed it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 January 2021,5/10,The acting was good. The story was below average. The result is average to annoying. The characters were cliché and underdeveloped. The ending is supposed to be surprising but is really convenient and rushed.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 May 2021,10/10,"There's no doubt in my mind that this film is my favourite. To be completely honest, 2020 sucked in terms of filmmaking (obviously everything else as well) so that isn't saying much. But Promising Young Woman is a movie that utilises a great soundtrack and score, fantastic acting and great direction to create a fantastic film. To me this is a movie that both works as an entertaining revenge film (with a twist) and a fascinating exploration of its themes.I think to get an idea of why this movie works for me I'd have to point out the one star reviews here. There are always a bunch of one star reviews that say stuff like ""acting bad, director bad, writer bad, bad movie"" which don't explain why they dislike the movie at all, but I'm looking at the main criticisms people have. I think to me there's main criticisms that is made, four main ones, that when I defend, explain why the movie is so great in my opinion. In no particular order of regularity, they are:'The movie's too boring, where's Thanos?""Kinda an annoying one for me, because I doubt these people actually sat through the movie. I think the first half an hour before cassie decides to go after the guy is slower and less entertaining, which I can see as one of the answers. To me though, the movie immediately becomes an interesting revenge flick after this, and even if you don't like it to call it boring doesn't make any sense to me. Also, I watch a lotta movies, and do normally stop thirty minutes through if I don't like it. But that's normally when I HATE the movie and what it's doing, not because not much is happening. Like I said this movie is kinda like a gender swapped idea of a macho man action flick. By that not only do I mean the lead is a woman but the film feels more feminine - rather than 'splosions and violence this movie is colourful and deceptively beautiful. But it's a movie with a lot of music, an interesting dramatic arc and a satisfying conclusion (more later) for our character. I don't get this.""The movie is innappropriately treating it's subject.""This is one of those ones which I understand, but don't agree with at all. Yes, this is a more entertaining movie that gets surrounded by a serious topic. And I understand that the idea of a rape revenge film is kind of iffy. But here's the thing. We are never SHOWN what happens. The movie is too stylized to show what actually happened, so it actually never just makes it part of the movie in a sense, because it kinda exists outside the movie realm, if that makes sense. But the main reason is that the movie is thematically about the nature of the 'nice guy'. This movie is really realistic about what occurs. It isn't some guy who violently attacks and assaults this person, because that isn't typically what happens. The problem to me is that this is the way art works. A movie that accurately explains the nature of this in a stark, realistic way is very unengaging and also lacks a lot of the deeper things you can do when your movie is free to be as artsy as you want. This is an argument that a lot of people have about art in general, and to me as someone who likes art that tackles explicit and mature subjects, I think this film handles its subjects very well.""THIS MOVIE PAINTS ALL MEN AS EVIL ITS SEXIST!!!""Well firstly, the people who say this haven't watched the film. Both Clancy Brown and Alfred Molina portray characters who are not okay with sexual assault. Secondly, and most importantly, what, do you want the movie to introduce all these male characters who are good just to be like ""in reality, most men aren't like that?"" I mean, I've watched the Sopranos, and I don't think most Italian Americans are involved with the mafia.""The ending ruins the movie""A big one. This is one of those risky endings, which'll work well for some and poorly for others. Now technically, the REAL final twist is that she had this backup plan which catches them all. But most are referring to her death. It's definitely shocking, and people usually react negatively to shocking. To me, it's the way in which it's done. Our main character isn't gunned down as they heroically try to stop the villains - she is suffocated in an extended long shot. Though I'll note, she dies struggling back as the villain is crying and hysterical, noting that she isn't going to be killed in a sexual or submissive way to diminish her status as a strong character. To me it goes into the film. The film is coloured with vibrant colors that express a lavish world, almost a utopian world. Everyone seems to be enjoying this world, ignoring the problems that is occurring. Because ultimately it is an illusion, because our world is far from perfect. To me, if she just won easily and walked away, that signifies that there is an easy way out. She would have killed him too easily. The fact that she gets killed showcases that at the end of the day, this fantasy revenge story is still a fantasy. In our society, sexual assault survivors rarely succeed without substantial loss. It is unfortunate, but the movie makes points that it is something we can change with our attitudes. We all know people like the men in the movie, the people who either participate in this behaviour or think it is acceptable. But we are the people who need to be holding these people accountable, and hope one day we will."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,4/10,"I almost stopped watching this because it was that boring and felt like a drama/romance, which is not what it seemed to be marketed as. It was slow-paced, there was 0 tension, and it really felt as though nothing was happening for the first half of the movie. It was so boring that it was hard to pay attention - which is a shame because the story is extremely universal and should be heard. But the ending was really good. It almost felt like the entire movie could have been more powerful as a 30 minute TV episode...the entire movie felt dragged out and empty until the end. So it's worth a watch because it's an important issue, but don't go into it like I did thinking it would be entertaining."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 July 2021,,"Such a great yet disturbing film! Carey is s great! Revenge at its best! Her character is pathetic, but you seriously root for her."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,8/10,"The movie is a solo Carey Mulligan's show and the whole story revolved around her activities to gain a particular objective. Seemingly lonely woman, worried by her parents, who pretended to be drunken in different nightclubs to find out a particular person with whom she had a brutal experience."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,8/10,"This film runs along similar lines to The Accused (1988). If you liked that, you will likely enjoy this. I thought it was good, but the last 30 minutes I found quite unsettling. I didn't think the story would head in that direction. I was hoping for a more subtle, pleasing end. But it is because of the very strange & wholly unexpected, unpredictable ending that my rating for this went from 6 to 8.Carrey Mulligan's performance was super good. As an English actress, she played the American female role with great conviction. This is the first film I have seen her in. Instant crush! And she played the part so well. Her Oscar nomination for this is well deserved.Great film. But, it definitely affected me and is still playing on my mind."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,9/10,"I probably would've given this a higher rating but I couldn't make myself give it the same rating as my all time favorite movies. That being said, I did score it the same as V for Vendetta, which seems appropriate, and is also one of my favorite movies. This was original, brilliantly acted/directed, and maybe even necessary.
Reminded me of Hard Candy, which is a really big compliment from me. It's nothing like that movie, but the ethos is similar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 February 2021,6/10,"I literally feel bad for this movie. The first 15 minutes are ground breaking, it felt like American Psycho on steroids and I was ready to give it 10 stars right away! But that's where the good stuff ends. Rest of the movie is one biased and (not even low key) misandric mess composed of comedy, romance, watered down drama, revenge whatever... The female American psycho from the first 15 minutes is nowhere to be found anymore. I would probably rate it 4 stars but I am giving it 6 because acting is on point, and some of the conversation is actually quite witty and made me laugh"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 January 2021,8/10,"Ok, the ending slightly disappointed me but overall what a film! Such a strong performance from Mulligan. Beautifully shot movie also and there are no weak points of this as it moves along at such a good pace. Yes there probably is a bit of an agenda but these horrendous situations do continue to happen and hell someone has got to shine a light on these things! Margot Robbie is very talented."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,7/10,"I liked this more than I thought I would. It had a lot of hype and lived up to it for the most part. Carey Mulligan did an outstanding job and it was good to see Alison Brie when she showed up. A couple of things annoyed me about the ending but all and all, it was well done."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 August 2021,8/10,"Finely plottwisted, greatly states moral problem about wrongs of a rapist and how there is no some moral force to stop him from even murder. Really like the movie and great work of cameraman also."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 May 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman was fantastic. I had no idea what it was about or what to expect, and was riveted and pleasantly surprised. Excellent writing, acting, direction, very original story and execution. Kept my attention throughout. Might be one of the best films if not the best film that I saw all year. It deserves a lot more attention."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 May 2021,10/10,"This movie is AMAZING.I never got bored of it not even for a moment, didn't even check my phone, nothing... it's. Just. That. Good.The ending was unexpected but it surpassed everything and i'm not even mad about it, it's not predictable at all.As a man myself, i can see why this got so many nominations for the Oscars, and if you are a dude too and thought this movie was ""gross"" because of the story, let me tell you something; you are part of the problem.Thank you for showing a real problem and reflecting it in a raw way. Bravo."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 October 2021,8/10,"I thought this was very good, and I really really like the ending; the ending is very satisfying. Carey Mulligan is wonderful. As is Alfred Molina. A few things minorly bothered me. The scene with the guy whose car she attacks seems really unnecessary and superfluous. I thought it stalled the momentum. And a bigger question would be: Since she has the incriminating video, why does she endanger herself by going to the party? But I think a lot of thrillers and such have plot holes, and this one doesn't really bother me much.Loved the use of ""Something Wonderful"" from The King & I. The juxtaposition of that particular song against what just happened and what is happening is awesome."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"Fantastic movie. The subject matter is as tough as it comes, but I still suggest everyone should see this movie. My wife and I were glued to the TV to watch what would happen next. The last 30 minutes were jaw dropping, the last 5 were earth shattering.As much as this movie is dark and depressing it also has sweet and funny moments. You go along for the emotional ride with the lead. If you connect with the movie, you will feel the emotion she feels as it occurs.Its the most powerful movie i've seen in some time. I had tears of sadness and happiness at the end. I can't say that has happened to me often. Please watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,7/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a dark revenge thriller that escapes the commonplace. It is not a spectacular film, but it is very entertaining. Good storyline, excellent performance by Carey Mulligan. Good choice for a Saturday night."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,8/10,"All across the board acting, story this film was excellent! I liked the plot but hated the ending!!! Should've been different but a solid movie overall."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 March 2021,8/10,I thought it was just going to be the usual revenge film. I was wrong.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,9/10,"The movie was very cool and enjoyful and i loved the way the story was being told. Very impressive.I understood perfectly was cassie was trying to do but maybe the director could have been more careful with the portray of men because it can be misunderstood and maybe that´s the reason why there are many mean comments about this film.I completely enjoyed this film from the very beggining to the very final, Carey Mulligan´s excellent perfomance kept it very entertaining, she was so smart.Now the photogaphy why is it so sweet/childish ? The only answer i could come up with is that Cassie lost her life when she started this marvelous plan so she was trapped in his childhood. She was not living as an ""adult"".The soundtrack was amazing, loved that fiddle version of Toxic by Britney Spears and all those songs that only made me think is this film really nominated for best picture ? (because the song choices of course) but it all mixed so well. One of the best of 2020."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 October 2021,10/10,"This movie goes there. I don't know how else to describe it. It forces you to have the difficult conversation, and not always in the most ethical way. I can feel the debate in me on how the main character goes about some of this... but as a survivor, I love her character. Her power. And I understand it. Because it really is different when it's you or someone you love. But that doesn't mean we can ignore that fact that rape exists. And it's way too common, and much too overlooked. This movie was powerful, and it's not one that will ever leave me. It's a hard watch, but it's a worthy one. An important one.Also, shoutout to Bo for his phenomenal acting in this movie! I love him as a comedian and now I'm obsessed with him as an actor! He has been outdoing himself, and I am so happy for him!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 June 2021,6/10,"I assume, based on the reviews, that no one has seen ""Unfriended"" or ""Hard Candy,"" because this film is far from original or ""puts a new spin on the revenge thriller,"" considering Shudder has an entire section that is based on that.However, it is very enjoyable. I really liked the storyline and felt it was better served as a revenge rather then be preachy. I felt that this story needed to be told in a way that both men and women could understand the pain and anguish of the characters and leave the film being satisfied.Where it falls apart is halfway through you learn the man the lead has fallen in love with is connected to her revenge and she switches on him like a light. The story goes from revenge, to love to back to revenge.Great movie, just needed the wrinkles ironed out."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,6/10,"This is a really good movie! I do enjoy a good revenge movie. So this one is right up my alley. Although the ending and the revenge wasn't quite satisfying for me. I mean, the perpetrators didn't get what they deserved truly. I thought she'd destroy at least their reputation by sending out that video to everybody, but she didn't do that. And the last straw was the ending. It wasn't shown how their lives were ruined by the following lawsuits and imprisonment. For that I downgraded my rating into 6. Originally I was gonna give this movie a 7, for successfully tricking me into thinking that it was gonna end up a romance movie. But it turned back into thriller mode at the last part. It's a refreshing thriller movie with a genius twist, although I'm left half satisfied with the ending."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 June 2021,10/10,"It's a comedy, but not really.It's a thriller, but not really.There's a romantic element, but it's certainly not a romance film.I'm not sure exactly how to describe it.Very well written and acting masterclass from 'Carey Mulligan' but can't sure what is the best from both."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,8/10,"Gripping film with a great performance by Carey Mulligan. However, although those responsible for this double tragedy will be punished the revenge was not complete because she was not there to see it through!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,6/10,"Above average, but definitely not a 8 or 9 like some people are saying. I didn't really feel like her character had enough motivation to do the things she did, unless she was unhinged already before all the Nina stuff went down."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 December 2020,9/10,"Sensationally entertaining and very evocative of flashy/trashy vintage Brian DePalma.
Carey Mulligan (who looks curiously like Kim Cattrall here) gives the best female performance of 2020. I hope Oscar notices.
In the pre-Covid days, an indie distrib like A24 could have turned this into a ""specialized"" blockbuster. Not sure what fate awaits it at this point in time.
(And it's definitely one bats**t crazy Xmas Day wide release, lol.)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 April 2021,8/10,"Sometime I feel obligated to, review a movie, especially when people who don't belong to a particular genre, come and gave horrible reviews, they don't even understand.Like I watched 4 hours movie called Justice League, for me, it's literally horrible and when I came to see the reviews I saw most of the reviews of 9 or 10 stars. I didn't want to give a 1 star review, because I know I don't like that superhero genre and I don't belong there, so I kept quiet, but the same Super Hero genre people come to serious cinema and gave bad reviews its obligation to negate them.The subject of this movie is kind taboo, swap mostly under the carpet. Yes, I am a man and yes, I have seen and also, I believe the way during college life, how boys tried to be macho and I blame the upbringing, parents never taught their macho boys to respect women in general, respect girls and their boundaries.The summary of the movie is conversation between,Carey Mulligan character and dean, the entire movie sum up and it was so good, she exactly knew that, the girl named Nina been violated by boys and she was also aware of video, but, she also told Cassie that, she can't ruin the careers of boys for every accusation no matter even that accusations happened to be true. Those boys could be doctors, football players, college stars, baseball players and what not, and there are low lives lawyers who took money and ruined the lives of girls, even though they exactly knew that the predators they defend committed heinous crimes, in the movie that lawyer couldn't able to sleep, but in real life unfortunately these kind of lawyers sleep like babies, I sincerely hope karma catch them.The acting of Carey Mulligan was top notch and Oscar worthy, the direction, editing and cinematography was excellent.I literally went to the cinema expecting I spit on your grave kind of movie and thought it another revenge movie where men wronged the woman and she took revenge in horrific ways. But, I was dumbfounded when the movie ends and it will remain with me for a few days.People who are giving negative reviews, calling it B-grade revenge movie are those who watch either Comedy movies, B-grade movies or Superhero movies, so its obvious they don't get the subject matter and how an not so innocent act of few mins could ruin the lives of so many people and they didn't even pause to realize the mistake they did or the crime they commit."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 February 2021,7/10,"Promising Young Woman is a film that I admire for its ambition more so than its execution. Clearly aping the style of 70s exploitation thrillers, Promising Young Woman tells the story of Cassie, a 30 year old woman working at a coffee shop, living with her parents, who doubles as a vigilante of sorts. At night, she goes out and plays drunk to lure predatory men to take her back to their apartment. Once there, she flips the switch and lectures them about consent, scaring them to check their behavior.As I said, this is clearly aping the style of films like Death Wish, both in visual style and story., while also serving as a commentary on those types of films. The film feels like it doesn't fully have the budget to accomplish what it really wants at times, and pulls its punches a lot. The moments that really work are the moments where it leans into its genre full heartedly and has fun with the tropes. Carey Mulligan is incredible as Cassie, and surprisingly Bo Burnham is pretty convincing as Ryan. The supporting cast ranges, but Alfred Molina and Allison Brie are standouts to me.The tone is inconsistent, and the film works best when it plays it straight down the barrel. Each scene has an almost mini twist which at first is really entertaining, but it begins to make the pay off a little less impactful as it goes on. The scenes where the guys (Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the worst offender of this) overact and play their jokes up really deflate the final joke of the film.I feel like the reaction to the film (and maybe the intention behind making it as well) are going to be more the opposite of what I enjoyed from the film. The character of Cassie gets a lot of big, preachy, moments where she gets to spout some topical buzz words and while Carey Mulligan elevates that material, it doesn't change the fact that they have all the nuance and subtlety of your best middle school debate team.With that said, Emerald Fennell is a very clever writer. Cassie embodies a righteous fury, but most of the characters are right about her. She is kind of a loser. She's 30 years old, still working at a coffee shop, living with her parents, and having no friends. Her obsession with revenge is ruining her life, and maybe it would be best for everyone if she moved on. The movie actually seems to be headed towards a strangely nuanced resolution, but then... I'm not going to spoil the ending because honestly, the real fun of the movie is letting it unravel in front of you, but there are two final twists of the knife. One of them I went with because it was needed to satisfy the genre. The other was a bit pitchy for me, dog.So it's a mixed bag. I feel like the first two thirds of the film are better than the final act. Some of the performances are really good, but some of them are cartoonish and boorish. The film has a lot of visual style, but doesn't have the resources to fully execute that vision. The script is good, but not as nuanced as it might have needed to be. I mean, what I will say is that it has provoked more thought in me than most other films of 2020, and for better or worse it is one of the more complete films of that year as well."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,"This film has enough surprises to keep you entertained throughout. It's nice to see Carey get such a wide viewed role and I've loved her since An Education. The direction, script, editing and music are incredible. I think about this film days and weeks after viewing. I can't wait to watch again."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 June 2021,2/10,"An important topic overwritten by an unrealistic story line. The movie turns into a movie about a vengeful women who because of guilt and her own personal behavior takes on a personality of a vigilante at best or simply her own extreme of risky behavior. It also plays on the urban myth of the medical schools. Cassie's behavior in the movie takes away from the importance of the subject. The movie should have focused on the behavior of men and women over consuming, men possibly drugging (although I believe she is one drugging people at the end), and the trauma it creates. Somehow they needed to build empathy or understanding of the Ennis character and the resultant dropping out and death is damage potentially done - show behavior and result of the victim Ennis. Instead we see the aftermath with Claire who is not doing well, let us just say.A very important topic of predation and risky social behavior marred by a plot that should have been focused elsewhere and a movie with poor storytelling and bizarre plot twists. Nonetheless the subject of men praying on women and women taking risks does not come through. Call it a social conscience movie and mark it up as a movie that didn't deliver as a movie itself. Just too many issues, not well told or believable, of an unlikable individual with behavior toward innocents and planned aggression toward others. It took away from the issue of the social behavior of taking advantage of a person either by them overconsuming or worse yet drugged. A missed opportunity of an important. Instead a vengeance movie where the person gets killed to take revenge for something that we are all left to imagine happened to someone else. Is Claire a PTSD victim and maybe these people should smoke pot rather than consume to excess?The last part 5 is the low point of the movie, it felt like the movie is broken and let's wrap it up. It was rushed with too many plot holes and poorly filmed scenes. At the very end the police involvement felt like they have determined they only had two minutes of tape and somehow the police have to make an arrest. Pretty fast and questionable due process."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,5/10,People ignore the 10/ 10 !The ending was ok but nothing ground breaking..Movie should have been 30 mins shorter.Obviously a certain demographic would love this movie !
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 May 2021,10/10,"I come on here to review because I love movies and to give credit where it's due, and to throw shade when a movie is crap, but for this film I didn't know where to start.It's brilliant. Absolutely utterly brilliant.Really smart casting. Great soundtrack. Beautiful filming. Direction was spot-on. The story itself was tremendous and the way the writing was done was truly phenomenal. I still can't get over the ending, I was definitely not expecting it to go there. Which was a testament to the skill of all those involved in telling this story.Ignore any doubts, you have to watch this film!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,9/10,"There is a reason why so many people have reviewed this movie and I wish it was because they all saw the cleverest new film I have seen ""Out of Sight."" (I never did get out much.) If you hated ""Out Of Sight"" you can substitute your own clever film of choice and this one will more than measure up. The plot is centered around a medical school dropout who is on a mission and you need to know nothing more. Telling you anything other than the fact that it includes great acting, superb writing, intricate plotting and highs and lows throughout would be doing you a disservice. See it. You will not regret it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 July 2021,9/10,"It is a slow film but well built with an unexpected end that explains the screenplay backward. A creative filming narrative shows a very pressing issue in our society: male violence against women. Humiliation over women has been addressed in other films, but this one brings a glimpse of the pain inflicted on generations of women. It is an unexpected masterpiece."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 March 2021,10/10,"My mind is BLOWN, can anyone be that connected to their friend!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,7/10,"Wasn't sure what to make of it for the first 20 mins, seemed like there was some impending doom coming, then it changes and you start to get the backstory of this quirky oddly dressed 30 yr old woman child who is obviously obsessed with her mission in life. The casting was interesting, some familiar faces in the movie are the exact opposite of the characters they usually play in their other movies, McLovin Mintz-Platz, Clancy Brown, Stiflers Mom, Adam Brody and the Lawyer all do well, the main character Cassie was played very well, changing like a chameleon and showing different levels to her slow boil and payback, playing the wallflower and the Vixen perfectly while we wait for the outcome. You can tell Margot Robbie had a hand in this for sure near the end, her Harley Quinn influence was obvious. Good flick, it was set in the present but at the same time felt like the 80s or 90s, only a campy version of it, it is sort of Indie low budget feel, like you wish they would have spent a bit more money on sets and locations but they covered the bases none the less despite that. The plot had a bit of romance, action, thriller, revenge and murder all mixed in and kept you guessing right to the end, maybe they could have changed a few things but why? It is what it is, give it a view You should find something you like and it will make you think even if you don't get anything else from it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 September 2021,7/10,"As far as the cinematic aspects of this movie are concerned, it is a quality pic. The acting seems to be in pretty good order. The dialogue keeps the viewer locked into the scenes. The scenes are visually pleasing to the eye. The back story of Nina is presented just enough for us to formulate what happened, but not spoon fed to us in an overwhelming way. For this movie to have this particular subject matter, it was very easy to sit through it from beginning to end.I have a couple of social problems with this movie and others like it. Despite what the world wants us to think, men are not all automatically rapists. I think this movie wants us to think that. I think young women, in general, are being taught this. It isn't true. If a rape occurs once, its one time too many. And it happens too often. I get that, and I don't approve of these actions. The problem in this particular movie is that we are to believe every male, save her dad and a skeleton of a lawyer, are all rapists first and humans second. A rapist isn't a classification of a life form. A rape is an action taken, albeit a terrible one. Anyone is capable of this action, fortunately most have enough self control and common sense not to do this. Not in this movie. If you have a penis, you are a rapist. Another problem is that she takes seven years to exact revenge. Why seven years? If this is so traumatic, why isn't her plan acted out much sooner? That's nitpicking though. Her love interest isn't excused either. He gets exposed for being at the party in which Nina is violated. We don't get a good look at this event, but we know he was there. Was Cassie there too? Cassie lets down her guard and lets this guy in her life, and even falls in love with him. She finds out through a video that he was at the party and likely a witness to the actions taken against Nina and thus, he's a bad guy now too. Again, was Cassie at this party? What is the perimeter in which people are innocent of the rape of Nina? How far away from this party did one have to be to not be guilty by association? Did Cassie not assume that all of these same year med students probably party together? Did she not assume Ryan(was it?) would have been at that party? All he did was show Cassie patience, love, caring, respect and she turned on him hard. I didn't like or agree with this detail of the movie. This was probably my biggest gripe of the entire movie. The only saving grace of this goof was that Ryan puts it back on Cassie by questioning her past transgressions. Unfortunately, she blows him off and we end scene.The problem with the rape in this movie, and I believe these circumstances to be the most common breeding grounds for most rapes to occur, is that its a party scene with a gathering of friends and acquaintences where drugs and alcohol are used. Inhibitions are lowered and senses are lost. Bad things are bound to happen with this wreckless and care free environment. I'm not excusing it, but there's a level of responsibility by all who partake of these actions. Ladies, if you're going to put yourselves out there in these situations, there are plenty of men under the same influence who will ablidge you. If you're going to wear provocative outfits or post skanky pics online, you will get men's attention. If you are going to flirt and tease young, horny, testosterone filled males at parties with alchol and drugs running through everyone's veins, things like this are possible. Again, I don't accept or excuse an action like rape, but in the case presented in this movie, all parties shared responsibility. The guys didn't pursue her on the street, they didn't apprehend her and bring her to the party. She was supposed to be a brilliant young woman with intelligence that surpassed her colleagues. Where was her intelligence while getting smashed? I'm not saying women can't ""have fun"", but sex is not a toy. Alcohol is not a toy. Drugs are not a toy. It seems like more and more people today treat these things like they are. People seem to be very careless when it comes to sex and drug use. Maybe they always have. But you can't play with these things and then cry foul when you get burned.Nina got violated. That was wrong and it shouldn't have happened to her. She did put herself there though. She dressed a certain way(we don't know exactly how, but make no mistake, she did), she partook of the spirits, she flirted and teased her colleagues.....yes she did. They flirted and teased her right back. Then she got black out drunk and problems occurred. None of it is excusable, but she put herself there. They all did.Does anyone believe that if gender roles were reversed that this story ends any differently other than its a male rape victim? Would that be ok with everyone?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 March 2021,6/10,"I enjoyed this movie and it was entertaining, but I don't think I will watch it a second time. It's more of a ""one and done"" kind of movie for me. I recognized a bunch of comedians in this, comedians are great at drama too surprisingly. They were all great. Directed beautifully, but I had a few issues. No men besides her father was cast in a good light, even he was a hollow character. And her love interest turns bad?? It's like a rom com that turns into a life time movie mixed with m night shyamalan.... Yeah it's weird. And one more thing.. she doesn't get revenge?? She just snaps out of being drunk? I can't believe she went home with these guys. And when the guy she is dating sees her come out of a bar with a with another's guy he doesn't care? She never explained it to him. The guy is a doctor. And he acts like he is 16, oh so quirky and witty, no way in hell somebody that immature is a doctor.. 6 stars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,8/10,"Really good cast and held my interest. Cinematography was excellent. Mulligan's performance was spot on as usual. While the film felt inconsistent at times, by the ending I felt like it was a huge metaphor for the Me-Too movement. As much as you want to bury the ""dead past,"" it'll still come back to haunt you. Given the dark nature of the ending, I found myself smiling when it all tied together."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,8/10,"A few thoughts:
1. This movie was so unpredictable and way more layered and complex than the ads led me to believe. For a movie that doesn't need to resort to blood and gore, it is incredibly dark and twisted.2. There were some crazy bold story beats that were so shocking but so well-earned at the same time. Emerald Fennell (the writer/director) is staffed on Killing Eve (those writers are TWISTED geniuses) so you know you're in good hands when those unexpected turns fling you into unknown territory.3. Bo Burnham is a scene stealer. He brought the casual levity to a heavy movie in a way that reminded me of Mila Kunis in Black Swan.4. The movie tackles rape culture unflinchingly and I could see it being a challenge for the more simple-minded egos, but the subject is handled with nuance and it calls out the system that too-often fails women; it's a system in which both men and women can be complicit.5. This movie isn't perfect but the most glaring thing to me is how overtly rude Cassie is to cafe patrons. It would have been fine if she accidentally let her rude thoughts slip or something, but she was actively and purposefully turning away customers...from a business owned by a black (trans?) woman. See the problem? Rather than having the ironically charming or funny effect it intended (""haha! Cassie being Cassie!"") it just reminded me how exclusive and tunnel-visioned the feminism of white women can be."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,10/10,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time - it truly is what I would consider a ""perfect"" film. It has it all - splendid acting (just give Carey the Oscar already!), writing, directing, soundtrack, editing, set design, hair/makeup...I could go on and on. This one better not be overlooked by the Academy due to its dark and ""controversial"" subject matter - I will lose all respect if that were to happen. Emerald Fennell - go get it, girl!It is impossible to categorize this film, as it has a bit of everything - I laughed, I cried (sometimes at the same time), I cheered, I yelled, I winced, and was on the edge of my seat. I felt every possible emotion. And wow...those last 30 minutes...how can I describe this without spoilers? Let's suffice it to say that I will likely get chills down my spine whenever I hear Juice Newton's song ""Angel of the Morning"" in the future. I have always loved that song, but it will never be the same.I rented it last night on VOD and have already watched it twice. Since it is a 48-hour rental, I will likely watch it again before my time is up. It really is THAT good. I want to make everyone I know watch it RIGHT NOW, but many of them are too cheap to pay $19.99 for the rental. Their loss, but in the meantime, I will have no one to talk to about it. Just watch it!You didn't think this was the end, did you?It is now.Enjoy the movie!Love,Me & Us;)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,9/10,I cant believe this movie.. it's beyond magnificent. I experienced all the feelings in it it started funny then it made me mad and ended up making me all shaked up crying. Did I wished a different end a less tragic? yep but I don't believe It would have make it this great. This is the best movie that Carey Mulligan cast
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 March 2021,10/10,It's very dark(but truth is life can be dark) and it almost ended too dark for me until the end which was a nice touch. I imagine this film will open the door for similar story lines. Loved it
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 October 2021,8/10,"Contrary to the official descriptions, crime/drama/thriller which are all dark and foreboding, I thought this movie had a huge comedic side to it in the way the main character goes about her business.Never a dull moment, the movie touches on several emotions: happiness / sadness, love / hate and befitting revenge. I believe it to be an overall excellent film, worthy of an Oscar nomination no less, for whatever mood you're in."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,10/10,"So my wife and I have pretty much maxed out on all the streaming channels. I told her about this movie and she said let's give it a shot, but for $20, let's watch the trailer first. After watching it she was kind of meh, but we decided to give it a shot. OMG, it's incredible. Massively twisted, but fast paced and incredibly well done. Carey Mulligan is brilliant and owns the movie, but the rest of the cast is terrific. Forget the mediocre reviews and forget some reviews that didn't like the ending. I'm going to watch it again either right now or tomorrow morning."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 September 2021,9/10,"Even though by now I heard a lot about this movie, I still went at it a bit skeptical, as the trailer made it look like a basic revenge movie, and even though in its core it is exactly that, it's also so much more.The screenplay is fantastic, the tension in the scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat and Carey Mulligan is hypnotizing from start to end. With subtle changes in her voice, expression, and a change in behavior so quick that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen for even a second.I got so much out of it, at some points I got chills with her performance and that's when you know you have an incredible lead actress and a great script, that can make the most basic plot feel refreshing and compelling. The colors pop out of the screen and everything feels vibrant, and it works so, so well.Overall I pretty much loved it, the ending felt a bit bittersweet, but I was still pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it and by how much I actually want to re-watch it already!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 September 2021,10/10,"The movie screams of the pent up anger and frustration of women because of having been treated as second class citizens and abused for too long. Denied the vote, paid 40% less to date, sexually abused, raped and perps not prosecuted, left pregnant or diseased, heck the ERA has still not even passed!I hate the violence of this movie and fear that it might send a very wrong message to women. I know we hope that violent movies act as an outlet so that people do not actually behave violently. I have no idea of the psychology of that. We are seeing a rise in the number of movies where women are the violent perpetrators usually because they are seeking to avenge some wrong that has been done against them or a loved one. I think even the stricter laws we see being passed around abortion are a cry from women for men to take a responsible role for their actions, as evidenced by the 15% increase in men acquiring vasectomies since the initial stricter laws passed. This is a very well made and graphic adult movie, not adult as in porn, adult as in don't let your children watch it.Clearly some very bright acting stars thought enough of the subject matter to be a part of it. Carey Mulligan owns the entire film, changing modes effortlessly. The good ones always make it look easy. I searched all through the movie for Jennifer Coolidge not realizing until the last scene she in that I had been watching her for almost 2 hours! Love her! A new, and unexpected, character for usually darling Max Greenfield too! Alfred Moline has never failed to deliver! I am impressed that as many excellent male actors are in this film as women. It gives me hope, although for damn sure the movie subject matter itself didn't. It is heavy though done with some lightness sprinkled in to make it more bearable than some others, which is good because it makes the message easier to receive, like a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. I liked that the cops were good guys again in this film, btw. We have got to have police we feel are trustworthy again. I know as a kid I always felt safe around the police and that has not been true for lots of people in many areas.At the end of the movie, my mouth fell open and I said ""Wow!"" I think I was kind of stunned.Also, such a young executive producer and star to have made this film with a first time writer and director and have it be a feature film on HBO Max I think really shows the commitment to the subject. ""This aggression will not stand man...abide."""
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 March 2021,9/10,"Such a great movie! My only complaint is that for a movie about women empowerment, I wish the ending was different regarding Carey Mulligan's character. You think you know where the ending is headed and all of the sudden... You're wrong! Overall a really good movie! Carey Mulligan is brilliant!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 July 2021,10/10,"It is extremely refreshing to watch a film and not know what to expect. It took be so by surprise in a good way. Going into it I thought I would hate it because it seemed like one of those movies that was trying to shove a message down your throat. I didn't expect to much. I was wrong though. I mean sure there is an obvious message, but the movie was so wonderfully put together that I didn't even care. It's one of those movies that I'll always wish I could experience for the first time again. The script, the acting, and the plot were all so well done. There were a few things that I predicted maybe happening but I can honestly say I was not expecting this movie to take the direction it did. So, if you're like me and are sceptical just go in with an open mind and just enjoy the movie for what it is: A thrilling, shocking, and crazy weird ride."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 March 2021,7/10,"I liked the movie, I really did! It's a good movie but kind of forgettable, I got the idea that the movie wanna pass and that's fine, but 4 nominations on golden globe??? You gotta be kidding me, I know this year is not the best but there is many other films better than this one that deserve way more pray than this as Judas and the Black Messiahs. Anyways watch this one if you want but is not brilliant, Cherry is more worth of your time also. 7/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,10/10,"Brilliant, innovative and fast-paced. Carey Mulligan is so brilliant. The message, the twist, can't fault anything!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 June 2021,10/10,"As a woman I was feeling all the feelings because the movie knew how to deal with difficult subjects while doing it in a funny gentle and mind-blowing way!Please, don't think even for a second that it's one of those stupid movies who were made just to shock people...it's so much more than that."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 December 2021,1/10,"A complete bore fest. It just doesnt work. Story is absurd, acting is really bad and background music is annoying. No one does stuff shown in da movie, but what ever make da lads happy.Better to watch repeats on TV shopping network.No wonder it tankd at da box-office. Avoid."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 July 2021,8/10,Im curious about the good comments now i know it amaze me good story.. justice serve!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,9/10,"After watching the trailer for this, I delyaed watching the movie becausse I figured I knew the storyline and it would just be another ""me too"" saga. While my suspicion was correct on some level, this movie has some twists and turns and maintaianed a pace to retain interest. Best, it wasn't same old, same old. The build up and the ending were brilliant."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,9/10,"I was expecting a dark revenge movie, instead I was pull into a whirlpool of steps and memory that didn't leave me time to breathe. And as soon as a the questions start formulating in my mind was immediately rendered absurd by a word, a gesture, a sound before I finish it formulated it, surprising me on so mane level, Always One Step Ahead.In a movie with a new way of a dark, funny, captivating triller, where, Carey Mulligan is given us the most memorable performances of a woman who froze her life after her best friend died, pretending to be drunk and attracting sexual predators, distributing her own personal punishment.Masterfully direct by Emerald Fennell, where only a woman could give the emotions feeling by watching a movie, that have a subject that become so pressing everyday!Multi nominating oscars for: Best Picture, Best directing, Best Actress, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design Best Film Editing, and it deserve them all, in taking into consideration the co-nominated I'm not going to be surprise if the movie will get a Oscar for directing to Emerald Fennell, and original screenplay."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"Candy-coloured with a dark core - a statement that can describe the protagonist, the antagonists and the film in general.Although Carey Mulligan as Cassandra may be my favourite character from 2020!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,9/10,"This is a really well done little film. Delightful acting, nice twists with a dark theme.I was surprised by every aspect.It's a gem."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,8/10,"Promising Young Woman is an all around well done film with an important message. I would classify it as more of a black comedy/thriller, but reminiscent of Easy A, Election, and possibly this generation's Fatal Attraction. Well worth watching."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 January 2021,5/10,"When I first saw the trailer I thought, this movie could be a modern classic, but there's a lot of room for failure. In my opinion it unfortunately missed the mark, but has potential to maybe be a future cult classic. My problem was the inconsistent tone, misguided direction of the plot, hollow characters, and lack of violence since this was promoted as somewhat of a revenge horror/slasher. Although, I did like the aesthetic of the movie, some of the soundtrack, and the premise (I just wish it was executed better)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,9/10,What a film. No wonder its up for a lot of Oscars and Baftas. Had me hooked from start to finish. Starts off nice and slow but has you hooked as your intrigue grows with every scene. Then it kicks in for the last third and what a ride. The ending is superb and definitely has the shock factor. Has you laughing at times when you shouldn't as well.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,8/10,"What I liked-
1. Thrilling unpredictable plotlines
2. Brilliant acting
3. Candy themed colour palletWhat I didn't like-
1. Problematic moral codeThis is a tricky movie to review on a moral standpoint. Rape-revenge stories are not new, but here we have to give extra emphasis on cultural issues. It is what the entire movie is based on. The tragedy and repercussions are realistic and I, as a woman understand the amount of trauma survivors had to endure. But do I think their vision of tackling with the problem is correct? definitely not. The protagonist was terrifying, we the viewers exactly know how much emotional baggage she has on her shoulders, yet she stays so distant from any vulnerability to the point that the none of the characters know what's going on.People will enjoy the movie as a creative project- the thrill, colour pallet, acting, everything is on point. The final scene especially was unpredictable (I felt sad yet relieved for the protagonist, it's very confusing). But morally-- uh, I don't know."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,8/10,"It is an interesting revenge thriller, with good story and acting. Unfortunately, in some moments, it gets a bit repetitive and slow but the final, for me, improved the entire movie.So i can rate it 8."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 November 2021,9/10,The movie lives up to my expectation and deserves all the praises. The soundtrack and the color use couldn't be gayer. Carey Mulligan did a brilliant job. The ending gives me chill. It's a must-watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 June 2021,10/10,"I liked what she did. The most satisfying revenge film I have ever seen yet. The ending was bittersweet. I wanted her to have a happy life, but that was ruined the moment she found out about Ryan. And F$*k you Ryan."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 January 2021,10/10,"Yes, we watched the movie yesterday and Carrie Mulligan is ready for her Oscar, this is truly confirmed.
In the seemingly comic beginning and the pink-sticky taste and shade of Britney Spears and Toxic is how the director gently sneaks you on the slide so that he can introduce you to the heroine of Mulligan. A dark-plastic clichéd but extremely realistic image of a focused character from the reconciled generation, 30+ years old, who swims in the soap of his own helplessness and seems to slip into alcohol and easily digestible professions. This is Carrie's heroine, Cassandra, who, in a flash, decides to rearrange the past and avenge the memory of her friend, whose death has lain on her shoulders for years and does not give her a chance to get rid of the vicious circle of her superficial existence.
The film somehow echoes Fatal Attraction, Falling Down and 13 Reasons Why, but it shapes its own psycho atmosphere, digging into modern psychology, taking an unusual turn to reveal anger, helplessness, guilt and violence and sending them to you with all their consequences. This is the portrait of a young woman whose goal is to reveal the real culprits for the death of her friend Nina. The film has its feminist niche, although it doesn't try to be didactic and dig in there, it just shows you a human story that ends tragically. The end is dedicated to all those hidden parts of our lives that no one can see and no one would want to accept. This is an allegory of evil that is not punished. Pandora's box is opened with all the consequences and a non-Hollywood ending in the bittersweet symphony of a reality show that stands there waiting to be revealed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,10/10,"I have two things to say about this movie to sum it up: Girlpower and that I hope this movie is like a kick between the legs of all the guys out there and for them to learn a simple question: do you want to do this?Carey Mulligan did an excelent job playing Cassie. How dark this movie might be, it's sadly not an uncommon thing for guys to take advantage of drunk girls or trying to report a sexual assualt and not be believed or have your case in some pile untoutch.It's an important movie about femenism and something every single woman out there are afraid of."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 December 2020,8/10,The ending was a surprise and amazing! You won't be disappointed.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 March 2021,5/10,"Didn't pack enough of a punch to leave a mark and was confused as to what it wanted to be; was it a dark comedy? A thriller? A rom-com? Mixing genres is definitely possible, but very difficult and this missed the mark.I think it could have been great if it took a darker/edgier approach more in line with V for Vendetta or even Kill Bill but instead it was just lukewarm for me. I never hated it, but never got too excited for it until the very end and by then it was too little too late (not to mention muddled by the silly phone/text thing that is just... not real?)All in all, disappointing. Not awful, but it could have been so, so much better. And that sad part was is that the film felt like it believed it was. It felt like whoever was behind it really thought they had done something special, but they hadn't.The ooey gooey rom-com bits that I resented at first actually became the most enjoyable part due to the charisma and humor of Bo Burnham. Unfortunately, by the end of the film you no longer care about that derailment of the plot and are just waiting for the pieces to come together... but they never do."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,8/10,"Serendipity: I watched this after ""Nobody"" (with Bob Odenkirk). Weird comparison, I know, but both are thoroughly enjoyable, if over the top, revenge fantasies. As a straight male I felt specifically targeted in very different ways. ""Nobody"" as a Bro-guilty-pleasure-fun-popcorn almost exclusively built for a certain audience and with cookie-cutter characters (although played with gusto), ""Promising Young Woman"" as trying to touch nerves for diverse sorts of people, with more complex (if also stereotypical and over the top) characters, also well played (notably Cary Mulligan)It was certainly an uncomfortable view, and I do understand how some viewers can look past the obvious logic-defying issues in the script and dialogues, while others forgive those exact same issues. But I thought it was, despite its flaws, decently constructed and with the very interesting touches, such as the leads fingernails (a smart way of showing she has not moved on from what happened years ago, and that it is ""complicated""- maybe I'm reading too much into that); but especially the invisibility of Nina (the victim, but clearly not the only victim) herself in the ""smoking gun"" video that viewers can't see. The ending? Yeah, that wouldn't be possible in ""Nobody"" (or ""Wick"", or whatever). I was going to give it a 7, but I thought that touch deserved extra credit."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 April 2021,9/10,"Really enjoyed this one. Stick with it, i thought it was going to be some Kill billl type rubbish but it is original and interesting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,7/10,"I had so much anticipation going into PYW. I'd watched the trailer what felt like years ago and heard so many great reviews - I was ready to be blown away. The short version: I wasn't. The long version: let me start with what I liked. The soundtrack was genius, iconic female pop layered over some seriously dark subject matters. I also loved the hair and wardrobe choices and the pastel palette that dominated the whole movie, the way it clashed with the ugly behaviours on screen was powerful. Carey pulled the role off perfectly in an understated but memorable performance. Yet somehow I was underwhelmed. Everything was so familiar, the lewd college jocks, the leering builders, the 'nice guys'... I think I was expecting something revolutionary. But maybe that's the point; these issues are still at play, time and time again. It's a predictable story because every woman has lived her version of it and keeps on living it. Where we go from here, who knows? But making movies like PYW that force people to take notice are probably a good place to start."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 May 2021,1/10,"While the initial idea and the plot are interesting, the execution is full of flaws. Dialogues make no sense as well as situation. The acting is soooo bad it becomes hard not to laugh. Don't understand the high rating."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 March 2021,8/10,"Was really good, kinda hits home so if you can't handle watching men being terrible don't watch it. But aside of that it is really good story line and the main character is great. Really great acting and worth the watch. Also super twist ending was not expecting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,9/10,"Keeps you guessing. Great heroine, without selling out in the plot."

Revenge movies do not help a cause or only hurt it.Review:It's hard to write a review without acknowledging how politically charged this movie is. This movie was basically made to appeal to the ""me too"" movement supporters.You may or may not consider that a fault.I considered it a major flaw. I feel like it's also important to disclose I am a female.So here's the story:Immediately we meet Cassie who is by all accounts very drunk in a bar. She's ""rescued"" by a Jerry played by Adam Brody, who has not changed since The O. C.I guess it's the norm for really good looking men to take drunk women home and take advantage of them. I don't go to bars often, so I don't know. I feel like this might happen, but I also feel like these events typically occur when the woman has shown interest in the man or arrived with the man. Does not excuse his behavior, but context is always important.So basically Cassie is only acting like she's drunk, and then eventually lays a bombshell on the sexually eager male animal: She's totally sober!!He's busted!I don't know why, but this really didn't do much for me. I just didn't have this feeling of ""female empowerment"" or ""you get em girl"".Jerry is not her only ""victim"". She keeps a tally of these men. According to her journal she's done this dozens of times. Which made me giggle.Anyway, we discover Cassie is a medical school drop out, still living with her parents at 30 years old. She works in a coffee shop with the owner Gail played by Laverne Cox.Now, at some point we piece together that Cassie is on a mission to revenge her friend's rape back in med school. This is why she's pretending to be drunk in bars. I guess to teach those boys a lesson??We are never transported back to the night in question though, nor do we ever get an idea of who adult Nina is, we only see childhood photos in Cassie's room and on her laptop.During a shift at the coffee shop and while still prowling the night doing vigilante work Cassie meets an old med school classmate, Ryan and the two start dating, although Cassie is a bit slow to accept a relationship, she eventually does.At one point, Ryan discusses old classmates and we learn Al is the perpetrator involved in Nina's rape. He became an Anesthesiologist and is getting married to a bikini model.Armed with this new information Cassie's targets become more specific to the actual event that hurt her friend and her.She creates a plan to get back at the people she feels truly let Nina down and ultimately lead to her suicide (The word suicide is never said but implied).She conjures up some diabolical plans too. She gets an old female classmate drunk, and admit she didn't believe Nina. Cassie appears to hire a guy to perhaps take advantage of her at a hotel.She also hires someone to beat up the lawyer who represented Al, who Nina accused of raping her in med school. She doesn't follow through because the lawyer wants redemption.She also kidnaps a young girl from high school.We learn the teen is the daughter of the Dean of Medical School where Nina and Cassie attended. She did not follow through with a formal investigation regarding the rape, so her daughter is used to prove Cassie's point.During all this Ryan and Cassie are getting closer. She's introduced him to her parents, and Gail. They've fallen in love.Madison shows up all the sudden at Cassie's house and is very distraught. She believes she slept with a man the day they had lunch together. Cassie calmly informs Madison that he was only there to watch her and be there to ""keep her safe"".Now this party REALLY upset me. Cassie has ZERO faith in men, and she believes this?? And Madison immediately does too. It's a truly bizarre moment in the movie.I assume it's only to introduce the evidence of the rape. Madison shows Cassie a video. The video proves that Nina was taken advantage of and raped by her med school classmates and oh sweet boyfriend Ryan filmed it.Cassie goes to Ryan and shows him the video, he's very upset. Makes excuses. She just wants the address of Al's bachelor party.She shows up to the party, as the stripper, greeted by a bunch of grown up frat boys.She slips something in their drink, and coerces a very reluctant Al to go upstairs with her.She handcuffs him to the bed, tells him her name is Nina Fischer to which he freaks out. She pulls out medical tools and basically tells him she's going to carve Nina's name all over his body. He freaks out, and even though he's handcuffed, he manages to get one off and suffocates Cassie with a pillow.Fellow bachelor party friend Joe (Max Greenfield) comes to the room in the morning. Realizes she's dead. They burn Cassie's body.But Cassie isn't done. She has made an alliance with the heart-of-gold lawyer. She mailed him the video of Nina's rape, and instructions to text the wedding party goers. The police arrive and start making arrests for Cassie's death.I've never been a fan of revenge movies. The protagonist in this film doesn't have any redeeming qualities. There are so many ways to keep your friend's memory alive. But she's running around breaking the law though. Being manipulative abs completely obsessed.Honestly, Nina's mom was right. Let it go. Move on.Cassie is a truly horrible person and mentally unstable. She's getting women drunk and kidnapping teenagers to prove a point. Just because nothing violent happens to these people doesn't make this okay. Also, the kidnap of the teen girl she could've totally went to jail for, regardless of the schools investigation.Cassie knows she's going to die at that bachelor party. She was prepared for it. So isn't this akin to suicide by cop?Also, I truly believe if Al didn't want to go upstairs he wouldn't have and would've passed her off to a fellow bachelor.So what did we learn? All men, especially the really nice ones, will always take advantage of drunk women? If a woman being drunk is the reason men should not take advantage of them, what if both parties are drunk?Here's the existential question though:Does Nina's rape and suicide excuse Cassie's behavior?No it does not."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 June 2021,9/10,"My first time seeing Carey Mulligan on the big screen and instantly I fell in love with her. Beautiful and impressive acting. On a side note I would not be surprised if there were to be casting for a female joker, she will certainly be the one. I am amused by her switching characters instantly, like an on-off switch button. Bits of comedy spread out accordingly. I have to admit I expected more explicit scenes but it's alright. Not a total let down because as a whole totally surprised me how good this film is. No regrets watching. Absolutely love the choice of soundtrack in this film.#MrZreviewes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 March 2021,8/10,"Have a few questions about some of the scenes but generally a well done film on an important subject ,definitely one that stays with you .harrowing and gripping ..my biggest disappointment was finding out after watching was that Carey mulligan is married to one of Mumford and sons ...oh dear."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,4/10,"The message of this film basically is: ""If you went through trauma, you can Never Trust Anyone! Never! Oh wait, but then you meet someone, you trust someone, you feel like you might finally love someone again and SIKE! He's actually one of the people who caused you trauma! So if you went trough traume, you might aswell just go on a suicide mission, because you can never trust anyone ever again!""On a technical level the film is good, the directing and cinematography are great, but the message is so disgusting that it ruins the whole thing."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,8/10,"Well this title has allowed Carey to showcase some great talent and will surely open up some career opportunities. But unfortunately, the character development did put a limit on that alent.The overall story is engaging and with a steady pace, but the ending left me hungry for more. If only there were more information on Cassie's character which would enable us to empathize and connect more with her. It could have been even more powerful message.Listen, it's a difficult topic and an equally difficult story. Sometimes Justice doesn't make justice for the victims, and only violence can give birth to equality."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 January 2021,9/10,"Really interesting and tense movie. It's a revenge rom-com that at times feels like a feminine spin on Falling Down or Cape Fear. It has a really good cast of great people being the worst people they can be. It's weird to say I enjoyed it since the subject matter is so dark. It's even weird to call it dark because it's actually a really candy coloured movie... maybe it's Old Boy but with well, a Promising Young Woman."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 January 2021,1/10,What a waste of my time feel robbed of precious time boring movie
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,10/10,"This is such a breath of fresh air. Carey Mulligan is the driving force behind this. Her acting is witty, funny and yet carries this air of doomed sorrow.The story never lets go, and the supporting act is great as well.And might I say that this movie deserved all the kudos for Emerald Fennell. What a riveting screenplay, and the clever direction. Final word to to oh so amazing soundtrack that I'm now listening to. Go watch this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,7/10,"Enjoyable watch, but so can see why men have hated this.Cassandra's best friend takes her own life after a sexual trauma for which the perpetrators were not brought to justice. Cassandra then spends her weekends going out and pretending to be trashed in the hopes that she will be picked up by a sexual predator so she can then go with them and... give them a talking to?.. I can't be the only one that thought the trailer made out like she was murdering these men, or torturing them or something?The ending did not quite pack the punch it should have and felt somewhat unsatisfying.Also, while I though Carey Mulligan looked great, there were times she appeared significantly older than some of the other characters who were supposed to be her school peers and therefore the same age.Enjoyable nonetheless."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 February 2021,4/10,"When you have lived long enough you see twist on plots that you have seen done much better...See ""The Bride Wore Black"" from 1968...."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 August 2021,8/10,"Entertaining drama about revenge and the consequences of pursuing it.A dreadful act that has more victims that we may initially think.The end could have been better, but as it does not pretend to be excessively deep, still quite enjoyable."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,"This is one subject (sexual exploitation, abuse, rape, trafficking, all of the above and below) that people don't want to discuss or think about. With that being said this movie was able to talk about it in such a moving way - even at times with some humor to lighten such a dark subject. I laughed, I cried and my partner and I discussed this for hours afterwards. There is good movies and good acting and then there are movies like this that really make the others take a back seat!!! Please sit down, watch and enjoy. The acting was incredible, the twists and turns are perfect. There are cliff hangars that piss you off and things that happen that make you wonder how do they go on from here. In the end . . . Well I'll let you decide if you like how they tied it all up!!! Again please go see this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,8/10,"Hitchcockian in some scenes, merely standard-issue thriller fare in others, but--thanks to a mesmerizing performance by Carey Mulligan, a slew of nifty plot twists, and a jaw-droppingly unexpected finale--well worth your time. Mulligan plays Cassie, a med school dropout on a kind of scorched-earth (and potentially VERY dangerous) mission to make amends for something from her past. (Don't worry; there will be no spoilers here.) It's all a bit heavy-handed, and the militantly pro-feminist, anti-male vibe may turn some people off (especially guys), but as long as the obsessively vengeful Mulligan is onscreen--and she's onscreen a lot--she'll take you along on a two-hour ride that's liable to leave you breathless. Don't miss it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,6/10,"I had high hopes for this film but was ultimately disappointed. Carey Mulligan was good as a woman bent on avenging her best friend Nina's sexual assault at the hands of some of their fellow med school students. She and Nina subsequently dropped out of school and Cassie (Mulligan) has been working in a coffee shop ever since.The problem I had is that everything is so vague. We never really know if Nina is dead or alive, she's never shown. It's intimated that she's dead.We see Cassie on her nightly trips to clubs to pick up unsuspecting men (usually sexist obnoxious ones), but just what she does with them at home we aren't really shown. We just see her crossing out things in her notebook afterwards.The tone should be ominous yet most of the time it's along the lines of comedy. That's okay, I love dark comedy but this one just felt vague and stagey in a way. The music is over the top at times too.I liked Mulligan's deadpan delivery and there were a few scenes I especially liked (the interaction with her former med school dean; the scenes with her parents). I didn't find the film empowering though as many have said. A lot of it was repetitious plus there was a requisite, albeit awkward, love story thrown in.The final part of the film was very dark and unsettling (and could be triggering). Fennell added a supposedly empowering twist at the end, which didn't work for me. I just found it sad."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 January 2021,10/10,"At the end of the film I felt that the focus is much more on the trauma that settled in Cassandra's mind than on revenge. Throughout the film she tries to overcome this trauma by act almost like a super hero, on the basis of indirect revenge, if we stop to analyze herself she would apparently never have been a victim of this crime, what she does is try to find a way to accept the unacceptable loss of her friend who committed suicide, however overcoming is impossible, she is so deep in this trauma of this unfair loss that for her the days don't even matter anymore, for her any day is just another day when she needs to try to end this crime, causing her to not even remember her own birthday anymore.To some extent it is thought that she could have murdered the men marked in red in her notebook, but towards the middle of the film when she trying to put her plans into practice in one of the guys who appears at the beginning of the film, he gives information that your friend is alive. So I say that I didn't understand the reason for each color, maybe it's based on the level of each of the guys, another point is that what she does with the rapists may not work, we have her perspective, but maybe even giving a scare in the scoundrels nothing guarantees that they won't do it again.The climax of Cassie's trauma happens when she finds out from the guy who was interested in her (which is already a hint of the movie) that the guy responsible for her friend's death was going to get married, then she decides to do her revenge directly, with people who know what happened and didn't give a damn, in this segment the film becomes brilliant because we see her as an unstoppable superhero, the film reaches a perfect and completely unpredictable rhythm, but the film never say that she would be a hero. And then we have a moment when she tries to put it all aside, it happens that a loss will never be overcome and the truth is this, the difference is in the level of acceptance, that in the case of a death by old age we ""maybe"" have more chances to accept, but I disbelief that overcoming it would be possible, and this is a bitter film, which resolves to break this ""movie romance"" in a perfect way, which seems to be a terrible surprise, but in fact the film had already given at least 2 tips before that happens.So we have the ending, which is where the film becomes completely memorable, at that moment I was expected that she would really have her revenge, but the film questions us, what would really happen to a woman who did what she was doing, until there she was thinking only of her revenge but as I said everything is very relative, nothing guarantees that nothing she did will really change anyone, not even the women, it's a dangerous battle that could have gone wrong much earlier, and in the end she already had that in mind, so the trauma becomes greater than revenge, I believe faithfully that she was not in the suicidal idea, but she had Plan B in case everything went wrong.I keep thinking how obscure the film would be if it had ended in that part, with the guy leaving completely unpunished, because I believe that what the director wants to tell us is that there is no punishment in this crime of rape, there is no happy ending, it's very pessimistic but it's also very real, the guy goes to jail for the murder not for what he did to Cassandra's friend. And the final question is also relative, did she get her revenge? Or was this (death) the only way to end her trauma, or both?Carey Mulligan did one of the best performances of the year and I'm already cheering for her at the Oscar 2021."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 October 2021,7/10,"I would compare this movie to a gymnastics routine: one that is going really well until the dismount. I really liked this movie up until the last 15 minutes. It does a great job of making you feel uncomfortable, not sure what's going to happen next. There is a great supporting cast, most in creepy roles. I just really did not like the way it ended. That downgraded my score, but I would still recommend seeing it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,9/10,"WOW, I can't explain it but don't do much research - just watch it without expectations. You won't be sorry."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"Carey Mulligan has been on a tear ever since she started acting. Loved this film, very good story, very solid acting, fun characters, some good laughs. I liked the way the story went down, unpredictable, and kept me interested throughout. Thank you Carey Mulligan, you are one of the best actresses in the biz, loved you in Drive also!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,8/10,Everything perfect in this movie until you reach the end!!! i was hoping give this movie 10 stars
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 November 2021,8/10,A dark comedy with an excellent plot that can teach us one or two things about how trauma can affect life and how some people deal with their past (although not in a particular healthy way).
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman Written and Directed by Emerald Fennell. It's a story about A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, who seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path. One of the best vengeance thriller I have watched in past few years. This is Emerald Fennell's first major movie and she nailed it. Writing and Directing is perfect. I haven't watched Killing Eve yet but I have gone watched it now. The first movie start with dark comedy and step by step it builds into a great thriller. I loved the color tone of the movie and they used it correctly. From start to the end I didn't take my eyes away. Every moment in this movie feels great to me. It's a well-paced movie. The most outstanding thing in the movie is the performance of Carey Mulligan. I think she will get an Oscar nomination for this. Her performance is that good. I expected more character development for Cassandra but it's fine. I should definitely mention the score. The score is perfectly hooked with scenes. I'm not a big fan of the ending but I really respect the bold decision they took and it is risky. After the certain incident happened I had a little faith in justice and I'm completely satisfied. One of the best movie in 2020 you should definitely watch this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 March 2021,8/10,"What a great piece of art. Why you may think I say that? Well the director and protangonist, skillfully bring you up and down HARD. Cassandra is a multifaced woman that is fasinating to watch because you don't know what to expext from her. This is a new genre of film. I'd like to coin it as .....""Hallmark Horror"".Definately worth your time, rent it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,8/10,"It starts as a seemingly low budget drama with middling actors. It ended with me in tears.It's got plenty of twists. There were several times that I was starting to think the plot was starting to slip into bland predictability - and each time, I was wrong!The cast is amazingly talented, includes some big names - and NOBODY seemed to call in their performance. Every scene is on point.Having heaped praise upon it, this film is not without its flaws. It can be slow at times. It has a low-budget feel. But it's still great! The best revenge drama/suspense film I've ever seen, I think. Charles Bronson, stand aside!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,4/10,"Just finished and still can't understand why so much hype about this movie? Do we know what's means REVENGE? Still can't understand why this pretending drunk fishing scenes was about? ... she was doing this for what? at least give us some blood and death moments. overall It was more Fantasy than reality-based. Ending was so unrealistic, schedule messages? Really?
I mean Srsly this is a solution of revenge of the killing your best friend?
P. S Mulligan is amazing and so pretty no doubt but rest was big Meh..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 November 2021,1/10,Doe too much time on why a 7.5 rating but glad to see a lot of other 1 ratings. An important topic treated badly. Watching more than one second impossible. Don't ask why. Don't give it a chance. The 1-4 ratings should have bright it below 7.5. Not all treatment of a topic that deserves attention should be good. This is terrible.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 October 2021,7/10,I like the movie and the storyline was excellent. I felt like the last half dragged out a bit too long and there should have been more bar scenes. On more than one occasion I had people that I trusted turn on me because I was a bit intoxicated (when in my 20's). This movie did a great job of showing how women need to stay in pairs or groups. There are too many creeps out there that want to take advantage of the situation.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 February 2021,10/10,"As stated above I have already watched this film multiple times and it's great each time because upon rewatching you pick up even more little details that continually enhance my opinion of it. The entire cast is amazing and Emerald Fennell is a bloody genius casting male actors we've all seen portray good, funny and goofy characters and they start that way in here and then a 180 happens and you're like ""Schmidt no, don't do it!"", ""Piz, you better hope Veronica Mars doesn't come for you!"", ""Seth don't make me call Sandy!"", ""McLovin why couldn't you just tell her what time it was?!"" Carey Mulligan hands down is flawless in her embodiment of Cassie, just as she was as Daisy in The Great Gatsby, she should receive multiple award noms and hopefully wins for this film. Don't even get me started on Bo Burnham, I've followed his career for years and to have him break our hearts and hope for just one ""good guy"" was unforgivable he did Cassie and Nina and all of us dirty in here!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 May 2021,9/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" is a tale on the revenge a woman takes to achieve her idea of justice for something awful that happened to her best friend. Carey Mulligan plays this young woman, Cassie alongside Bo Burnham (one of my favorite comedians) playing an old friend from college.This film is brilliant, colorful, and intelligent, and I haven't been able to stop thinking of it for weeks. It is smart because you assume a woman's revenge tale would be gory, bloody, more like Kill Bill, but there is barely any real violence shown. It is a realistic take on how a woman who has let a single event consume her personality turn into someone who makes men realize the truth that they aren't the perfect guys they think they are. I also believe it is so genius that the movie shows no nudity of any kind, and does not objectify Cassie or any woman in the movie. Nobody is wearing skimpy clothes or is shown naked; and that is the point. Cassie doesn't rely on her views on most men to get revenge, she relies on their views of themselves.Also, for a movie with a very dark, cynical view on the world, it has a nice contrast with the girly, colorful, sleek, candyland aesthetic of the set and lighting. Every actor is perfect for their roles, and each shot has purpose that I could gush about forever (I am a fan of color theory, so watching the shift in colors was so fun for me). The soundtrack is also pretty genius. I have never been a fan of modern pop music, but to the film's credit, it works well with the environment. I will praise their unnerving violin cover of ""Toxic"" by Anthony Willis.I will not spoil the ending, but it is the most gut-wrenching, sad, bittersweet, smart, exciting, happy, depressing ending I have ever seen. It is everything you go to the movies for.The movie is even genius in the way it uses Roman Numerals. The fourth mark is up for debate who it is, I will just say.For a movie that could so easily fall flat, ""Promising Young Woman"" defies all expectations and is my favorite live-action film of 2020. In a year that had so much horrible garbage in it (not movies, just events in general), this movie gave me the slightest bit of hope for the future. It is my wish that everyone go sees this movie, no matter what gender you are. I am so happy this got Best Screenplay at the Oscars this year, and Carey Mulligan deserved Best Actress despite her not winning."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,5/10,"Great idea but the movie just didnt make it justice. Im disappointed, really I excepted more."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,6/10,"This is a very well made movie, great acting, especially Carey Mulligan. The plot is not your usual revenge movie. It's hard to say anything else about the movie itself without talking the story line.
Your actions have consequences, let it be not doing anything only watch, taking advantages of the vulnerable, kill because you are afraid of the consequences or drinking until you black out. But these are moral dilemmas for a film club or a philosophy club.
The movie is great, it kept me stay put and watch it instead of checking my phone and that's a good thing nowadays.
I'm looking forward to next work of Emerald Fennel."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 February 2021,7/10,"What a horrible decision the creators chose for the music ambient, just in the first made me think in take off the movie cause it is really bad, but I'm glad I didn't.The trailer is also not good cause they could make it better (horrible music too)
But is not something that makes the movie bad, cause it isn't.A good plot. Is not that creative cause we have seen a lot of movies like that before but with a really unexpected and amazing ending.It has a plot twist multiple times and it makes you empathize with the main character. Don't see the trailer, ignore the music but go and watch it"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 January 2021,9/10,"I found myself cheering out loud during this move. Incredible acting, great storyline, engaging, fast pace and fun!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 May 2021,10/10,"An absolutely outstanding movie, and essential viewing. This is the most emotionally brutal film I've seen for a long time. Just when you think you've got a grip on it, it throws a scene at you that twists things further and ups the ante.I'm sure this film has its faults, I just can't think of any, perhaps because I'm still reeling from its emotional impact 12 hours later."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,9/10,"I went to watch the movie thinking it was one thing and in the end it was another. But, I say this in a positive sense, the film surprised me in some moments, mainly the final plot twist. The photograph is very beautiful, I am surprised that I am not competing for this category at the Oscars. The script is kind of silly, but very well executed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,9/10,"It wasn't what I expected, it was better.
It said a lot without being preachy.
Original story, great acting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,5/10,"OK, there are other reviews here decrying the fact that this is hardly the first female oriented revenge-fantasy on offer, and it's not particularly shocking or grand on that particular dimension. So there is no need to belabor the point.If you are looking at reviews before watching (as well as by 5 minutes in) you know what you are signing up for, along general thematic lines with this flick.That said, I think prior reviews are misleading on the potential polarizing nature of this movie, and to that point I'll add my two cents.It isn't the general theme that puts many male viewers off, rather it is the fact the movie ""triples-down"" on its potential target audience.The central thematic conceits of the movie surround the 'subversion' of the rom-com genre. Half of the potential audience for this movie isn't going to feel pulled in by the trope references this movie is pitching because their suspension of disbelief will have already been broken and the genre references will fall flat.If you have been raised on rom-coms, and there is a part of you that still resonates with (however much your rational side may dislike it) I think the middle part of this flick might well pull you in. For me, it really fell flat, but that may be because I am not the target audience.... And that's ok. Not for everyone, as I said up top."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,10/10,"...Wow. No words really, just ... WOW. After the movie finished, I sat there, mouth agape for about 10 minutes, and it stuck with me for a few days after. Full stars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 December 2020,10/10,"It's a comedy, but not really.It's a thriller, but not really.There's a romantic element, but it's certainly not a romance film.I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, except to say that this film crosses several genres, and that I thought it was very creative and interesting. It reminded me a little of 'A Simple Favor', except not quite so dark.Carey Mulligan is superb. Bo Burnham is very funny. I wanted to punch nearly every other male character in the film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 June 2021,10/10,"The best movie I've seen in I-can't-even-remember-how-long.The music is genius, it functions as a red herring.The ending is not where you neither expect nor would like it to be."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,10/10,"This is a movie unlike any other that you won't forget any time soon. Btw, weird all the Joker fanboys are hating on this one, seems ironic to me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 August 2021,5/10,"It tells you something about the state of movie making in the English language world - and it's not good - when a film like Promising Young Woman wins the Oscar for best writing, original screenplay.It's a revenge story with a young woman (played by Carey Mulligan) as the protagonist. Some twists and turns along the way (the new boyfriend was there during the assault), a shock ending and poof, the movie is over. I suppose the shock ending is supposed to add to the gravitas of the story and the film's message. And while the film's theme is timely and the ending is chilling, I wouldn't consider it an outstanding story or rendering or Oscar worthy.As it so happened, the day after watching Promising Young Woman I watched Dog Day Afternoon which, coincidentally, won the best writing, original screenplay Oscar for Frank Pierson back in 1976. Granted, Dog Day Afternoon had Sidney Lumet as Director and the towering performance by Al Pacino at its core, but the drama of the script, the characters and scope of the film is evident Oscar-worthy material even 45 years later. To say A Promising Young Woman's screenplay doesn't even come close, is an understatement.Promising Young Woman had some good performances (Mulligan, Bo Burnham) and the story had some good momentum, but for me it didn't amount to much more than a risqué movie of the week."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 March 2021,10/10,"I absolutely love this movie, I've watched it several times. It's a finely crafted film on a sensitive subject matter. It's a haunting story of revenge and taking responsibility for past actions. In some cases delivering karma personally. It's thought provoking and fun.Carey Mulligan is brilliant (as usual). Bo Burnham is hysterically funny. Laverne Cox is amazing and beautiful. Plus many more faces you'll recognize. Great spundyrack throughout the film as well."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 August 2021,1/10,"Terrble movie
previsible
weak dialogues
weak acting
stupid plot."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,9/10,"What a great film, really enjoyed watching it, loved all the characters and the build up just reminded me of the first time I watched films like Sleeping With The Enemy, Pacific Heights etc"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 March 2021,8/10,"I almost went this route a few years ago when I was broke and not able to get a job. Too old but not old enough for SS. I follow quite a few of these folks, and think Bob Wells is a hero for helping people live well when good fortune seems scarce.
Those who gave this low ratings were expecting more drama and polish. This is a real American story."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 July 2021,8/10,"The movie starts off as a sort of ""classic"" romantic comedy/drama but fortunately that is perhaps only a ruse, as we come to find out in the meantime. This film has the courage to do what most movies up until even today have failed so pathetically to do, adopt a most bleak and realistic view of a potentially real life situation where the protagonist doesn't always win just because they're the protagonist. I don't want to give anything away so I will simply end by highly recommending this film to anybody! I'm not such a big fan of most of the soundtrack, however."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 August 2021,6/10,"I've learnt not to take notice of the ""movie of the year!"" Headlines that accompanied many movies over the years and I was right to do the same with this.It's not the worst film I've seen, good in parts but overall disappointing.The relationship issue that rears it's head near the end was predictable and a number of other scenes left me feeling puzzled.You're gonna love it or hate it..Rather like marmite."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,6/10,Threw me off a bit. Wanted to like it but I thought it was poor. Strange casting decisions.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,9/10,"Amazing comedy / action movie.
The black comedy that this film handles portraying simps, ""good boys"" and other characters typical of our times is perfect"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,10/10,"This movie is very deep, painful yet still sugar coated! amazing twist turns this movie even darker and after that its just downhill bleak... a must watch for men. i can imagine this could be triggering many for women.
my only criticism is that the main actress looks too old for her role. she is 35 in real life (and 30 in the movie) but looks like 50. so thats a bust on make up department."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,"The last 15 minutes had my jaw drop. This movie was very well done! Felt very realistic and unfortunately most women will be able to relate to it. Some parts will make your blood boil, and some parts will make you laugh. It's not at all like what I expected it would be. The ending was bittersweet, I wish it would have ended differently. But I think the movie got its point across loud and clear. I'd watch it again. The people giving it negative reviews are probably just like the men being depicted in the movie and they can't handle the truth."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 August 2021,9/10,Carey Mulligan 's performance is so good that remains with you. Great story beautifully direct. So far best film of the year. With all the cgi'movies so boring and with stupid story an dialogues this seems a diamond. Beautiful.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,,"I kept waiting for her to slice his throat or stab him in the chest multiple times, while the pillow was on her face and that it was all an act. (she did fake the being drunk routine the whole movie, that's why). Also we never get to see her dead face. Since she was so messed up, i even thought perhaps she even acted it all out till the very morning :) But Nope!Uptill then i gave it a solid 7.9. (almost every movie takes the easy road sometimes to keep the story going, even if it is illogical for people to do something stupid or convenient. For me the biggest one was the phone with the video. (which is a videotape) lot of trouble to convert that and send that around via mobile. And even that is weird as it not smartphones as we now today)Good acting throughout the movie though.7 stars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,100% Carey Mulligan made this good to watch. Such bs to see them put her fourth on cast in alphabetical order wth? She was the star and most important character!?!?!? This movie hit home. The degree to which she was able to portray how men systematically ignore all of a woman's cues!! Its like they think they are the star character in every interaction and they suck so much at doing the right thing. First time that i know of seeing Carey Mulligan in a feature. This was worth the exorbitant new release pay per view fees!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 May 2021,10/10,I hope all the girls be in safe in this bad world.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,"After reading about the premise and seeing some interviews from the director and Carey, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I knew a lot of heart and thought went into it, so I was intrigued.I am so glad I was able to experience this movie in a theater rather than at home. It's important to support directors, actors or movies you want to see more of in the future. This movie is that for me. I would say it's the best thing I've seen since Nightcrawler. It was fairly original, had a lot of interesting intentional imagery and coloring to set the mood, which I normally fail to notice or care about, but everything felt like it had a purpose or meaning in this. I wasn't sure I would like Carey for the role at first, because like many others I don't find her to be very alluring, physically. Especially since I'm a female who has grown up with women like Scarjo, Angelina Jolie, Denise Richards, etc., it's hard to look at Carey Mulligan as being some kind of femme fatale. I thought that before watching this, but I take it back. Carey made this role so much more believable and interesting than someone like Margot Robbie ever could. She wasn't annoying or excessive in the role, she was unexpected and surprising. She brought a lot more dimension to it than most people would imagine, and it was really cool to see her in this kind of role. The director made a great choice there. This movie was really fun, funny and at times, dramatic and relatable. It's not simply another revenge tale, it has meaning. I was worried it might be too feministic or political, but was relieved to find that it wasn't at all. I would recommend this to anyone!The ending was one of the best around! I wasn't sure where they were going with it, but I was practically giddy and out of my seat for that climax."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,6/10,I am a woman and the reviews making this about hating women etc..are stupid. Let's trash the movie for reasons true film lovers do. Soundtrack was good. Bo Burnham was a surprising scene stealer and a joy to watch. Carey mulligan was so thin her skin seemed to be falling off her face but the film did nothing to help her at all with makeup. The pressure put on women is a sad problem in Hollywood yet it is definitely going nowhere. So get better at makeup. Bo's face appeared blotchy and red on his lip like he had a cold which I found very distracting. Makeup! On the story line it was ok. Could have gone so much better though. Seemed like it was PG'd down hardcore. I saw where it was going with the mom but didn't land. Cinematography could have been better at telling this story and others. It was OK of a movie. Slower than I expected. Mulligan's acting was good but the direction did her no favors. I almost went to the theaters to see this because I was so excited for it and so glad I didn't risk covid for this. My counterpart fell asleep. He was also excited to see it for weeks.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,6/10,"When i saw this movie was nominated to five oscars, i decide to give ir an opportunity, and perhalps this is not a boring movie, but it's far from my expectations."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 April 2021,10/10,"Man, that was the best feminist and revenge movie I ve ever seen.Design good
Music good
Acting good
Cinematography good
Good linear editing
Plot was good
Plot twist touched my heart."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 November 2021,6/10,"We should see more movies on the topic. It's an imporant issue that should be addressed more frequently and spoken about openly. I liked the way they presented the plot by slowly making us understand what actually is happening. The actors have done a good job too. I was very surprised by the plot twist. On the other hand I didn't really like the choices for music in the movie ... except ""Toxic""."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,"Whew...watching this movie takes a lot out of you. Carey Mulligan? Just hand the statue to her. What a fantastic movie and I will not give away anything for those wanting some sort of window into this gem.If you think you have seen this play out before on screen, I promise you haven't. I appreciate the fact that it's a movie where the director shows us what they want us to see, but there is an undercurrent of so many things we want to know.Are there any nice guys out there?It's a brilliant movie on many levels, and the ending..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,"One of the best films I've seen for awhile. Beautifully directed and photographed. It's disturbing, gripping and funny - the actors give it their all - my favourite scene was the one with Mulligan and Britton, after this, you know where the movie is going- dark! I don't want to say that this is a woman's film because it's not but some of the reviews on here detest the man bashing. The man bashing bits in this film are well deserved - enjoy 😉 and think about it people !"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"I was intrigued by the story line, satisfied with the romance - felt it needed a little more vengeance but when it came to the ending I was thoroughly satisfied. Carey Mulligan was sarcastic, witty and badass. The men were... well they had it coming."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 September 2021,8/10,"OMG! A pleasant surprise, Carey Mulligan was great, and pretty too (but don't tell her I said that). Very worth the watch.***Spoiler***: Wish she could've stuck around."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,9/10,"Fantastic performance by Carey Mulligan in a great script and directed movie. The other actors, mostly low levels, are good as well but Carey steals the show. Its a too relatable story to dismiss with Careys character taking action against all these nice guys in general and the gang in particular. The ending is a little sad but at the same time the ultimate bitter ending/revenge."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,8/10,"To prove that Hollywood can still delight, after a string of boring recent movies respectively starring otherwise highly respected Tom Hanks, George Clooney, and Kevin Costner, I was delighted to have seen this awesome movie tonight. Everything was great. Story & plot, script & dialog, acting & direction, even the photography & locations. Loved it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,9/10,"Wow, the movie is good, it surprised me a lot, I thought the movie was going to be done in a way and it was totally different from what I thought, good casting, Alfred Molina the villain from Spiderman 2 and Clancy Brown from The Shawshank Redemption"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,9/10,"And probably it should become a compulsory film, kind of a requirement on the path to graduation. It is not a perfect movie, it is not a pleasant movie and definitely it raises a middle finger to audience's expectations. Viewers who want the filmmakers to lead them by the hand, gently whispering in their ear ""this is a metaphor and it stands for trauma"" while one of the character clearly says the same exact sentence, will be disappointed and will dislike the film for its inconsistencies, or the music, or the colors or the lack of fart jokes, LOL scenes or quotable lines. This is a deeply unsettling movie. It offers a refreshing point of view and it should be discussed and analyzed over and over again until, hopefully, society will change and this will really be a dated portrayal of characters and situations. It's been 33 years since ""The Accused"", yet this could be almost a companion piece to that movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,4/10,"4 stars was generous. And it's a shame because this could've been something truly interesting had the writers and producers not felt compelled to turn it into such a sermon, and a bad one at that.The plot is dumb and was delivered by a cast of pathetic caricatures rather than interesting characters. And the ending was just idiotic - no other word quite works.If you don't have anything at all better to do for two hours, watch this awful movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 June 2021,9/10,"Like a grown up Hard Candy or Teeth. Holds nothing back. Beautiful film, love the soundtrack, colors, twists, all of it. This is a dark comedy thriller, not for the faint of heart, or people who can't handle a reflection of the most privileged and dirty parts of our society. It's likely and unsurprising this movie will get a lot of hate. It focuses so much on women, realistic experiences we all have, and how the world handles straight, white, well off men. I mean, the Dean at one point basically quotes part of what the judge for Brock Turner said at his sentencing. Doesn't get more realistic than that.If you are concerned about all the low rated reviews, think about how this movie skewers the privilege of men. Then think about who those low ratings came from, how uncomfortable they are to see a mirror held up to their actions. Of course they gave it a low review!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,9/10,"One can write many cliched sentences talking about relevance, society and more. What this movie does do is examine several critical components of the gaze, the contract of consent, power and culpability as well as the intoxication of anger and the role of witness. Never does the cast overplay their roles, and this is not simply a Death Wish style vehicle short previews may indicate. There are many male archetypes included in this film and the idealized or imagined responses to such constructions these men often develop. This final point embodies a detail of the movie which makes it even more devastating; an essential fantasy quality which one might find on any media reinforcing toxic gender paradigms enhances the potency of its acerbic message. That message is there are consequences to every action, women are angry and that rage gets lost in a society addicted to violence. One must leave this film asking themselves whether women are defined in male terms, is power a necessary attribute to our modern society and if so, who holds it and how. These are prescient queries not just for the moment, but for one's entire life, and you will never stop asking them...nor should you."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 November 2021,7/10,"Let's tally this up: Lives of 2 amazing women are sacrificed so the bad guy can get arrested and shamed at his wedding. Hardly sounds fair.Having said that, the story is captivating. Dark, funny and even joyful at times. The acting is effortless yet deep. The pace was swift with nary a dull moment. The soundtrack was another star adding to the many layers of each scene.-2 for the bad guys outliving the heroine."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 May 2021,5/10,This film feels like it could be one of the greatest but it's just the first draft and needs tweaking. The plot takes a few random turns that don't quite go anywhere or make sense but they feel so unique and interesting. There were a lot of great details in the plot - probably too many. The last arrest scene was just shockingly bad.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"Well it bloody well better - it's only January but I'm not going to see a better performance than Carey Mulligan's this year. She was just incredible in this movie from start to finish.The film itself? Enjoyable and absorbing, if flawed to some extent. It was a little difficult to accept Cassie's decisions in the final act and the sacrifices she was making, knowing what might happen to her, considering how strong a character she'd been portrayed as for the previous 90 mins. The tyre iron scene was a small insight but there needed to be more scenes showing the direction she was heading in - I'm still not sure I'm convinced.Good supporting cast, especially Alfred Molina in a tiny role. Best thing I've seen from Alison Brie in years. But they're all overshadowed by Mulligan. Without her, it would have been a very different movie, and likely nowhere near as good."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,10/10,"Excellent movie.
Best movie I have seen in a long time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 March 2021,10/10,"The movie wasn't what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time with several plot twists. It highlights an important subject matter that is heartbreaking and uncomfortable but delivers it colorfully. I highly recommend this film. Hopefully more movies focusing on this subject matter will continue to bring attention to these horrific events so we can keep the conversation going."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,8/10,"A captivating film, not obvious and that makes you think, in particular on the personal actions that characterize the choices of the protagonists.Although its duration is almost 2 hours, all in all it is smooth; but it could easily last 20 minutes less.A feminist film, written and directed by a woman, Emerald Fennell, and masterfully acted by Carey Mulligan.Vote 7,5."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,10/10,This is an entertaining chilling movie explores the impact of sexual assault and extremely interesting way the demonstrate how complex the issue is. The main characters acting is phenomenal in the movie makes you think about the real world impact that sex crimes have an individual's. The end was extremely shocking and very unexpected. This movie is intense Journey that will leave you extremely disturbed. It's unforgivable movie that will stick with you Long after You're watching experience. I would not recommend to watch it when you're feeling stressed but if you're ready for an intense emotional trail ride that will leave you thinking about the world in new ways I would recommend it. I think this movie should win best picture.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,10/10,"""Promising Young Woman"" shows what type of negative path one can go on if they let their grief and need for vengeance consume them. I am aware that this film is divisive because of its ending, which I will not go into, but I personally enjoyed it. Carey Mulligan does a great job as Cassandra Thomas, our dreary, dry-witted and admittedly mentally unstable yet likable protagonist who is deliberately written to be as much of a Anti-Role Model as possible while still allowing for the audience to root for her in spite of her actions. Despite all the mixed reception from the film, one thing that I can't dispute is how ballsy this film is in taking certain unconventional risks in its storytelling. This is going to be a film that will evoke thoughtful conversation and for that in itself, I applaud it. This film isn't going to be for everyone but I personally give it a recommend."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 June 2021,10/10,Carey Mulligan is brilliant. An incredible and original story. So entertaining and so emotional. But the ending was slightly felt bad.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 January 2021,7/10,"The whole movie's story can sum up in one sentence.She was a young promising woman, and now she is nothing.This is not about revenge, this is not about women rights, not about love and not about revamping a broken life. The movie is about that powerless feeling of being a marginalized or oppressed person, nothing you do works ,and nothing you say will make people care, life shrinks into just numbers on calender, you live thru days that doesn't even create memory. For a brief moment, she met someone who might rescue her, at least that's the on screen illusion suggests, but with that new found relationship, comes insecurity and lies, which only push her away from this potential happiness. The whole story is blatantly sad, she never had a chance to live.In a way, this movie is like Mickey Rourke's TheWrestler, it never wanted to satisfy.The part I really like about this movie, is how the director using (almost) still images within a movie to make suggestions to her eventual insignificant demise. No spoiler example: early on in the story, there is a scene when she got cat called, there is a shot several seconds long, where she merged into a construction background, almost disappeared. Another one, the end of nurse outfit scene (it's not a spoiler when it's in the trailer), something white covers her rainbow hair, the outfit is mostly white, the bedsheet is white, the pillow is white, she just drowned and disappeard into this whiteness, lying there straight like a typical detective show victim, one you forget right after you see it.Acting is good, but too depressed, it's not great with my own struggle with depression, I preciate the movie as an art piece, but will never watch again."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 May 2021,4/10,"In my opinion, this film is a failed attempt to mix different tones and genres. It could have been a lighthearted and fun feminist revenge flick, which it is clearly not. It could have been a serious film about a 'me too' subject and the psychological effects of rape on the victim, but it is clearly not that either. It is rather a cringeworthy cross between the two. There are scenes with Tarantinoesque violence, but these are not trashy or fun either, they made me cringe so hard that I had difficulty continuing to watch it. The characters are all cliched and caricature-like. Add to this the feminine colour scheme and the upbeat, girly soundtrack and you get a very silly mix. Then again, pehaps I just didn't get it.I only rated it four because I actually like Carey Mulligan and also because the movie is memorable in a way, even if only as a failure."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 January 2021,7/10,I liked this but the end is a little far fetched. Its a sensitive subject that is far too common and possibly by showing such an extreme situation it ignores the more typical scenarios.Cary Mulligan is excellent but the rest not so good. The family does not really work and i think we need to know more about what happened to make sense. Not a fan of flashbacks but it may have helped it here as we are left to figure out what is going on and why.Spitting in coffee was so good though. The fact he came back should have told her all she needed to know.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 October 2021,4/10,"A lot was made of a hapless professional reviewer who opined that Mulligan was 'miscast' for this part. Personally, Ithought she was too young for her take in Collateral as a cynical, world-weary detective when she was barely thirty. She looked a little old for this part, but fine, let her stretch, maybe she'll nab that Oscar & recognition she appears to crave. But the main problem with PYW is the godawful writing. Superficial characters mouthing light, empty cliches, this is barely a step above teen horror fare. The premise is threadbare and, again, adolescent in execution. The writers apparently recognize a good movie when they see one; there are references to Lobster and Night of the Hunter. Maybe they need to immerse themselves in further research before taking pen to paper again. For all our sakes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,8/10,"This is a good film but tough viewing, sad to it's very core. It's particularly difficult as it reflects the experiences of many other women.I wish the Cassie character could have found a healthier way to exact her revenge- perhaps this is her reality?Overall the strength of the the film is the performance of Carey mulligan who is a fabulous actress, she takes the difficult material and creates a flawed complex character.My criticism is that it was a bit predictable and even the ending was what I expected.It raises many important issues and for that alone I applaud it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 April 2021,9/10,"Got to watch ""Promising Young Woman"" yesterday and with the exception of a few scenes that don't mesh with the story, I loved this film.Carey Mulligan stars as Cassie, a troubled woman who still hasn't gotten over her roommate's rape and subsequent suicide so she goes about pretending to be drunk out of her mind to fool random men. A common theme of this movie is revenge and in many of the scenes she plays psychological mind games on people that were connected to who was responsible for the rape. That leads to many phenomenal ""cameos"" by the likes of Alfred Molina, Alison Brie and Connie Britton.Bo Burnham, a very underrated comedian, plays the love interest of Cassie and some of his scenes pertain to the example of those few scenes I mentioned earlier that don't mesh. When I was watching it, I originally felt like the director had no idea which direction she wanted to go and it felt rushed but as they picked up I was hooked and understood it more.There is only one scene that I found truly laughable that stopped me from giving it a 10. After a really dark scene, Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham are shown at a pharmacy and Paris Hilton's ""Stars are Blind"" is playing and they're dancing happily to it. I thought, ""huh""?That aside, Carey Mulligan was truly amazing in this film, the writing was spectacular, a lot of the scenes are completely unpredictable and the ending was something I did not see coming at all!!A must see!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,8/10,"This incredible movie reminded me so much of Kill Bill it's hard to know where to start. First off you have this female protagonist that has absolutely no life except for a single driving purpose of righting a wrong. In the case of Promising Young Woman it's not a fictional murderous mastermind that the lead actress is fighting but a social problem that exists everywhere in the world : sexual predators preying on defenseless victims. And she has to do it one man at a time while putting her life under constant risk, while not having a single soul she can confide in.
The pacing and tension building of the movie is great. You often have those slow moments that are never too long and are very prone to turning into very intense situations. Another nod to Tarantino's Kill Bill is the chaptering in the second half of the movie which I find to be a very neat cinematographic trick that has a great impact on the viewer.
The lead actress Carey Mulligans was incredible at portraying this complex character that is both self isolating from the outer world but still yearning to be able to trust and love again.
The one thing I did not enjoy at all was the ending , which might have been somewhat expected but will still stop me from rewatching this movie as many times as I have rewatched Kill Bill. If it had ended differently I would give it 9/10 but as it is an 8/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,8/10,"This movie is so sharp and on point. Just perfect for now. In the unfolding story, both men and women are culpable, either through direct action or through silent complicity.Carey Mulligan is totally believable in the role of Cassie - I can't do her performance justice here. The casting worked from the key roles right through to the smaller bit parts.The script is superb and takes some satisfyingly surprising turns.It's difficult to discuss without giving spoilers and I'd hate to spoil anyone's viewing pleasure.Just watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 December 2020,10/10,This movie is brilliant. The storyline is clever and intriguing. Acting is amazing and the main point is strong and resonates well. A new spin on a age-old problem. Definitely worth seeing.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 March 2021,8/10,I absolutely adore Carey Mulligan. Have watched her since her Doctor Who episode Blink in 2007 and have been amazed at how incredible she has been since. This is her 3rd nomination at the Oscars and I'm praying she wins. What a performance. I would go so far to say it might just be her best ever. Hopefully Emerald Fennell gets an award too seeing as this is her DEBUT in directing. She's going to be certainly one to look out for. A movie that everyone must see.PLEASE GIVE CAREY MULLIGAN HER DESERVED OSCAR!!!!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,7/10,Promising Young Woman fulfilled promise her promise....
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 May 2021,8/10,"After watching the movie, I must admitted that, I have been fascinated by the topics of this movie, ranging from revenge, sexual abuse, seduction, overshadowed female lives. Cassie Thomas is a vigilante, whose life and actions was defined by the death of her best friend, Nina. The movie surrounding the topic of revenge, although not taken into a violent measure. The movie itself is a ironic, sarcastic portrayal of a grim, unjust reality that every women have to face, that the term of ""promising young man"" has overshadows ""promising young woman"". This is not any female led revenge movies, where you can expected a stylized action scene, or a graphically violent scene that depicts revenge, it's a revenge movie that is unique, creative and innovative in a new way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,9/10,"I loved this film. I found it to be dark, funny, weirdly romantic, yet infuriating and frustrating all at once. The script is excellent and the direction is so well thought out. Carey Mulligan is just an absolute powerhouse, I believed her in every part of this journey. The ending completely floored me, yet felt terrifying and truthful all at once. I found myself sitting in the cinema for a long time after it ended. Hooboy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 November 2021,10/10,"Over the course of nearly two hours, Emerald Fennell (nominated for an Emmy for Best Supporting Actress for ""The Crown"" and who here directs and writes the script) perfectly and ironically draws the representation of the fear of leaving home one night and not coming back the next morning, the fear of spending the night at someone's house and not coming back the next morning, the fear of getting lost in a feeling of love and... Well...Award-winning Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, ""Promising Young Woman"" introduces us to Cassie (Actress Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan), a young up-and-coming young woman tormented by past trauma and now apparently spending the night in nightclubs drunk, hoping to become the victim of stalkers and potential rapists, but not before turning the tables and putting her assailants against the wall.Cassie, a nickname for Cassandra (name immortalized in Greek mythology by the character who spoke the truth, but nobody listened), lives in her parents' house and works in a half-baked cafe, appearing to be nothing more than a woman without salt and no future, but just like Ryan (Bo Burnham, visionary director of the movie ""Eight Class"" and nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy for his special musical ""Inside"") impresses by being more than a cute pediatrician and a good guy, well as Alfred Molina's brief appearance (who will be in the upcoming ""Spiderman: No Way Home"" reprising his role as Doctor Octopus) delivers a memorable layered character, the plot Fennell's screenplay developed for Mulligan to drive is of undeniable quality.While some might argue that Promising Young Woman is nothing more than a big clickbait with no substance or plausible ending - an unfair reviewer specifically claims that this story is nothing more than a disservice - in my opinion the film has an engaging, thought-provoking, dark plot. And distressing in a way, but enveloped in a glittering 2000s wrapper that deceives even the most observant of viewers. I'm not kidding when I say I was breathless with the heat of the climax, I remember as if it were today, I felt betrayed at a certain point by the choices of the screenwriter and director. But, looking at this plot in retrospect, there is nothing fairer, more poetic and beautiful than the ending rocked by the voice of Juice Newton with his classic ""Angel Of The Morning"". Promising Young Woman is a pleasant surprise that may displease many, but it surprises when it takes a while to get out of the mind, it takes the viewer to reflect a lot on the problem represented on the screen, and be surprised by the sad reality that women are forced to face out in the world, abandoning their promising lives to face traumas as horrific as the revenge of a sexy nurse named Nina."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 June 2021,10/10,"From the first second to the last, the movie kept me intrigued with well written characters. It never played the sexism card to the extent of being cringy.Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham were amazing! I believed every line of theirs and the tension they could build was insane. Such good chemistry! Bo kinda knocked it out of the park. I didn't expect that!-----------------------
Enough said, let's start with the spoiler-bits:The movie had me 3(!) times, where I thought it would end soon, and it never did in a positive way. The story really took the time it needed to make the viewer reflect on what was happening. I as a man will surely never fully understand what it must feel like to be constantly prey to men and even fall victim.But the movie slowly started tugging on this rug and when it was revealed that Bo's character was there when it happened, at first I caught myself thinking ""oh well, he was young and didn't know what to do."" then the movie kept rubbing in our faces that 7 years have passed. And honestly, any male over 16 years old has no excuses here. He could have stopped it or at least reported it. But to imagine he COMPLETELY FORGOT what happened in only 7 years just shows how little he cares deep down in his core.So yeah. All of them got what they had coming. Love the revenge from out of the grave type of deal. Very twisted, intense and shocking ending to this movie.Every time the flick almost lost me, It got me back immediately.It was a box of chocolates with funny scenes, lovely scenes, f-ed up scenes, detective scenes, psychological scenes and so on.I also love how the movie does not shy away from making clear that Mulligan's character is kinda insane and has psychotic tendencies as a result of the psychotic tendencies in many preying men that is widely accepted/ignored still.The first few of her victims fell perfectly into that gray area, where they feel like they didn't do anything wrong and ended up either realizing it finally or just being hurt in their ego.Well played over all. I would not change much, if anything!For now, I will have to leave it at 10/10. For what the movie wanted to do, it succeeded on all fronts IMO.Might adjust the rating after a rewatch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 September 2021,8/10,"If Jodi Foster's character in the accused never received justice and decided to take matters into her own hands, Promising Young Woman would be that movie. Sort of. In this case, the woman looking to exact revenge isn't the victim of the assault, but her former med school classmate and best friend (Cassie, played by Carey Mulligan).Mulligan delivers a terrific, Oscar-nominated performance as the psychotic friend out to get everyone involved, and who she feels bear responsibility for her friend's subsequent death. This includes not just the guilty male college classmates, but the Dean of the medical school who dropped the investigation, and a female classmate who didn't believe the rape accusations. Meanwhile, she entraps men by going to bars, feigning being intoxicated to lure them in, and then revealing that she's sober the moment they try to take advantage of her.Yet, Promising Young Woman isn't your average story of revenge. The film delivers some twists and turns along the way, including revelations about the ex-classmate she is now dating. Ultimately, the revenge Cassie delivers isn't a dish served cold, but one delivered ingeniously and ever-so-deliciously.Of course, it's hard to view Promising Young Woman outside the lens of the recent #MeToo movement. The ""woman should always be believed"" Narrative is weaved into the plot. And though there is no doubt as to the guilt of the offenders in the film, in real life it's not always so cut and dried. If you're a devout member of the #MeToo movement, however, Carey Mulligan's character is your hero.The film is not without its holes. In one scene, Cassie is stopped in her car in the middle of the road. A road rage incident with a male driver ensues, leading Cassie to take a crow bar to the guy's truck. He drives off instead of getting out to pummel her, or even calling the cops.We discover the friend's assault was videotaped and circulated to numerous other classmates -- none of whom revealed its existence to the school or to authorities. Knowing this evidence existed, it makes no sense that the female classmate Cassie targets for revenge wouldn't have believed the accusations. Yet, somehow she still had access to it years after the incident.And how is it possible that each time she put herself in such obvious danger with strange men that nothing bad happened to her?Despite these flaws, PYW is still a terrific, unique film deserving of its nomination, including its win for Best Original Screenplay. It is the Oscar-worthy film the Hallmark Channel never could make."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,6/10,"Not too bad, it got me hooked and it wasn't boring, just didn't like the ending"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,8/10,"Probably the best film I've seen this year, although I haven't seen many. The film starts slowly and is not that easy to follow at first, but the plot develops and you start to understand what has gone on before, both in the film and in the past of the characters. The acting is excellent, the subject matter difficult and those add to make it a very good film.There is an unexpected twist near the end which changes the perceptions of the film, and is extremely unusual in a film of this type, but the resolution was perfectly executed.Carey Mulligan is truly excellent in this film, and the promise shown in the part of Sally Sparrow more than a decade ago is really fulfilled."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,9/10,"I really did enjoy this movie genuinely! Even if you're not a feminist or if you're a male, this movie is enjoyable for how dark and real it is. The movie goes fast, but does unfortunately slow down in the middle when it focuses on Cassie's personal relationships, but it's worth it to see the entire movie pan out. If only Covid didn't ruin the massive audience it could've had because this movie deserves widespread attention!Lastly, the soundtrack was astonishing, but not more than the lead actress's acting. She blew me out of the water."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,8/10,Give this a go. It's great. Story is good. Really great last 30 minutes. Casting very good too.Great job.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 January 2021,6/10,"Well, Mulligan may seem the weirdest option for this character. But she was good."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 March 2021,1/10,"I expected so much more. I watched with a large group of friends who love Mulligan, as do I, and this movie tries to hard to make a point instead of just being entertaining. Sad."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 May 2021,10/10,"I loved everything about this movie down to the very ending. So well made, no notes!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,7/10,"Without spoiling- I definitely went into this movie thinking it was one thing, then it wasn't quite what I thought, then it took a 180 and looked like it was going to be rom-com type movie then the ending completely flipped everything upside down and was very unexpected, in a good way.It was a bit distracting that all of these ""30 year olds"" were being played by like 35-40 year olds."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 February 2021,9/10,"Best movie I've seen in a really long time. Totally took me by surprise. I say go in knowing as little as possible. Very dark, but oh so fun and perfectly cast."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 October 2021,7/10,"Wow. Just wow. Carey Mulligan's acting is exceptional in this film. This is a seriously nuanced performance. She perfectly walks this tightrope of a deeply damaged woman with this whirlwind of emotion inside of her, whilst simultaneously showing no emotion at all. This isn't an easy thing to pull off but Mulligan makes it look effortless. In my opinion this is her best, most mature performance to date (which says a lot because she's always on point).It's also a great looking film. Very vibrant and bright..the colours leap off the screen. I strongly recommend you check it out. Yes the subject matter is heavy but I think it's a topic that's addressed carefully and respectfully."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 March 2021,10/10,"I didn't have my hopes very high for this movie, but it blew me away. The story is very original and you can never predict what's going to happen next. Emerald Fennel does a terrific job writting and directing, creating a very dark atmosphere. Great job by Carey Mulligan too, she deserved that Golden Globe.Best movie I've seen this year. Should have done better at the globes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 December 2020,10/10,"I didnt know what to expect when I saw the trailer. This is so much more and goes deep to the core.
The ending had me in tears and clapping my hands. Awesome acting and storyline. I give it a solid 10!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 August 2021,7/10,"An entertaining movie for sure. It has a good rythme and gets you through a whole range of emotions by somehow being three different films put together. And that's a difficult task to undertake but somehow it pulls it off.My only compaint is that the changes between the funny,absurd and the dramatical elements are not done smoothly enough and that confuses the viewer on how to feel at times. That's the reason the ending doesn't really land for me. (It's also a little exaggereted. Less would be more there.)This movie reminded me of Kid Detective, (also a hidden gem of 2020 ) but more ambitious and political."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 January 2021,7/10,"Other reviewers here are writing that they thought this was going to be a 'serious' movie... I knew from the poster, the trailer, the title, the casting etc. that it was going to be a cheap thriller.Being a cheap thriller, ultimately, it has to have a twist - and being a Hollywood movie, an A-list movie, the twist in this one would have to be unexpected, otherwise it would end up as a mid day movie.There have been so many thrillers written in the last twenty years that most 'twists' have been done already. It's very difficult to come up with something new for this genre.To come up with something new sometimes means stretching the suspension of disbelief to disconcerting levels.Or worse, writing a screenplay that while entertaining and with an exciting, unexpected twist, just doesn't make any real sense."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,4/10,"No characters, no real story, nothing to write about.. aesthetics were nice, soundtrack was cute and the idea interesting. But as revenge stories go this was just bad"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 March 2021,9/10,In most of the film I was like OK so what? So what? Although I love mulligan's performance I got a bit bored. But oh my the ending the music the cinematography! It is propably one of the strongest scenes I've ever seen!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,8/10,"Kinda creepy to watch. This has happened to me more times than I can count when I was 16-18. And it's men in their late 20s and 30s going it. They purposefully get you hammered until the stage where you can't really say no. Even if you do protest they pretty much ignore it, cos you know, she's drunk, she saying no, but doesn't mean it cos I'm not able to scream and really struggle. It's things like me saying; ""I need to sleep, I don't feel good."" Him: ""Oh, no you don't."" I've totally been passed out and they do whatever the hell they want. Sexual entitlement is real. These men should be so ashamed of themselves. You know who you are. Despicable."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,10/10,"I am now a new fan of Carey Mulligan! What a movie. Brilliant score, plot, writing and acting. No spoilers but an absolute watch. Men who are scared of this movie are for a reason. Me too movement embodied in this dark comedic movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 March 2021,9/10,"#LIKE, Is a micro budget movie, more drama/horror skew, not comedy, but all about (!) the revenge women crave.I have been following the the debate about the fired film critic - who I think wrote for The Hollywood Reporter - He said Mulligan wasn't pretty enough to play this role, for a 'honey trap' movie - and when she pushed back there was discussion on all sides about how she used her 'fame/power' to get a poor critic fired, but what is she supposed to do? Remain silent? Anyway, the meta argument about that mirrors what goes on in the film - should women saty silent or should they vent their rage...It was so satisfying to watch both these films, seeing angry , imperfect young women kicking ass and taking names!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 October 2021,10/10,"I thought this was awesome. It shows the nice guys, the ones that everyone likes to claim to be, rarely are.The soundtrack was brilliant, the theme certainly captured the zeitgeist, and the acting was spot on. The ending was surprise, but totally fitting.I absolutely loved it. Though maybe the work ""loved"" is wrong - it resonated deeply with me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 July 2021,7/10,"I wish this script was implemented by European movie makers. Hollywood cliches are all around this one even though they get torn apart, at least partially."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,8/10,"This film opens an important dialogue but does so while being clever and entertaining and never dull or preachy. The major achievement is the films humour and tone, it keeps you engaged with some heavy subject matter and is always on point. There is some farfetched plotting and some contrivances that don't quite work, this didn't ruin the film for me, but probably did stop it from being a stone cold classic. Great acting all roind too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 August 2021,10/10,I don't think I'll be adding anything new here. Brilliant film!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,10/10,"I have watched this movie 3 times now and I could easily watch it 3 more! I only rented it though so time has ran out. Ok so I had been waiting for this film for a while. I missed it at the cinema, but I kept waiting until it was available to rent. It certainly did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded my expectations on almost every count!This movie isn't scared of the uncomfortable, in fact it relishes it. However it also delivers some very sweet scenes and has the colour and soundtrack of a rom com. This was done on purpose of course. As was the casting of famously 'nice guy' actors and casting them in roles that may not be so 'nice'. The kicker being that they think they are nice guys, until they are called out. Misogyny and rape culture have become such a big part of our society, shockingly so and calling out these apparent 'nice guys' is very satisfying. The sound track is full of female pop music, with remixes that add something extra. The colourful, pretty clothes and settings seduce you into thinking it will all be OK. What it is getting at is just how normalised rape culture is that it appears even in a rom com type setting, along with leaving us to question some rom com's in themselves over the years and the toxicity that hides beneath the glossy love story.This movie is a call to arms and calls out everyone involved in covering up this rape culture; men and women. It is not anti men it is anti the society that we live in that makes it OK for someone to rape or sexually assault someone, especially if they are drunk. Also excusing past behaviour as 'we were just kids'. Infuriating and glad that gets called out too! This movie gives me chills, I have a visceral reaction to it. Saying that I also had fun watching it, despite the heavy undertones etc. This is a black comedy in part, which I love. It is written and directed by a woman and this is clear in the characters, dialogue, soundtrack and costumes. One of my favourite quotes in the film that made me laugh was after she was told that she wasn't even that hot she responds with; You're hardly dropping panties yourself Paul. When was the last time you scored in daylight?'In summary this is my favourite film and with each watch you find something new! Even the title is important as it refers to a rape case and how the rapist was called a 'promising young man.' This film asks what about the promising young women whose lives get destroyed by sexual assault?! Watch it, don't read spoilers as it will ruin it. Just watch and take it in, do not look away, this is an important film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 January 2021,9/10,"This film did what few films do: it broke the mould. I was surprised most of the way through the film. It could have so easily become cliche and it resisted. Well written, even better acting. It left me with a similar feeling that I had after watching Hard Candy except this had a lot more moving parts. All this from a first time director too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 February 2021,8/10,I didn't know how I felt about this film after watching it I was a little unsatisfied and frustrated but it's overall a really good film like it's not what I expected and the soundtrack is unreal the more time has gone on I'm obsessed with it and I don't know why I just think it's the best new movie I've seen in a long time! Definitely recommend the watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,10/10,"When I saw the trailer for this film, they played a sinister orchestrated piece of Britney Spears ""Toxic"" and since then I knew that I had to see this movie.The film focuses on Cassandra getting revenge on the death of her best friend, who was a victim of sexual assault. She goes out to bars pretending to be drunk and waits until a ""nice guy"" takes her home to his house and tries to take advantage of her, later to be confronted and humiliated.Carey Mulligan was phenomenal in this role. The way she portrays a women planning her revenge, it makes us, the viewers, root for her and sympathies for her. But the biggest praise I can give is director and writer Emerald Fennell for writing such a compelling, gripping and mesmerising film.This is a #Metoo, revenge movie. And it is a revenge movie at its best."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,3/10,"The main character was built up for so long, with no result. The horrible acting in the scene where she was about to kill the guy completely ruined the movie.The message of the movie was like: people get away with this all the time, and no one listens to the victim. We get it. But the movie itself was just not good. It dragged on for so long and bored me throughout. I stayed committed because I thought something would happen, only to have the characters completely change their nature at the end, without any sense. Character development goes out the window. And of course the worst part of the movie, the Al character, acted so horrible. The worst fake crying, the worst crap ever.The only redeeming qualities of the movie were a couple of jokes.Horrible movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 July 2021,9/10,"'Prosming Young Woman' is a playful satire on the double standards that dictate our sexist society and comes across in its intent surprisingly well without falling into the ridiculous and the grotesque. Cassie, portrayed by a captivating Carey Mulligan, is a 30-years-old woman who never went forward her best friend's tragic past and every night conducts a second life: she pretends to be drunk to see if men try to sexually assault her. In each encounter, once dropped the mask, she assumes the role of the oppressor in order to vindicate her old friend who was brutally raped during a party and overturn the social norms.This movie promotes a strong stigmatization of the patriarchal system and all its inane mechanisms without caring about how it can be perceived.Its promise is to be unapologetically irreverent and the result is rather satisfying."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"I love this! This movie touched on so many things. It added to the suspicion of murder and rape. I love how it touches on such serious and sensitive topics in the way it did. It went to the extreme but it fought for us women who cant. It shows how most men take advantage of women drunk (or even not) and it took it to ways that we wish we could because of the pain we felt. It also touches on the fact that our friends and family wont believe us and suicide. This movie means so much to me even though it is the extreme. It has everything I love and everything I relate to. Like friends not believing me, people believing the male just fir his image. This subject needs to be talked, explored, and educated more about. This movie perfectly executed the extreme. I love it. I needed this as a women. Thank you!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 October 2021,8/10,"Honestly, there is no end to the love I feel for this movie. The wit alone is worth all my stars. Carey Mulligan is superb, and this script was made for her."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,3/10,"The best parts of this movie are the cinematography and the definitely surprising twist. The movie looks very nice and colorful, there are some great looking shots. I think everything else was subpar, the movie could've been much better as a sole thriller without the comedy and romance.People describe this as dark comedy but for someone who likes that genre very much I did not find it funny at all. It's juggling between being a thriller, a comedy and a romantic movie and it just doesn't work for me. Feels like the rom-com is in there just to balance out the very heavy subject matter, which wasn't handled very well either. The movie is like 40 minutes longer because a character conveniently forgot to call someone back, causing the whole middle section to be a filler. The last 30 minutes are decent, wish it was more like that the whole time.
Acting is pretty bad as well, some people have got rather embarrassing, parody-like roles.Making the movie this way undercuts the message it's trying to convey, I would not recommend watching it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 July 2021,2/10,"Seriously I was so looking forward to this, after all the reviews. You could go for a walk and come back and nothing entertaining happens bar the end. I get the quirky, I get the weird is cool but what a bore of a story."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 June 2021,10/10,Incredible movie with some what unsettling ending. Defiantly worth to watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,10/10,"Absolutely Brilliant! Important subject matter, gripping story, some of the best dialogue in ages, and a sublimely transformative performance by Carey Mulligan all make this the best movie of 2020. And the fact that this is the directorial debut for Emerald Fennell is kind of mind-blowing. The film is rife with finely tuned technical craft shaping the tone throughout, such as the specific utilization of music in key areas to build and punctuate the underlying narrative, or the Hitchcockian framing of certain scenes, like when Cassie is admonishing the Dean of the University in defense of her deceased friend (who she's memorializing in a sense), and the camera facing her is panned back to encompass two people in the shot, as though her friend is there beside her . . in spirit perhaps? Chilling. It's not often a movie comes along with an alchemy of cinematic riches as deep as this, but there's no mistaking when it does . ."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 June 2021,5/10,"Felt like it had so much potential but just ended with a lot of questions. Questions like;
She had scheduled messages. She didn't go out planning to be murdered.Why weren't all the bachelor party confused that they'd been drugged and all came round?Why did they disguise her murderer, with her dna all over the place and he was literally defending himself. Tell the police the truth!?What was with the Nina necklace?Just a tip for those that do leave reviews. 10/10 or 1/10 scores means your review probably isn't worth reading."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 November 2021,7/10,"This vigilante genre movie has a satisfyingly surprise ending. Overall, a gruesome reminder of the extremes of justice served when the means justifies the end. A few good well played scenes despite the familiar plot line of a girl on a revenge trip, action."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 July 2021,8/10,"I loved this movie. Brilliant and unique. I think I liked it even better than ""Gone Girl."" Thought provoking, unpredictable, well done.I'm not saying this for ideological reasons. I'm male and I was actually not 100% on board with metoo. But regardless of your opinions on these kinds of subjects, if you step outside yourself for two seconds you will enjoy this film.It was entertaining, smart, deep, everything I could want from a movie. It didn't even feel preachy, because it all fit so well into the mind-blowing story being told. Emerald Fennell: thanks for your hard work. Can't wait for any films you write/ produce in the future!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 April 2021,10/10,"I hope this wins best original screenplay at the Academy Awards because goddamn. This is so well done.On the surface it looks like your regular good old thriller but it's the undertones that really matter here. The movie never tells you who's the bad guy, there's no monologue explaining everything that's wrong with society. It just shows you what happened, and that's enough. That's enough to make you think. The facial expressions- the raised eyebrows, the eyerolls, the panic and pain in people's eyes- they are enough to make you angry or uncomfortable or disgusted. And that's the sign of some great storytelling.There wasn't a slow moment- it pretty much picks up pace from the very first second and all the actors were great. I am really impressed with this!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 October 2021,10/10,"As a man writing this, this story is just one of thousands that don't get told, until now. Whether it's the ""me too"" movement or not, women's stories of truth are making their way out to the mainstream. Sure the acting was incredible, mulligan was incredible, but it's the story that has happened to so many faceless women. This story needs to keep getting told to show the truth about how men get away with so much more than women. I think there is no better time than now to rip open the facade and show what's really going on with the power men have had over women and how misogyny shows it's face in power."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,9/10,"I think that men forget that this movie didn't portray every man as a predator, not every man in the club approached drunk Cassie, it just showed the ones that do. But it's also a mirror of society, this actually happens! It's even shown that some women don't take allegations seriously. Maybe it's not all men, but it's certainly all women. And it's one thing to not like the acting, script writing, etc... if it's the message of the film you have a problem with, you're part of the problem."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 January 2021,,"I wanted to like this film. The concept was interesting and amazing. But the execution was off. The characters were not completely believable. I really like the entire cast in this film. But Carey's character wasn't believable being that she could go be as scary as they try to make you believe. I felt that there was so much that could have been done. The conclusion felt a little lackluster to me. And I didn't really sympathize with her character. She ties up and holds a knife to some guy who is about to be married towards the end of the film and we're supposed to side with her when he breaks free and kills her in self defense? Now I do agree he deserves to be punished for his part in a rape but her extremism didn't work so well for me. That being said, I didn't hate this film, nor would I say it was bad. The commentary on it is amazing and the acting is superb. I just felt a little disappointed after because I had way too high expectations."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,,"Great achievement in the first feature film for Emerald Fennell.
The movie is great till the start of the third act which I find it kinda unsatisfying and even now that I am thinking about it I still have mixed feelings toward the ending of a very well done movie.
Carey Mulligan is great after her performance in ""suffragette"" which was six years ago.
I don't want to complain much although I'm fine with the ending but in my humble opinion I think Emerald could have done better, but once again she is gifted I hope she will have a wonderful career ahead of her
It's very good movie; I recommend this any human being..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 February 2021,4/10,"One-dimensional and two-dimensional characters can work for a film when the plot drives action quickly. But this film's heavy reliance on stereotypes leaves viewers caring very little for main protagonist Cassie after the first 30 minutes. The performances by Mulligan and all of her costars are solid, but the dialog and backstories of all characters are thin to the point of insulting. Examples: Apparently all 3+ of the onscreen guys who encounter drunk protagonist Cassie are single-minded jerks who cannot seem to keep their hands off her (or who gloss over her her own deceitful behavior when confronted with their own). Or a pediatric physician used to chatting up sick kids cannot seem to ask meaningful questions and pinpoint suspicious stories in the coffee shop barista he is courting. And 30-year-old Cassie's parents have never caught on that their formerly brilliant student doctor might be leading a double life despite living at home for the last 5+ years. And who knows how poor barista Cassie got the money to pull off the variety of her stunts?An interesting plot in need of a better writer / director."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,10/10,Great film. Totally unpredictable and that's what makes it superb. Kinda reminds me of 'The Devil all The Time'. The acting is top notch and the writers did a good job with the dialogue.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 November 2021,9/10,"This could have played like dozens of 1970s or 70s inspired rape followed by violent revenge. Those can be satisfying in their own visceral way. This is on an entirely different plane. It's a revenge flick, except it isn't. It's a vindication of #metoo, except it isn't. The victim here is dead. It's her lifelong friend with survivor's guilt and overwhelming grief that is exacting revenge. Except it isn't exactly revenge either (until the end which is reminiscent of ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" )Strong performances by all, especially Carey Mulligan. Her complete devastation and dedication to a sort of lifelong karmic mission comes through. She's also very smart in how she, doesn't exactly exact revenge, more like exacts a crisis of conscience and making people realize when it could be ""metoo"" how they react differently. One scene with the dean particularly powerful. Another scene where the subject already had that crisis of conscience and comes out already redeemed. There's just enough ambiguity in the moments leading up.Just how good this film is you won't realize until you start thinking about it a few days later. There are a lot of subtleties that you may not notice in the moment."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,9/10,"Cautionary tale of ensuing deranged elaborate revenge plot so common in some young females pandoras box!
But, tell me, where does a traumatized young woman,emotionally mulling over her friends demise, previously in ""college"", still living with mom & dad, working in a coffee shop, get the $$$ & resources to entrap & threaten her past ""abusers"", carte blanche?? Must admit everyone has thoughts, but intellectual & psychological constraints halt the madness. Too many predictable elements, kinda reminds one of those cutesy teenage witch cheesy movies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 August 2021,7/10,So watching you think oh no really it's gonna end like that but then it twist kicks in and it's all so worth it I really liked Clancy as the father he's a great actor ha.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 August 2021,6/10,"Script: Not getting what you're expecting can often times be a great thing, and the marketing & trailer only shows a little portion of the actual plot so it really didn't give anything away. But if you are expecting an action-horror-revenge-thriller but you are actually getting a slow, dialogue-heavy, intricately crafted script which mostly tells and not shows, I was, after the first two acts, really disappointed.Leaving my point about the trailer and marketing and trying to be objective for a second, I think the script is actually well crafted and deserves its praise, but is rather slow. 10 or 15 minutes less runtime I think wouldn't hurt.In my eyes, the real strength is the third act. This third act beat me up like a group of burglars in a dark corner. But the rampup to this, while well crafted, was really slow at times.Cinematography & Camera: My other issue I have with the movie is its looks. Same with the script, the looks are amazingly crafted, there is so much love and intricacy in so many of the shots, but on the other hand it also looks really artificial, which in my eyes hurt the movie in the sense of making it not feel ""alive"" or ""real"".Sound: The choices of some songs seemed really weird to me sometimes and not in a good way, but also some other songs really helped the scenes burn into my mind (that britney spears toxic violin solo anyone?). A mixed bag of weird and amazing.Acting: She acts brilliantly and she basically steals the show here. I liked how Bo Burnham acted aswell, although I didnt really feel a chemistry between the two. Which may have been deliberate. I also remember Max Greenfield fondly. This movie is a good example of great acting in my eyes.Structure: Its weird. There couldve been two movies. The first one may have been the movie the trailer establishes, a maybe bloody and gory revenge thriller. The second one, a movie without that part the trailer shows, more concentrated on what happened back at the university, with flashbacks and stuff. Maybe.I might have to rewatch this a bunch of times. I for now am pretty sure that if I was the director, this movie wouldve been completely different.Final Thoughts: Such a weird one for me honestly. I was on one hand really really disappointed by the movie. On the other hand this movie left me speechless in a good way. This 6/10 doesnt tell anything honestly."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 November 2021,8/10,"I understand the point of the film and I mostly agree with it but the point showed in a too fat way. The film tells ""all men are ****"" it is ok but here is very poor dialogues to take it seriously.The film is very beautiful and plot is interesting. 2nd half of the film is much better than the 1st one. And romantic dialogues here is very fun."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 February 2021,10/10,this movie is absolutely fantastic.i am absolutely in love with bo burnham <3men are the literal worst and are ickyplease win an oscar
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,8/10,"This was cleverly written and I loved that it had some questionable moments of morality with the protagonist despite having so much empathy for her pain. Carey Mulligan is a fantastic actress so I knew I would not be disappointed with her portrayal. One minute I was totally on her side, the next I'm feeling she's gone too far with it, then I'm back on her side again knowing that nothing will change otherwise.I very much appreciated the writer's choice not to glorify the crime itself or make it solely about the victim's undoubtedly tragic story of trauma. She allows you to fill in those gaps yourself (or not if you'd rather not think about it!)Given that the protagonists are all good looking, seemingly kind, educated, white men (yes, white privilege absolutely applies here) who, ""were just having drunk fun.. It was years ago..blah blah"", the film so importantly captures the societal assumptions about the majority of cases of sexual assault thus forcing the viewer to feel internal conflict about whether it was a mistake that could be forgiven or not. The answer is ""not"", by the way.I feel like you'll either get the message the film is trying to send, or you won't. If you don't, arguably you're part of the problem but perhaps that's too divisive.It's a rollercoaster ride of a film that manages to bring humour despite a very unfunny subject matter, a true shocker of an ending, with an excellent cast and a chance to really question where your own morality line is. What more could you need from a couple of hours' entertainment?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,10/10,I love this movie a lot even as male it shows so much of what happens to women on a daily basis and how men can get away with everything they really showed that in the scene where she talks to the director of the school. But be safe out there
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,10/10,"This was an unexpected surprise. I didn't go in with high expectations, but enjoyed it a lot. It is a phenomenal movie. The director did a wonderful job"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,7/10,"First time director, Emerald Fennell, who you might've seen in The Crown, offers a really solid directorial debut. Her film is a gripping revenge thriller, that tries to take into consideration the recent #MeToo movement and look into its ramifications and implications of both parties involved.Carrey Mulligan offers a stellar performance as Cassie Thomas, who is on a revenge spree to avenge the injustices that occurred to her best friend, Nina. Mulligan goes to great lengths to portray the multiple facets of her character, creating a three-dimensional character in a genre that accustomed us to one-dimensional scream-queens.While there are plenty of positives, such as Mulligan's stellar performance or the great tonality established through the films disturbing soundscape, the film also has some slight shortcomings. Despite it's unsettling tone, the film never manages to really thrill the audience, being quite devoid of tension. Also, it's worth mentioning that the film at certain times feels a bit disjointed, especially towards the end, when it feels like multiple ideas were spliced together.Nevertheless, despite its flaws it's a solid debut from Fennell, who offers a revenge thriller that is perfectly fitted for the current #MeToo climate, while Mulligan offers one of the best performances of her career. Give it a watch, you won't regret it!Score: 7/10."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 January 2021,8/10,"This was so good !! Carey Mulligan is amazing who can demonstrate strength, vulnerability, humour, creepiness, forgiveness & grief. Cassie is not a character you want to mess with or get in the way off. Such a dark matter & good to see rape revenge not done in straight up horror. I did think the ending was a bit rushed but still loved"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 March 2021,3/10,"The tag line for this movie is ""Revenge Never Looked So Promising."" But a more accurate tag would be: ""Revenge Never Looked So Halfhearted.""Fennell's attempt at dark humour and social commentary falls flat at just about every turn. The screenplay is underdeveloped and loaded with plot holes (many of them defying all sense of logic); the characters are mostly stereotypes; the first shocking is twist all-too predictable; the direction is derivative of far more talented filmmakers and sluggish as well; and the second shocking twist in the denouement is both laughable and insulting at once.I suspect the inspiration for this wildly uneven film came from three different sources. . .one from real life, the other two from fiction: Christine Blasey Ford's courageous testimony before the Senate Confirmation Committee, and the motion pictures ""Elle"" (a searing dramatic thriller about a rape victim bent on revenge) and ""The Girl Most Likely To..."" (a wickedly delicious dark comedy about a homely college girl who exacts revenge on her tormenters after reconstructive surgery turns her into a gorgeous bombshell).The problem is, ""Promising Young Woman"" lacks the devastating poignancy of Dr. Ford's testimony, the simmering dark passion of ""Elle"", and the sheer joyful fortitude of ""The Girl Most Likely To..."" And so, in the final tally, it fails to deliver on all that promise.It's worth noting that despite the film's many shortcomings, Carey Mulligan, Alison Brie, and Connie Britton all manage to deliver exceptional performances. Sadly, I will never get to see these performances again, because as good as they are, none warrant a repeat viewing of this disappointing misfire."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,6/10,"I thought this film would be taking a look and exploring the extremely complicated world of what consent really means. It's not. It's a black and white story of a horrific rape perpetrated by men who are all caricature villains. Nothing to learn here unfortunately.If you do get over the one-sidedness of the argument and the horrible, horrible, jumpy pacing of the whole film and then get over the fact that Carey Mulligan, who looks like a mother of 4 in her forties, is playing a 29 year old party girl (great actress that she is, it's hard to act against the hands of time) - then you MIGHT be able to enjoy what is, admittedly, an ending I didn't see coming.A pretty good story, badly directed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,5/10,"I felt like the final message worked against character development. The death scene wasn't a break or make moment for me as it was for others but the scene where bo burnham lies to the investigator to save his career, and deliver the ""everyone is likely to turn the blind eye if the truth could destroy their lifes"" message. So the plot was a little contrived there. I also believe that she knew in the back of her mind that she wouldn't have a long life because of her ""missions"", and that's why when she was asked why wouldn't she get a better job, have her own place, create a family she said that she didn't want any of it. Due to this, I believe her death wasn't just a plan B, knowing that Al would eventionally burst out if she stalled and threatened him enough. Something that goes along with the rest of the plot. Remember that she only tried to ""send a message"" to those who persistently looked the other way and seemed unchanged or unmoved, with no actual intention of hurting them. For such a dark theme, the candy colored presentation and the slightly sarcastic / humoristic tone, for me, demolishes any chances of impovement on subsequent viewings of the movie.The movie is overall good but if a screenwriter wants to deliver such a message, supporting characters shouldn't be an afterthough but be more rounded. I always see this in Von Trier films who does not let his characters speak their ""movie language"" but his."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,6/10,"I enjoyed this movie. Some nice scenes and some decent acting. Strange ending though, I imagine he didnt get jailed because she drugged all his friends and tied him up, so he'd just plead self defence and she'd be seen as the crazy one??"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,10/10,"Best movie I've seen in years! The script, acting, production, visuals etc are all fantastic. The story has a few plot holes when you really think it through, but it is still a really fantastic film.I don't see this so much as a comedy, despite the comedic elements it's very poignant and left me feeling empowered. But what is really amazing about this film, is that a wide viewing of it may actually reduce the number of sexual assaults in our society - whether that be for ethical reasons or simply fear of punishment. So this incredible movie serves not only to entertain but also to make a positive difference in people's lives. And that folks is how you make a movie! All involved in this production should be proud."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,6/10,"If you are looking for a revenge thriller that the trailer implies then this will not be the movie for you. If you go into the movie without expectations, you may enjoy the ride.First, I loved the casting of this movie. Almost all actors played a role contrary to their typical type-cast. The direction was also wonderful and playful.I can see how the central character is frustrating to viewers as she refuses to fulfill
expectations by neither taking an extreme nor taking a logical approach to solve a problem and reconcile with reality. This said, the messaging around sexual assault is handled relatively lightly so this movie may be even more frustrating for survivors.Unlike other reviewers, the end did not ruin the movie for me. I liked the ultimate message as I saw it: a woman must destroy herself completely in the name of justice."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 June 2021,8/10,"The subject matter is rather heavy but the story is executed lightly. The actors, all strangers to me, did a good job. The main protagonist transitions with ease between cunning psycho, justice heroine and human being allowing herself to be vulnerable.The end was... unexpected, but it's a good reminder of the price you have to be prepared to pay for your being right(eous)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,2/10,"Watched this movie to see what the fuss was about. I love revenge movies, especially if a female is getting revenge but I was so, so disappointed in how this ended. A real shame in what could have been a great movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 March 2021,9/10,"True black comedy indeed !Movie was unpredictable and ending was just above imagination. Sometimes it's a matter of time and moment when will man shows his another face. Good acting, really funny moments and ending was what makes this film in a competitive race for the upcoming Oscar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,10/10,"As a woman, I've experienced this movie as a truly cathartic experience. It exposes the chauvinism that all women have faced more than once in our lives, reacting as (also more than once) we would have liked to ; therefore the resemblance to Tarantino. Also, Mulligan's performance is superb. Although it can be very raw at times, it is a much-needed film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,10/10,"This was so well made, so well written, well acted. This was a great thriller without blood, gore which was much more appreciated by me. I really liked the way each person was responsible and addressed in their own way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 January 2021,9/10,Highlighting current issues in a poignant way with a great ending.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 November 2021,6/10,I don't want to give anything away. The movie was good until the final act happened. Up to that point the story had me sucked in. I really cared about the main character. But the end fell apart badly and didn't fit the main body of work. It was like two different people wrote it. So I gave it a 6 rating. 8 for the bulk and 4 for the crap ending.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 May 2021,9/10,Ignore the hatersA mystery that keeps you guessingMust have been a close call for the Academy for the Best Actress Award as Carey Mulligan is exceptionalA must see.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 July 2021,10/10,I remember when this movie came out last year and I really wanted to see it but I never got around to it. I saw the movie pop up on Amazon Prime the other day and I got my sister to watch it with me. We love this movie!!! The main character she was a total boss and made sure folks got what they deserved. Another excellent film I'd recommend everyone to see!!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 August 2021,10/10,"In my opinion, this film stands out and also checks some boxes that make it special. Must-see. It's a Tarantino-esque joy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,8/10,"I have never expect the end of story, before 20 minutes of the end, i thought the story is over and now the role of the ending music, but the fascinated end surprised me.From the story side and the idea the author want to delevir its great and meaningful. Design and colore are awesome. Charactars is real and finally you well not regret the time you spent on the movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,1/10,"I tried to watch this, but can't stand it after 30 min of the show that goes no where."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,10/10,"The subject is difficult but relevant and dealt with brilliantly
The acting is amazing.Best film I have seen for ages.Don't think I will forget it easily."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 March 2021,6/10,"Interesting movie about revenge, I loved the main idea but execution just disturbing despite I love Emerald Fennell so much. 1st part of the movie was great, but it's hard to say the same about the 2nd and 3rd parts, especially the final. Carey Mulligan's performance was very good, she's likely to be nominated for Oscar. Fantastic performance."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,9/10,"Firstly, give Carey Mulligan an Oscar, please and thank you.Secondly, HOLY SH-
Genius writing and directing. Starts off slow but it picks up REAL quick. The cinematography, specifically the composition of the film, was incredibly clever. It's also very colorful and who doesn't like colorful? Highly recommend, and amazing debut for Emerald Fennell."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 March 2021,3/10,"I had high hopes for this but it was just so bad and blah. They spent so much time following the main character doing whatever that you totally forget what the point of the movie was
Skip this one but on the plus side some nice casting choices."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 August 2021,10/10,"This was such a great movie. I found it last year when the first trailer came out and I've been waiting to watch it for awhile. I even read the script before I saw the film, but I was still shocked. It's a beautiful film, and it's also so painful. The balance of pure black comedy and drama works very well. People will complain about the closing ending, and I understand, but I believe the closing five minutes were the perfect mix of reality and optimism. The final moments were paired with the song ""Angel of the Morning"" and cut to other storyline wrap ups in montage - y fashion, which truly made it stick in my head long after the credits rolled. Go see this and give Carey Mulligan an Oscar already."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 February 2021,10/10,"Cinematography, plot, script, acting, suspense and unbelievably eye opening. Every young male and female should watch this and I can't tell you why."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,9/10,Yes! Just yes. You don't expect what comes your way. It comes hard. I loved it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,9/10,"Very impressive story, writing and acting. As disappointing as the ending was, there is still a degree of satisfaction that justice will be served."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 August 2021,7/10,Loose script and not so convincing story rescued by some great acting and a tight screenplay. Questions still remain as to why Cassie begins her tirade after meeting Ryan? The targeted people turn out to be damp squibs the moment she shows she ain't drunk enough. Where does she get the finances to do what she does? The entire storyline is thin and unconvincing. Yet my rating is just for the performance of Mulligan who got into the skin of the character and stayed throughout. Rest of the cast was more of ' also rans'. My rating is a 7.5 for the film 1.5 just for Carey.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,6/10,"I really wanted to like this movie, but the quality wasn't there. A vast majority of viewers will find it entertaining, and it is...in the moment. That said, I'm truly shocked over the fact that it's nominated for 5 Oscars. A gesture that is indicative of a rapid decline in arts/cinema culture.(Spoilers & Rants below)#1 The Character performances are hollow. Most of the scenes play out like a messy sit-com, minus the laugh track, and despite trying to be impactful, the dynamics of the scene fall flat.#2 The movie wants us to take the issue of rape culture seriously, but ends up creating a farce out of the deepest issues it's trying to touch on.#3 SPOILER. Why is the main character so obsessed with avenging her friends death? Were they secret lovers? Her reasons for revenge are never fully touched on, yet she seems to take on all of the emotions & trauma despite the fact that she herself was not the direct victim. Even the mother of the victim tells her to ""move on"" and in so many words, tells her to stop coming to her home unannounced.#4 SPOILER!!! The suffocation scene played out terribly and by the time it was established that she (Carey Mulligan) is dead, I felt more confused than ever.#5 The ending scene played out like an episode of Black Mirror called ""Shut up and dance"", which came out in 2015, I think. It was the SAME premise, although Black Mirror executed it flawlessly. The editing of the ending in PYW was subpar.Again, I know a lot of people will enjoy this movie but does it deserve all the accolades it's received? It's a big NO for me."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 March 2021,5/10,"Surprising, because one doesn't often see actors of the calibre of Carey Mulligan and Alfred Molina in something this simplistic. Surprising, because I would have thought it hard to raise finance for a movie which purports to say a lot but ends up saying very little, and that neither eloquently nor particularly well. Surprising, because I see this screenplay has been nominated for numerous awards, which makes me wonder if it's being judged by more forgiving criteria than is normal? To me, as a filmgoer, this is a first film which looks just like a first film - with all that statement suggests - so it surprises me to see it assessed as if it's something more.The film, overall, is not bad - one can pass an easy, thoughtless two hours with some popcorn and only an occasional glance at one's phone and not feel too resentful by its end - but there are some glaring weaknesses of the kind which often arise when there is no filter placed between writer and director because they are one and the same person.It's rare to find screenwriters with sufficient self-control to prevent themselves being overwhelmed by the onerous task of blending message, material and structure, and Emerald Fennell doesn't pull it off. Had the film been directed by someone else, perhaps accompanied by the usual script discussions, rewrites and edits, then it might have been deepened, enriched and considerably improved. Doing it alone is an ambitious project and few writer/directors have the vision, objectivity, dramatic experience and harsh self-critical judgement to match the likes of Orson Welles, Quentin Tarantino or Andrea Arnold.Let's deal with some of the weaknesses:* There is no character development to speak of. As the film begins, the lead character has apparently spent seven years working in a coffee shop, frequenting bars, chastising men and keeping score in her journal. By the end of the film she has done little more than move that score-keeping from a book to a phone screen. All other characters are static.* All characters are woefully clichéd and two-dimensional, mere ciphers that exist to say their words and push the story along. In this simple revenge story the characters exist merely as bearers of oft-repeated complaints and statements. A puff of wind would blow most of them off screen. Most are forgettable within minutes. Carey Mulligan does a first-rate job with weak material but is left, ultimately, to carry a story which is not well crafted.* Female characters are typically superficial, driven by self-interest, covetous or acquisitive.* Male characters are either predatory, weak, violent, craven, duplicitous, inconsistent, self-obsessed, unaware, lacking empathy, rapacious or untrustworthy.* The story takes place in a sterile vacuum. There is no world beyond the coffee shop, the house, the clinic and some bars. These settings are no more than convenient backdrops where authenticity takes second place - the coffee shop's turnover wouldn't support one employee let alone two. They could be painted scenery and would do just as well.Such weaknesses often arise when a lack of writerly controls allows the core message to overwhelm the story, relegating normal dramatic structure, character development and plot pacing to a distant second place. The screenplay reminded me of commendable efforts by film students.As such, this film presents less like a dramatic tour de force and more like a series of points which the writer was so keen to get off her chest that she forgot to construct a proper framework on which to display them. I imagine its central (indeed only) message will resonate with a female audience but that, unto itself, doesn't turn it into a well-crafted film.Writing a screenplay is tough. Writing and directing one's own screenplay is much, much tougher. Fennell does a creditable job on her first go, but no more than that. There's a considerable gap between that and creating an accomplished movie which is well written, properly structured and then realised on screen. She has some way to go to reach that level. How surprising..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"The trailers looked exciting and actually amusing, however, the movie takes a dark turn and the ending left me in tears."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,10/10,"The subject is controversial, but there should be no controversy over the excellence of this film. Carey Mulligan should get an Oscar for her performance, although everyone in this movie was good.Don't believe the bad reviews, I suspect most of those were written by people who often think women deserve what they get if they dare get drunk in public.You don't like the message this film is sending? That's not the fault of the film, that's on you."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,10/10,"Ah yes, nothing like watching a bunch of men fear for their lives. Times up boys."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 November 2021,9/10,"So hard to find a word to describe how incredible this movie is . The story about friendships and love and of course guilt . Great directing , script and the cast is phenomenal."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,10/10,"This movie is one of a kind, a masterpiece of both story telling and visuals with a very hard hitting message.
A quick warning; if you're the type of person who uses the phrase ""feminazi"" you may not enjoy this but I hope you'll still watch and try to learn something."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,6/10,"And unfortunately this is one of them. There's three earlier points this movie could have ended and it would have been amazing, but the last half hour or so was just predictable, boring and sad. Such a shame."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"Wow, I absolutely loved this movie. I haven't had such a visceral reaction to a film in such a long time. It's hard to explain what this film is, all I can say is don't miss it. Outstanding performances by everyone involved."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"This was so well acted and written! The story is a dark one that isn't light on the humor to match. Carey Mulligan is sensational and deserves the hardware. It's rare an entertaining movie can chill you to the bone, move you to tears, and make you laugh out loud. The topic is real and chilling so beware the faint of heart."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,8/10,"I loved it, I loved the way it looks at all of the players in assault cases; the victim, perpetrator, bystanders, authority figures, lawyers etc.I gave it an 8 because I wanted so badly for a truly happy ending. But I'll settle for the one we got because it was better than how things go in reality.Also an excellent soundtrack."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,10/10,Absolutely great film with surprising ending ! I can't believe this doesn't have higher score. It has been a while since I enjoyed something like this.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,Eveything I expected and wanted it to be. The best of 2020.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,9/10,"At first I thought the movie was weird but then I understood like, the trama, it is a comedy/drama movie, and it worked bc I laughed and cry at the end( the trama gave me some flashbacks ) anyways, it is a rlly good movie i recommend it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 April 2021,8/10,That death in the end obviously some sort of no country for old men type script. That's a 10/10 for that. So original. But that feeling of not understanding what the eff what was happening in the beginning was irritating. Dont get me wrong here there are films that get you curious about the plot in the start by piecing things up and up. But not this one tho. I mean if the first half was the part that gets you curious to stay in the end. I doubt if it wont have already won best PICTURE.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 January 2021,10/10,Love it she is awesome great movie sally sparrow rocks
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 February 2021,10/10,That movie just blow my mind. Dont you ever miss this wonderful piece. Carey Mulligan deserve an Oscar. What a performance!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 June 2021,5/10,"### Cinematography ###
A lot of the satisfaction I got from this movie was how beautifully the cinematography was. The wide and long shots just blew me away and made me in love with it - makes me now very intrigued to research more about the camera crew.### Editing ###
Same goes to the editor(s). The music, clipping and pacing was executed perfectly which gave the film an extremely nice flow.### Fun-Fact? ###
And I believe some of these factors were inspired by the Joker (2019)? I at least feel like a lot of these instrumental usages had the same somewhat creepy and toxic violin and dark-toned piano vibes...### Dialogue and Directing ###
Then comes the awful dialogue and oh god I found more than enough to say this drags down the whole movie by 3 stars. I understand that the characters are awkward or struggles socially, however the dialogue goes so far it becomes uninteresting and so that I as a viewer couldn't care less if a lot of these scenes were deleted. It destroyed the pacing ---yes, I know I said the pacing was done well but that goes for the cinematography ONLY--- so as I watched the movie I imagined the scene in my own version. However, this was close to impossible due to the lack of creativity within this film. The alternatives were slim as the characters weren't fleshed out enough - and at times they somewhat were, that was after the first half of the movie.### Acting & Characters ###
And about fleshing out the characters...this barely happened throughout the film. You see the protagonist feeling useless, has no dreams and no passion from the first scenes - she doesn't change in the end either, that's a massive problem!! Cause you want your protagonist to use their feelings and inner-self to grasp the attention of your audience. If you still want to make your audience intrigued but want a rather quiet/dull protagonist you should make them a mastermind, very wary of their situation, controllable and manipulative. This is what grasps the audience and makes their enjoyment thrilling.And so the actors...no. I've got to agree they're all good but 80% of the cast just did not fit their role.A few I can name is the protagonist's date, the protagonist's parents and the ""rapists"". None of them seemed to have acted geniuenly, sorry. A lot of the problems could've stemmed from the director's directing ""skills"".### Conclusion ###
It's just so sad how a movie with a message so strong ended up executed so bad, directing-wise. Yup, this is a harsh critic review, but I couldn't leave the 5-star on IMDb without a reasoning."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 November 2021,9/10,"Women's lives is filled with experiences like this followed by the ignorance of the system. So Cassie here, deeply affected by a trauma, decides to teach the ""nice guys"" a lesson.I was amazed by the character of Cassie; Revengeful, smart, funny and distinctive; Disappointed from the system, she rolls her sleeves to serve justice herself.I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending but I guess it was a symbolic ending showing how women never win these wars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"Wonderfully made unique and terrifying thriller that speaks volumes about the current climate.Smartly written, tightly directed, staggering performance from Carey and an ending that will stick with you for days."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 April 2021,8/10,"Shocking, traumatic, and a real mind f&$k. I expect it to leave a lasting impression. What higher compliment can I pay a film than that it made me feel something real?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,10/10,"Incredible film. It was everything you could ask for in an entertaining movie. You'll notice most of the negative reviews are from men and I'll bet these men have put themselves in similar situations as the men in the movies and that's why they're mad. Men, if this movie scares you you should probably rethink the way you treat women."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,5/10,"Boring, one sees nearly everything coming from afar, from start to finish as soon as one understands that it won't be nearly as strong as its cover advertises. Cassie's revenge is a pretty weak one. She has all the reasons to go berserk and what ? She only threatens. Wow. And what's the final point of the movie ? When a woman tries to get revenge she gets killed...? Is that supposed to be a feminist movie ?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,8/10,"Cinematography was excellent, Carey Mulligan was phenomenal throughout,
soundtrack was nicely crafted and the final 30 minutes really picked up the rather slow first hour. I could see this being suited for Netflix instead of a theater film.
--
Considering the fact it cost Cassie her life in order to get revenge, which most likely won't even result in Al getting life behind bars is a slightly disappointing fact.
Despite that, I enjoyed the film and the story was engaging.
All in all with this performance Carey will be nominated for best actress alongside Frances McDormand and Viola Davis.
Hope she gets the oscar! Go Carey!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,10/10,A film that really kept us on the edge of our seat with a very interesting story and very promising actors.Worth to watching and if you like Tarantino this one will bring you to such an atmosphere!Absolutely fabulous and controversial!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 January 2021,9/10,"I actually really liked this film. Wasn't what I expected at all after seeing the trailer and that's great. Definitely made it an unpredictable watch and more realistic.Human nature is sometimes selfish, immoral and plain disgusting. This film is a clear depiction of this.I really enjoyed Carey Mulligan's performance."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 March 2021,3/10,"Tho this movie has a great message for the reality of what men can do and the consequences of their actions, this movie just plain boring. Right from the beginning i wasn't too attached to what was going on most of the time. The characters were really uninteresting and the dialogue was a snoozefest. The only interesting part was the end but thats about it. A forgettable movie, skip this one."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 October 2021,10/10,"This movie was amazing and the way guys act towards women is 100% accurate, speaking from experience. It's not a man hating movie, it's an accurate portrayal of how women are treated in a man's world. This movie is amazing and I hope it gains a lot of popularity for its dark reenactment of real life situations."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 May 2021,7/10,"A slow burner that made me think something was missing, violent murdering of the guys she takes home for example... but I stuck with it through the tough hour or so and boy was I rewarded. I kept guessing at possible twists or directions but boy did I get it wrong. Well worth the watch!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,,Came in with fresh eyes and left speechless. Carey Mulligan gives an all-star performance. This movie is fearless. 9/10
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,10/10,"Amazing movie, amazing cast...
Don't miss this movie..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 October 2021,1/10,"What seemed like it would be a strong woman taking charge and looking at rape culture in a new way turned out to be another movie that punishes strong women by killing them in the end and making jokes about it.I would have felt better if Cassie had actually carved Nina's name into Al's chest instead of him breaking free of his handcuff 🙄 and overpowering her. Seemed like it took him a long time to smother her with a pillow without ever thinking maybe he should stop - because after all he was 'only' a rapist, not a killer 🙄.And as for the 'justice' 🙄 at the end of the movie - we all know when good ole boys get arrested for violence against women they 'go to jail for a long time 🙄'"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 October 2021,10/10,I'm blown completely away by this movie. It's so relevant and just so important. A story of grief and revenge and ultimately justice. Unfortunately the things that happen in this movie happen far too often. It wasn't even the sexual assault for me. It was all the people who idly stood by and acted as if it didn't happen. It wasn't important until it was their family or it effected them. As a woman and especially as a woman who's been sexually assaulted it's just such a powerful movie. It's written so well. Carrie did an amazing job. I was so shocked by the ending but satisfied. I will probably never watch this again as it is quite triggering but I'm glad I've seen it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 May 2021,7/10,Not at all what i expected from the strap lines and publicity. I expected plenty of violence and death but that would just make this a typical revenge movie and this is much better than that. Well worth a watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,9/10,"Fantastic scripting and execution. It is rare these days to see filmmakers set out to tackle a pretty blunt message and actually pull it off, and for that message to hit you in a way that genuinely makes you think about the state of the world and the society we have created. This movie achieves it through bravery and genuine introspection from the team behind it.On top of that it's actually an entertaining watch, thanks to the impeccable casting and visual treatment. It felt like a drama, comedy, horror all wrapped in one and I was here for it.But the ending! Ah man without spoiling it too much I first thought it was going to be a depressing outlook on the state of things, it's a repeating pattern, no one wants to change anything, how could Cassie make any difference. I would have loved it to end there, a massive middle finger to us all that these filmmakers thought about the subject matter and their genuine conclusion was nothing changes. That is the message I'll be leaving with, and I am motivated to do something about that, THINGS NEED TO CHANGE!I still do love the final little twist at the end, that keeps with the overarching tone of the film, would have been pretty bleak leaving us at such a dark outlook after the fantastic playfulness of everything else.Really enjoyed it and I'm holding thumbs for it at the Oscars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"Great cinematography, writing, and acting, all around great job by the cast and crew! Even though there are some nit picks that annoy the observant movie viewer, it's nothing that is story immersion breaking.I really like this film, it was a fresh take in a time when thrillers have for the most part become pretty stagnant."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 January 2021,1/10,Stupid movie. Why tf she have to die?The most overrated movie ever.Big disappointment
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 March 2021,8/10,"If you ever watch Black Mirror and you miss the ""vibes'"" of this series, you must watch this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,9/10,"A great movie, with turns and unexpected surprises. Carrie did a great job. Well written and well directed over all a very fun, sad and enjoyable experience."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,10/10,"This film is not a great production, but it did everything good. A delicate and real topic shown in such a funny but dark way. Really smart, enjoyable and original movie; good looking too. One of the best of 2020."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,9/10,"I will not spoil this movie through my review; I have a pretty uncomplimentary opinion of those who do that. Why would you watch the movie and then ruin someone else's experience??? But I digress...This is a DARK comedy, and a well done one at that. Ms. Mulligan will get a slew of nominations for her role, one she acted the **** out of. Seriously, stop at my review, sit down. clear your mind and prepare for a film (they still make those, by the way) that is clever, thoughtfully written and casted (but OH BOY, it is dark). I just finished viewing and I'm so glad I did!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,8/10,Finally a movie that doesn't follow Hollywood formulas. Good acting by Carrie Mulligan carrying the movie to the end. If only we all had a friend dedicated as Cassie. I enjoyed the movie to the end.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,9/10,So I waited awhile before watching this. I was worried about all the hype. Usually I read the reviews and movie summary before going in. I didn't with this and I'm glad.This movie went where I thought and then all the sudden didn't but in a good way.I highly recommend watching it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,Finally a socially relevant story. Very engaging and interesting at the same time.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,9/10,"My wife and I were calling this the 'All men are terrible' movie until we got to the ending... it's still pretty much that, but the ending was classic and made this movie a classic as well."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,10/10,"I treated myself to this $20 rental on Amazon. I have been wanting to go see it since it came out, but haven't made it out to see it yet.
I loved every minute of this sharply written, perfectly acted film. I clapped all by myself at the end. It was just brilliant! I decided to watch it again immediately after I loved it so much. 😉"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 January 2021,10/10,"Men who are offended by this film are apart of the problem. This is a very clever film and brings light issues that unfortunately many women face. It shows the common viewer that the people who commit these acts are not in fact what we imagine them to be, example given by these ""nice"", well dressed, conventionally attractive and educated individuals shown."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,8/10,"I've seen many ''feminist'' movies out there , and considerate them horrible and annoying. It's totally not the case here. Usually when a movie is directed by a woman , an has a woman protagonist , the only thing they try to do is showcase that the protagonist is stronger than any man , or that she is empowered to do anything. Promising Young Woman bravely escapes this formula with a character that all viewers , regardless of sex will identificate themselves on. As a fighter , and as someone who looks out for justice. It keept me hook'in from the very beginning to it's explosive ending."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 August 2021,6/10,"Good subject, but becomes overly on the nose and establishes no sense of rhythm throughout the entire movie - partly because it's hard to feel much sympathy for a protagonist, who seems to be both tired of life and a full blown psycho. Another film too hyped up for its own good. I'm sorry it does not matter one bit that it was a directorial debut. Case closed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,10/10,"Dynamic performance from Carey Mulligan. She deserves the Oscar!!
The Boyfriends involvement Cliche' was actually perfect considering it was a simple 'Slight of Hand' to throw you off the (then presumed) ending, only to then twist the knife in slow, steady and methodically, just as Cassie does throughout the entire film.The opening sequence sets the tone for the emtife film. Dark, humorous (in a uncomfortable way). Most importantly it takes serious subject matter, turns it on its head, sideways and asymmetrical, allows it to breathe and evolve naturally so to keep you open to it and thinking about it, (as we allshould be)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 April 2021,7/10,"A serious topic. Well handled with grit, style and dark humor. Mulligan is superb. All the performances are.But then just as the film has the chance to really make the realism land.. it swerves hard left into comedy and parody and ends poorly. Lessening the important message of its core. Shame."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,5/10,"So unimpressed with this film. There are amazing films that are worthy of Oscar nominations and this definitely is not one of them. Completely disjointed and mediocre in every way. I think the academy is trying to make up for not nominating Greta Gerwig last year for little women ( which they should have by the way she is a phenomenal director, writer and filmmaker ) I am shocked by the glowing reviews"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,10/10,"This film literally took my expectations, decided they weren't high enough, & still managed to top them. Carey Mulligan absolutely shines in this, & I cannot fault her acting ability one bit. The whole cast is stellar, in fact.With superb direction, it has an unusual twist on the typical female revenge trope, & everything from the lighting, the wardrobe, & the sets, create an atmosphere of tension, that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It takes you on a rollercoaster of emotional turmoil, never revealing more than it needs to, until it needs to.Then just when you think it's over, the final act is just a masterpiece to watch unfold, & you feel the vindication for her.10/10 would watch again & again."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,8/10,"I blind watch this movie knowing mostly nothing of the plot or genre, only watch it because I saw Carey Mulligan is one of the cast. I thought it's a romcom, then I thought it's a drama about someone suffering mental illnes, then it looks like a thriller. It's a combination of all of that with an unexpected ending and fun & happy songs. After it ends and the screen showing the casts name i started bawling so hard out of nowhere fir a few minutes. Surprisingly it's not that kind of movie that can cause me bawl like that, i usually okay with a brutal bloody scenes, messed up plot or something like that. I don't know what and why but it just hits me that kind of way, weirdly."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,8/10,"Great cinematography and framing, standouts would be cassie's breakdown and any scenes involving her parents
lighting is amazing as well
has some absolutely amazingly tense composition in the scenes where cassie is confronting the people that have done her wrong (standout is the restaurant scene)
great misdirection, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time
it definitely wasnt what i expected at all from the trailer (which is a good thing imo)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 June 2021,10/10,Wow. Wow. Wow. No words after watching this film. Watch it. It's very important. Very very important. This movie deserves ALL the Oscars!!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 June 2021,8/10,"While the pacing is not quite as fast as I had hoped for a ""revenge"" film, the ending makes it totally worth it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,8/10,This is one of the greatest and realistic movies I had ever seen. It s mirroring the world we living in and rape is one of the biggest issues right now so it's definitely to the point. I really loved Cassandra and we all (women) should be so powerful as she was! The ending was really shocking I didn't expect it. I think we all should watch that movie for a reminder.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,10/10,"Firstly... Carey is amazing in this movie. Full stop.The movie was unexpected in so many ways and ended in a way I wasn't ready for! It's thought provoking, dark and heartbreaking. I can't describe it, but you must watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 October 2021,7/10,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, highlighting on human flaws and ignorance. I can guarantee most of us have dealt with, or at least heard of a similar situation to the one that's focused on/obsessed over by the protagonist, and it's how alot of the other characters react to the reminiscing of the situation that makes you realise just how disgusting and selfish we as people can be when dealing with something so horrific.Carey Mulligan's acting is absolutely brilliant in conveying how truely disturbed the character is. But, due to the dark humor, it's done in a way that's easily digestible and at times even comes off quite light-hearted, while still keeping it's dark undertones.Overall I absolutely love this movie and can't recommend it enough, especially if you're in the mood for something that will longer in your head for days to come."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 April 2021,9/10,"Pros: Great performances from the leads, good balance between serious social commentary and dark comedy, memorable soundtrack, satisfying twist ending.Cons: None.Conclusion: Revenge thrillers may seem like a dime a dozen, but ""Promising Young Woman"" proves how promising the genre can still be (pun intended)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 April 2021,9/10,"Promising Young Woman was perhaps the biggest surprise for me to see on the Best Picture nominee list. This is not because I thought the film looked bad, but rather because it looked far less subtle or ""artsy"" as many of the other films on that list. It's uncommon for a black comedy thriller such as this to make it onto the Oscars' most prestigious list, but after watching it I'm very happy that it did.Promising Young Woman stars Carey Mulligan as Cassie, a college dropout who seeks to avenge her friend, Nina, who was raped during their time in school together, and who presumably took her own life after the incident. Cassie seeks her vengeance by preying on sleezy men at bars and clubs, appealing to their darker sides by feigning drunkenness and tricking them into trying to take advantage of her. Once they attempt to, she surprises them by revealing her sober nature and effectively traumatizes them (to be honest, it's never made perfectly clear what she does to the men, so ""traumatizes"" is the best word I can use to describe it). She also seeks revenge on the individuals involved in Nina's rape, teaching them (and the audience) valuable and gut-wrenching lessons about the modern world in the process. Carey Mulligan's performance as the protagonist rightly earned her a spot on the Best Actress nomination list - she is absolutely riveting in the lead role, convincingly conveying her character's trauma, rage, and grief that lead her to do what she does. It's also clear early on that - due to her past - she experiences some level of mental instability, and this quality comes off brilliantly in the performance. In spite of all this, she comes off as relatable and down-to-earth, making her someone that's easy to root for. This partially hinges on her arc in the film that sees her learning to love someone again: an old classmate portrayed very well by Bo Burnham.It's hard to get into the nuances and details of Promising Young Woman without giving away some key plot points, so I'm going to choose to focus on the general qualities of the film rather than engage in spoilers - I'm assuming most people who see this haven't watched the film, and your enjoyment of it hinges heavily on the shocking climax. Outside of Mulligan's excellent leading performance, Promising Young Woman's greatest strength is its strikingly familiar story. Sexual assault on women in college is something that has become far too common in today's world, and the film takes this familiarity and skillfully uses it to drive our investment in Cassie's journey. All of her actions, though sometimes morally questionable, manage to come off as feeling righteous or deserved. The sporadic, unpredictable nature of those actions constantly kept me on the edge of my seat, as I was eager to see what she would do next and how far she would go to achieve her ultimate goals. The result is a genuinely thrilling experience.Thematically, Promising Young Woman is a strikingly relevant film. It's not surprising that a story about a woman seeking vengeance for her sexually assaulted friend would include some hard-hitting commentary on society. The film takes a close look at the different roles contributing to the incident central to Cassie's motivations: rather than focusing just on the perpetrators (the men), it scrutinizes everyone involved. Authority figures who could have brought justice to the assailants, lawyers who failed to act morally in the aftermath, and even bystanders who watched but said nothing are all carefully examined in the film. It paints a sad but honest picture: that those who are guilty of a crime aren't necessarily the ones who committed it. This is where Promising Young Woman excels: in its pertinent societal analysis. For the most part, that analysis never comes off as ""preachy.""
The only times it does is when the film borders on flat-out proclaiming that ""ALL MEN ARE EVIL"" (which is helped by the obvious lack of redeemable male characters). Of course, being a male, I'm inclined to disagree with that - though it's not too far from the truth.The last thing I'll point out before concluding is that the finale of Promising Young Woman, which I won't describe in detail, is likely to frustrate and divide many viewers. While the film is clearly trying to make a point in the direction it goes, it makes the remainder of the film feel less satisfactory and less rewarding. I won't dock the film too many points for not ending in a way I would have enjoyed more, but the decision to do so certainly impacted my impression a little bit.Promising Young Woman is an excellent thriller: one that I am pleased made it onto the Best Picture nominee list for the upcoming Oscars. It is supremely engaging, driven by an excellent lead performance from Carey Mulligan, and filled with impactful commentary on society. While its ending is likely to turn off some viewers, I'd still recommend giving the film a watch before the Academy Awards are held at the end of the month. I'm giving Promising Young Woman 9 out of 10 stars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,7/10,"This is a brilliant weird movie about how Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be. She's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life by night. Now, an unexpected encounter is about to give Cassie a chance to right the wrongs from the past I would definitely recommend."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 May 2021,10/10,"A movie that points out the idiocy of the 'boys will be boys' mentality being used to excuse inexcusable behaviour. Explores how men take advantage of women, the notion of 'nice guys', and how 'bro's' often won't correct the predatory or misogynistic behaviours of their friends at the expense of women's safety. Just as you think the protagonist has found a man who defies this and is genuinely nice, respecting her wishes to not rush into sex, and they fall in love, you then are shattered with the reality that he too was complacent in the assault of her friend several years prior. He defends himself with the belief that 'he was just a kid' and that he was only a bystander, but in spite of this continues the pattern of male complacency by obstructing justice when refusing to tell truths that could've helped the investigation of the protagonists disappearance/murder (by the same man who assaulted her friend). Despite the fate of Cassie, she doesn't go down quietly. Just as you think the men have gotten away with it once again, she kicks back with a scheduled arrangement that reveals all and achieves justice for both Nina and herself after she dies. There is definitely something to be said about the fact that she clearly anticipated the danger she would face walking into a house full of men and thus made arrangements accordingly. A powerful point of the film is when the assaulter (and then murderer) tells her how accusations of assault is men's greatest nightmare and she responds with something a long the lines of 'well guess what a woman's is?'. Women can never be too careful in a world where they're targeted by men who see them merely as objects of their desire.Cassie is a powerful and unapologetic lead who makes her impact within her community. Unfortunately she is still only a small fish in a big lake, and the crimes committed against her and Nina won't stop in our world until Men learn decency. Much needed in the social climate of our society, I hope all those who don't understand the severity of these issues can watch this and learn from the perspective of a woman how it is to be subject to these sorts of misogynistic attacks and going forward can be more mindful about how they interact with those around them in a respectful way, as well as holding each other accountable for inappropriate actions.One of the best attributes of this film is its tastefulness in approaching such horrible topics, when a video surfaces of the assault of her friend it is not shown, and there's no scenes that jarringly depict intense sexual violence like some films do."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 October 2021,3/10,The concept was definitely there but the execution wasn't.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,10/10,"Very thought provoking, and loved the use of 'nice' actors as baddies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 December 2020,10/10,"It's excellent, unique, necessary, and at times it's a very tough watch.
But I recommend it as highly as I can.
Perfect cast. Please let Carrie Mulligan win the Oscar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 September 2021,6/10,"The cinematography is beautiful and colourful, and the soundtrack is great.Other than that, I feel this movie was a miss not only because the plot is all over the place to the point where you never quite understand the protagonist's goals. Also, although it is presented as a « revenge thriller », the « thriller » part was not there at all, and I am really not sure the « revenge » part was even slightly satisfying.Looking back, it feels like I just watched a young woman lecturing a bunch of people without real impact, and I am ever so disappointed that it didn't take a gore turn towards « justice ». Nina deserved it. Sexual agression victims might find the whole process triggering and disturbing. Not even close to being a cathartic experience."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 February 2021,7/10,"The movie felt well balanced until 5 minutes before the end. She had some revenge, saw some people were regretful, and others didn't care. In the end she overplayed her hand, and it shows one can be still be right, but tragically fail. I guess that the ending of the movie portrays that there are only losers in this kind of affairs. I'm personally not offended by the sexist portrayal of men in this movie, it's just a movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,10/10,"This movie answers all the deep questions we ask as we watch people walk home after a happy night out. I will point out though, women are the most to this horrible act to happen, it also happens to men. Carey deserves an Oscar ten times if the Hollywood Usual dont jump on Nomadland"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 July 2021,9/10,"Beautifully written, acted, and shot. Sparkling dialog. Creative genre-stretching. Powerfully thought-provoking. Grapples with a deep wound in modern society so deftly, with humor even. Amazing. Every man should see this. (He said, with sadness and hope in his heart.)Here's to you, brett kavanagh."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 February 2021,2/10,"I hadn't seen the trailer so I had no prior expectations but I had a strong feeling that I would like the movie judging by the opening scene. I was wrong.This movie is problematic on so many levels: plot holes, lazy make-believes, morals and the message it conveys. However I'll only talk about the ending.The main character being suffocated for about a minute on screen and then her body being burnt by the same man who raped her best friend ONLY to prove to the police that he's a killer is not only bad logic but is morally flawed. There's no proof that he will get the punishment he deserves for the rape which should've been her main goal.Cassandra was clearly depressed throughout the movie and neither her parents nor her friend at the coffeeshop(who I think had great potential to be an ally to Cassandra in her struggle in life and was there just cast as a token) realized that. She needed help and support in a men's world where no one understood her. The justice system failed her; her family, her colleagues, the university, men...This is the reality for so many women around the world. And that's fine to have that in the movie too. But what I can't understand is the message.The metoo movement tipped the iceberg through the collaboration of women. It wasn't the justice system nor a lonely deranged woman raiding bachelor parties. It was a collective awakening.This movie fails on so many levels for me but most importantly it fails to acknowledge the importance of collectivity over individuality.I've read that the director's cut wouldn't have had the arrest scene. It would've conveyed a much stronger message for me because Cassandra trusting the justice system that failed Nina is just naive; whereas showing the audience the injustice women face and how men will get away with anything would deliver a much stronger message."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,7/10,A lot of influence from Joker and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but still a very good movie.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 August 2021,9/10,Very well done. Not your typical Hollywood film. Amazing.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 November 2021,,I was with this movie up until that ending. I just kept thinking it would be a dream sequence or some other awful cop out but I gotta give the movie some credit that they actually went with THAT outcome for the protagonists. It's sadly prophetic/poetic but I kind of just felt like a watched someone kick a wounded animal while they were already down. It felt mean spirited and hopeless when it was marketed as something subversively cathartic/empowering. I guess thats the whole point of why rape revenge itself as a construct is false.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,6/10,"I hate this beautiful movie. It perfectly shows how men get away with this, but why sacrifice the women for any justice to be served?? Profoundly upsetting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 October 2021,10/10,"What an amazing script, acting, directing. I cannot say enough. It's edgy. Heartwarming. Funny. Poignant. Best picture material and definitely a thumbs up to mulligan and the actor who plays her boyfriend. But every actor was spot on. A must see."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,8/10,"After seeing the rating here I was definitely expecting an above average movie and it actually didn't disappoint. Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.Lets just say Carry Mulligan pretty much carried this movie all the way til the end.In fact, after she died she was still commanding the movie with the text messages.I've read a lot of reviews here (and there a lot of them) criticising the movie about the lack of character depth and I feel like a lot of people tried to take this movie for what it wasn't.For me at least, it was never about the their background itself as it was mostly about the subject matter and the dialogue that made this a thrilling watch.Some of the dialogues were extremely uncomfortable but yet it served the movie's purpose - which was to expose a bit how cruelly people can just cover up serious accusations and wrong doings and of course how easily men can take advantage of vulnerable women. But in a thrilling-revenge type of way.It kind of reminded me of the movie Ready or Not that had also this really dark tone but somehow enjoyable to watch.And the way how the character's interactions with each other weren't very complex either made it even more eerier cause it can all look normal on the surface until they show their true selves. Like how Cassandra invited Alison to the restaurant and got her drunk. Or how she made Ryan show how much he values his job over people.In real life, this whole manipulation sounds very messed up but somehow it worked in this movie. And I loved that nuance how Cassandra always just let the other person do the talking and kind of expose themselves.Now the ending itself wasn't perfect. But it's a hard task to wrap a movie with such a dark subject and it was certainly an interesting decision to kill the main protagonist, given how wrong of a direction her life was going. Maybe you would've hoped some sort of silver lining for her.So overall, I really think a lot of the reviewers here took this movie too seriously or expected way too much of it when it was only meant to be a thriller-revenge movie with a couple cliché moments (the pharmacy scene) and twists but with a dark undertone. And it achieved that."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,"This movie was fantastic, and I have seen a LOT of movies. Smart, funny, poignant, intense, twists galore! I wish I hadn't seen it so I could watch it again for the first time. Carrie Mulligan is on fire, what a performance! Definitely watching this one again tomorrow!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 March 2021,8/10,"A very stylish, jaw dropping comedy/horror movie. I'm excited to see what this director does next."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 June 2021,6/10,"There are some well-inspired shots, everyone was made to play the role they were given, the environments allowed the audience to breathe and relate, and making a revenge movie into a romcom was pretty fresh on the genre. Why I rated it lower than the 8 I wanted it to be (spoiler) is the outrageous, sudden change of Bo's character after the discovery of the tape. It wasn't like he had a small freak out about something he'd long thought about and regretted, learning from it like a kind and intelligent person such as his character would in real life, he just became another bad guy to blackmail. The character assassination left a bad taste in my mouth. Her self-destruction would have felt a lot more sad and less cartoony as well without the text to the mustache-twirling, scared villain he'd become. It felt like they wanted an ending that made us feel like even in death she'd finally taken all the power back, but they had no idea how to do it without this character assassination. It was lazy.Fantastic otherwise. Will watch again and imagine my own ending."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 November 2021,3/10,"Had an ambitious and interesting idea with bad exectuon. Ended up beind just plain dull, monotonic, superficial, one-dimensioned, shallow, uninspiring, and overall poorly written with unlikable characters with predictable arcs. Lacked emotion, lacked depth, lacked power and lacked charisma. Had really nice aesthetics and soundtrack, though. All in all, totally forgottable movie, unfortunately. I dont get all the hype, really."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 December 2020,10/10,"Be warned it's hard to define this film. Lessons will be learned. It's dark, funny, heart warming, sad, and tragic. You will find yourself wondering if it's ok to laugh. Even though I figured a couple of things out throughout the playing of movie, the ending was a huge twist. Not everyone will like it, but it will make you think! Great cast, great acting."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 July 2021,10/10,"Takes the genre to the next level. Solidarity with fearless confidence to teach everyone a lesson. A very important lesson but her methods are risky. At first she appears to be unhinged but she is fully in control right until the nail biting end. Watch it now with your friends and family. We all need. To act on the message of this movie, this movie deserves a place in our collective in our psyche."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 March 2021,10/10,"I was blown away by this movie that could easily be resumed to a « anti-men » story and message depicted on screens but it's far from being this and goes way deeper then I expected.It is so important in my opinion that everyone shoud see this one because it is adressing a message to a very very actual subject and debate in 2021 since the uprise of the « me too » movement.Go see it, it is wonderful to know too that this film is the first one from Emerald Fennell and ... wow ... just wow"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 February 2021,8/10,I loved the movie until the last part. It was hitting so many important points in such a good way. Why did the same person who wrote that part think the best ending would be to have this woman suffer even more for men. We didn't need another martyr. (p.s. anyone who says this movie is unbelievable is probably a man)
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 May 2021,8/10,"Great movie and i hate chick flicks
must watch strong story smoothly unfolded mystery great performance."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,8/10,"I cried a lot, sadly many of us (women) have gone through this kind of experience. This movie it's everything that is good in this world."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 January 2021,10/10,"I can't say I've seen a more honest acknowledgment of what it's really like being a woman in modern society. In turns both sadistic and masochistic without being lewd. I loved this movie and at the same time hated it. It made me laugh while at the same time triggering in me the sick feeling in my gut that comes with anything that shows the truest nature of humanity's worst parts. I would recommend this movie to everyone because I feel there is a lesson here. Definitely watch this film, it's the darkest story I've seen in a good long while. It is nihilistic while maintaining such honesty that it can't be faulted for it! ;-)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,1/10,"This movie was long and boring, gave me a headache."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,10/10,"Great visual and audio execution, sharp and cunning dialogue, perfect pacing.Pretty confronting, and not comfortable to watch though.Anything else I say would probably spoil something, so I won't."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 November 2021,10/10,"This movie definitely brings you through a range of emotions. However, it is an important topic and is very truthful for what unfortunately a lot of women through. A must see and good acting!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,9/10,"The plot is so novel it is hard, if not impossible, to anticipate events. Carrie Mulligan is fantastic. Both movie and her are Oscar material."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 March 2021,9/10,"Its a great movie with a really great ending. and the story telling is unique, especially about a girl who doesn't talk about whats inside her. after this movie you should know that lingering on things would most likely lead you to a disaster."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,7/10,"Five minutes in I thought is this a joke. The opening credits in the pink bubble font threw me a bit. As a woman it's a tough subject to watch being portrayed but it's important to be shown. However I just felt the movie was a bit tacky. It's nowhere near Oscar worthy in my eyes. Carey is a phenomenal actress but she doesn't cut the best actress category for me based on this performance. One minute I felt like I was watching a DC comic, then a love movie, then a revenge movie. Disappointed sadly. The trailer is deceiving"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"I loved Carey's acting!!! Loved the movie, great thriller overall."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,10/10,This is a solid 10/10 film! Carey mulligans performance is outstanding.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,This is such a great film and I love the premise. Carry Mulligan delivers an excellent performance.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 October 2021,8/10,"I have 3 little ones. Two boys and a girl. On one hand, I'd never want my sons to be accused of or punished for something they DIDN'T do, on the other hand I'd never want anything to happen to my daughter & then especially no one believe her. I myself went through my own ""event"" at a Halloween party almost ten years ago when I was a young 20 year old girl. I think what hurts more than the actual night, and the person who did it, it's all the family and close friends who didn't believe me, ignored me, or even blamed me. After a while you just stop talking about it. You shut it away. & Then this brilliant movie comes into your life. This movie sends two clear messages: It doesn't matter what you were wearing, how much you had to drink, your past relationships, if you made the first move... If you weren't cognitive enough to make a consensual choice, or you said no, or you fought it, seriously it WAS NOT your fault. And the other clear message, she gave each guy in the movie a chance to do the right thing and they chose not to. They actively chose to make the wrong choice. So, they were completely at fault and deserved their day of reckoning. I only wish I had a friend even half the character Cassie is in this movie. My best friend since we were children said it was my fault because I was dressed too sexy (I was dressed in a 1920's flapper costume from Walmart & had a hoodie on top of it). We haven't spoken in years because of that. Today, her words still haunt me more than that night and make me sick to my stomach. You're loved ones should have your back more than anyone. So the message of true devotion in friendship and sisterhood here was especially lovely. This isn't something that happens exclusively to only a certain type of woman, this happens to all women. & Movies like this will be how we put an end to it for our future, our children & loved ones."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,7/10,It's about being traumatized and how a human deals with it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 June 2021,7/10,I was totally engaged throughout. Carey Mulligan is incredible in this one. Really contemporary thought provoking subject!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 March 2021,6/10,"This movie has that fresh feeling to it, but it is all just an illusion. All you need to know about this movie is in the end credits. The music. Have not checked out the director nor writer yet, but my guess is that they are in their mid 20s or perhaps some one older trying too hard to be relevant and shocking.But i was entertained! Almost gave it a seven, but I can not give this nice try of a revenge movie more than six."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,8/10,"The idea that Carey Mulligan thinks she was being disrespected by a reviewer because of her looks seems preposterous. How anyone could look more fetching as she did in the film seems beyond crazy. Some of her outfits and optics of course were deliberately absurd, that was all purposeful. I have been a huge Carey fan since ""An Education"" finding her most amazing as Jean in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Her ability to speak in American sharpness is a towering thing, given that she seems to be from heavily Queens English Westminster. I did take exception with the zeal that her character (she?) took with humiliating and hurting other people indiscriminately. Liked the NYT comment about self-loathing. I kept wondering through the film, isn't there any healthy help that could be provided for this character to resolve her past. And at least, perhaps Cassie could have tried to engage in a variety of satisfying vocations: regional theater, local museums, weekly meditation groups, discovering new authors. All things we try when we are blocked."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 June 2021,7/10,"I want to give it a low score for the second part of the movie but a high score for the overall quality. I was speechless and disturbed during the second part of the movie. This is a unique film, one that makes you feel bad."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,8/10,"What a shocking, great tale of vengeance this movie was.
And theres have been so many. I can remember now Isabelle Adjani in the eighties, Raquel Welch in that western in the sixties, and many,many more.
I have to admit, at the beginning I thought this was another intent of telling the
story of a young woman trying to get revenge for her friend. Badly told.
It looked like a 90s movie, full of clichés, at the beginning.
But no. Halfway through the movie I had to admit Carey Mullingan's acting got my total admiration.
The black humour and the movie soundtrack just made it better still.
In the 80s or 90's, this story in real life would have been buried safely in the past of the offenders.
But now, at the light of the events of the meetoo movement and women's rights, it has a new,
bright light. Not everything can be buried easily these days.
Not even Cassie's body.
From the creators of Killing Eve, a great tale of revenge. Another one.
For this generation, this time. :)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,7/10,"1) Would you deliberately leave your wallet on view in an unlocked car just to catch would-be thieves? No? So why would Cassie pretend to be hammered just to teach men a lesson about taking advantage of drunk women? It put her in danger and she was literally looking for trouble. Also this part of the film had nothing to do with the main plot so could've been omitted and saved for a separate film cos it had interesting potential for a premise all of its own but I figure it was part of the film's feminist agenda.2) I didn't like the way Ryan was presented as a simp - he was desperate, wilky and had no self-respect. I feel this was the director's way of poking fun of or satirizing good guys; the message was men are either misogynist A-holes like Al/Joe, the workmen and the pick-up driver OR hopeless weak saps like Ryan. Either way they're all pathetic. Dad's don't count of course cos they're related to you.3) I didn't buy that Ryan just forgave Cassie WITHOUT explanation when he saw her at the bar about to go home with Paul. Sure, Ryan was a love-struck gullible lost-puppy but even so wouldn't we ALL want an explanation if it was us? It really made her so unlikable too that she was STILL playing the drunk game and about to go home with Paul when Ryan had been good to her at that point.4) I didn't buy that Madison would NOT ask Cassie to explain how SHE knew about the guy at the hotel and that he took Madison to his room to just lay down and not touch her. I also don't believe even a drunk woman would go up to a stranger's room during the day after what must have been a brief encounter. She wasn't even single and could easily have called her husband to pick her up.5) I didn't buy that Joe and Al would decide to burn Cassie's body. They're smart guys and must have anticipated Cassie might have told SOMEONE where she was going. They didn't even think to hide her car, even Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" did that. She had knives so Al could easily have pleaded self-defense, the police still wouldn't have known about the tape at that point, only Cassie did and she was DEAD.6) The fact Cassie was about to cut Nina's name into Al's chest (and drugged his friends) was the final nail in the coffin that made me stop rooting for her. She'd gone too far at this point. She could have just sent the tape off to the police and everyone Al knew, she already threatened Ryan she'd do the same. If she just did that she'd still be alive and could have visited Al in prison to confront him."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,9/10,"Ask a man"" What are you most afraid of?"" Most likely he'll say: "" To be disgraced in public"". Ask a woman and she'll probably say "" To get hurt"". And there you are!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,10/10,"I cried so hard at the conclusion of this movie. **SPOILERS** The lengths she had to go to to get justice for her friend were astronomical and the sad thing is that if your not someone famous, if you don't have a platform, justice for sexual assault victims is sometimes unattainable. Hell, sometimes even then. The acting was very believable, never once was I distracted by incompetent actors from the very real and sorrowful plot. She loved her friend so much that she made her her life, literally it took her life for people to listen, for her friends attackers to face justice. It's an emotional movie and sadly it happens a lot, on college campuses, at parties, at bars...and men are excused and coddled because as the dean in the movie said...as many deans have said...we mustn't ruin a young man's life due to baseless accusations. I mean she was drunk right? Did you see the tox report? What was she wearing? There is never an excuse for sexual assault or assault at all, which is one of the main points of this movie. I really enjoyed it, I think you will too. I think it was very intelligent and poignant, having a lot to say without ever losing its emotional core. If you are an SA survivor Trigger warning!!!!! There are lots of possible triggers throughout. Its really difficult and heavy subject matter, but its not exploitative like some media about SA. Very brilliantly done, it definitely brings you and your emotions for a ride."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 July 2021,1/10,Bad acting with disastrous storyline in an extremely boring movie. Each nanosecond spent on watching it is a total waste of time.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 August 2021,9/10,Loved it very much. So different and about a topic that is not represented enough in movies.Great acting - astonishing costumes.Nice plot-twists.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 August 2021,8/10,1 out of 5 drunk women are not really drunk and are carrying a pair of scissors!Stellar performance by Carey Mulligan!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 January 2021,10/10,"If laughter through tears is an emotion you enjoy feeling while watching a film, wait till you experience laughter through fury. Not shying away from the infuriating injustice and horrific encounters described in great detail, the film was able to portray a dark humor throughout. Their use of comedy, rather than lessening the heinous subject matter, actually serves to emphasis it. It was an unpredictable, eye-opening, disturbing, and hilarious film. A train wreck in slow motion that I'll think back on for a long time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,5/10,"When the directory tries to copy Tarantino, but lacks the talent, this kind of a movie is the result. Over all extremly disappointing to see the terrible way in which all men are portrayed.Acting is good, but story line and character motivations is unrealistic. Could be nothing more than a bigger budget movie in the I spit on your grave series""."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,2/10,"A head scratcher on every level. It is 'wish-fulfillment' cinema that does nothing to elevate the very serious subject matter it purports to be about. Almost nothing in this movie is believable. It seems to be taking place in an alternate universe: The bar scenes, the coffee house, her parent's home - they all looked like movie sets - And no single person acts like a real person would ever act under those circumstances - Just because this woman suddenly reveals herself to be not drunk would in NO WAY remove her from the very real danger she had put herself in - and we're supposed to believe that with the hundreds of names on that list in her little black book, not a single man got angry in that moment and overpowered her and had his way with her regardless of her sobriety? The behavior of every single character is only designed to further the plot. A that plot makes absolutely no sense. I have to assume it as intended as 'fantasy' but for that to work the movie would need a more interesting production design and a steadier hand from the director. And don't get me started on poor Jennifer Coolidge. Why put her in a movie and then tamp down all her charms and make her into a joyless nonentity? Being a blank is not an acting challenge - It is a straw man movie (straw woman?) - It is speciousness personified. Not horrible, but really, really stupid and only annoying in that it's being touted as best movie of the year."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,10/10,For all women. And especially for all men.Please watch. And think.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 November 2021,8/10,"I literally had no idea where the plot was going on at the start of the movie but I was pleasantly surprised. The colour scheme of the movie, the writing, solid cast, the little plot twists. I loved it. Carey Mulligan is such an underrated actress. Side note on Bo Burnham, never heard of him before but really, really enjoyed watching him in this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 August 2021,9/10,"This film is full of very nice lines and moments and insights. It is pretty sound, with the crux for me being her confrontation with the female dean who defends the rapists with a standard 'boys will be boys' type patter, and the classic ""You don't want that one incident to ruin a young man's life forever'.There was one thing that I found a bit off, however. In both the film and the commentary there were slight references to the idea that we all are a mixture of good and bad deeds in our past. However, I thought that this was a bit off. We indeed have checkered pasts, but I don't think this is so much true of rape. I mean, there is definitely a line that we know exists, and I think almost all of us know not to cross that line. I mean, it is like saying we all have a mixed past, with a few youthful bank robberies behind us when we were just kids and too young to know any better. And I think this is one of the points the film is making - that regardless, we all know that line exists, and most of us know not to cross it. And when we do, we know what we are doing. Regardless of youth and high spirits, and whether or not we are going to university."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,"This movie... I went through so many emotions watching this. Cried many times, and really appreciated the contrast between the aesthetic and the theme. The ending... wow...
If you think you will not get triggered by this movie I highly recommend watching. They play on what you would expect from a female revenge movie and really humanize the main character while she showing that she is like us and not some indestructible god like vigilante. Just watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,9/10,"To be honest, as a male in his early twenties, found this film to be incredibly powerful and honest. Some of the dialogue by the male characters in this film is quite disgusting, making it all the more horrible that I could see a lot of people my age making comments a lot like the male characters in this film. The film follows Cassie, a young woman who was considered by many to be making her way to a very successful career. However, a traumatic event during college causes Cassie to drop out. Now, Cassie spends her nights travelling to bars around town and pretending to be very drunk. Every time she does this, a presumably 'nice guy' offers to take her home. This film is incredibly relevant to people my age group. I feel like the screenplay was disturbing in how real it seemed. As a member of the audience, I feel like I could have known any of the characters in this film. Carey Mulligan delivers a masterclass performance as Cassie and will be met with a lot of attention this awards season. This is the best film that I have seen all year."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,9/10,".... I don't know what would need to happen for me to give it 10 stars, but regardless, this film was sublime. Maybe it lacked one star because this is a topic altogether? In any case, I went through every range of emotion watching this film, and I'm not mad about it. The theme, the music, the acting, it's place in pop culture, the wardrobe (sans the nurse fit), was very cunning and witty. Everything just fit. It was relevant. And that's disgusting. And superb."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,7/10,You will have weird mixed feelings after watching it
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,10/10,"This is one of the best, most real movies I have ever watched.
The coward, the manipulator the repentant, and the Warrior written and directed true to life in Emerald Fennell's Docudrama."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,10/10,"This movie blew me away, it's so good, you don't want to miss this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 May 2021,10/10,"I watched this movie a week ago and it is still in my head. It's painful, difficult to watch, yet quite entertaining. The writing, acting, and directing are superb. Carey Mulligan is brilliant as Cassie, and the rest of the casting choices are surprising and perfect.People have suggested different genres for this film. I see it as your basic Greek tragedy. No one comes out looking good. And yet, even after they do horrible things, I could still relate to most of them, and wish that things could be different. The biggest condemnation is for our culture, that fosters so much trauma.If you're looking for a simple revenge thriller, go somewhere else. If you like movies that delve into all the complexity of real life, and you're willing to accept the discomfort that goes with it, this is for you."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,9/10,"I love it, whatever the other negative reviewer are saying. its witty, clever, some may say it was just a feminist movie. But its actually a really good movie on its own, enjoyable and the last bit made me reach to my seat, a must watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,9/10,"Clever and refreshingly different , Superb cast , Carey Mullinghan nailed it .Never so the ending coming !"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 August 2021,1/10,This film is not what some people think it is. Believe me. I thought it was awful and a massive disappointment. Not a horror. Not a thriller. Not a revenge movie. Not a comedy. Hammy acting. Ridiculous story. Terrible ending. What more could you want!?However - each to their own and if you did enjoy it then that's great. It's one of the beautiful things about art. You get to choose whether you like something or not.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 January 2021,10/10,"I was not expecting this movie to be as well-thought-out and brilliant as it was.It was a movie about violence against women and it had something powerful to say, but it was calculating in how it came across. Every element-from the directing, to the writing, to the cinematography, to the acting, to the music-was a conscious choice. No angry male-bashing. No bitter ending. Just a clear message about holding ourselves and each other accountable-men and women together.I could go on about every clever aspect. The critique of the male gaze, the specialization of women, and the horror genre itself was beyond brilliant. The question of hero vs villain throughout the movie made you constantly question your own assumptions. And for a movie about violence, it was careful not to be gratuitous so as to numb us to it, but instead made us hyper aware of it.Everyone should see this movie. It is a movie for our time.My one critique would be that while it was definitely a feminist movie, it was not necessarily a womanist movie. It was very much from the perspective of the white upper-middle class. Laverne Cox comes in as a representation of black women and transgender women, which is critical since violence against both are frequently ignored, but her character does not have much of an arc. It makes the movie's message feel like it has a gaping hole, since violence is a problem for all women."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,9/10,"It took me until the middle of the movie to figure out a model for what this movie really was - it was Superman 2 (or Spider-Man 2, depending on your preference). Protagonist acting on a responsibility, defined by tragedy in her past, has the opportunity to put the responsibility aside in favor of a more comfortable, more ""normal"" life. All that she has given up to honor Nina's legacy could be returned to her. This, of course, cannot last and in the end acts only as temptation against what Cassie knows she must do. This is a hero story (or anti-hero more specifically) as old as time itself.And, coming from a guy's perspective who got to watch this movie sitting next to his wife and experience her anger and disgust, the villains in this hero story are real. Men - boys - are all-too-often exactly like these as***les. We'll make excuses, we'll tell you what a nice guy we really are, but in the end, this movie shows you what our worst fear really is: exposure. Men can complain about ""liberal feminist hollywood"" all they want and as long as they continue not confronting themselves, they and their leaders will continue to be exposed as the frauds they are. We need Cassie the hero, and we need more movies like this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 March 2021,7/10,"The premise of a serial killer woman who hunts guys that takes advantage of her is so brilliant. I wanted to really love this film. As a woman myself, I have my own fears of someone trying to drug me in a club. But my issue is it takes a while to get going. It tends to be slow and focuses more on the relationship with her and some former guy that she is interested in. Everything comes full circle at the end which is brilliantly done, but you have to force yourself to get there in order to see it. The performances are great. Carey Mulligan does an excellent job as always. This is a perfect film for DVD if you have nothing better to do."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 May 2021,10/10,"A film that tells the story of the world.Super shocking
I can not say anything. This film itself depicts the facts and all the words.We have to think about our beliefs and behavior."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,8/10,An unforgettable movie. Carey Mulligan is amazing.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 April 2021,,"Definitely the sort of film that leaves you thinking about it after the credits role. To me it was powerful, it had my thinking about every woman and girl who has been in a situation like this, I think the dark humour is a nice touch, it's not too serious but it is at the same time. I am very happy I've watched this and will probably watch again."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 May 2021,10/10,"Beautiful film.. its an absolute work of art, visually, incredibly well acted and a great story too.. highly recommended.."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,10/10,"I can't wait to watch this movie again and again. So smart, fun and dark. Love a good revenge movie, but this movie takes it to the next level. The writer-director thought about every little thing and I enjoyed all the details as much as I enjoyd the movie. The art direction, the music and all the subtle details were brilliant. I assure you the director thought of everything and all of it only adds to the movies genius. Carey Mulligan's performance blew me away. It was a difficult topic told with so much humor, heart and heartbreak. I hope this movie gets nominated for Best Director, but I somehow feel that it will go over some of the older male dominated heads. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,9/10,"The writing and acting are top notch, and there's a wonderfully romantic meet cute that makes the film seem like it is heading in an obvious direction.It isn't.I can understand why people might find the film frustrating. I did initially when it ceased to conform to my preconceived expectations of a narrative arc. However With a little bit of reflection and digestion, I came to the conclusion that this movie makes a much more profound statement by failing to offer easy answers."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,6/10,"I was on board at the start, the movie reminding us with style how men are pigs and introducing an interesting main character, but the story lost its focus after.
Like if the pain and the anger submerged the script.
A good movie but I would have liked more."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,8/10,"I felt like there were some stuff we should had known earlier in the film but it was a good, entertaining movie and the lead actress was perfect and also the end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,8/10,What an incredible movie... great lead character... well acted and kept me gripped to the end... and what an ending. A must watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 January 2021,8/10,"Let me get the great out of the way. The premise is great. The look, feel, and tone of the movie is great. Mulligan is unreal. The supporting cast is perfectly selected. The subjective moral compasses of many of the more despicable characters involved is expertly communicated.But why did this movie rush through its final chapter? For a movie that reveled in its ability to really setup how agonizing Cassie's life had been for so many years, it moved far too quickly through its climactic events.And lastly, a big piece of me thought they were going to follow through with the ultra dark, really despicable ending, but it feels like they played it too safe with the ""plan fulfillment.""All that aside, really great, and Mulligan proves yet again that she's simply on another level like she's been pretty much her entire career."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,7/10,"This reminded me of the old film The Girl Most Likely To with Stockard Channing where SC gets bullied at school and comes back to take her revenge - great film. PYW is also a really good film though if I have a problem (or two) with it, it's that the entire cast was too old. It's one thing to want to avenge a friend at 18 or 24 - but if you haven't gotten over it by 34 (or 30 in the film) you look too much like a loon. If the cast had been younger (max 25) I think it would have been more poignant as it would have been about a young girl's confusion as she tried to navigate the road to womanhood, only to be held back by a single, terrible event (or two) that she simply could not get past. The other problem is that it paints ALL men as predators when it's more nuanced than this and that discussion still needs to be had. Still, a revenge movie that ticks all the right boxes and Carey Mulligan is great as always."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,9/10,"Yeah its not all thrill. but the soft part the movie, its set up for the ending. which is good ending"

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 December 2020,9/10,"#Review for #PromisingYoungWoman
🍬
🍬
#CareyMulligan plays Cassandra, A woman seeking revenge for an incident that happened to her friend in high school. Mulligan's performance is absolutely memorising and sets a dark tone for the movie, considering its vibrant candy-like palette. #BoBurnham's performance is absolutely hilarious and will 💯% make you laugh.
🍬
The films plot and theme reflects extremely relevant real-life issues regarding the #MeToo movement. It's overall premise is very convincing and Jaw-Dropping in parts. Real-life issues depicted in this film reflect on Mulligans character regarding, her desire to get revenge (And does it in the best way possible)
🍬
Overall, Promising Young Woman is a very important movie for many people to see and will ignite lots of conversations upon its initial release (December 25 - January 14). The movie shows director #EmeraldFennell as a talented up and coming Director.
🍬"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,8/10,"First and foremost, this movie has very heavy themes of sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual assault. It's literally the movie's premise. So, if that's something that could trigger a response in you, I recommend not seeing this movie. That being said, the writers and director for this movie handled the subject of sexual violence VERY well. This movie could have easily been PG-13 if the swearing was toned down, but it was intentionally written to be vulgar to force an R rating to make sure those who watched it could absorb the themes and message of the movie best. The movie never shows an active sexual assault, but it's masterful in the way it almost forces the audience to feel exactly how each character feels about every event in the movie. The acting is great, the visuals are pretty, but what shines in this movie is the message the writers and director clearly feel very passionate about. Highly recommend."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,8/10,An outstanding performance by Carey Mulligan coupled with an excellent script makes this movie a must watch and a possible contender for future honours.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,10/10,"This movie had heaps of unprecedented twists and turns. Overall a genuinely well put together film. Considering the lack of good movies that have been released to cinemas in the last year this movie will definitely keep you hooked and I can guarantee that this will likely be one of the best movies you've seen in 2020/2021.
Can safely say this is one of my favourite films."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 August 2021,10/10,I haven't watched a movie with a plot twist that actually got me in a long time. If you're considering watching it just do it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 September 2021,9/10,"I love a good revenge movie, but this one is a masterpiece that's going to stick with me for a while. Carey Mulligan is outstanding as a grieving friend who is seemingly cool and disconnected, but you can feel that she's burning from the inside to bring some justice and focus. It doesn't end prettily, but it definitely ends with twisted, poetic justice. Just watch the damned movie - it's worth the time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,This movie starts off as what you think will be a romantic story. This story line will keep you guessing. The colors and aesthetics of this movie blew me away. The color schemes and decor they used was very intriguing. Would definitely watch this movie again.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,4/10,"Oh, I had such high hopes for this film. A topical theme, Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, a fresh new director. There was so much potential yet it felt horribly flat. There were a few flashes of brilliance and Mulligan did her best to bring some depth to her role. Still, the film lurched wildly in tone and genre, from a dark comedy to a sinister thriller to a... I don't know what. We learned little of what really motivated the protagonist to go to such extremes and there wasn't one likeable character in the film. An overbearing soundtrack, stilted dialogue, weak supporting players. And an ending that was just as much a mess as the rest of the film. Viewer beware."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 November 2021,8/10,"This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen. It has beats out of a romantic comedy and has quirky, upbeat, likeable characters. Many character interactions seem realistic in a lot of way and leave you feeling gross even as you chuckle at the writing. The movie strangely oscillates between horrific disgust and quirky cute comedy, but it works well enough. Some of the writing is a bit too cute or even a little predictable at times, but it definitely kept my interest the whole time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 May 2020,10/10,"This movie is an incredible new take revenge and the anger I think a lot of women feel. As a warning, the ending is difficult, but at the same time, I couldn't see it ending any other way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 October 2021,6/10,I looked forward to seeing this moving and I was utterly disappointed. It was an inspiring concept for a movie that's story line never delivered. The acting the most redeeming quality of this film.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 December 2020,9/10,When a movie ignites a valid conversation that needs more attention in today's climate it deserves to be regarded by everyone. Promising Young Woman does this fantastically.What's great about Promising Young Woman is that it doesn't vilify men as a gender purely because they're men. Like so many other films have done before.Please don't let this films overall review deter you from seeing a film fanatic film that ignites a powerful conversation that needs to be heard today.I would've given it a 10/10 if not for Bo Burnham (Although I love him!) and some of the other casts transparent acting. You can tell he's a comedian and not an actor. While I wouldn't be surprised if that was the directors decision to have some of the characters seem paper thin I would've hoped for more depth with Bo''s character and found that if the role was acted better it would've brought more power to his climax.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 November 2021,9/10,"Do not have expectations because Promising Young Woman will exceed and defy them.A brilliant take on a much talked about subject, this is easily the best movie that takes on the meaning of consent and turns it into a roller coaster.Crisp direction and solid performances keep the viewers guessing right to the end. An innovative choice of background score adds to the mood. This one is not to be missed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 January 2021,9/10,"I couldn't help but compare this film to similar films about the destructive nature of revenge, and also novels where the female protagonist is in a state of arrested development due to unprocessed trauma. But it manages to tell that story with limited violence, which I think is a credit to the writing. The aesthetics of the film and the direction of the first scene would have you believe that it's a cheekily self-aware black comedy, but after that you're hit with a deeply sad story of grief, anger, and impotence in the face of a societal disregard for the suffering of women. It's a very feminine movie, with pop music and bright candy colors throughout, and while the ending is emotionally cathartic, it still feels like a tragedy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,This movie is something one needs to see at any cost. Didn't expect at all that it'd turn out this great! What a genius story and even more brilliant execution. Hats off to the team!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 March 2021,10/10,"So much better than typical revenge movies that just get everyone killed.
And the ending felt so relived."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,10/10,"Very few films capture my attention now... this was superb!Beautifully filmed, acting was on point, moral compass addressed, kept me gripped from start to finish.Great writing, directing... a 'gem'...not forgetting a story that needed to be put out there...
Carey Mulligan you deserve an Oscar.."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 June 2021,7/10,"It was a good movie and worth the watch. However, they try a bit too much in too many places - you'll see what I mean. But def a good watch with the significant other."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 August 2021,9/10,"This movie tricks you. Oh, you think after watching the trailer, it's a revenge slasher. I'll go get my popcorn. Oh, you think after seeing familiar loveable comedy actors, maybe it's a comedy after all.But one after another, Emerald Fennel keeps breaking your expectations, without letting you settle into a comfy familiar mindset, until you stop expecting tropes and start honestly feeling the things that the movie talks to you about: loss, pain, love, forgiveness.Another remarkable thing is how well thought-through this movie is. Every color, every song, every frame and angle, every reaction are there for a reason, and for a day or two after you watch it small details will keep coming back to you, as you realize why they were really there and what they stood for."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 October 2021,8/10,"This movie is extremely relevant to the current climate. It was thought provoking, at times difficult to watch but so well made and acted. I was a little disappointed by the ending but completely understand the reasons behind it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 March 2021,4/10,"Boring, flat, primitive. I handled just for first 20 minutes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 November 2021,9/10,"From the very start, I new I had to finish it to the end. It had me thinking the whole time and guessing along. I think this might be the strongest directing performance from a female director in a long time. And funny parts too despite the theme."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,,"This was the best movie I saw in the last months, and I see a lot of good stuff. The screenwriting is creative and original, the acting is just perfect, the whole movie is such a pleasure to watch, you don´t want it to end.It´s a necessary movie where there are no bad guys, but inherited behaviors that are socially accepted. See it more than once if you can and pay attention to details, the structural sexism is all there and should make us reflect."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,10/10,"Well what a movie. From the opening scene I was riveted.Carey Mulligan was incredible as Cassandra hell bent on revenge and making the culprits 'pay the piper'!!At times excruciatingly hard to watch but brilliantly acted by Mulligan, her finest to date.The last 35 minutes I was on the edge of my seat right until the end credits rolled.
So unexpected.So very sad.So brilliantly directed. I could have been watching and modern take on Looking for Mr Goodbar at times.Oscar nominations should be on the cards for this outing. Bravo!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,9/10,"This movie left me in awe of the brilliance of Carey Mulligan and Emerald Fennell because DAMN! I thought it was going to be a cliché, woman scorned film but boy was I wrong! Just when I thought I had it figured out it threw a curveball. The story is amazingly well crafted and the kept my attention through out. Carey Mulligan is pure magic as Cassie. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of her the entire time she was on screen. Although it may seem like a ""Men are the worst!"" kind of film, I saw it as a ""Come on guys, we can do better!"" It definitely suffers from lack of diversity, however it perfectly depicts male, white privilege! So, I can slightly forgive it for only have 2 BIPOC. I highly suggest this film to anyone who loves well acted films with female leads."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 October 2021,6/10,"Someone told me this movie was a must-see. It's not that great. I found it rather tedious and, at times, a little annoying. Some of it didn't make any sense. The pharmacy scene was ridiculous. The ending was predictable. One reviewer here got it right.... Cassie was always in danger, held no power, no leverage against these men and would have been dead in a week.It would have been better if they dropped all the bubblegum songs, stopped trying to be more than it was and went balls to the wall. Bring us what we thought; a woman who seeks revenge and doesn't stop until they're all gone. This movie wasn't that. And what's with all the fake reviews calling it a masterpiece and Oscar worthy?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 January 2021,9/10,"This movie starts out like you expect, but you don't quite understand why Cassie ( played by Carrie Mulligan) is doing what she is to these men. The movie started to come together piece by piece and once you understand what's happening it does a complete 180 and you will not see the ending coming! This is a fantastic movie about serious subject matter told in a unique way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is amazing as well as a stellar performance from the cast. This is a must see!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 April 2021,10/10,"I hear great things about this movie, but I did not knew what to expect. Since the first minute you know you are watching something rare, special; its not a drama, its not a comedy, its that kind of movie that you find just a few times every now and then.Everything its perfect, the score, the lighting, the photography, the script, the director's work, the cast, but above all the work of Carey Mulligan.I cant believe its the same girl that looked so fragile on ""Drive"" that you wanted to hold and take care. Here she its brutal, you like her but at the same time, you are affraid of her. Its the first great female psicopath character of the movies, at the same level or above of Norman Bates, the guy from the Shining, Alex from Orange Clockwork or the Joker from Nolan. And this movie its just as good and intense as ORANGE CLOCKWORK. A new classic has born. If the Oscars for once are fair, this movie deserves at least the best female performance, best movie, best script and best director. A must see."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 March 2021,3/10,"I was so excited to see this movie that I purchased it instead of renting it because of the good reviews. The story was as cheesy as a bad lifetime movie. It lacked any believable emotion, but included every cliche. Great idea, bad execution."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,10/10,This is a unique romcom thriller if that is actually a genre. The pace and the storyline had a very weird vibe sending mixed emotions in different directions from start to finish but I found myself going along for the joyride. Carey Mulligan was amazing and the writing of this film is superb! It's an instant cult classic that will be on my short list of films whenever I need to remind myself that some sick films can be so disturbingly rewarding to watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 September 2021,10/10,"...where no one is safe.This will be a cult classic in the future, I think. It has amazing camera work and the story is one every woman has thought of at least once in her life. I
Well written and performed, could actually fall in the documentary category in some parts of the movie. A great film.On an odd side note, my puppy did not like one scene in particular and she barked at the screen. Smart dog.I really enjoyed this movie and can watch it over and again. It should win some awards if it hasn't already."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 October 2021,8/10,"I propose an exercise in imagination: you are in the club at night, drunk and confused, without friends and without a phone, and in front of you appears a benevolent stranger who offers to help you in those moments of deep vulnerability. The stranger not only does not leave you safely at home, but takes you to his corporate apartment, intoxicates you even more, and when he is fully convinced that you are completely devoid of defense and lucidity, he begins to undress you, full of emotion and curiosity, like a child opening his present on Christmas morning.The debut in feature film of British actress and director Emerald Fennell, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020) starts as a real horror, in which we are forced to watch, in a discomfort that is accentuated with each moment, the whole unfolding of the apparent sexual trauma that will stand at the basis of all subsequent actions of the protagonist. The repulsion that Fennell invokes in the prologue - although it has its origins in an event that overwhelmingly affects females - is universal. The fear of being the victim of abuse is present in each of us, only the reality has shown over time that this problem materializes most often in women's lives. And it materializes so frequently that the social nonchalance with which it was treated until recently becomes retrospectively worrying and therefore frightening.But the protagonist, Cassandra (Carey Mulligan) wakes up before the aggression actually takes place. Specifically, she was lucid from the very beginning. She is not a victim and this will not be a rape. It's a social experiment as elaborate as it is desolate. ""Promising Young Woman"" is at the first level a revenge story, or, more specifically, a rape revenge story, and in this sense Fennell follows a structure as classic as possible: we start with a vaguely articulated trauma, which gradually fades along the sequences, a quasi-hermetic protagonist who dedicates her entire existence to payback, an optimistic love interest in the person of Ryan (Bo Burnham), able to break through the protagonist's anger with affection and honesty and a final act that overturns her social and sentimental evolution and propels her at full speed towards the goal she had set for herself from the start: revenge on the element that irretrievably stopped her possibility of a happy life.Secondarily, but perhaps even more visibly, Fennell's film presents itself as a carefully nuanced feminist manifesto, the director taking care not to turn Cassandra into a vehicle of evil, a dehumanized beast purified of empathy. On the contrary, the filmmaker places Cassie in a higher moral sphere, completely separated from the other characters - especially the males - all of her actions being ultimately clearly justified and never truly excessive. Because the experiments used by the protagonist do not have a malicious intent and no desire to produce serious and irreversible physical and mental consequences, but aim at an honest awareness of the problem and a possible revelation of the aggressor.Poetic justice seems to be the motto that Fennell pursues in every sequencea and the character she creates for Carey Mulligan is finely outlined, but that doesn't save the director from a particular and, in the end, avoidable excess. Every male character who appears in the film is either from the beginning or until the end, either rude, misogynistic, abusive or sexually obsessed, or cowardly, pathetic, embarrassing or simply repressed in his fragile masculinity. Fennell appeals to an absolute generalization of the idea of toxic masculinity, all men engaged in the action of the film being represented, with one exception, as careless, hostile or unable to admit their own mistakes. Of course, it could be argued without too much difficulty that the mere nature of Emerald Fennell's feature film prevents a less acute approach, but the world the filmmaker chooses to illustrate is an almost hopeless one, in which the evil associated with masculinity can be held accountable only at the cost of one' own life, and not even such a heroic endeavor will in any way stop it from spreading further.Moreover, it soon becomes apparent that the aversion to the entire male ensemble in the film belongs primarily to the filmmaker, not the main character, as one might think and as Fennell herself tries to suggest in some interviews. It is initially interpretable whether men are unilaterally toxic because they are viewed through Cassie's distorted perspective of pain or because the director decides to strictly portray them in this way. Almost all the sequences of the film involve the protagonist directly or are actually provoked by her, so that every scene or setting in which a male character appears involves mediating the interaction through Cassie's eyes.Take for example the first appearance of Ryan in the film, in fact the first completely pleasant appearance of a male character in the film. The interaction begins awkwardly, with a reluctant and passive-aggressive Cassie and a seemingly shy but later surprisingly assertive Ryan, but Fennell quickly signals that this is not an ordinary conversation. Moreover, Cassie lets her guard down for a few moments and even begins to fall in love - a fact subtly signaled from the beginning of the scene, the director choosing to infuse a dose of melancholy and romance through the background song, ""Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby"", from Cigarettes After Sex.We can deduct from this narrative fragment that the filmic environment reacts directly, intra- or extradiegetically, to Cassie's feelings. In fact, Fennell, in addition to the delimitation by chapters, divides her movie into three carefully separated directions, all equally focused on the protagonist: Cassie against the abusive patriarchal system, Cassie in her parents' house, managing her trauma and Cassie in relation to Ryan. Almost every contact she has with the patriarchal universe is either offensive or disgusting (she is whistled by street workers, she almost gets molested by an embarrassing guy who also tries to explain the concept of femininity to her, she is honked at and cussed in traffic by an angry driver etc.), and the sequences themselves are marked by an approach that mimics reality, but not rendering it quite objectively. When we watch her at home, the atmosphere seems downright fake, observing a bizarre dynamic between the protagonist and her parents, always present and always refractory to her thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, in the sequences that deal with the relationship between her and Ryan, the setting becomes almost idyllic, only warmth and pure feelings passing through the lens.Therefore, the desire to filter the events of the film and their substrate through the particular optics of a character who seeks to alleviate her suffering and to find a solution to the problems that press her is visible. It seems that the entire patriarchy, along with all of its adjacent elements, is against Cassie, and that translates, for much of the film, into a subjective virtual angle. It's just that men remain detestable even in the absence of the protagonist. Moreover, their malignancy reaches paroxysm only after her distinct perspective can no longer be spoken of. And here the director seems to lose sight of her original goal, throwing herself into a gratuitous, simplistic and clichéd representation of an entire social category by virtue of personal considerations.Simply put, Fennell starts well, but gets lost, thematically, on the road, abandoning the honest and empathetic exploration of a subject as sensitive and relevant as possible in favor of a gradual and, finally, unexpected expansion of the antipathy she starts with. This does not make ""Promising Young Woman"" less fascinating in its construction or less important for the current context, but it inevitably detracts from the potential of the message it set out to convey."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 February 2021,10/10,Very profound intriguing movie. Love the fresh faces and a topic that truly needs to be addressed. Fantastic soundtrack too!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 November 2021,7/10,"I'll start with what I loved - the casting was spot on, and the acting was great for both the emotional moments and the dark comedy bits. The theme is a difficult one to tackle but the writers and director did a commendable job. The set design looked very creative and original. Overall amazing effort, and this film deserves all the recognition it's been receiving.The plot would've worked better if there was no video evidence at all. Bcos we're told that Cassie wasn't present at the party where Nina's assault takes place. It's all he said, she said, so the system failed her initially due to lack of hard evidence. They should've made Madison's character confess what she witnessed of the incident to kick start's Nina's revenge 2.0. Then cassie's subsequent death and Al's arrest for her murder would've brought justice to Nina in a backdoor, indirect way which would've made more sense.Sadly the availability of the video evidence and the fact that there's no statutory limitation for rape (in India at least, but most probably in the US as well) dilutes the necessity and moral justification of cassie's actions. Bcos ultimately in the end Al is going to jail which Cassie could've achieved even without her dying. Seems like the video plot line was added only to show that ""nice guys"" like Ryan are not what they appear to be. But this choice has negatively affected the tone and coherence of the film. It doesn't help that it isn't easy to relate to or root for our protagonist."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,6/10,"This is a strange film. The trailer looked great. Its winning awards, including BAFTA Best Film and everyone is raving about it but when I sat down to finally watch it, I was underwhelmed. Carey Mulligan is great in the lead role but the film never really feels like a great. None of the other characters really pull you into the story, they're just filler and pretty forgettable, with the exception of Cassie's parents. The whole revenge plot is intriguing but obvious and comes as no real surprise. It does nothing to subvert your expectations. Directorially, I thought I was watching another Nicolas Winding-Refyn film, it's got a lot of ""Drive"" vibes about it & therefore loses any uniqueness this film may have. Id suggest that this film is getting the traction it is because of its content, not for its quality. The ending is a real kicker & will catch you by surprise but at the same time, feels a bit unnecessary. Yes, the men finally receive justice but you end up just feeling tragically sorry for Cassie's parents, played superbly by Highlander actor Clancy Brown & Stifler's Mom, Jennifer Coolidge.Overall, an interesting and yes, at times, enjoyable watch. However, it certainly isn't anything special or Oscar worthy and left both my fiancée & me underwhelmed, considering the hype."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 February 2021,9/10,A film that discusses real and traumatic subjects about abuse and revenge but uses dark comedy reminiscent of American Psycho. Many twists and turns with a truly climatic ending. Absolutely loved this kick ass girl power film and it's messages.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,10/10,I went into this not knowing the plot.. I don't even know what to say except for WOW.. Great acting and the plot just intensified.. The ending left me blown away!! Soooo good!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 May 2021,10/10,Loved every second of this movie! Great story and great acting and just the right amount of twist.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,9/10,"Every line of this film is brilliant and it's also a cinematic masterpiece. Overall it's powerful and dark, but hopefully brings with it behavioural change."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 June 2021,8/10,"Loved the film overall Carey Mulligan was outstanding and the film was thought provoking and hopefully has made people reconsider how they think about many social issues. I do, however, have mixed emotions regarding the ending. It was powerful - however, I would really like to seen an ending where the female protagonist doesn't have to die to get the point across."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,6/10,"I've been seeing this film getting a lot of praise lately, but I don't really get why.I thought it was a bit shallow all the way to the ""IIII"" chapter. The film keeps reminding the viewers what it's message is about: ""don't take advantage of vulnerable people"". Which I don't think is interesting enough to carry a whole narrative, but that's what ends up happening.The ending is definitely it's best part, it's shocking and unexpected. But because of the bad taste the rest of the film left in my mouth, it was hard to really appreciate it.My only guess is that people are praising it mainly because of the topic that it covers and the Director's genre. Which I hope that's not the case, because that would be kind of sad.I think this film would benefit a lot if it had a more stylized and tense direction.Could be a 7 if the ""build up"" to the end was less dull."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 February 2021,10/10,"The ultimate female buddy movie, except that one half of the pair is dead. She's exhausted all legal means to make things right for her friend, so is forced to take things into her own hands. That she seems crazy highlights how far a woman has to go to defend another woman in a patriarchal society. The two people in the film deemed crazy are the two most deeply affected by the horrible treatment of her friend. The filmmaker does an excellent job of portraying how good some predators are compensating, from the female justice of the peace to the feigned attempts at being gentlemanly. As the protagonist says, ""they're often the worst""."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,8/10,"Funny, cunning, and elaborate in its overall delivery. Although the basic premise contains aspects that many of us are already familiar with, none of it was predictable; kept me guessing till the end.Its emphasis on feminism and portrayal of males might be viewed as a bit extreme by some - almost to the point of reverse sexism. Personally, it did not bother me at all as it is still a phenomenon that is very relevant; and I feel it's underlying message goes beyond that.Anyway not to spoil anything I will just say that it will definitely be worth your while. Carey Mulligan's performance on its own is already a big plus with a lot of depth to her character and delivery. I hope her performance is given the appreciation it well deserves! I also really appreciated the movie's use of music and the choice of attire throughout different scenes - spot on!I did not give it a 10 because there were some aspects that I felt could have been portrayed better (especially towards the end). Also. some of the characters could have been developed more as it felt like the movie was very much polarised with most characters fitting in the category of 'good' or 'bad'. But I need to also appreciate that it might represent the main character's way of thinking (you're either good or you're like 'them').Enjoy :)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 March 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan gives the best performance of her career and this is Emerald Fennell's directorial debut Wow! Amazing storyline, great performances and the final was shockingly good. Watch this without prejudice and get blown away!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 February 2021,10/10,"As a person who can relate to this topic I think it was a great movie.
It used an extreme version of actions to convey a message."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 April 2021,8/10,Great movie. Great acting. Great cast. Great story with a twist.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,10/10,"I survived men like the ones in this movie. This was extremely cathartic to watch, especially hearing my boyfriend cheering her on as she went."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,9/10,"Really interesting movie, definitely my has my recommendation!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,10/10,Great movie. Finally something new. Too bad it came out during the pandemic. It could've and should've reached a bigger audience. All the one stars are from all the Al Monroes in the world.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 February 2021,8/10,"Lt's a common topic of the sexual assault that happened in uni or high school and the
predators got away with ""righteous' 'excuses and disguised it,they went on with their life when the victims suffered in shadow.Everyone who are aware of or responsible for Nina's tragic got reminded of the atrocities they did, which in common sense, shouldn't take all the revenges to get them around. This film detailed the process,in an kind of uncomfortable, excruciating way, I was doubting whether the heroin was doing the right thing, she might had better ways to do it ,but she took the extreme one and we'll prepared, sacrificed her life to bring justice for Nina.."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,9/10,"I absolutely loved this film! The acting, the writing, the directing, all A+++."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,7/10,"Basically perfect until the unsatisfying climax, by then your rage is so deep you need a much bloodier and slow revenge over the perfect life of the ever unrepenting villains. Horrible crimes like this happen all the time and the evil monsters who commit them always get away with it"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,9/10,"I really like it! Different story and unpredictable end,, the best movie I've seen in the last two years."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 April 2021,9/10,"This film was such a pleasant surprise, well I don't think pleasant is the word to use but...
The acting I thought was very good, particularly the lead Emerald Fennel played the dead pan bad a*** character very well. The plot was well paced an I couldn't guess what direction it was going in. A shocking twist too which caught me off guard.Visually clever too I thought with the use of bright colours and almost oldy American backdrop with the characters home.Finally we all know someone (or many someone's) who hold the values and opinions of the rest of the characters, I could feel my anger building for the main character.Definitely worth a watch!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,9/10,"This movie was good! i don't understand the negative reviews. this movie wasn't meant to be educational or inspiring, but was a thriller that represented the realities of r*pe culture today. it portrays the grey area of assault that people often victim blame due to intoxication of the victim. it shows that not even the nice guy you're rooting for is innocent. i think any guy who sees this movie and is afraid maybe should be! consent is the presence of a yes, not the absence of a no and cannot be coerced through force or through the use of substances! people are saying that the movie continued the act of violence and while this is true, it's a fictional movie and the point is that some people need to come to their senses and admit to their faults. and not to mention she never ended up hurting anyone? (until she almost did at the end, yet he deserved it). this movie was shocking,
disturbing, and thrilling. carey mulligan did an amazing job and bo burnham played his character very well. i was shocked and happy at the end as while we saw a tragic fate, we also got justice. it was a refreshing movie to the recent releases of very awful movies and if someone were to pick a new release on movie night, i think this would be a good choice.
remember: consent is necessary"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,,Enticing movie. Great acting and amazing plot. The movie is about a topic we all need to discuss. Great work.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,"A thought-provoking story beautifully told and
No!! The movie is not feminist."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,7/10,"It's a pretty decent film, main criticism is that it's so on the nose and laid on thick, that it doesn't give the viewer much work to do in the way of thinking, and the plot armor guarding the protagonist is virtually impenetrable. It's a great visceral tale of a woman scorned; and it satiates a very specific taste. The color pallets are often times quite nice."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 February 2021,8/10,"Many women out there have the same story just like this that is hidden in our society because they only see them differently. This movie should open up this kind of stories needed to be told. About the movie, it is instantly changing its mood throughout the movie. Revolves on a woman that seeks revenge that everybody can learn about while you were watching this movie. From my perspective, I explore more things after what's gonna happen. It is not satisfying in my opinion only because I am wanting more ""ahh"" moments. Nonetheless, it is a very good movie I am recommending it for someone who is looking for dark comedy thriller movies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,9/10,"This is a gem.From minute one,you realize how well it is performed,directed and it is like I said a little master piececthat must be seen.Go watch it!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,7/10,"A tragic story told in a comedic way. One of the best movies I've seen in 2020, highlighting on human flaws and ignorance .A movie about the long tail of a sexual assault, showing how a person can be so effected by the actions of a few against her loved ones. Carey Mulligan does the best performance of the year and her career.Director and writer Emerald Fennell did a really good job. This is also her direct debut and everything I've seen on screen shows great potential for her as a filmmaker in the future. the ending is very strange and shocking. I was both sad and happy at the same time. However, it can also make or break the movie for some, while I was kind of mixed on it. Some parts of the ending were realistic, as it was a cold reminder for us that sometimes justice isn't always severed. although this movie is not perfect but 100% would recommend, and worth watching"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,8/10,"Carey Mulligan was amazing in the movie, I enjoyed watching, an interesting story which you hear a lot about but doesn't end like this one, very clever. I might watch it again with friends and see what they think of it. I only do that if I like the movie and something happens that I wasn't expecting and want to see how people react to it.
Carey should do an action movie and play an assassin next."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 May 2021,10/10,So believable. This movie is so true to my life in college and high school this type of stuff happened all the time to my friends and everyone always said 'oh well they just woke up with regret.' I'm glad to see the world is changing and that we can finally speak on this stuff.WARNING though this may be very triggering to SA survivors. My friend told me it was very hard for her to watch because a similar thing happened to her. Just despicable to see what men with power will do to cover their tracks from the transgression they committed when they were 'kids.'There have been a lot of movies that speak on SA but this one gets it right in a darkly comic way that is very watchable.10/10.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 May 2021,10/10,"The story is so compelling, well written and gives perspective to a real pandemic that has been going on for centuries, rape and sexual assault.This film is a must watch for us all. 1 in 3 women has been assaulted at least once in their life. I have personally been assaulted 3 times in my only 34 years of age, the first being at the age of 10 by the husband of my aunty. I didn't say anything because I knew I wouldn't have been believed. The pedofile is still around.Although talking about something so tragic, the movie is something of a classic, with beautiful theatrical images and a compelling drama and thriller, like a good book you can't put down. A job well done to both the director and main actress!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,10/10,"This movie is the type of film where you think about it long after the credits roll. It's dark and I had a weight on my chest watching this, but it's powerful and contradictory. The plot twist really pushed this film over the edge and unfolded many layers that the viewer probably wouldn't notice at first glance. The soundtrack and Barbie aesthetic are a stark contrast to the dark theme of the movie and I think that makes It even more powerful. This movie is one of the best things to come out of 2020. I think everyone needs to see this, especially now."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 April 2021,6/10,"I love the concept of a powerful female lead carrying out her revenge on predatory men. I expected this movie to be suspenseful and violent but was left disappointed.I think this film would have been so much better with a ""Kill Bill"" approach. I was always waiting for the movie to ramp up and felt unfulfilled when it didn't.However, I enjoyed the twist at the end so it wasn't all bad."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 January 2021,7/10,The originality of the Story is perfect.. they tried so much though.. it could have been a simpler movie.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 December 2020,10/10,All I have to say is this was the best movie of 2020 I'm so shocked that the reviews are so low the production and everything about it was just amazing and I really think you should go watch it right now if you're hesitating on watching it. The last 33 minutes were just crazy so unexpected I think that's what's really good about this movie is you think it's going one way but you're wrong twists and turns I just think it's amazing and you should do watch it now
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,8/10,"The movie was much different from my expectations from the trailers. It seemed to be an ironic, light-hearted story about revenge, it is though a serious movie telling a story of inequality of the sexes and behaviors and its consequences on the long-run.We get to know Cassy (Cassandra portrayed by Carey Mulligan) throughout the movie.
She was a medical student and dropped out of school years before the story is set. She punishes men for taking advantage of woman under the influence, majorly by too much use of alcohol.
Cassy's past catches up with her as a former college mate shows up at the coffee shop she is working at. Talking about former class mates is the kick-off for unfolding the past and the reason for Cassy's vengeance against men.This is a movie about an issue barely touched, abuse of women in a state of vulnerability and men taking advantage - without directly showing this kind of violence, but more displaying the dark scars this leaves and holding up a mirror to many young men.
Great movie, good food for thoughts and discussions and with that, simply highly recommended."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 February 2021,10/10,Really makes you think of what is commonplace among the youth and society as a whole. Well written and great sound track. A film I will remember forever and makes me think how I will raise my girls and boy to understand what is acceptable and what is absolutely disgusting. Should win many awards.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,9/10,This film is an absolute must see. The dialogue spoke by some of the antagonists alone is chillingly accurate. Brilliantly presented and ends with the ending that I can say actually feels real. Carey Mulligan is smart and fabulous. Laverne Cox is a wonderful supporting actress. This movie needs more buzz!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,9/10,Great story and well executed. There is often no justice for victims and I love how Cassandra becomes some what of a vigilante.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,Give this woman the Oscar now! What a brilliant performance.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 March 2021,8/10,"A different drama and the best history. I never watched anything similar. A movie for to see and then think.
This film it's a real life of a lot of women.
The final parte it's amazing, you will enjoy it but your hearth will be break.
Only one thing against, there's some regular performances.
To finished I repeat, this is a movie to watch and to thing, the world it's too different to some people."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 July 2021,10/10,Clever!Well acted.Mulligan is 10/10 - as always!Watch Watch Watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,9/10,"Not entirely what I expected, I was anticipating a serial killer.But I really REALLY liked this movie. I think a lot of guys will be disturbed by the characters they (silently) relate to."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 April 2021,3/10,"Ending is miserable
She was preparing herself for revenge in whole film
And then at the end she gave up 🙁"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 March 2021,10/10,Finally a film to get back at all those dirty one night stand dudes that walk away bragging but the girls are chastised. I enjoyed this and the performance of this promising young woman!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 May 2021,10/10,"Have been wanting to watch this for some time and it didn't disappoint. I think most women will recognise some of the characters in this film - especially the 'nice' guys. It should probably be shown in schools and universities as a lesson in consent.Great little film, entertaining, clever, quirky. Carey Mulligan is fantastic."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,7/10,"Cool film
Was not excepting the twist.Margot Robbie can definitely do everything."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,2/10,"At least some, as that what was teased, not only with the trailer, but with the tally she kept in her book. Some of the tallys were in red, surely meaning she'd killed or at least maimed them? I even thought ""Oh cool, she's ex-med school so maybe they'll do something with that, like she always wanted to do surgery but never had the steady hand for it so they wouldn't let her practice in theatre so she's taking it out of them"". But no. No violence at all. Just...words.All in all, I had such high hopes for this film but was let down by the execution. It was just so sluggish. Not punchy and wicked and fierce as I thought it was going to be, and what the trailer and marketing sold to us. Lame conclusion that was obvious from a mile away too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,10/10,"Positive:

definitely Carry Mulligan as Casandra Thomas."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 August 2021,10/10,"Every woman and especially every man needs to watch this movie. It deals with the very important topic of sexual abuse and how people are willing to oversee injustice as long as they're not personally involved. It is funny, dark, has a lot of unexpected twists and it makes you overthink your own actions and how you treat people."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 May 2021,10/10,"We did a double screening with Initiation. Sparked great debate after the double feature. The general consensus,strong female leads make great horror. All the attention was well deserved. Bravo to the entire cast!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 October 2021,9/10,"This is a fast-paced very-dark comedy/thriller about a woman seeking revenge on those males who prey upon impaired women, in addition to enlightening those who dismiss such assaults as ""he said/she said"". Having heard reviews & commentary about the movie for months before finally being able to see it, I noticed no scenes that would give this an R rating - except for the copious & Very Adult language. It's a testament to Emerald Ferrell's Oscar-winning screenplay that most of the actual violence readily appears in our imaginations, while not actually on-screen. This movie should be required viewing for older teens & all college students, to continue spreading Cassie's (and Ferrell's) message."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"Disturbing, charming, clever, and full of sweet revenge-Mulligan serves it up cold."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,6/10,"I expected so much but it delivered so little. I hoped for a dark, sinister plot but got superficial fluff. The characters are just not believable and it's a huge distraction. Coupled with a weak script and some over the top acting it's hard to go with it, even though I wanted to. I've recently watched Soul, Judas and the Black Messiah, the Mauritanian and Run, all of which are far superior to this film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 September 2021,9/10,I only read a brief summary about this film before I watched it. I had no idea what it was going to be about. It was unexpected and a well done film. I recommend for many reasons. You should find out for yourself.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 February 2021,9/10,At first I had no idea what was going on but slowly the darkness took over and it was beautiful.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 April 2021,9/10,"There are so many aspects of the film that were so well thought out that it blew my mind. From set design to cinematography, there were some breathtaking shots, and everything worked so well in situating the characters within the storyline.Story-wise, it felt so cathartic and liberating to see the story develop. It was a simple but well-written story, which is often so a much more satisfying experience."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 April 2021,7/10,"A good film with a very cool idea and nice production design, dealing with a very important topic.The hero of this film is a person deeply affected not only by the loss of her best friend, but also by the injustice of a system that fails to treat harassers, their supporters, and victim-blamers the way they deserve, which is why she takes justice in her own hands. She is surrounded by candy colored interiors, people, and dresses, but inside she is dark, depressed, and angry. She is being perceived by her surrounding as arrogant, strange and unstable, while the ones truly arrogant are admired and seen as normal and rational.This contradiction is topped with a genre combination of thriller, comedy and fairy tale romance. I don't find the comedy in this film funny, and I am not sure if the romance part is intended to be that much overdone and uncomfortable to watch, but the way the plot took turn in the cabin was indeed disturbing. It's not the violent act that is shocking, but rather the fact that that guy will once again get away with a crime. It's the fact that a detective gives more credit to the statement of a doctor/ex boyfriend than to the one of the concerned parents. It's the sticking together and back petting of the spoiled and rich elite, even when one of them murders a person in cold blood. This is why the ending, even though it's very unrealistic, feels good. The police does their job and everyone gets exactly what they deserve. A fairy tale ending to the heroes nightmarish outcome."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,7/10,"The ending is not reassuring at all but quite the opposite: it's a depressing sign that nothing is gonna change in this world (patriarchy, machismo, etc..)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,5/10,"I loved every minute of this movie until the end. The whole story was about this woman getting justice for her best friend. But instead of getting that satisfaction, the writer decides the same guy responsible for the rape and Demise of her friend will also be the one who kills her in the end. So frustrating. I don't give an eff that he was arrested, how is that freaking justice if she's dead??? The ending ruined it for me. It would've been so much more satisfying if she would've ruined their lives and then went on to find happiness. Instead, the story is that a group of guys destroy the lives of two women that leads to both of their deaths. It's the opposite of the story I wanted."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,8/10,"Wow this had me glued to my seat. I was so invested in the main character Cassie and watching this story unfold. Carey Mulligan did a fantastic job. The music was perfection! It brought me back to the 2000s and was a perfect pairing. I'm still unsure how I feel about the ending, which is why I currently rated this an 8. I was 10/10 but am so shocked by the end I can't decide if this was a good or bad shock. Either way, addresses really important topics in totally new lights. The movie is a mix of genres & unlike anything else you've seen before. Definitely not one you'll forget anytime soon."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 September 2021,5/10,Carey is an amazing actor but this movie is so cliche from the characters to dialogues. A wasted opportunity.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 August 2021,6/10,"First of all I must say I agree with the general premise of the film to raise awareness of safety of women and to highlight the potential risks out there. What ruins it for me is the reaction of the man, many times it seems like it's more the way certain women want men to react, rather than the way they would in real life. For example some man getting scared and racing away in his car when she decides to smash it up with a crowbar. Man crying left right and centre every time they are confronted about their behaviour.I worry that some women will see these on realistic reactions, and think they can try them out on men out there. With dire consequences.However, a very different ending and overall was a good idea, hopefully it helps somebody."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 April 2021,8/10,"Wow.This movie is... So many things.First of all, let me express my undying appreciation of the absolutely amazing performance portrayed by the remarkable Carey Mulligan, unfortunately only recently discovered by me.Carey takes the lead with such ease, giving us a captivating, at times close to impressively intimidating(mostly at the first half of the movie) performance, while not being afraid of giving us reminders of her humanity - mainly her vulnerability - throughout the film.Her acting is with no doubt the best part of this film.And yet, fret not, for this movie has much more to show off for than its admirably identifiable lead Cassandra.The soundtrack and directing team-up is genuinely brilliant, whether it be the opening number, the music-video-esque almost parodic Paris Hilton scene, or the classical cover accompanying us through the doors along Cassandra in the 4th act.The tone chosen from beginning to end by Anthony Willis combined with the genius directory of Emerald Fennell creates an unforgettable experience which only enhanced my connection to Cassandra.Fennell portrays on our screen what could seem so unrealistic in many ways, as most of these films and movies in general do, but over time becomes closer and closer to our reality, through her brilliant writing filled with plot points which truly fooled me thinking much darker than what is finally exposed later on, the realness of the characters, and of course, the endgame.I have been excited to watch this movie from the moment I laid my eyes on the first trailer and I cannot express my appreciation for the work done by Fennell and Mulligan enough.Be sure to watch this one.If not for the cinematic creation that it is then for the message only too relevant to the state of our society which it delivers."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 May 2021,10/10,"I really wanted to like this movie as I'm a fan of Emerald Fennel as an actress and was intrigued to see how her writing/directing would turn out. I didn't like it, I absolutely loved it. It seems a bit slow to start but it holds your interest from start to finish and had me laughing, crying and gasping with shock throughout. Carey Mulligan is totally believable as Cassie, she was perfect for the role and played it brilliantly. It's a very well thought out plot and a surprising but satisfying ending even though things don't quite turn out how you hoped. Definitely a must see and a worthy Oscar winner. Let's hope Emerald keeps em coming as she's one talented young woman."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,"So brilliantly real, so brilliantly true.The cast is amazing I felt like I was in their situations with them. The tension was insane and Carey M 🙌🏻👏🏻"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 January 2021,9/10,"Carey Mulligan is always a powerhouse in any move she's in and this one is no exception. It takes a while (up to the midpoint) to figure out what her motivations are, but when we do figure it out, we can really understand what the title of the movie really means. Its not only about her, its about her childhood best friend and a traumatic event that occured to each of them.I don't really wanna spoil the movie, because I recommend people watch it.
The other actors, many of whom I love and appreciate, do a fine job, but they don't shine the way Mulligan does. The spotlight is pretty much all on her. I'm not sure the dialogue makes it worthy of awards, but still, its a move that keeps you hooked until the very end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 December 2020,6/10,"The thing I found disappointing about this film was that tonally it was just not in any way 'redeeming'. The end was just tragic and despite trying to be kookie, one just walked out of the cinema feeling flat."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 March 2021,8/10,"The trailers could be misleading, cuz it's more than just a ""woman revenging on men who have wronged her"".I agree with some saying about the mix genres, but that's life. Especially for someone who have traumatic past. We tried to move on with the bright side, meeting new people and stuff, but most of the time the dark sides will get to us and feel stuck all the time.Her plans were brilliant until accident happened, again, just like life. I did enjoy watching it, but there's this one moment I felt was dragging a bit, but yeah it served for a purpose. It's a feminist movie, and it doesn't matter how it ends, as long as it raises the awareness. Shame to see those who thought this would be a great thriller and left a negative review because it's more than just that."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,8/10,"Not your average formulaic film
It takes a while to figure this one out. Carey Mulligan is extraordinary in the part of a vengeful young woman still carrying the pain of a great loss from her youth. But as they say, it ain't over til it's over. And this promising young woman certainly proves that to be true."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 December 2020,10/10,My husband and I both enjoyed this movie equally. And since a lot of it hinges on the feminism of Revenge. That's not usual.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,9/10,You won't fall asleep if you watch this film.What would you do if someone you love committed suicide. Watch how a young woman deals with it. You will be surprised.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,5/10,If the film ended with a happy wedding and the men getting away with their crimes this would have made for a much more impactful film. Disappointing as I was surprised how watchable this was. I just wish it was more brave with the finale given the films themes of masculinity and victims of assault. They could have sent a message that men continue to get away with this kind of behaviour with no repercussions. The ending seems to contradict what the message was throughout.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 October 2020,10/10,"This film definitely did not have the ending that everyone is expecting. It's not the type of ending you'd expect in any film about assault, rape, murder, etc. This movie was made to be entertaining but also very BLUNT to get an important message across. When you see this in theaters, you'll leave with a sense of disappointment in the ending (but not with the film).The disappointment in the ending however, directly correlates to the thought of ""I wish that would've ended differently"" that crosses through victims' minds after being raped or assaulted. Going home drunk with ""a guy from the bar"" or even being alone with a longtime friend shouldn't result in rape or being taken advantage of - but often does. The thought of ""i wish that would've ended differently"" definitely echos in that same sentiment.Promising Young Woman challenges the idea of what a ""good guy"" actually is. PYW attacks the idea of there being a ""gray area"" in regards to placing someone at fault.The cinematography is beautiful and purposeful. Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, & Laverne Cox all did an excellent job at acting through such important roles. This movie is triggering, healing, and educational. Please go see it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 October 2021,8/10,"After all the work that went into ensuring Al's arrest, why didn't Cassie also include the video from Madisons phone?"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 April 2021,6/10,"Let me start off by saying that the movie had great acting, camera work and scene design. Carey Mulligan was fantastic as the lead, playing a cunning and grief-stricken friend that did a great job at putting a lot of men in their place. She certainly deserves her Oscar nomination.However, my main issue with the film was the writing. It was riddled with cliché and unoriginal dialogue. The overall story wasn't bad but there were a lot of cheesy conversations between characters. There were some good moments sprinkled around, the scene with the lawyer was a personal favourite. However, it all culminated to a very unsatisfying ending that didn't fit with the rest of the film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,9 June 2021,3/10,"I'm still in shock how this movie has been nominated for couple of oscars in any case! Yes the message is today's trend and has to be heard (honestly that's the only reason I could convince myself to recommend it) but from all point of view, its an average movie. Directing remind me the 90s movies with theatrical gestures, of course all actings follow the direction, shallow and predictable. The story doest have enough reasons to satisfy our logic. Comparing with the other movies at this genre, Gone girl or prisoners, its nothing to talk about.the ending is awful and mostly comic rather than a crime movie.3 stars for editing and some technical efforts."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 August 2021,9/10,"As a woman, I've never felt a movie so relatable. We deal with this stuff all the time. Her fishing scenes were to prove that most (not all) want one thing and one thing only. It was a point I've seen many times and it scares the hell out of me. Bravo for her for sticking up for her best friend."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 December 2020,10/10,"This script was so impressive. She covered all the angles and tied it up neatly. The acting was flawless. I'm grateful that I've never known anyone who was raped or anyone accused of it. But I know it happens more than it should. My friends and I always had a ""babysitter"" among us when we went out in college, and it should be a common practice with all friends (male and female). Alcohol/drug use changes people, and all too often, it ruins lives. This story may seem far fetched, but I doubt it is. Anyone who rapes another person should be held accountable just as anyone who wrongfully accuses another of such a heinous crime. Sadly, many victims get screwed. Alfred Molina's character in the movie was an excellent reality check. I'm an avid moviegoer, and this is at the top of my list for 2020. If you're one of those people who believe that drunk girls are ""asking for it,"" this one's for you."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,4/10,I think it was a boring movie with a message. It was slow and to me most of it didn't really make sense. I don't see what all the fuss is about.

📽MOVIE REVIEW🍿
_____________________
#PromisingYoungWoman #ReelKidReview #movies #popcorn #Kuwait #cinema #film #review #moviereview
_____________________
Movie Info:
*Movie: Promising Young Woman
*Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller
*Director: Emerald Fennell
*Cast: Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, Clancy Brown, Jennifer Coolidge, Laverne Cox
*Budget: N/A
_____________________
In my opinion, 'Promising Young Woman' would receive a B+ because of the following:
_____________________
➕Positive:
Let's start with the obvious. Carey Mulligan gives an electric performance that just really works in the realm of the film. The whole film depends on her performance to work, and she really hits it out of the ballpark.The tone is also extremely tense and riveting throughout, making the film consistently engaging even when there isn't much story-wise happening on screen.The film is also very satisfying as a revenge tale, while also adopting some clever twists on the genre.While not particularly flashy or noteworthy dialogue-wise, the screenplay is provocative and exciting, and always authentic in terms of how it allows its various characters to feel like living, breathing people.Emerald Fennell's direction is also particularly noteworthy, and lends for some stylistically interesting visual storytelling.The social commentary woven through the film is piercingly prevalent and incisively executed whilst also feeling natural.The final act is terrifically executed, with multiple moments that I ensure will make your blood boil. Trust me when I say this is a movie people will be talking about for a while, mainly thanks to the brilliantly shocking ending (I literally gasped out loud multiple times throughout the last 30 mins).Although the plot felt a bit disjointed whole watching, I think the structure only fortified the film's ending and held up beautifully in hindsight (this is one of those film where it all clicks in the end and you get what is trying to be done).The cinematography is also great, with lots of interesting shots throughout that assisted the film's subtext.The costume design and hair and makeup is also well-done across the board, working in tandem with the production design to aid Mulligan's performance._____________________
➖Negative:
Unfortunately, the film is a little slow at times, but picks up considerably for the final act.As much as I appreciated the film for what it was, it felt like something was missing (I don't know but to me, it doesn't yet feel like a fully formed film)._____________________
*Best Actor/Character:
As I mentioned, Mulligan carries the film with a bravura performance that exudes an equal amount of sympathy and sociopathy, making her development throughout the film incredibly devastating to watch. Although she isn't my top contender for Best Actress, I still think she definitely deserves the nomination.
_____________________
*Should it get a sequel?:
Nope, this is not that type of film.
_____________________
*How to Watch:
Although it is currently playing in theaters in addition to PVOD, the film does not need to be seen on the big screen, and I think streaming is the perfect choice for it.
_____________________
*Audience:
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a really great revenge thriller but done in a more sophisticated, socially relevant, and subversive way. Carey Mulligan's performance alone is worth watching, so if you enjoy her in other films, this is another big performance from her. Although I will admit that it isn't for everyone, and is more or less consistent with the smaller movies which we've seen this awards season due to the delay of some of the bigger 2020 studio awards productions.For more reviews and film coverage, make sure to check out @reel_kid on Instagram!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 April 2021,8/10,"Wow. I did not expect that type of intensity, just wow. Helluva movie with a direct message. Mrs. Mulligan did a good job."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 December 2020,10/10,Darkest film I have seen in a very long time. It stays with you in a very uncomfortable way for days after viewing.Casting and acting is spot on.Possibly the best film I have ever seen.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 February 2021,9/10,Great movie with some extremely touching subjects.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 January 2021,5/10,Spite the movie has a really bad opinion about men and showed all of the as as***les but the story was nice and catching. But the ending was unreal and very fantsy . A dead person sends you scheduled message exactly when police arrives?? Really?!?!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 January 2021,10/10,"It isn't what you are expecting, the trailer makes it seem high octane, witty, clever but predictable. it witty and clever but it is not predictable and is quite slow paced. I literally shouted at the screen at one point and cried at another. this is a fantastic film and it will resonate with many woman not perhaps in the way the trailer suggests but in a darker and truer way."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,10/10,"This movie should be part of the curriculum. Knowing that the human race in general would not choose to watch/discuss/acknowledge the issues in this film, it should be free to stream at least."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,9/10,"I never leave reviews, but I think this one is more than worthy! I loved everything about this movie and I will be thinking about it for a long time to come."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 August 2021,9/10,We both loved this film. Important message (obvs) but packaged as you'd expect from someone associated with the brilliant Killing Eve. It is certainly one that has stayed with me.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 November 2021,10/10,"Brilliant script, direction and performances. I hope it gets recognized as an outdated story of the ways things were... some day. The story eloquently shows why there are no ""good guys"". All men have either been the perpetrator of or have defended a man who has sexually abused a woman. It's as systemic as racism. I hope men are held accountable."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,6/10,"Five Oscar nominations that invite five times the same question: WTF?Is not a bad film, mind you. But it's just not good enough of anything; not Oscar-level performances, direction, writing, cinematography or editing. It would clean the Meh Awards, no doubt. But not the Oscars.Then in the middle of the film there's a dance sequence that would embarrass the gaudiest Bollywood kitschfest. And the music cues punctuating drama and Oh-my-Godness during Cassie's speech to Al, is worth of any school production.All in all, a good idea poorly executed. I cannot help thinking that with more back story and time to develop the conflicts, this would have made a best seller novel instead of a rushed, incomplete film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,10/10,"I haven't seen such a good film for a long time. Great story. Phantastic actors.
Reckon this movie will gets all the rewards its deserves."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,10/10,"A film by Womxn, for Whammen, about Wimnx. Though not a comedy, neither is it drama: Not compelling, nor particularly interesting. It must however, be given the Nobel Prize for Movieness. WARNING: contains sanctimony, rainbow hair, and resentment."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 July 2021,8/10,"She even finds some one every night. I hate how the hero is human and is still not without risk of violence. I hate how I want her to win and have a good life, this means letting go off the vigilante. I also don't want that since I love seeing her punish the bad.It is sad that she can't change the world without giving her life to this purpose therefore suffering herself.I hated that there is even a movie like this.But I think this movie is amazing! Since the frustrations I have with it are the ones I have with reality and therefore it captured it perfectly."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 May 2021,9/10,"Such an amazing, tense, revenge thriller. Just go and watch it! That's all I have to say!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,What a brilliant film. Can't stop thinking about it. Genius.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 December 2020,8/10,What a great movie. Highly recommend it. Thank you Emerald Fennell for delivering this gem. Carey Mulligan you never disappoint.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,9/10,"Carey deserves an Oscar for leading actress, that's all."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,8/10,"I really don't understand all the bad reviews.This movie is a rollercoaster of emotion, and it makes you THINK (And also cry... well, at least I did).It talks about the importance of consent especially in a situation that some people try to pass as gray zone, when it is obviously not. You can see how painful and wrong it is without graphic images, and that's a big plus for me.It was quite predictable but I think that the beauty of the film resides in it's message and how it's portrayed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,10/10,"I sat stunned as the credits rolled.
I haven't seen a film that has stayed with me in a very long time.
Filmed with a pastel hue of innocence while telling a story that is all too common.
I don't want to give spoilers but this movie will make you laugh and make you angry."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 May 2021,5/10,"Carey, Adrien, Schmidt, Stiflers mom and doctor octopus had half decent performances. I could have done a better job than the rest of the male cast. Also, poor visuals, music and writing in general."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,10/10,"There are plenty of movies that attempt to get their message on assault across and do it incorrectly, and this is not one of them. Not only was I thoroughly entertained throughout, but this movie was spot on in the acting, writing, and storytelling. 10000/10, go see it!!! You'll be surprised!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 December 2020,10/10,"It's not often I'm not the slightest bit disappointed in a movie I'm DYING to see on the first viewing. But I am thrilled to say Promising Young Woman delivered. It's the film of the year. Timely, necessary, and an absolute gut punch. Carey Mulligan is sensational and has never been better (and she's given some great performances).I cannot wait to see this again and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I think it will be unshakeable for a while. The end alone kind of makes it impossible to forget. I was a little nervous going into it because the ending seems to make or break it for a lot of people. I didn't want to have it ruined for me by ending in an unsatisfying way. Thankfully I'm not one of the people to have a problem with the ending. It's not the crowd-pleasing revenge fantasy people might want, but it's the sobering (albeit still kind of crowd-pleasing when all is said and done) one we need."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 September 2021,10/10,"If you did not like this movie, you are probably the problem. People dont like to see the truth."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 June 2021,10/10,I never write reviews LIKE EVER.This has such a twist. For what started as a me watching it because there was nothing else on and ending in me shell shocked for days.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 July 2021,10/10,"One of the best feminist/humanist movies/statements.Please watch and THINK""It is never a man's fault"", right? Not even for wars, poverty, rape, femicide, ecological catastrophy, even for Patriarchy itself..."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 March 2021,10/10,"I love dark comedy...but this was surprising, elegantly scripted and Carry Mulligan gives one hell of a performance.
Love love loved it!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 November 2021,7/10,Good flick but the ending is obviously adopted from the play - and the movie - Karinca Kapani (Ant Trap) by Cüneyt Uzunlar. I encourage everyone to see it and be the judge.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,10/10,"Wow, what a movie. This was a harrowing review of privileged rich white men who think the rules don't apply to them and lack any moral fibre to know right from wrong. Women are merely at their disposal rather than sentient beings. Carey Mulligan gives a wonderful performance. We need to educate the next generation of boys and have these discussions early so that tomorrow's men don't repeat the men of today's mistakes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 August 2021,9/10,"The exquisite casts and detailed depictions were wonderful, and I felt it was a lean work. The heroine's kindness and sharpness made me feel sad and be pierced."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 July 2021,10/10,Powerful topic to discuss. The ending was a total shock. All the casting defys expectation and worked well.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,10/10,"Above all else....as a female who attended college and saw and experienced and lived this....for me it was a picture that was a simple glimpse into some females realities. Often one that is compartmentalized and can be a life long haunting.If one male college graduate married with daughters sees this film and thinks back to a moment in their college years when this was just a fun time, boys being boys...I hope they think of their daughters in college. This film to me was a very succinct glimpse of my reality...and obviously many, many others.Don't over analyze it...just watch it...you may have daughters, sisters, nieces and friends that carry life long memories like this around with them. Something they will not talk about or address, they just carry that moment way back in their mind for their whole lives."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 May 2021,1/10,"Plastic plot, paper characters, soap opera acting, corny lines and super annoying dance music... This is not even a film, it's more like a cheap TV show combined with a teenage/college movie. Terribly overrated trash."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 February 2021,4/10,"Nothing that it tries to point out hasnt been discussed the las couple of years and in better ways. It doesnt bring anything new to the discussion on rape culture, neither gives it at least a good movie trying to. the characters are so shallow that the emotions i feel about them are thanks mostly to the real world than to what is constructed in the movie. Cassie doesnt go too far either, she doesnt use violence for revenge, but neither anything else. Just some flat moral teachings, that arent even given an outstanding dialogue. I could have forgiven all the plotholes was it trying to go somewhere else, leaving you feeling some strong feelings with powerful metaphors in the acting and scenery, but it just did get anywhere."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 October 2021,1/10,"This was a horrifying and demented film billed by HBO as a comedy. There is NOTHING funny about rape, suicide, or mental illness. As a survivor of sexual assault, I thought this film would be helpful or encouraging. It is NOT."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,"I record short films and my goal is to do a feature film! But! After watching this movie script develop, I just want to quit and do something else! It's just! Too good! I feel like a little fish in an ocean. Great teaching, great acting, WHAT A SCRIPT. Great job on this movie, I was not expecting it base on the graphic design cover. But I was wrong, congrats to the director! For the amazing overall. A MUST WATCH!!!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 January 2021,,"I applause to Emerald Lilly Fennell (born 1 October 1985) Great work! Thank you!
And of course how it is possible not to fall in love with one of the most beautiful and very talented actress Carey Mulligan.
I think since Me too movement happened it is one of the top movies. Deep, sarcastic, funny, sexy and painful story. The story which was always left behind.
So glad to see that younger generations will be able watch this movie and learn something, hopefully to make changes.
because of the ending this movie left my heart broken, but seems that what it means to watch a good movie.Again, Thank you Emerald Lilly Fennell for your great work and lets not forget Margot Robbie being one of the Producers. Just great gift to all of us for 2021.
Thank you and I would highly recommend to watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 March 2021,9/10,"...sad.
Carey Mulligan's performance is incredible."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,9/10,"This movie was extremely good and uncomfortable. Men are driven by their hormones to a crazy extent when younger. Some men will understand the trauma women can feel from such an event later in life. Many never will ""get it"". Although most would get understand PTSD from a war buddy. If men were to understand deeply at a young age the trauma that is caused all the time from such events most would think twice and interrupt an event that the film portrays in such a witty and uncomfortable manner."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 November 2021,1/10,So the one that rapes her kills her . This movie was good until the ending. Horrible ending. She didn't know she would be murdered? Sending future texts. Okay I'm dead and before I die I'm sending all these texts and letters . This is the worst film making ever for an ending. I'm dead and now you are going to get yours! So dumb. So stupid. I know who the Director is so I'm good.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 May 2021,6/10,The message behind the movie was good only the movie would have been a lot better if it were a bit more violent so that the message comes in better and leaves a better impression.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,I loved this movie.Carey did such a great job. I loved the script. The end had me out of my seat and first pumping in the air.The soundtrack was fabulous. There are very few soundtracks I can say I loved just as much as the movie. Promising Young Woman is certainly one.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 January 2021,10/10,"Takes the premise of toxic masculine rape culture and handles it with savage intelligence. Most movies would put a massive gun or a SAW like revenge plot in the hands of the protagonist/antagonist but this was so much cleverer, more subtle and ultimately more brutal. A real career peak, a tour-de-force performance from Carey Mulligan in a movie that subverts a standard revenge movie trope and makes it realistic, intelligent and vicious. Movie of 2021 already. This year's Joker and then some."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 May 2021,9/10,"The plot like any murder mystery , holds on to your attention till the last moment. You'll start to realize that what you thought about vindictive revenge have many levels. You will be introduced to all of them."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 March 2021,10/10,Her performance was touchingand outstanding. The best movie lately.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,9/10,Completely different from any movie out right now. MUST WATCH!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 February 2021,9/10,"This movie is great. Dark and gripping. I have no idea why there are some less than 6 reviews on here, but clearly the subject matter made some people uncomfortable. It's not an easy topic for sure. Loved how the director used color and other symbolism in this film too. Just watch it. You will not be disappointed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 August 2021,9/10,"My first review. Just had to say something about this amazing movie. IMHO, it's up there with Silence of the Lambs. So, maybe not for everybody. And I'll admit, I'm a big Carey Mulligan fan. All of the other positive reviews are valid. If you're looking for a really good movie, watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 December 2020,10/10,"This movie deserve some recognition it's game changing masterpiece and the cast is great, visually pleasing but the ending kind of I'm not usually satisfied. In conclusion the movie is Dynamite Carey Mulligan one of her best performance she deserve recognition and Emerald Fennel too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,6/10,"I needed to remind myself of the movies dark humor and fantasy elements a few times so I did not nitpick the small things. Some moments will be empowering for many viewers but I had a few too many times where I struggled to take things seriously (even considering the topic). There are some very tough and real moments for characters here but can be washed out by some of the (dark) comedic elements that parody the situation. The subject matter just tends to put me in a more serious mood. Along with some of the actions of Cassie, a joke, snarky dialogue or revenge plan would suck out the atmosphere for me.It was in those moments I had to remind myself that this movie is what many women would wish they would do or say. How they would approach bs justifications around terrible acts. Just like 80s macho male action stars, the more these characters progress, the more ridiculous it becomes. Almost seemed that there needed to be a revenge montage somewhere...But thats its goal and it doesn't mean its not entertaining either wayPros: Carey Mulligan (8/10), overall visual style (7/10)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 April 2021,10/10,Outstanding Film.Clever and enjoyable yet also relatableReally made me think about the fact you never know what's going on behind someone's smile.Shocking but great ending.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 December 2020,10/10,"Promising Young Woman succeeds at being a thriller, it succeeds at being a comedy - it's devilishly entertaining - but it's also deadly serious heartbreaking.At its core it's about a girl - and I'm deliberately choosing to say 'girl' instead of 'woman' - who's been hurt, badly, and can't find a way out. She's looking for some kind of salvation, some way to make things right, but any time she comes close to finding it it's taken away from her.And I say girl because the situation is not allowing her to be a woman, to be whole. It's stunting her and causing her to lose herself, to ultimately only be able to feel small and hurt and scared, like an innocent child exposed to a cruel world.As it turns out, the film ends the only way it could, and I left wishing I had cried even more than I did at the ending, but then there were laughs and smiles too.The film walks a tightrope and it's possible that for some viewers the tone won't be calibrated quite right, which I say only because I don't want to be so presumptuous as to think everyone is like me. But if this film doesn't move you deeply, in some way or another, you may be dead inside.Essential viewing for everyone. Thank you, Emerald Fennell, Carey Mulligan, and everyone involved in the making of this film. It will be remembered and treasured for years and years to come."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 January 2021,10/10,"It doesn't fall in cliches, everything is kept original and novel, this movie is striking from the start till the end, I am calling it a draw with Another Round as the movies I enjoyed the most from the last couple of months!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,4/10,I'll admit the movie is filled with oh sh** moments. It brings rare real world events into play but feels like a let down in some moments. From looking at the trailer I had thought that there would be more horrid twists to what seems to be a psychotic chick looking for revenge. To finally watching it and expecting what I think and would happen into a pipe dream. I will also admit it does leave you questioning. If you're expecting any type of bloodshed from what you think might happen in the trailer this movie isn't for you.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,I knew I was going to like the movie before even watched it. The cast alone was amazing. The writing was really good and the shots were eye catching. I loved the the idea of the plot but the execution was better then I could have hoped for.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 February 2021,10/10,You won't be disappointed. Unpredictable script and well acted.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,10/10,"To have a movie about something so dark not actively show sexual assault scenes the way so many others do for shock value was refreshing. The lack of one-dimensional stereotyping and vilifying made this story actually feel realistic. All the way to the end this movie avoided falling into terrible, overdone tropes. The fact that they cast Laverne Cox with no mention of her being trans should be the bare minimum, but it NEVER happens and I am going to see this movie again because it is everything we need and more to move past the stale bs we get from so many overhyped directors. My favourite movie of all time EASILY."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 January 2021,10/10,"I like it, it's really cool, it is an artisic creation"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,4/10,"Stylish, witty and gripping for 45 mins then plot starts to drag and cinematography sharpness loses its edge.Dreadful ending. Lazy, rushed and clumsy. This is not how her character would behave, so it lacked plausibility. Felt a bit exhausting.Overall disappointed."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,10/10,"To learn destruction as antithetic to creation isn't just anomalous within fennell's electrifying equation, it's a consequential nightmare for the niceness, unmasked. It creates, it sustains, it nourishes every cell to be, for only in the manorial arson dwells the cry of liberty. But our cassie knows no end to this lordship, it has poisoned countless mxn, it's harshly beyond her ends. In search for peace she preys on poison, hence harbouring none but a numb heart.
Promising Young Womxn is not a complex pill, it's as formulaic as cassandra's principle - inebriated consent equals none at all. An oscar worthy mulligan doesnt slap this on our faces, she's gentle, plays by the rule, bides her time, crediting chances after chances to our nice guys. But once cognition consumes illness, it kneels only to fear. Everyday cassie alienates moral codes teaching that maybe when they're so drunk in bias, we all should. It's in that moment of alienation, her principle comes crystal clear - lurking underneath the bait of old school hollywood revenge is a continuous experiment on predatory conscience and warn you, it unsettles, unravels and shakes all mal conceptions of proximity to their roots, spitting into the cup of 'conquered consent'."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 January 2021,10/10,"This is a great movie. In this day and age with rehashed garbage, this is original. Excellent writing and directing! Kudos to Emerald for keeping my attention...not easy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 February 2021,10/10,"Loved it!!
Really is an eye opener, stuff like this happens all the time with women and people just look the other way... revenge is a dish best served cold;)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,10/10,"This movie explains the aftermath of taking advantage of women. Just because they drink doesn't make it right. I cried watching, men need to watch so they see the mistakes many have made. Very proud of Hollywood sticking up for women. Outstanding movie with ups and downs. Shocking ending. It's worth $20 bucks to rent. Go see it now. Reminds me of Joker/A Simple Favor. This is what happens to mental health when the people who get away with crimes aka the rich privilege men."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,9/10,"This is a brilliant movie about men. As a woman who loves them, I should know. It's also got one of the funniest scripts I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. Granted, the Raymond Carver death scene had me nonplussed, but hey, it's a movie. Watch and learn, struggling script writers, and hire Carrie Mulligan for the best results!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 February 2021,7/10,"In my opinion, the film could have been much better if it had followed one storyline. In this case, there were a lot of moments that were quite boring and did not help the development of the film. The main character's acting was GREAT!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,10/10,"Well shot, well acted, well directed. This movie teases you with comedy and intrigue, while cutting to the bone with reality. An awesome watch, and so poignant. As a woman, it brought tears... for me, not an easy thing to do. Watch it."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"Nice, it was a gripping movie from the very beginning"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,This is a fantastic movie. Lots of familiar faces - happy to see how many of them wanted to be a part of this movie!This movie starts off a little odd - you think you know where it's going - but then it gets SO much better than you can imagine.BTW - anyone who rated this movie any less than a 7 may need some mental health counseling.Kudos to Emerald Fennell!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 February 2021,7/10,"I loved the way this movie looked. I kept making remarks that the colors were my favorite. Pastels always do it for me so I loved seeing that throughout the movie. I loved the acting, everyone was wonderful (especially Carey Mulligan). I thought the shifts in tone were great and kept you guessing throughout. I definitely think the 1st part of the movie was my least favorite and then once it sets the stage and gets going I enjoyed it much more. I think this concept of revenge has been done better in other movies but I don't want to spoil it. I think it's worth watching but wouldn't call it Oscar worthy (unless it's for best actress!) and I won't be giving it repeated viewings. The uncomfortable feelings you get are very real and something that most women have felt at some point in their lives. I also enjoyed that all types of people were addressed in regards to the problem: younger women, older women, older men, younger men, even parents. It's a broad scope of the problems that accusers face. If you're skeptical I would give it a chance."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 February 2021,1/10,"The description paired with this movie avoids a very particular and extremely sensitive topic. There should be mention in the description and warnings that this is a high trigger movie. The storyline is rape and rape-revenge that is it.
For someone to go in and watch this having completely different expecrations and being confronted with what was shown could be incredibly unsettling.
Although it highlights the sad reality for many, I would not recommend this to anyone.
Not just for the lack of appropriate warnings, but the casting for characters and lack of age awareness-was all over the place. Definitely a movie that shouldn't have made it to screen."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 February 2021,3/10,"Not a big fan of Carey Mulligan. This movie could have picked a way more enticing woman for this particular role. With that said, I still tried to enjoy the movie for what it was suppose to portray which was revenge. However, luring men from bars, pretending to be beyond wasted so they could take advantage was not what I had in mind at all. It's a setup more or less, yes, for a good cause.In my opinion, the movie, Vigilante, was well directed, produced, great cast and story plot. Olivia Wilde was significantly more interesting in her role and executed true revenge flawlessly. If you want a true revenge thriller and have seen it yet, I suggest you add to your watchlist ;)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 April 2021,5/10,"I can't say that it is a bad movie. I watched it without knowing anything about it, so I had no expectations while watching it. But honestly most of the time it felt like nothing happens. And it definitely doesn't deserve to be titled as a thriller, because IT IS NOT. If you are bored and want to watch a movie that isn't engaging, that's it. But if you want something interesting and funlook for something else."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,10/10,I couldn't put in words how much i loved the movie it shows the reality of what women go through the whole movie from start to finish catches you.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 February 2021,6/10,It was an interesting movie and the acting was good. I was not a fan of the ending. I think it was a bad miss in my opinion- kinda ruined the movie.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,13 February 2021,7/10,This was good.Fantastic Performance by Carey mulligan.She is a great actress and I think she is gonna win the oscar for this movie.There are several performances this year but I think😁😁😁😁😁
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 February 2021,10/10,"Dark funny and well written
not just some bad girl boss movie it has a good plot and well written characters"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 February 2021,10/10,"This movie was easily one of the best I've seen in the last decade. It is so brutally honest and verbalizes things I've never been able to discuss about unspoken micro-aggressions and continued violence against women...even by the ""nice"" guys. It frames things that are typically considered a ""grey area"" for many in such a clear and unflinching light. It is heartbreaking and as a woman will make you feel things you might not be prepared to visit. Truly magnificent."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,9/10,"The film was surprising, or not really if you think about it, fresh, interesting and disturbing"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 March 2021,8/10,I am glad I watched it. Beautiful storyline. I am saddened that she had to die but I guess that's the director's take.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 March 2021,10/10,This is a movie many need to watch. Maybe it will help us all move forward.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 March 2021,10/10,"I am amazed at the way the sensitive topic of sexual assault was dealt with, and with the way the story unfolded, keeping the viewer on their toes at all times. Just when you think you have the full story, more things come to light and more action happens. Loved how it was dark without being gruesome, violence was highly implied but definitely did not rely on it for shock value. Truly amazing casting/acting as well. Rooting for it at the Oscars."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,7/10,Did this turn into a comedy in the last half hour?

PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 March 2021,9/10,"Going into this movie I thought it was going to be mainly about man-hating, but it is not. This movie has impacted me in some way I cannot explain, and it talks about such a serious topic but it does not go overboard with anything. I loved Carey Mulligan in The Great Gatsby and I loved her portrayal of Cassie, because she did such an amazing job, bringing out such raw emotion, which made it easy to connect to the character. I find some of the lines to be a bit exaggerated, however that is the only thing I only sort of disliked. I enjoyed everything else; the music, the actors themselves, the plot; it was all golden. You should definitely watch this movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 March 2021,9/10,"Edge of my seat while I'm trying to guess what she'll do next. It's thrilling, with a message about a big problem in society. It really leaves you conflicted about how to feel in my opinion (in a positive way)."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,10/10,"I love how the storyline goes because at the ending i'd have never expected that. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. And i love how she took revenge on everyone, 10/10 would watch it again..<3."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 May 2021,9/10,"This movie got to me. I even thought several times at some scenes ""well, this must be the end of the movie"". There was more to tell, and that was necessary to.In the way you are taken along, as a viewer, in both the female and the male perspective is devastatingly good written and set on movie-screen.The movie has actors that are spot on, well balanced towards each other and, as a fact, i think this script is played pretty flawless, and never a ""well, this is not possible, this can only happen in movies"" moment. In several scenes the main character has unspoken words, the silence between the spoken words is striking wel, and therefore scary."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 March 2021,10/10,"Absolutely a home run movie: the important cultural message, the fully developed characters (contradicting personality quarks), witty dialogue, and ultimately, an unpredictable and intelligent script. There are too many amazing elements of this film to begin with: The concept of the so-called ""nice guy"", the important value of female relationships and how other women continue to maintain the status quo. The film points out the immoral and unethical spaces in between current laws, universally. I hope the main character's strength and self-sacrifice will inspire new laws to protect women. Spectacular performance by Carry Mulligan. Emerald offers a unique, yet highly relatable perspective from the modern women's point of view."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 April 2021,10/10,Yeah. Incredible. I hope gets oscar award. I hope. For women. I hope.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,10/10,"Excellent. Very cleverly made, with subtle examples of what crosses the line, both in terms of consent and harassment, throughout. Those leaving bad reviews are missing the point entirely; the film has a lot of hidden (and overt) messages. With regard to the ending, the feeling it evokes in divided watchers reflects reality... can anyone ever be completely satisfied with justice served and terms imposed once a crime has been committed? N. B. I watch a lot of films but never bother leaving reviews, so the fact I've taken the time to write one says a lot about how good this was."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 April 2021,8/10,It's a amazing and super And love to watch such type of movies.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,17 April 2021,10/10,So well presented. It highlights the blurred lines between perpetrators and enablers. Will stick with me for a long while.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 April 2021,9/10,"I went into this movie only seeing the trailer. I didn't have too much hope for it, expecting the show to push a message down your throat, rather than tell a compelling story, but I wanted it, becuase Bo Burnham was in it, and trusted he wouldn't be in anything so basic.Anyway, not knowing the plotline was a great help for me, as this movie provided twist after twist, and exceeded all expectations."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 May 2021,10/10,An amazing deep movie with an unpredictable end. Carey Mulligan played a very good role.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 May 2021,10/10,Incredible. The best movie I've seen in years and I watch a lot of movies. Everyone should go see this movie. It deserves all the support and recognition it can get.Important plot. Fantastic acting. Best soundtrack I've heard in a long time.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,10/10,"A wonderfully dark, comedic and telling tale which women will love and hopefully men will take note. It's not the usual saccharine film...particularly at the endMulligan is a great choice for this role and blends anger, frustration, vengeance as well as humour and fun perfectly.A telling tale of woe...brilliantly written and most highly recommended."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 August 2021,9/10,"An unflinching and flawless look at patriarchy. Incredible acting, phenomenal writing. A film that brilliantly defines the times we are living in, and one of the best I've ever seen. Carrie Mulligan is just perfect. I wish this movie got more PR outside of the 'most popular' around awards season. Kids in school should watch this."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 June 2021,4/10,"I just wish this movie did more. It seemed in the beginning that it would have a very great revenge plot. Instead, it turned out to be mundane and pretty predictable. The biggest twist was in the end when the main character meets her demise. The message is overt the whole movie. No one that participates in sexual assault is a ""nice guy"", many guys are creeps, and many do not see the seriousness in sexual assault. Also sexual assault is too easily swept under the rug. The message is brought home when Al who is ""so nice"" but ""made a mistake as a young man"" violently murders Mulligan's character. He's not a ""nice guy"". The writer doubles down on the message when Ryan, another ""nice guy"" does nothing to help during the rape because he was ""just a kid"" and then stands down when his lover disappears. Yet he knows exactly what happened to her and could have helped bring the criminals to justice but fails to do anything once again. He's also not a ""nice guy"". The film lacks complexity but I guess it is kept simple so that all viewers are able to fully grasp the message in it's entirety."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 June 2021,10/10,Promising Young Woman is a masterpiece with an amazing original script.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 July 2021,10/10,"As a victim of an incident similar to Nina Fisher, I have never seen something so accurately portrayed as what I watched in Promising Young Woman. It is heartfelt and shown so well and accurately. I truthfully wouldn't change a single thing about the entire movie. It is my longtime favorite movie and I encourage so many people to watch it. It is hard to watch. It is uncomfortable many times throughout. However, it is supposed to be that way; it is a raw movie of everything I have witnessed in my own life."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,14 July 2021,6/10,"Please stop giving oscars to ""politically correct"" movies.The acting is ok in this movie, the direction is also good and the cinematography as well.The story starts with an interesting mystery that makes you want to see more for about half the movie.Unfortunately, it all gets ruined by men stereotypes and an ending that didn't have any twists or anything, just what you'd expect it to be.Seriously, this movie wouldn't even get close to an Oscar if it wasn't all the political correctness involved.DO NOT WATCH."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 August 2021,10/10,"Immediatly after watching I cannot believed how great and emotional for me was this movie. Everything is phenomenal in this film great acting, writing and shocking bittersweet ending. Just watch it ASAP!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 July 2021,10/10,"This is a social commentary that needed saying. It's not a man hating movie full of women just to be trendy - once you watch it you'll see that there are good guys in it and those who redeem themselves. It is simply a commentary on a problem that does exist.Sexual assault is too often labelled as ""being taken advantage of"", rather than what it actually is - assault. Too often rape cases are dropped - stats show this. Often people think of rape as something that occurs down a dark alley when clearly the women ""asks for it"" by being alone at night. This movie addresses one of the more common type of assaults - ones that centre around alcohol and the lad culture.It's a brave take on a difficult subject that also entertains (albeit uncomfortably). Well worth the watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 July 2021,10/10,"This is an amazing film. It's so very real, the poppy, colourful aesthetic somehow intensifying the rawness. It's deeply uncomfortable and potent but also darkly humorous. I was laughing out loud despite myself at moments that were all too familiar. Not everyone is ready for this film, but drop your guard and let it get under your skin and it will be one of the best and most powerful movies you're likely to see."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,10 August 2021,7/10,"Great movie that holds your attention throughout , the ending was horrible though , just very disturbing , never saw that coming. The acting is superb and the story has great twists and turns."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 September 2021,9/10,This film has one of the most moving endings I have seen in a while. What begins as a promising young woman gone off the deep end turns out to be bright young med school drop out to correct a grave injustice. All I will say is you will either be weeping or cheering at the end.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 August 2021,10/10,"I loved the plot twists and original angle. The film did not disappoint, the script by Emerald Fennell is a gem, as was her masterful directing. The 'Best Screenplay' Oscar
was well deserved. I think we'll start to see more of these types of movies coming out."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 August 2021,10/10,"This is a stellar movie! It's smart, funny and wise, and probably should be shown to all first year college students, male and female, during freshman orientation.. and then again right before graduation. Wink wink."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,6 August 2021,9/10,"This movie is really nice to see.I didn't know what happend next in the movie and isn't predictable
The plot is realy nice and the ending too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 August 2021,,"I don't recommend this movie if you could get triggered by sexual assault, suicide and anything connected to it.I think it's irresponsible to show a misleading trailer and not warn about triggers in any way!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 September 2021,8/10,The inspiration for this film looks very much based on the Brett Kavanaugh accusations. Terrific story drawn from many real life situations that no doubt will inspire a lot of conversation about Male/Female perspective.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 October 2021,10/10,"This is one of the best movies I've watched in a while, I'm addicted to it. I've watched it three times in the spawn of 48 hours, I absolutely love it. The actors, the clothing, the storyline, the plots, the ending, everything blew me away. It left me with so many emotions I may need a new therapist appointment soon."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 October 2021,1/10,Frozen performances from everyone but the leading lady. Most all of them seemed like B actors. Plot didn't make any sense and had no grab at all. I know what they were trying to do but it didn't end up making a film worth watching.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 October 2021,9/10,"I think ""older"" women may relate to this more. Men have a hard time watching.Clearly, not without faults but enough is understood before the movie gets going that we know what we are dealing with. Men (smh)"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 November 2021,3/10,"To begin with, the Director must be a big fan of Clint Eastwood since this film rips off MFA (2017) starring Francesca Eastwood, Clint's daughter and Sudden Impact (1983) his fourth Dirty Harry film and the far superior of these three movies.It was shocking to learn that this film won an Academy Award for writing. The opening dialogue is literally straight out of the feminist ""this is how men speak"" manual which immediately tells you what kind of film you're in for. It feels like the writer came up with it by reading Twitter posts.The boss at the coffee shop where Cassandra works apparently doesn't care that she insults and drives away customers because I'm sure small indie coffee shops are just rolling in cash and can risk getting terrible reviews on social media.Bo Burnham's character plays a handsome pediatric surgeon. You would think a person with a job like that would be have to fight off women and you'd have to think he was full of confidence in order to cut open children and operate on them. And since it's referenced that several children have died on his table (yikes!) he would be good at having very serious conversations with people, But nope, here he's a shy awkward goofball who only has eyes for an older, moderately attractive underachiever who lives with her parents no matter how abusive toward him and no matter how odd her behavior and he gets tongue tied every time he tries to pay her even a simple compliment.BTW Burnham is a funny comedian in real life. Maybe they should have let him write the jokes that they were supposedly laughing at during the date scenes rather what they wrote.Oh, did I mention that Cassandra and her friend were the best in their class at medical school? Because of course they were. In the 2020s every female character is always the best at whatever they do.There's a lawyer in the film who is racked with guilt for pressuring woman to drop their rape lawsuits by finding compromising pictures of them. I guess rape shield laws don't exist in this universe. And of course there's no real explanation as to why after doing it for years he now regrets it but he randomly becomes very important to the plot.While Cassie's Bete Noire is a guy named Al Monroe, in the last 10 minutes of the film, some rando named Joe gets name dropped a comical amount of times as an instigator.And speaking of comedy, a black comedy is one that mines humor from a dark premise. It's not dropping a silly montage in a film about rape. But writing a dark comedy requires some effort and it's clear that effort was not made.And where is Cassie getting the money to do any of the things she does? Yes, she doesn't pay rent but how much does she earn working at a a tiny, independent coffee shop? Apparently enough to hire a man to commit a violent felony that would put his own freedom at risk.In summary, the dialogue is little more than hollow polemics, most characters are one dimensional and their actions are not even consistent with their positions in life, the story is predictable, and the film rips off several other films.If you like this kind of female revenge story watch The Maid (2020) or try to track down the 1987 Canadian thriller Positive I. D. instead."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 April 2021,9/10,"This movie dramatizes the frustrations victims experience too often, ""We can't ruin a young man's life because of an allegation,"" ""We were just kids,"" ""Boys will be boys,"" ""She shouldn't have gotten drunk."" What is the line between justice and revenge, and how far would you go in a quest for justice/revenge? Great acting and (at least) 2 great plot twists kept me fully engaged. Really deserved the Oscar it won for best screenplay."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 February 2021,5/10,"If you believe the hate can be so intense that you even sacrifise your life. If you believe that mistakes in college can't be unforgiven.
Plot and story lines - yes. Realistic? Not really."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,4/10,"The script, dialogue and dramatic progress is very poor. The work of a debutant, badly advised by the production team.The first hour feels extremely long, unfocused, uninteresting and stumbling in different directions. A frustrating experience.Carey Mulligan is interesting in a - for her - quite unusual role - but it doesn't save the movie - it only saves it from being a disaster and a complete waste of time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 June 2021,10/10,I wish I could thank the director personally for this movie. Thank you for this! It means something.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 May 2021,10/10,"It's very telling that so many weak men are commenting with their egos bruised. If you feel attacked by the themes in this movie you should take a moment to truly understand why. If you're only route to a connection with another human is manipulation and assault, perhaps a decent society isn't for you. Bo Burnham was great and the perfect level of charming to fool us all, and Carey Mulligan was an exceptional lead. Essential viewing for all."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 August 2021,8/10,Really enjoyed the movie. Until the endS that left me with mixed feelings. It's the only reason I gave it an 8 and not a 10.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 March 2021,10/10,"Checks all my boxes as to what a really good movie is all about. Story line cohesive, acting was stunning, subject matter so important. The ending was perfect. I don't think I'll forget this one for a long time."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,"I absolutely love this film. Definitely in my top 5. I adore Carey Mulligan & her portrayal of Cassandra Thomas was perfect in my opinion. The whole aesthetic of the film was lovely. This is most definitely a wonderful #MeToo revenge film. (yes, there could be a trigger warning, but I feel if you go to a film like this, you know what you're in for.) It's a great conversation piece & something that sticks with you after. I feel I've waited for something like this since 2013, I wish Cassie was my best friend...I also wish some things near the ending were a bit different, but I get what Emerald Fennell was doing when she wrote the film. She was going for a more realistic approach & it works. Looking forward to purchasing the blu-ray. I'm so happy I was able to see this in theaters as I'm happy to support the cast & crew who made this flick. My husband enjoyed it too."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 January 2021,10/10,"I don't write reviews often but this movie highlights a problem which is so normalized in our society, it's painful. It really is painful how many young girls and women lives are going down in the garbage bin just because men refuse to control their primal urges. The problem with rape is so huge and neglected, the offenders even after sentence rarely serve jail time, they usually receive just a slap on the wrist meanwhile the whole life and the future of the girl is shattered. This is why women don't report. We know justice system will fail us and we will pay huge tall, being mocked and blamed for our own suffering. Because of all this rape is much bigger pandemic than all. I don't know a woman who was never raped, even if she states this never happened each one of us has stories of ""bad sex"", ""drunken mistake"", ""being young mistake"", ""party mistake"" etc. It's not a mistake it was rape, women are simply in denial. Many people dislike the ending but I think it's brilliant - men are much more stronger and encouraged to get stronger unlike us. No matter how carefully females try to plan and avoid bad situations men's strength and enormous sexual appetite force us in the place of being their victims. All the cliche replicas are used on the write place to point out exactly what nonsense we face all the time. It was also smart to point out how many women are also so brainwashed by patriarchy they reject and deny the reality with the narrative ""boys will be boys"", ""her word against his word"" and tend to see monstrosity only if it happens to them or to a person they love. A wonderful movie which had to be made long ago, so our society can finally open its eyes for the magnitude of this injustice."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 March 2021,10/10,"This film is astonishing and it really stays with you. Seeing this after the recent tragic events in London cuts deep. This film is very important go see it, share it with your friends. It can be a real eye opener for so many people. Best film of the year deserves all the attention and I hope it gets a well deserved Oscar."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,10/10,"Completely engaged throughout the film, what a fresh take on revenge and from a focused perspective. The ending was absolutely outstanding. I suspect that the reason so many are dissatisfied by the ending is because it isnt the traditional unscathed hero's ending but it is a realistic ending and wholly pushes forward the message the film is trying to make. I dont think any other ending could have conveyed those messages better. I did not expect to like this film as much as I did, this is an easy 10/10. Its nice to watch something genuine and uniquely creative."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 January 2021,10/10,Not what I expected! Definitely my favorite film of 2020! The score added a great tone to the film which gave me goosebumps and tears (both happy and sad). Great revenge movie with unexpected elements! A must watch for loyal friends.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 October 2021,3/10,"Even though the message is clear and admirable, the movie itself is cheezy. There is absolutely no point in writing a long review. It is BAD. 7.5 rating must be a mistake."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 October 2021,7/10,I watched this film with interest and could see what it was trying to portray. I feel it would have been better as a series with the characters explored more deeply.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,8 May 2021,10/10,"I was afraid the ending would be a bummer, but it turned out awesome!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,10/10,"This movie added so much for my morals, I now support women everywhere around the world.Thank you for everyone who worked on it.JUST KIDDING, WORST MOVIE I EVER WATCHED."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 November 2021,9/10,"I remember how freaked out men were after watching Fatal Attraction, since violence against women persists, here is another cautionary tale. Much less ambiguity in this end.... but another brutal fight with the avenger paying with HER life."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 February 2021,8/10,I really love/hate watching this movie. Is a great movie. So good that I feel proud of how my beautiful father raised me. And I also feel disgusting about being a man. It was awful watching it. But I loved I have watched it.The director made such a wonderful job of making the protagonist the only character that doesn't appeared in the movie ( Nina ).
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,27 March 2021,6/10,"This movie shouldn't be categorized as comedy, it wasn't even a bit close to comedy, dark comedy or what so ever kind of comedy. People smiling in some scenes don't make a movie to be a comedy."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,25 January 2021,10/10,"As a huge fan of Hard candy I was THRILLED to see another film taking on a revenge story through psychology war fare and the woman's perspective. The acting was spot on, the direction was clever and insightful. If your looking for a slice them up Old Boy revenge story, this won't be for you but if you are interested in the long term effects of trauma and how it can be consuming mentally then you'll love it! The soundtrack is fantastic and completely lends itself to the narrative. Also! I loved that you never saw the violence, it is all about seeing it through the storytelling and the actors reactions. This was a fantastic film!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 June 2021,5/10,The first part of the movie is great. All characters involved are put in their place nicely...creates so much potential and expectation about what is about to happen..but afterwards the movie seemed really rushed to hit the screens.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 February 2021,10/10,"As a female, I went in expecting a sexy revenge tale for all of womankind.
Instead, I experienced one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
Fresh, upbeat, exquisite writing and filmography reminiscent of Wes Anderson's, but the strawberry vodka version.
Many men in the theater scoffed and some left, maybe they thought it was an inaccurate representation.. it wasn't. The conversations and attitude portrayed felt so real and I've been victim to as well..
Twists rarely shock me but I had an immediate pit in my stomach.
Carey Mulligans performance as a lead was incredible. I felt her pain and turmoil as she sough the right choices.
I watched Bo Burnham and continue to be a fan of his more mature roles. He truly portatyed a convincing Prince Charming.
Together, their chemistry was that of a Lumineers music video.
Well done. Highly recommended."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 June 2021,9/10,I really enjoyed this movie. Cassie loved her friend so much that she was willing to do anything to get justice. Now that's love!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 October 2021,10/10,"I came across this on TikTok of all places and thought I'd give it a go.I'm glad I did, though I went through so many emotions whilst watching it which really surprised me.It's a tale of a true friendship and the revengeful search for the truth. Any woman watching this will be filled with horror at how prevalent a story this is and by the end filled with such sadness at the methods taken to get to the truth.The acting is superb and the storyline really clever. Well worth a watch, though I imagine not many men will come out of it without thinking about it. At least I hope so."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 November 2021,1/10,The issue may be important. For me it doesn't legitimate this movie. The dealing with the topic was one-dimensional or onesided. Sort of movie where the viewer doesn't need to think her-/himself. Therefore boring and hard to watch.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 December 2020,10/10,"My favourite of the year. A wonderfully paced revenge story, full of tension but also humour and charm.Carey Mulligan is great as the silently menacing stroke sympathetic antihero, but Bo Burnham should get best supporting actor nominations for his performance as Ryan.A must see."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 January 2021,7/10,"Great acting, beautiful colours, but why kill her off? So many alternative endings could have made this movie a 10. Makes me think we haven't moved out of the 80's."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 November 2021,5/10,"Sloppy and superficial directing, bad acting allover (with the exception of Mulligan), a real shame. If you havent thought/heard of sexism before, then maybe you'll learn something but if you didnt come to this world yesterday, then you can spend your time watching something more fulfilling."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,9/10,"Add this brilliant movie, suspenseful to the end, to your list of must see movies."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,21 January 2021,3/10,"This movie has everything you look for in a great revenge movie, except for a satisfying ending that instead manages to rip you out of the movie and smack you in the face all for the benefit of ""subverting your expectations"". Now subverting your expectation is a good tactic in movies and can often pay off well but it only works if it makes sense to the viewer. This made no sense and left a bad taste in my mouth after the movie that I could not wash out for hours. Would recommend you not waste your time or money watching this let down of a movie."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 May 2021,10/10,"Is that a real movie in 2020 idont believe that they ever provide in this century movie like that
Every thing in the movie was de-wait for it delatful.I will watch all the movies from this writer, don't know his name before i write this review."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,10/10,"This was an amazing movie that really brings to light issues women face daily. It is thought provoking and I really loved the fact that the love interest doesn't work out, so many movies seem to have a man that comes to save the day- it wasn't the ending I wanted but man was it ever what I needed to see. Highly recommend seeing this"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 January 2021,10/10,"So many feels....the last ten minutes of the movie put a knife in my heart and twisted the blade! Watch this movie, now!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,23 January 2021,9/10,"Fantabulous acting, a plot worthy of a after thought.
Give it a watch!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 February 2020,10/10,"Caught this at Sundance and absolutely loved it. Not sure why it's getting negative reviews on here. No, it's not going to be the ending that some would want, but it's truly brilliant."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,4/10,"Thank you to the actors. If this was purely satirical then okay, it was average. However, it tried to demonstrate meaning and to be honest it wasn't worth it. To the people that plan to use this message movie as a movement, please don't."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 June 2021,,"The movie does a great job at breaking the expectations of what a rapist looks like for most people in society. First, in the club you see two douchebags talking about how the woman's ""asking for it"" by being too drunk, but Mr Nice Guy saves her by getting her a cab, only to make a detour back to his place. Then Bo Burnham, who made me believe for a hot second that this was a nice romantic comedy with a happy ending, shows that if you see your bros doing something and don't stand up for what's right, you're trash like them. Then Al (Chris Lowell) comes in wearing khakis pants and saying he actually doesn't want to do anything with the stripper, and looking like a normal, ""good guy"" you see around all the time, decides that he'd rather commit murder than be held accountable by atrocities done to possibly multiple women because ""he was just a kid"" and ""did nothing wrong"". Overall good movie, very entertaining, with a satisfying twist at the end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,31 January 2021,9/10,"This movie made me love Bo Burnham while simultaneously hating his character. There was enough humor in the movie to cut the tension from the serious theme. I screamed at the TV constantly, sometimes in anger and sometimes in pure adoration for the main character. I love this movie and it was a 10/10, but the soundtrack missed its mark. I was lost when ""It's raining men"" started playing, despite this I was very happy with this movie and it's message. The fact that all these lovable men played horrible people just made it so much better."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,10/10,This film is the best film I have seen in a long long time! Carrie Mulligan is the absolute queen!!!
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 May 2021,10/10,"I have just walked out of the movie theatres, and I am very angry, but mostly with the wold we live in. The movies was great."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 March 2021,10/10,"It's amazing story telling. So real, like life . Some great acting here with a tough subject matter."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"While a little confusing at times in terms of pace and tone, it comes full circle in the end in a very satisfying way - overall I would call this truly one for the ages."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 October 2021,10/10,"""This did what arts supposed to do, and I didn't like it. I mean, it was a masterpiece, a true work of art, but I will never watch it again. I don't have the emotional vitality to do that again. I need a stiff drink, and a good cry."" - Casey BrownIt was a VERY uncomfortable movie, but...
It's needed.Watch this.Stomach this.And you will understand why we are upset.You will understand the true terror a person can feel.Let yourself FEEL uncomfortable.Because that will strengthen your resolve and you will realize why.Why we fight.Why we believe.And why we have to be so cautious all the time
I'm not saying it's just men either.This can also be women.It's unacceptable.Truly monstrous.And until we see the injustice as it is, we will never heal."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,10/10,"As a male in his 30's, this movie is brilliant. A bold, powerful and necessary commentary on society today. If you liked ""Joker"" this movie will make you feel the same way, or even stronger. Carey Mulligan is outstanding!As a passionate moviegoer, I must say this is one of the greatest films of the past 10 years."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,10/10,"Be prepared to question your own integrity. A gritty, desperate reminder of the clandestine relationships we all hold in terms of sexual exploitation of the female. This is an education for the sexes. Watch. Learn. Change the narrative.. powerful in its reflection of truth in this age we live in. Watch. Learn. Change the narrative!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 June 2021,9/10,"Thought this was very good, not trying to be too clever or too over the top in terms of its messaging. Saw in here behaviour I've seen in the real world and that's perhaps why it doesn't appeal to everyone, to true to the everyday which makes people uncomfortable.Thought Carey was excellent, amazing actor."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,"I love the contrast between the colors from the night/day scenes which could be symbolic in many ways. At night it's dangerous and chilling comparing to during the day where everything is in pastel, a perfect white girl fantasy color pallette.Ryan's development, i'm shocked by it. I really thought the film was making him an example of the type of guy that treats women right and that every girl should date.
Oh was I naive!
It was a stone cold move to destroy the last nice male charactor in the film showing us he's just as selfish and cowardly.Cassie's death is what elevates this film, if she had just succeed in the revenge I wouldn't be up at 2am writing this, I would be asleep satisfied.
We're usually numb seeing people dying in films, but to see the protagonist screaming and shriking under the pillow with giant baby ""Chad"" kneeling on her head plus the slow zoom was truly traumatizing.Promising Young Woman will be haunting me for a while. 10/10"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 January 2021,10/10,"This movie blew me away.
I went through basically the entire range of emotions before the movie was even over. It hit on everything that's made me so angry for such a long time. It was a vessel of that rage and it felt so good to see it depicted. More than that though, it felt like a story about the deep love we have for our friends.
The message was amazing in my opinion.....and the ending was perfect!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 March 2021,10/10,"Promising Young Woman should win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay because that is what it is. There is no other movie like it. It's clever, funny, suspenseful, violent. One surprise after another. All wrapped up in a cautionary tale that every incoming college freshman or 18 year old should watch."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 October 2021,5/10,"Boy, if you didn't know that females hold onto grudges much longer and tighter than anyone should, you do after watching this lesson in getting over it. The actors did great, but the writing and plot are very middle school. The lady dies trying to dig up the past. On purpose. That's it, save yourself almost two hours of screaming ""that's just one kind of guy, the kind that goes to college and has something to prove"" at your TV."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,4 October 2021,10/10,It is a VERY dark movie but so worth it. I almost stopped watching at the one hour mark but then it turned and I was glued! May he too dark for some people.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,5 June 2021,10/10,This is an amazing film with an amazing storyline and plot.Haven't seen a movie like this in quite sometime.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 October 2020,10/10,"Saw this at Sundance. Thought it was witty, smart, amazing writing and brilliant acting. So excited to see this again in theaters. So confused at the low rating. Truly a powerful and strong film"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 April 2021,10/10,"Brett Kavanaugh, and so many others like him. I actually was sick at my stomach watching them. Even the ending didn't ease the pain. Powerful, raw, sadly realistic."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 January 2021,9/10,"This film is excellent and slow but worth the pay off. If you've seen 'Very Bad Things' (90's naughty bro film, pre-Hangover era) then you can imagine if the gender exploitation was in the woman's favor. The on-screen text chapter points aren't needed but the final 'cross-off' on 1111 was relatable and satisfying. Mulligans performance made the film. She exhibits a woman too determined to even explain. I love that. Hopefully she'll get recognition for this strong performance. I'm now convinced more incredible work is coming from female writer/director Emerald Fennell. Hell yes."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 January 2021,10/10,I think its about time a story turns the tables on so-called innocent youthful aggression. So how do you feel when you're not in control? How do you justify complacency? This movie is a wonderful slap in the face
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 June 2021,10/10,"I've watched this four times now and absolutely love it. It's sad, romantic, funny and breathtakingly well made. The casting and acting is spot on and a great soundtrack to boot."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,19 March 2021,10/10,"Just go see it with your mind open. Don't think about your own life, your ego or status. Let your guard down and take in the visually stunning genre glitch of a film Promising Young Woman is. Let it show you the Other Side.It can help you understand so much. It can be painful, at first, but it allows you to have meaningful discussions with your friends. It's not about you. It's about the other 50% of the world's population that hadn't really had a voice before.And what an terrifying, awesome voice it is. And only too justified."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 June 2021,10/10,"Every man should watch this film.Realistic and gritty, I loved it.The cast were fantastic."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 March 2021,7/10,"After the previews, the plot was a bit different than expected. There were a couple plot twists; especially in the end."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,16 May 2021,9/10,"Wow, I loved this movie. The outrage from both men AND women just proves the entire point of this movie and shows just how important the message is. America is such a right-leaning country and it SHOWS."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,18 April 2021,10/10,I was waiting my hole life to watch this. Amazing cast and best final ever. For a moment u think your watching a romantic comedy and then revenche hit u in the face.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,1 July 2021,10/10,I can't understand why some people have given this a low review. Simplistic and well thought out. Excellent acting but extremely thought provoking.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 April 2021,10/10,"Original and makes you think. What more do you want from a movie? :)Having worked in a videostore for a couple of years I like movies that can still suprise me, as few do nowadays."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 August 2021,8/10,"I'm conflicted about how I feel after finishing this. I was keen to watch it after seeing the trailer and it's the first time I've paid for a movie on YouTube.I think the only disappointing part was the ending, although I didn't think it was predictable. I don't know if someone would get away with doing what she did to that many men for that long but everything else seemed realistic enough, the men acting in the most predictable way. I feel like she should have lived but that wouldn't be realistic, would it? I was waiting she would 'wake up' and move. Wishful thinking."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,11 February 2021,9/10,This is a film of its own. I've never seen a film with this plot and the outcome is great. It left me with a very uncomfortable feeling and that's make this film so good
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,20 May 2021,10/10,"Important theme approached honestly and in a real way. Mulligan's performance is phenomenal and the end, although questionable to some spectators, in my opinion is wonderful. It's what would happen in real life. It's definitely a movie that makes you think and reflect. And may the rape culture be abolished once and for all!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 February 2021,10/10,"There are enough people who will never understand the power this film has. Those people need a reality check if they watch the whole thing and feel nothing. (See all the negative reviews) This movie is ""unfortunately"" so relatable for some that you can't help but fall in love with all that Carey stands for. You want to be her. You want her strength and all she embraces. This movie not only made me laugh out loud but also break out into tears. It was an emotional rollercoaster. It offered more than what I was expecting to get and still left and impact. The impact was neither good or bad. But I felt it. For the naive... This is real... This happens... For those that got it, you are loved and respected."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,12 October 2021,9/10,"This movie has to be seen! Not only does it have an important message, it also has great writing, acting, photography, music, comedic & thriller timing but is also colorful and exciting to watch! I watched it 2 times in a row immediately!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 September 2021,10/10,"I'll admit, there were some cheesy parts in this movie. BUT, this movie felt too real. I'm glad too say that I never let myself get into any of these situations, but I'm afraid that I may know people that may have taken things too far? Shout out to Bo Burnham for an exceptional job!"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,7 May 2021,10/10,Bitter sweet film. Amazing story line and great leading lady. A must watch for men and women.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,22 January 2021,10/10,"Sometimes revenge is something hard to depict, but this movie is brilliant. You understand the main charater's feelings and relate with them. It makes you get angry, upset and outraged. The theme is even harder write in a good way, but don't orry, you won't be disappointed.
It's an important movie and theme, more people need to see this. I really hope this changes something inside everyone that watched, you don't need to feel a deep connection or whatnot, but think about it.
After finishing it, I was left without words for some minutes, it's truly astounding. A few people didn't like the ending, but you have to experience it for yourself. It's brutal and shocking, but also necessary. It's far rom being bad."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,24 January 2021,10/10,"Honestly I have never written an IMDB review but this film blew me away and I felt like it deserved it.Females and males go see it. And if it makes you uncomfortable take some time to think about the world, your life and you.Amazing work and amazing film."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,15 February 2021,9/10,"This film almost lost me midway thru. Thought it was turning into a stupid romance. Stick with it tho, the final act was amazing. This film rocks"
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,30 June 2021,5/10,"Would have been a good movie, good story. However it had this underlying bass tone throughout the entire film trying to make it seem more dark then it actually was. Turned out to be so annoying that it made the film much less enjoyable, and meaningful then it should have been. The low rumble often times made it hard to understand the dialog."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,29 September 2021,7/10,"I watched the trailer for this one a few times before it was able to be streamed on my streaming service. It honestly did not have the ending I was hoping for- but I think it may have ended even better. The plot, the characters, the cute relationship between Cassandra and Ryan, the backstory, the plot twists (especially THE twist that made me ""oh my God. NO."" - I loved it ALL. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the main actress, typically, but she did a phenomenal job and deserves so much praise. This is a difficult topic and, at times, this was difficult to watch. But it's important that we talk about it. This one was good."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,28 February 2021,10/10,This is so fulfilling. I wish there is more like it. it's the less heart breaking way to film it.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,26 January 2021,10/10,"Such a movie cannot be missed. In some places they did not hold out, but nothing is perfect."
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,2 January 2021,10/10,This movie basically shows how taking advantage of others while intoxicated is way more common than you would think. And goes in deep detailing that people don't care about such things unless they benefit out of it or unless it's their own personal problem. I don't think if I've ever seen any movies or series that been as close to the real life events as this movies.
PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,3 July 2021,6/10,Promising young woman is not good enough to win the academy awards. I can't understand this movie included in so many nominations and won. All the nomination listed movies are better than this in 2020.
