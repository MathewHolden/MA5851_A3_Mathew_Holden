THE FATHER,14 April 2021,7/10,"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives in his large London flat for much of his adult life. He's showing signs of dementia as he falsely accuses others of stealing his beloved watch. His caregiver daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him that she's moving to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough. This is an interesting movie with some very interesting actors. Maybe the early part of the movie had me expecting too much. I end up reviewing what's not on the screen rather than what's on it."
THE FATHER,10 May 2021,,"The good thing - Sir Anthony Hopkins, after a long expectation, refuge in easy formulas and what can be defined as cliches/ manneririsms, gives a magnificent acting. For me, The Father is a sort of return to past, reminding the bad condition of one of loved ones. But, maybe, the realism is one of its basic fundamental virtues. The provocative perspective, the fall of a world / order and the need, high need to understand as a need of breathing. An admirable work and splendid job of Olivia Colman."
THE FATHER,10 September 2021,6/10,"""The Father"" is a new movie, well from 2020, and a co-production between the United Kingdom and France. The movie runs for under 100 minutes, so not a particularly long film by any means. And yet this was one of the biggest players from the previous awards season. The director is Florian Zeller and his career path can really be described as unusual. He launched his career through stage plays and mostly focused on these as well in recent years, even if here and there he also moved on to movies. So the smallest surprise here is probably that he wrote the screenplay himself. The bigger surprise is that he directed. And he did not have a co-director despite not being experienced at all in this department, but a co-writer. That would be Christopher Hampton and he has been in the industry for a long time and even won an oscar decades ago. Well, he won his second now. This is how successful this film turned out in the end and how audiences, critics and awards bodies loved it. Huge international breakthrough for Zeller too of course and we will see what will be next for him in the future. Certainly promising projects coming up. But as much as Zeller may have achieved behind the camera and with the pen in his hand (metaphorically), the heart and soul of this film was British actor Anthony Hopkins. You see him on the right of the imdb poster of course. He won his second Oscar for his portrayal here and even if he did not go into Oscar night as the frontrunner, not too many neutral observers were unhappy with Hopkins being announced as the winner at the very end, even after the Best Picture winner was announced this time. Hopkins was not there in America, maybe partially because of the pandemic and partially because of his age and the distance, but he recorded a little thank you message the following day if I remember correctly in which he also made a short reference to the late Chadwick Boseman that most people were expecting to win. More on Hopkins later.The woman you see on the left is Olivia Colman of course, already an Oscar winner herself and her win for The Favorite as an against-the-odds upset as well, so kinda fitting. I think she played her part well as she always does, but I don't see huge versatility in her somehow and it feels a bit exaggerated how much awards bodies have loved her in the past. Still she contributed in a way where the film does not get worse when she is on screen and here and there she also has a memorable moment, like the one in the elevator for example with her bright smile after she gets a compliment from her father. That was one of not too many moments where we really saw how much he meant to her and how much she wanted to be loved by him. Despite the violent fantasy. Nice connection to how she in reality(?) takes really good care of him when he is in bed. Another example would be the table argument of course. But as a whole the fact how much she cares for him is also shown to us by all the time where we see them both on the screen, even if they are separated in the end and even if we can never really be sure what is reality and what happens only in Hopkins's character's mind. This is pretty much the key aspect to the script here. I cannot write the mindf... word from beginning to end, but it's all about that. Zeller's main intention here was definitely to make us see things the way they are seen from the perspective of an old man whose memory and sanity are fading quickly. We also see all the emotions he goes through in the process. Be it him joking around before becoming very serious seconds alter (the tap dance scene), be it him saying he is an intelligent man and how he does not want to be treated like a fool. The nun reference there also felt a bit random. But also those moments in which he is as vulnerable as it gets. When he is physically attacked, slapped, though (probably) only in his imagination, or when he, near the very end, compares himself to a tree basically and realizes how he is fading basically. These are all moments in which Hopkins truly shines.As for all the inclusions that do so much with your mind, I will also mention a few examples: Of course, the recurring watch references come to mind. But also the painting from the wall. All the references to his other daughter and how he sees her a bit in a new applicant. Or actually sees her a lot and how confused he is when he sees the other woman near the end. Then there is this loop scene which I also found fairly haunting to be honest when we have his daughter and her man talk about him and how he enters the room when they do. Would they really talk that loudly and even scream immediately afterwards with him not too far away? Anyway, this scene closes with him not taking his seat the way he did before, but going back to his room. By the way, in the trailer this film seemed to be much more about the apartment, but it turned out completely differently. The only thing related to reality clashing with an old mind was maybe when we saw the other daughter (let's call her that) briefly on one occasion. There are many more moments really I could list here, but I don't want to take it away from you if you have not seen the film yet. Or also not take it away from you to draw your own conclusions. I must say that in the second half, I felt it became a bit too much honestly with how everything gets blurry and not too close to reality anymore. For example the scene towards the end (but still a bit earlier and away fro the closing credits) when we see Hopkins' character alone all on his own at an utterly cold and sterile retirement home. This of course gave us in the audience immediately the idea that this is where he was all along, that maybe Colman's character never really existed, but then things take another turn and twist. One after the other. I don't know, maybe I like it more if I watch it again, but I thought that perhaps Zeller wanted a bit too much here. Had almost Nolan proportions with stuff like Inception, only as a full-on family drama.Aside from that, I think this is a pretty interesting project also as a stage play and I would not be surprised if we see it one day at non-movie theaters. Surely a challenge with some characters, even if it's not that many, and also the changing locations of course. I see that Zeller turned this into a film already in France years ago. Interesting. This seems almost lost though judging from the amiunt of votes here on imdb. But back to this one here: By the way, when Colman's character leaves in the end it felt like closure and a framework compared to how she entered the movie. But the film ends with Hopkins' character of course and a beautiful shot of the nature outside his new home. Fitting really. This seems like a film really close to his heart. The birthday his character states is his own in fact and he may be healthier in terms of his mental state, but also his character's name is Anthony. A bit of an irony if we take a look at another Oscar-winning movie, namely Nomadland, and how there everybody has their real name except the protagonist, even if it is not too different either. Let's sta with this one here for now though. What else can you say? Oh yes, Imogen poots is always a nice inclusion, not just for a hetero male like myself, but also acting-wise. Very nice. This also applies to the rest of the cast, especially Sewell and Gatiss who held their own next to Hopkins (and Colman) and this is a really huge achievement I'd say. No matter if it was two scenes or ten.All in all, this movie gets a thumbs-up with no hesitation, even if I somehow feel that I did not like the outcome overall as much as I would have liked and some of the awards recognition is also too much, especially for the screenplay. I felt that it even took away a bit from the emotional component because the fictitious aspects (and how we cannot be sure what's happening at all the longer the movie goes) made it a bit less depressing. For me at least. Difficult to really put a finger on it. I wonder how I will think about that on rewatch, but I have no intention really to go for a rewatch anytime soon. Who knows, maybe once it is on television. This is not a visual masterpiece, so it's not much of a worse watch on the small screen than at a movie theater where I saw it today I believe. The music I did not like too much, but that is of course entirely subjective. High-pitched opera is smply not my thing. But of course it makes sense that the character likes it with his age. They could not have gone for modern pop music or something and it also fits from the cultivated perspective if we look at his really fancy apartment and fairly exquisite alcoholic beverages you see here and there. What will always stay the most with this one here though is how Hopkins turned solid scenes into something exquisite at times. Great props to him and it will take quite some time to find a better performance by somebody in his 80s. May he lives for many more years to come and maybe also give us a few more nice films hopefully. Or just enjoy retirement. Whatever floats his boat the most. Thank you, Mr Hopkins!"
THE FATHER,11 June 2021,6/10,"Anthony Hopkins won his second Best Actor Oscar for The Father.This shocked some people. The late Chadwick Boseman was the sentimental favourite and he had won the earlier awards in the run up to the Oscars.I was not surprised that Hopkins pipped Boseman. People forget just how revered Hopkins is in the acting profession. Other actors would bend over backwards just to share a scene with him.This is a man who was anointed as Laurence Olivier's successor many decades ago.In The Father, Hopkins gives a masterclass in acting. Anthony is a man living with dementia and his world is jumbled up.People, places, relationships have no fixed bearings.Based on Florian Zeller's own stage play. Zeller as director makes small subtle changes to unsettle the audience so they can sympathise with Anthony's confusion, frustration and even anger.Several actors play different characters with slightly askew performances which makes the audience doubt them.It is all part of the film's structure. In the centre of it all is Hopkins and I doubt the film would work without him, especially at the end when he talks about his mother.The film's innovative narrative has been slightly robbed by other genres. The British soap opera Emmerdale had a special point of view episode in 2016 where the former vicar's early onset of dementia demonstrates his confused state of mind.The Father ploughs a similar field. In that sense its framework of being a warped thriller did not really cut it for me."
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,9/10,"This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,9/10,"With cinemas being closed during the COVID-19 lockdown, it was difficult know when I'd be able to watch this on the big screen, so I'm thankful when it went online, with it being nominated during Awards Season, I was most keen to watch it, based on the acclaimed play by Florian Zeller, who debuts as writer and director. Basically, Anne (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Olivia Colman) visits her father Anthony (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Anthony Hopkins) in his flat after he becomes aggressive towards his recent caretaker. Anthony has developing dementia and constantly forgets important life events and where things are in his flat, including his watch, even though he places it in the same place every day. He tells Anne he thinks his recent caretaker stole his watch and that he will never leave his flat. Anne tells Anthony she plans to leave London and move to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. Anthony is confused and thinks she is still married to James, but she tells him that they have been divorced for five years and leaves. The next day, Anthony sees a man he does not recognise named Paul (Mark Gatiss) and is confused that he is living with him in his flat. Paul states that Anthony lives with him and Anne. Anthony is confused when Anne returns from the shops with chicken for dinner and appears as a different woman (Olivia Williams). His confusion causes him to become frustrated. Anne schedules an interview for a new caretaker in his house. Laura (Imogen Poots) meets with Anthony for the position. During their meeting Anthony claims he was a professional dancer and that he doesn't need any living assistance. After Laura has been hired, Anthony states that she reminds him of his other daughter Lucy. He mentions that he has not talked to Lucy for months for reasons he is unaware of. Anthony is taken to Dr. Sarai (Coronation Street's Ayesha Dharker) by Anne and is asked about his memory; he claims he has no memory problems. Anthony tells Laura about how proud he is of his daughter Lucy, who is a painter. Laura tells him she is very sorry about Lucy's accident, but Anthony is unaware of what she is referring to. Laura drops the subject and moves on to give him his medication. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Anthony has really been living with Anne and Paul for years, Paul has also changed in appearance (Rufus Sewell). But Anthony believes he is still living in his private flat. The night Anne comes back with the chicken from the market, she and Paul have an argument over a vacation to Italy they had to cancel to look after Anthony due to his difficult behaviour with the caretaker, and about how much Anne sacrifices for her father. Paul asks Anthony how long he plans to stay in their flat and annoy everyone, and he slaps Anthony to the point of crying. Then a few moments later, Paul's appearance changes again (Mark Gatiss), and the argument and slapping repeat. Anthony wakes up in his room and walks out of the flat, only to find himself in a hospital hallway. He remembers his daughter Lucy (Imogen Poots) died in a car accident at the hospital. He sees her bloody body in the hospital room. At that moment, he wakes up in a completely different bedroom, now in a nursing home. His nurse, Catherine (Olivia Williams), checks in on him and informs him Anne has moved to Paris with Paul and visits on occasional weekends. Another nurse, Bill (Mark Gatiss), also visits during their interaction. Anthony has an emotional breakdown over his inability to understand what is going on anymore and Anne's disappearance. He becomes child-like and cries wanting his mother. Catherine comforts him as he sobs and tells him she'll take him outside for a walk in the park. Hopkins gives an astonishing performance as the elderly man suffering the devastating illness and constant paranoia and confusion, Colman is terrific as his concerned daughter saddened by his deteriorating mind, and the support of Poots, Sewell, Williams and Gatiss is perfect. What makes this film stand out, besides the extraordinary Hopkins and the fantastic script, is the clever editing and structure of storytelling, with distorted realities and dramatic shifts in perspective, the visual trickery and twists are a literal representation of what having dementia must be like, it is a breath-taking and emotionally engaging drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Production Design, and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,7/10,"The devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease (although never mentioned by name) on an aged ex-engineer in London. There is no conventional story in ""The Father"", and that's as it should be. Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play ""Le Père"" with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie's rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It's a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony's conflicted daughter. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Hopkins as Best Actor. *** from ****"
THE FATHER,2 August 2021,,"This movie was shot in May 2019 just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic was recognized. The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story's impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do.Usually movies dealing with aging and dementia depict it from the points of view of all the others around, friends, family members, medical personnel. This does the opposite, it depicts it from the point of view of the afflicted person. As such I found myself totally confused after about 20 minutes but eventually understood why it had to be this way. We are seeing what Anthony (character's name) sees and experiences, the confusion as to where he is and his failure to recognize people he knows.In many ways this is a hard movie to watch because we know people who have gone through dementia and its inevitable end, or know people who are in the early stages of it. For that reason my wife chose not to watch this movie.For the subject matter it is a very good movie."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,,Wow. This story is expertly crafted that I just don't know what is real and what isn't. Amazing acting too.
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins and Gloria Williams stars in this movie about an elderly suffering from dementia entitled, ""The Father"". It presents a story of the struggles that a person having no sense of reality with the things surrounding him and the people around him.I just found this movie an average one. The story was simple. There was melodrama written over it as the movie wants the viewer to feel towards the elderly with dementia. No question that it achieved its objective. What made it great is Anthony Hopkins.No question that Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the elderly. He won another Oscar for it. I just got to learn from his movie when the news about Oscar winners for this year. (Personally, I did not even know that the Academy Awards Night was held just like many other people and no wonder the ratings for this year has become disastrous as it was at an ALL-TIME LOW. But that is another topic for another day). Hopkins made it interesting from beginning to end. The movie focused on his character. The story focused on his character. The screenplay focused on his character. And Hopkins delivered as he took it to new heights.Without Hopkins, this would have just been an average movie."
THE FATHER,14 September 2021,7/10,"It's been quite a while since I felt the Oscar winner for best actor actually turned in the best effort... Well, there is absolutely no doubt here that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on fine form as the elderly gent who is struggling to keep a grip on reality as he suffers from dementia. Coupled with a sparing contribution from Dame Olivia Colman who plays his daughter ""Anne"" and who is also excellent as the woman trying to juggle her own life with the responsibilities of caring for her father - sometimes lucid, sometimes less so... The performance from Hopkins allows him to build on his substantial stage experience to present us with a deeply thought out portrayal of a man dealing with psychological issues he (and sometimes the audience, too) is largely unaware he has, and he excels. Regrettably, the supporting cast let the film down rather - Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell could have done so much more as actors and with their characters - though, to be fair, their appearances seem to serve as little more than a bit of light relief for the audience from the intensity of Sir Anthony's contribution. The extent to which Florian Zeller has referred to any established clinical templates or practices when directing his own play for the big screen doesn't matter - this reeks of authenticity and engenders frustration, empathy and sympathy like no film that I have seen for many a year. A must watch, I'd say..."
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,9/10,"After his previous carer leaves the daughter of an octogenarian, Anthony, organises a new carer for him. However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not? And why doesn't his other daughter visit him anymore?Brilliant. An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it. He well deserved his Best Actor Oscar.Great supporting cast: Olivia Colman (who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her efforts), Rufus Sewell, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss."
THE FATHER,21 June 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins gives a towering performance and joined the ranks of multi-Oscar winning actors in this harrowing film.He plays an elderly man suffering from dementia, and the movie is filmed mostly from his point of view, meaning it's a disorienting experience for the viewer, as past runs into present runs into future, different actors play the same characters and then the same actors show up later playing different characters, the apartment in which he lives changes decor and layout. We're never sure whether we're getting an accurate version of events, and the last and devastating scene of the film leaves us wondering if anything that preceded it happened within the world of the movie at all or whether it was all a jumble of memories of events that occurred before the film even starts.The film is expertly written and directed in such a way to make it just frustrating enough for us to feel like we're in the shoes of the main character, but not too frustrating to make the movie overall a turn off. Given its accolades, I was surprised and maybe a touch disappointed that I wasn't more moved by it than I was, save for that last scene, which would have justified Hopkins' Academy Award even if nothing else leading up to it did, though everything leading up to it does as well.Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (who also directed) won an Oscar for adapting the screenplay from Zeller's play, and this is one stage-to-screen adaptation that doesn't scream its stage origins. I wasn't surprised it was based on a play, but on the other hand would have accepted that it was written directly for the screen too. Olivia Colman received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing Hopkins' daughter, or at least one iteration of her, while the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Best Production Design (and how wonderful to see work like this nominated in a category that usually favors obvious period or fantasy films), and Best Film Editing (again, a very high-brow choice by the Academy, and richly deserved).Grade: A."
THE FATHER,1 July 2021,9/10,"I cannot say what I want to say about this film without spoilers, so please don't read on if you want to find what happens in the film as it unfolds.Anthony lives in a flat in London. His daughter Anne calls in on him every day. She is upset and worried because Anthony has driven away another care worker, and Anne is about to move to Paris in a new relationship. Anne's husband indicates that the flat is Anne's, not Anthony's. Anne seems to be an entirely different person,, but then she is Anne again. Her husband is someone different though. Some conversations are repeated. Anthony initially charms, then verbally attacks, Laura, a potential new care worker who reminds him of his other daughter, Lucy, who never comes to see him.We realise early on that Anthony is in the grip of dementia, and through most of the piece, right up to the end, we are wondering hiw much of what we see is real, and how much is Anthony's disintegrating memory betraying him. Ultimately, we never know and it doesn't matter - despite it being very clear how destructive the impact of Anthony's dementia is on Anne (and possibly her busband - was she married? Was it a factor in the marriage breaking up?), what the film shows us is what it might be like inside the mind of someone whose foothold in the real world is increasingly unreliable.Anthony Hopkins wins a well-deserved 2nd Best Actor Oscar for a portrayal of a character who is initially unlikeable but, by the end, is almost literally a little lost boy. The rest of the cast are also excellent.Florian Zeller directs this adaptation of his own play (the adapted screenplay also won an Oscar). It is wise, sad, accurate and compassionate. If you and your family have never been touched by dementia then you may well marvel at the clever and kind telling of a worthwhile story, brought to life by a crew of supremely gifted artists.My family has been touched by dementia on a number of occasions.At different times, I saw in this film my grandparents, my mother-in-law, my wife, my father, my mother, my brother and myself, and all at times in our lives which could never be called happy. It struck very close to home, and I found it brutal."
THE FATHER,11 March 2021,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are frequent topics in movies these days for the simple reason that so many are impacted either directly or through a friend or family member. The importance of memory to our core being cannot be over-stated. It's crucial to who we are and what we feel. The first feature film from French director Florian Zeller is an excellent and poignant tale, all too real for those who have experienced this with a loved one. Zeller adapted his own play (winning a Tony Award for Frank Langella) with his co-writer, Oscar winner Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIASONS, 1988). It's also one of the few films where Set Design is so crucial that it basically serves as a main character.Whereas most of these movies provide the perspective of the caregiver or family members, this one is extraordinary in also giving us the point-of-view of the one suffering. Sir Anthony Hopkins (Oscar winner, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991) plays Anthony, an 80 year old Londoner who gets hurt, defensive and a bit churlish when his daughter Anne (Oscar winner Olivia Colman, THE FAVOURITE, 2018) informs him that she's met a man and is moving to Paris. Anne is working to find an acceptable caregiver for her father ... one that he doesn't run off in a matter of hours. Though Anne maintains a spirited front, it's clear the responsibility is exhausting and draining - feelings of which any caregiver can surely relate.Just about the time we get a feel for the flow and settle in for a family drama, filmmaker Zeller spins things topsy-turvy. We suddenly aren't sure 'what is what' or 'who is who'. Olivia Williams (THE SIXTH SENSE, 1999) is now Anne. She now has a husband, Paul - maybe Mark Gatiss or Rufus Sewell. The details of the apartment are slightly different, and instead of being Anthony's place, it's actually Anne's. Or is it? Anthony tries to process these differences, just as we do. The interview with an in-home caregiver played by Imogen Poots brings out the joy and liveliness of Anthony, but a painting raises questions ... as does the ongoing saga with Anthony's favorite wristwatch. As viewers, we are baffled and disoriented; however, unlike Anthony, we are slowly able to process the flashes of data and slowly put the pieces together.Anthony Hopkins delivers his best and most emotional work in years, while Olivia Colman continues her impressive run. In fact, the entire cast his spot on. Complementing the performances is Peter Francis' previously mentioned Set Design, which adds to both the confusion and the explanation. Also elevating the film is the work of Film Editor Yorgos Lamprinos and the score from Ludovico Einaudi. Hopkins' character asks, ""Who exactly am I?"" and we feel the excruciating pain of realizing one's persona is slipping away. This will be a challenging film to watch for anyone who has experienced this type of agonizing loss in their life, and Zeller's film also serves as a warning to everyone else.
Opening theatrically nationwide March 12th and available for Premium VOD on March 26th"""
THE FATHER,26 August 2021,8/10,"The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one."
THE FATHER,27 May 2021,,"""The Father"" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called ""Kitchen Sink Drama""--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, ""Who am I?""It wasn't entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne's ""husband"" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait."
THE FATHER,22 June 2021,8/10,"""The Father"" is one telling picture of how time passes and how the mind drops and goes in the final years. As really it's sad and strange seeing how the mind and reality can be in such a state of confusion as it twist with nothing ever seeming or being the same. Anthony(the great and super Anthony Hopkins) is an old man living in London, who's caretaker has left and his grown daughter Anne(Olivia Colman) now has and wants to take care of him in his final years, however this will prove a tough task with his current emotional and mental state as the dementia is clearly draining and sadly taking it's toll. The scenes are well acted as the state of mind seems real, however it's painful and numbing watching the decline of Anthony every day with doubt as his mind is always changing people and places for him. The film is to the point and a tough eye opening display on dementia and losing reality as it's sad to see how life and being normal can just slip away from a person over time just ending everything so suddenly."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,"""Spatially, Anthony's apartment, Anne's, the clinic they visit, and the elderly home where Anthony ends up, all share a rigid compositional similarity that even a sane first-time viewer might get disoriented (one must heed their decors and furnitures to discern them). A nightmarish dream sequence in a hospital hallway recalls a similar passage in Michael Haneke's AMOUR (2012), another gerontological chef d'oeuvre, but THE FATHER is less poetic (no magical pigeons here), and more leans on evoking our empathy and compassion to Anthony's deterioration, like Julianne Moore's Oscar-winning vehicle STILL ALICE (2014).""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks."
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,9/10,"All I knew when I started watching this movie was it was about an old-man whose mind was failing, and I was expecting a standard drama on the subject, affecting and serious, powered by Hopkin's inexhaustible talent. Hopkins is what I expected, brilliant as an irascible and increasingly confused old man. His final moments are brutal and brilliant. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. But the film itself is not a straightforward drama, but something much more remarkable.*********** SPOILERS BELOW ******************
What is remarkably about this film is how it takes you into Hopkins failing mind. The first scene is a straightforward one of a cantankerous, independent old man interacting with his exhausted daughter. But in the next scene, there are weird shifts and disorienting moments. That's when you realize we are experiencing reality, for the most part, as Hopkins is experiencing it. Settings and faces change, time loops in on itself. It's often unclear if we are re-experiencing a moment or reaching a new one.The timeline is an unsolvable puzzle. There are contradictions that can't be resolved. It's unclear is everything we see happened, and almost certain it didn't happen in the way we're shown. Hopkins is unmoored, and as he declines, you see his increasing caution as he begins to realize that he's been wrong so often that he needs to be careful in what he says. But then he's often not careful because he is who he is.This is from a play, but unlike most movies from plays, I wouldn't have guessed that. It's opened up beautifully, as Hopkins drifts from one location to another, never quite sure where he is. I'd be very curious to know how this was originally staged.The playwright directed this, and I am really curious what he'll do next. This is a truly remarkable, must-see film."
THE FATHER,7 October 2021,7/10,"If there's one flaw with 'The Father (2020)', it's that Hopkins' character seems to be able to perceive events he has yet to experience. The film uses nonlinearity, alongside a few other formalistic techniques that I won't spoil here, to convey how its protagonist's deteriorating mental state leaves him confused and feeling as though his world is changing around him. That's all fine and it usually works as intended, putting you in the increasingly disoriented headspace of the lead. Sometimes, though, the protagonist will reference, in specific detail, events that have actually happened in the film but not in its established chronology. Basically, he mentions things we've seen but he hasn't, things that are yet to occur to him. Of course, he could just be getting confused; that is a large part of the narrative, after all, and we're supposed to question the validity of some depicted events. However, the specificity of his assertions doesn't make him seem confused so much as precognitive. There is an argument to be made that the whole picture is a series of lucid memories that he's making his way through, the entire thing essentially taking place in his head at the very end of the plot, but that doesn't quite ring true because there are several scenes told from the perspective of his daughter which depict events he could never possibly have witnessed. Regardless of this, though, the movie still works well and achieves what it sets out to. Our lead is a man out of time due to his illness, and his condition comes across rather keenly. Even if the movie feels as though it's tripping over itself ever so slightly, it's ultimately successful at putting us in the increasingly frustrated and uncomfortable headspace of the protagonist. His world doesn't make sense, so perhaps that's why the film itself doesn't quite add up. I say 'quite' because other than the occasional bit of precognition, the narrative itself is relatively easy to keep up with. Its presented a bit like a puzzle, leaving you to figure out where each scene takes place within the flick's chronology and where the seams are between time jumps. It's an engaging effort and presents a distinct approach to its under-represented subject matter. The picture isn't quite as emotionally impactful as it perhaps could have been, for me at least, and there is the occasional sense that some further work could've been done to smooth the story's transition from stage to screen (there are a lot of monologues). In the end, though, this is a compelling and effective look into an ageing mind that properly conveys the horror of perhaps the most despicable disease known to man. 7/10."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,10/10,"I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.Everything is seen through Hopkins' eyes. Olivia Coleman, (heartbreakingly good), is his daughter but there are other 'characters' who may or may not exist or rather, if they do exist, who are they or who does Hopkins perceive them to be? A man appears who says he's the daughter's husband but then the daughter has said she does not have a husband. Another woman comes in and says she's his daughter while another man appears and converses with Hopkins. Is he the husband? Is there a husband?I've already said that this is an actor's piece of the first order but it is also a writer's piece with Zeller adapting his own play with Christopher Hampton. It may be mystifying initially for just as characters turn up to confuse us so the film follows no chronological timespans. Events keep repeating themselves if they happen at all until we come to realise we are simply inside Hopkins' dishevelled mind and for Hopkins I think I can safely say that this is a career- best performance. The Oscar givers may ignore it but acting like this deserves more than prizes; it deserves to be seen."
THE FATHER,6 May 2021,9/10,"Okay, that's what I call high quality and masterpiece. It made very professional and that's why it's very hard to watch it... When you have father,grandmother or other relative who acts the same as shown it hits much different. I'm just in love how cute it was done and it almost made me cry. Main actor did amazing job, if you wouldn't know it's a movie you could think it's real documentary. He absolutely deserved oscar and I'm glad for him. Hands down, I can say it's the best film of 2020 that I've seen. I would definitely recommend to watch it."
THE FATHER,9 June 2021,8/10,"Absolutely terrifying. The dizzying disorientation of losing one's grip on basic reality, the loss of dignity, and the vulnerability associated having dementia are portrayed here in a stunning way, with the film giving us enough of the perspective of an old man to truly feel his horror. At the same time it allows us to follow what's really going on, with one of his daughter's struggling to get proper care for him and dealing with her own emotions as well. In a cruel twist of fate, she was never his favorite daughter but ended up being his caregiver, and he no longer possesses the tact to stop talking about her sister. Argh, this one just tears at the heartstrings, especially if you've gone through a situation like this personally.As noted pretty much everywhere, Anthony Hopkins turns in a brilliant performance, really humanizing this character and in small ways reminding us that he once led a highly respectable life. In some of the more poignant moments he attempts to put on a brave face, make jokes, or even flirt with the caregivers, trying to appear as dashing as he remembers he once was, when those around him feel uneasy and awkward. The shame of playing the fool and worse yet, being a burden to loved ones, is tough to watch and even tougher to imagine possibly experiencing firsthand someday. Director Florian Zeller keeps us off-balance and wisely doesn't try to give us a completely objective version of events, because that isn't the point. The film is also well-paced, and well-timed at 97 minutes."
THE FATHER,22 May 2021,8/10,"Dementia is a terrible disease. It's not something I'm interested in seeing depicted on screen. I've already seen enough of that. ""Amour"" (2012), with it likewise being claustrophobically isolated to an apartment and although it involves a stroke, especially comes to mind. Anticipating it was a depressingly realistic slice-of-life drama, I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing this Awards-winner, ""The Father,"" from a playwright turned first-time movie director. Fortunately and surprisingly, I don't think it's that, and one would be well advised to see it before reading reviews for it, including this one. I'm not familiar with the writer-director's original play that this is an Anglicization of, ""Le Père,"" nor the French film already made of it, ""Floride"" (2015), so I don't know how much of it was always of design or if anything is original here. I mean, ""they don't even speak English there."" Regardless, that ""The Father"" may come across as what I feared it was--and what others seem to discuss it as--is because we may forget genres when introduced to their entries in unpredictable ways. But, remember, ""The Father"" is a mind-game film, a puzzle picture.Think ""Fight Club,"" ""The Matrix"" (both 1999), ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), ""Shutter Island"" (2010), Charlie Kaufman, David Lynch, Christopher Nolan--movies that play games and are puzzles to put together. My go-to essay on this type of movie is ""The Mind-Game Film"" by Thomas Elsaesser. It lists six common motifs among such titles. I've already done this in my review of ""The Machinist"" (2004), but as remembered repetition is especially the name of the game in this case, I'll run through the list again, of which ""The Father,"" with its congruent case of dementia, may be diagnosed as checking every box. 1) the protagonist is involved in events whose meaning or consequences escape him. 2) He's mistaken about the difference between reality and his imagination and so are we. 3) He has imaginary friends. 4) He has an identity crisis--asking ""who am I and what is my reality?"" 5) He's not only unable to distinguish between different worlds, but is also not aware their might be parallel universes, nor are we, until the ultimate reveal. 6) He's persuaded by others that he's deluded, particularly as regards a child and past trauma.The novelty of ""The Father"" is that we know he has dementia, so when the picture is put into his perspective, we know present reality and memories might be mixed up, although it may still be difficult to distinguish. This is further complicated by briefly taking the point of view of the daughter or of the camera sharing subjectivity with no particular character. The greatest trick of all here being that the spectator might not even realize what kind of movie this is. It's all there, though, in its non-linear jigsaw puzzle of reality and illusion, past and present, one's own identity and those of others. Actors playing different roles depending on his confusion. The business with the other daughter. Clever stuff. I also like the allusions on the margins to other arts in painting and music, as well as that this maze of a mind comes from a retired engineer, or was he a dancer, or circus performer. And what wonderful use of its limited setting--as if everything takes place in an ever-changing flat. Despite what that would suggest and that it's an adaptation of a play, this isn't stagy at all. Well edited and photographed, too.The only other movie that comes to mind that deals this smartly with dementia is ""Still Alice"" (2014). In that case, it was reflexively about literature (implicitly ""Alice in Wonderland"") and acting. As there, with actors switching between characters, and back and forth in identity, it's vital that the performances be top notch. Fortunately, then, ""The Father"" stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman in Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated roles, respectively, as well as a capable supporting cast. Olivia Williams is especially well cast, including for passing similarities in appearance to Colman. There's too much mental misery and the hardships of aging in the outside world, so don't forget this is a movie."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,,"Bolstered by an outstanding performance from Anthony Hopkins & narrated with a welcome sensibility, The Father paints a heartbreaking portrait of dementia and gives the audience an idea of the confusion & frustration that takes over one's life as this mental illness worsens and does so by putting us in the mind of our ageing protagonist who's struggling to deal with his progressing memory loss.Co-written & directed by Florian Zeller in what's his directorial debut, the story is adapted from his 2012 play of the same name and is crafted with care & honesty. The way its plot is structured & narrated provides added clarity to what it's like to live with dementia as the mind deteriorates piece by piece and one loses grasp of their time, reality, thoughts & memories but still try to make a rational sense of it.The homely setting, silent camerawork, undisturbed pace & fine editing do fit the premise but the real highlight are the performances. Anthony Hopkins delivers an absolute powerhouse of an act here, articulating his character's pride, fear, agony & perplexity with precision, and it's one of his career-best works. Olivia Colman is in as his daughter who painfully watches her father wither away and chips in with an emotionally hefty input.Overall, The Father is nuanced in its storytelling, empathetic in its presentation, and features Hopkins & Colman in splendid form. The bewilderment it causes is deliberate to make the viewers scramble for answers & rational explanation just like our protagonist and the more they relate to him, the more devastating it all gets. A promising start to Florian Zeller's filmmaking career, The Father is tragic, harrowing & powerfully moving. Don't miss it."
THE FATHER,28 August 2021,8/10,"It was one of the best movies of the year. Anthony Hopkins definitely deserved his Oscar. Excellent performance sir A. Hopkins. The movie was a bit of a mess, but you'll get it at the end."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Father"" (2020) is a brilliant film that shows Alzheimer's disease in a way it was probably never been show before. It puts a viewer in a ""shoes"" so to speak of a one suffering from this disease. And its a heartbreaking experience.""The Father"" is not an easy movie to watch, but its a rewarding experience. First you will see a great script, very good directing, cinematography, editing and terrific performance by a legendary Anthony Hopkins. Acting was phenomenal by everyone, and especially A. Hopkins.Overall, ""The Father"" doesn't have a good feel ending, because there is not good feel ending when suffering from this kind of disease. Its heartbreaking and painfully real. Its also one of the very best films of 2020."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,,"One of the most popular earlier movies about dementia is ""The notebook"" (2004), a weepy romance that put Ryan Gosling on the map. ""The father"" (2020) takes the dramatization of this tragic occurrence up a few notched, well above melodrama.""The father"" is adapted from a modern (2011) French play. I browsed several critics' reviews on performances of ""Le Pere"" in the last few years (in London, Washington, Sydney and New York). As a result, I was able to appreciate the narrative's unique style more than otherwise, but at the cost of sacrificing an unimpaired first impression.""The father"" reminds me of ""Le vie en rose"" (2007), in which Marion Cotillard won her Oscar for the portrayal of legendary French singer Edith Piaf. In both these movies, gradual deterioration in mental capacity is conveyed with montages seen through the protagonist's POV.The English movie ""The father"" stays close to the original play, but with the roles of the two cities, Paris and London, reversed, for obvious reasons. The familiar story is told through 6 characters, 4 real and 2 surreal (identified as ""the man"" and ""the woman""). Familiarity notwithstanding, the story is not less tragic, particularly when depicted by the heart-wrenching performance of the two leads.The following simple linear recounting of events is nowhere near the way it is presented in the movie. Successful retired engineer Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lost his younger daughter Lucy years ago (details fuzzy) and has been relying on divorced daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) as his emotions crutch. As his dementia gets worse, Anne moved him out of his upscale apartment to live with her and her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell), while employing a part-time caregiver to take care of Anthony during daytime.The starting point of the movie is when Anne decides to move with Paul to Paris. Anthony's ""having his way"" has driven away several caregivers and she is hopeful that the latest candidate, young and attractive Laura (Imogen Poots) will work out for him. The sad, ultimate inevitability comes when just prior to moving to Paris, Anne has to yield to Paul's realistic reasoning for putting Anthony into a nursing home. The aforementioned 4 are the ""real"" characters.The remaining two are mainly Anthony's hallucinations. ""The man"" (Mark Gatiss) represents the dark side of the men he had come across in his life - Paul in the present, his ex-son-in-law in the past, and other male characters real and imagined. ""The woman"" (Olivia Williams) plays the alternative versions (neutral, not ""the dark side"") of Anne and Laura to enhance the effect of the confusion in Anthony's mind. In the final scene, Williams also plays the real-life nurse Catherine caring for Anthony in the nursing home.As mentioned, what the audience witness on the screen (and stage, in the play) is nowhere near to being simple, and the narrative is anything but linear. We are never sure where is where, when is when, who is who. And that is exactly the effect desired, seeing things through Anthony's confused mind, the erosion of which has been renders excruciatingly detailed.Anthony starts out just a little bit confused about his supposedly missing watch, but comes out emphatically when Anne intimates that she is moving to Paris. ""Like rats leaving a ship"", he promptly asserts ""You're abandoning me"". In a later scene, he accuses Anne for waiting for his death so that she can have his flat. ""I am going to outlive you, Anne"" he declares and, without missing a beat, turns to young Laura and adds ""I'm not sure about you"". Still sharp-thinking mind even in delusion.It is heart-wrenching, however, to see him in the final scene, in the nursing home a few months after Anne has moved to Paris. Anthony's mind has regressed to a state of whimpering for ""mommy"", curdling in Catherine's arms. This scene reminds me at once of both Benjamin Button and the final scene of ""2001: A space odyssey"", a man coming full circle at the end of his life.The acting is uniformly excellent, and Hopkins beyond excellent. His completely immersed portrayal of Anthony fully deserves an Oscar to go with his BAFTA. We'll find out in less than 3 days. Coleman matches him tear for tear, smile for smile. Between the two of them, they break your heart again and again.Sewell who got my attention in the TV series ""Man in the high castle"" delivers a measured performance as Paul, not a particularly likeable character but comes across as understandably human. The dark side of this (and other) character is left to veteran Gatiss, who has under his credits two popular TV series ""Game of thrones"" and ""Sherlock"". Prolific Williams does not have anything to work with in the ""alternates"" in hallucination of Anne and Laura. But in the final scene, as experienced (perhaps even a bit world-weary) but still compassionate nursing home nurse Catherine, she has her shining moments. Imogen Poots is well-cast for Laura, young and fresh, but poised under pressure."
THE FATHER,14 April 2021,8/10,"""The Father"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a woman trying to help her father who needs assistance. We watch the way he changes through time due to some circumstances and soon he has to realize the reality and not his own reality.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very interesting plot. The direction which was made by Florian Zeller, it was very good and he presented very well his main character from a completely different perspective that I had not watched before. With his way he succeeded on making us understand his character feelings and his reality. The interpretation of Anthony Hopkins who played as Anthony, it was simply amazing and I believe that he made one of his best interpretations and he truly deserves the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Olivia Colman's who played as Anne and she was equally good. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Father"" is a very interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone can learn something from it."
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins is one of the most noted thespians of all time. From his work on the stage, to his iconic Hannibal Lector portrayal, and even a more recent turn on the TV series Westworld, Hopkins is about as upper-echelon as actors get. Somewhat remarkably, then, his leading role in ""The Father"" might just be one of his top roles of them all.For a very basic overview, ""The Father"" tells the story of Anthony (Hopkins), an aging man who seems ""a little off"" (perhaps some senile dementia). While visited by daughter Anne (Olivia Coleman), things start to get even stranger for Anthony. People leave the room and come back as others, or show up in his England flat seemingly at random (Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, & Rufus Sewell). The new live-in caregiver (Imogen Poots)? She bears a striking resemblance to his other daughter. As the odd events continue to pile up, Anthony struggles to figure out just what exactly is ""real"" and what may be a result of his dementia.I can't say any more about the plot of ""The Father"" without ruining some of its endgame drama, but suffice it to say that it is an utterly riveting treatise on the betrayal of one's own mind. Just the way certain scenes are shot/framed keeps the viewer off-balance (like Anthony), and the ""answers"" you are looking for are all provided along the way (even if it may not feel like it in the moment at film's end). It neither lags, nor feels rushed in any way.The big draw here, though, is Hopkins' performance for the ages. If you make it through ""The Father"" without being severely emotionally moved, you'll be in the vast minority. In moments both depressing and funny/uplifting, Hopkins proves just how versatile of a performer he is. He can draw the audience in with his gregarious (and mysterious) nature, and absolutely break that same crowd's hearts with his raw emotion. A very obvious candidate (if not outright winner) for the Best Actor Oscar.Overall, ""The Father"" is on my short-list of top-five films released during the odd 2020 pandemic film season. Hopkins (and the supporting cast) provides extraordinary acting talent, the plot is intriguing from beginning to end, and it tells a story that can be viewed with equal parts sorrow and hope. It's an emotional rollercoaster that will completely enrapture your mind and heart."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,9/10,"The last 20 years have not been an overly memorable time for the screen icon that is Sir Anthony Hopkins.If you take away his impressive turns in the well-received 2019 drama The Two Popes and the hugely enjoyable New Zealand biopic from 2005 The World's Fastest Indian, Hopkins last two decades have seen the esteemed performer lower his colors in a range of forgettable features that have failed to utilize the skill and strengths of an aged yet still considerable talent.Thankfully the multi-Oscar nominated and critically lauded The Father, directed by debut feature director Florian Zeller (adapting his own stage play of the same name) gives Hopkins a chance to deliver what could just be his best ever performance; a huge call I know when you weigh up his Oscar winning turn in The Silence of the Lambs, but his devastatingly beautiful and unforgettable turn here as the dementia stricken Anthony is a once in a blue moon type occurrence.One of the most honest and raw examinations of growing old and losing ones sense of identity and purpose, The Father features Hopkins in almost every single scene of its mostly apartment based setting as Anthony's loose tracking of time, events and even his loved ones leads to a surprisingly intricate narrative that may feel familiar in parts but utterly unique in the way in which Zeller explores Anthony's tale and tells the story from his fractured point of view.Ably supported by the always great Olivia Coleman (quickly becoming one of the most effective performers in Hollywood) and some small turns from the likes of Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell, there's no mistake that The Father is Hopkins film and lives and dies off his performance but at the age of 83 the screen legend proves that he still has what it takes to handle drama, comedy and the human element that makes his turn so noteworthy here.There are moments when Hopkins turns the dial almost instantaneously between cool, calm and collected and either aggressively assertive or forlorn and lost and there's barely a chance that you walk away from this experience without being moved by his incredibly well-rounded turn here, delivering a performance for the ages that will touch many of us personally who have seen someone just like Anthony in our lives, lost within themselves as their mind no longer allows them to be who they once were.Final Say -A stagey but nevertheless captivating drama that explores the often unspoken about truths of growing old and coming to terms with ones mortality/frailty, The Father is top-class stuff and a stunning reminder of the skill Hopkins still possesses as a big screen performer.4 1/2 watches out of 5Share The Goodies -"
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,8/10,"The Father (2020) :
Brief Review -A Classic modern take on Old-age solitude issue. The realistic Father of Delusional Mind-shakers like Persona, Fight Club and Shutter Island. The Father is not that emotional soaking experience as we assume from the title and genre, rather it is damn confusing at the beginning and extremely delusional based on the realistic term called Memory Loss or Old-age solitude issues. Don't know why but somehow it reminded of Classic films made on delusional effects like Bergman's Persona (1966), Fincher's Fight Club (1998) and Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) etc. But The Father is far more realistic than those fictional thrillers. The film is about a man who refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. By the end it gets over-confusing but fortunately provides all the answers in classy and artistic cinematic sequences. With the small runtime of 97 minutes it never bores you, it feels less actually. I was like, show me some more this is too short. Anyways, whatever they put on screen is simply brilliant and connectable despite the intricate theories used to explore a normal issue. I doubt, some people may not even understand it in the first watch and they shall have to watch again to understand it better. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance to remember and i would like to see him winning couple of honorary awards this year. The supporting cast is fine too. The Father is all about Zeller's outstanding vision to look at an ordinary routine and then showing it in extraordinary manners. How smartly he shuffles his characters, the sequences, linear equation and timeline of events is just splendid. Overall, The Father is A Must Watch and perhaps the Best Film of 2020.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,"We were lost for a while, lucky for us, because for those with Alzheimer's disease nothing is momentary, it is degrading and decreasing, I liked being a protagonist from the patient's point of view, as well as in ""Forever Alice"", empathy transports us into the home, mind and relationships, excellent duo Olivia and Anthony, still full of questions and doubts, a beautiful film, poetic, melancholy, emotional and dramatic... My grandfather reminded me, complex context..."
THE FATHER,28 December 2020,8/10,The Father was a very good social drama with two great actors in it and if Oscars happen this year i think i know who will get it expecely in a actor for leading role and that is of course Anthony Hopkins who here maybe give performance of his life and that is saying something since he is great in almost every film.Colman was also here great and i could see how much she wants to help her father but also how she is suffering because of that.Story had some emotional moments that will hit both happy and sad side.The Father is one sad and heartwhelming story
THE FATHER,14 March 2021,9/10,"""The Father"" (2020 release from the UK; 97 min.) brings the story of Anthony, an 83 yr. man with dementia. As the movie opens, his daughter Anne visits him. Anthony's caretaker has quit, after he accused her of stealing his watch. Then, to Anne's exasperation, he finds the watch. Anne herself has big news: she informs him that she is moving to Paris, to live with her new boyfriend Paul. But how will that impact Anthony, who even with the helop of a caretaker, is so dependent on Anne? At this point we are less than 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut film of French writer/director Florian Zeller. And what a debut it is. The script is based on Zeller's award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is remarkable on several levels. First and foremost, the entire fim is brought from Anthony's perspective. This means that timelines are warped and things do not always appear to be what they are. This is what happens to one's mind when you are dealing with dementia. I've seen a number of films on this topic, and I feel that this is the first time that a filmmaker ""gets it"". Compare this for example to the 2014 film ""Still Alice"" starring Julianna Moore, which brings an utterly laughable Hollywood version of Alzheimer's. Anyone who has first-hand witnessed the devastation of what dementia in its various forms (including Alzheimer's) will do to a person's mind will immediately know what I mean. I saw it with my dad (RIP), a brilliant man who descended into the hell that is full-blown Alzheimer's. The second thing that makes ""The Father"" so remarkable is of course Anthony Hopkins. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, to devastating effect. At some point in the film he is asked by a doctor what his date of birth is, and the Anthony character immediately responds ""31 December 1937"", which is of course the actual birthday of Anthony Hopkins. This performance, on the heels of his equally impressive showing in ""The Two Popes"", demonstrates once again (as if more proof is needed) that Anthony Hopkins is one of the all time great actors, period. Olivia Colman as Anne does very well too, but honestly she is blown out of the water by the towering performance from Anthony Hopkins. Bottom line: ""The Father"" is one of the finest movies of the year. It has already collected a bunch of awards and nominations (including at the Golden Globes and at the BAFTAs--the British Oscars), and no doubt will be in line for a bunch of Oscar nominations AND wins.""The Father"" premiered to immediate critical acclaim at last year's Sundance film festival, yes, well over a year ago already. It was supposed to get a major theatrical release sometime last Fall, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally is now receiving a limited theater release before moving onto streaming services. The film opened this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay: 9 people including myself to be exact, which is on the high side for movie screenings these days (most screenings that I've attended typically get 5 to 10 people). The rest of the movieplex resembled a ghost town. I honestly don't know how movie theaters can operate profitably like that. Meanwhile, if you really want to get a sense what dementia is like, or if you simply are a fan of Anthony Hopkins, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, and check this out, be it in a theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"Sometimes an idea for a film comes along that is so good you can't help but wonder how it hasn't been done before. 'The Father' was very much a case of that for me. I couldn't get over what a brilliant concept for a film it was. Dementia is a truly heart-breaking condition and to be put in the shoes of the character who has is not only fascinating, it is also important I think. It's great that people can understand what others are going through and relate to their struggles. The way they did that here was masterful.Anthony Hopkins in the lead role is truly incredible. He has been nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards and he thoroughly deserves it. Most years with a performance this good he would've been a lock to win it as well. This is one of those performances where he is so good that you actually have to keep constantly reminding yourself that he doesn't actually have this condition. Olivia Colman has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She is also really good in this film. Her role isn't quite as easy to shine in, but nonetheless she finds a way. Her heart-break over the situation becomes our heart-break as an audience.The way this film is structured is nearing perfection. It's so clever and every time you think you have it figured out it hits you from a different angle you hadn't seen coming. The final scene in this movie is one of the most devastating scenes I've ever seen in a movie. This is an incredible film that isn't just a must-see, it's mandatory viewing in my opinion. A truly great film."
THE FATHER,13 May 2021,10/10,"The Father (2020) is a movie my fiancée and I watched in theatres a couple months ago. The storyline focuses on a man with Alzheimer's and how he deals with various transitions through life. His daughter does everything in her power to support him, both herself as well as by hiring help. His mental state is troubling to him, her and the help and as his mental state deteriorates tough decisions plague the family. This movie is directed by Florian Zeller in his directorial debut and stars Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz), Mark Gatiss (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) and Rufus Sewell (Dark City). There isn't one aspect of this movie that isn't perfect. The acting by everyone in the cast is all time great and perfect. The depiction of what people with Alzheimer's go through and how it impacts their life's choices is perfectly presented. It also depicts how family's need to make tough decisions, often to their own detriment, and how they can be torn between their own happiness and the happiness of their family members. There is so much I learned and appreciated about this movie, especially since my grandfather recently passed away with Alzheimer's. I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend seeing this masterpiece and would easily score this a 10/10."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,8/10,8/10 - affecting and innovative film leaves a mark in large part due to the performances of its talented cast.
THE FATHER,14 March 2021,7/10,"I saw ""The Father"", starring Anthony Hopkins-Thor:Ragnarok, The Wolfman_2010; Olivia Colman-The Crown_tv, Hot Fuzz; Rufus Sewell-The Man in the High Castle_tv, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter and Imogen Poots-Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping, Need For Speed.
This is an interesting story about a man that is getting older and how he sees things. It's based on a play by Florian Zeller, who also directs this movie. Anthony plays the old man that is living with his daughter, Olivia. Anthony keeps getting things wrong or seeing different versions of what he thinks things should be. For instance, one moment he will see Olivia and then he will turn around for a minute, and then he sees a different girl standing there, claiming to be Olivia. Rufus plays Olivia's husband and Imogen is a caretaker hired to take care of Anthony. Anthony starts believing that Olivia & Rufus are trying to take advantage of him by making him think he is crazy and have him institutionalized-so that they can take his apartment. Anthony's performance is riveting and you feel as if you really don't know what is going on-are they taking advantage of Anthony or does he have Alzheimer's? All is revealed in the end and either way, it is a riveting study of Alzheimer's.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-great performance and all but once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"This film does a really good job of placing the viewer into the shoes of a dementia patient. Everything from a technical point of view-the writing, directing, art direction and especially the editing-carries off the central conceit very well. The viewer ends up being a wash in time and reality as Anthony is. Moreover, the film does not (just) treat Anthony as an object of pity-he is also a figure of conflict and causes pain for his love ones. The film has a messy reality to it that I rather like. Hopkins-in a good way-is a hot mess in this film and it is amazing how *much* of the gamut of humanity he goes through here.I am afraid however the film has no repeat viewing value. The more clearly you can put the narrative together the less you feel like Anthony-which defeats the point of the film. Everyone should see this film-it is a great one off experience-but it lacks the true depth Great Films have. It is something of a parlor trick."
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,1/10,"This film start with a daughter ""Anne"" searching for her father ""Anthony"", and she found Anthony listening song in his room scene! As turnout, this film is about a series of imagination of Anthony in the nursing home! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the listening song scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the taking medicine scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the staring at the street scene, overuse of the talking with phone scene, and overuse of the cooking scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, we found out Anthony actually is at the nursing home, not his house! That's it! Completely wasting time to watch!"
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,7/10,"Anthony Hopkins plays a man sinking into dementia, confused and angry at all the changes that he thinks are going on around him in his flat. Supporting him and taking the brunt of his anger and sadness is his daughter played by Olivia Coleman.A chamber piece set almost exclusively in the flat, it is mesmerising to see 2 such outstanding performances and often deeply moving. As good a performance from Hopkins as any in his career, probably better, he effortlessly switches between confused, funny and furious, but is most impressive when he is scared and vulnerable and these pieces are achingly sad to watch. Coleman has the less showy role, but is still quietly coming unstuck, frustrated at what has to be done for her dad and yet again gives a note perfect performance. Good support from Sewell, Williams, Poots and Gatiss, this is truly an acting masterclass and a realistic insight into such a terrible disease."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"""what about me? Who exactly am i?""The most pleasant surprise of the year.Everything in this movie is amazing, from the music and the soundtrack to the directing and editing, but the biggest stars of this film are Anthony Hopkins and that incredible script.I was expecting a quite different reaction from me, but this movie is everything I did not imagine, and in the best way. I can't think of anything bad about this film."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,9/10,"I spent 97 minutes praising Anthony Hopkins for how excruciatingly brilliant he is, while he was trying to make me think the exact opposite. The cinematic art can't get any better. An Oscar worthy performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Well done."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,7/10,It makes audience understand about dementia from this movie. I get confuse in the beginning and turn into sad and attached mode while watching. It's how people suffer dementia. The acting is top notch and Oscar of leading role should go Anthony.
THE FATHER,16 March 2021,10/10,"Brilliant, bold, and so well written- The Father is hardly just another play turned into a film, it's a unique, incredibly acted, and thought-provoking masterpiece. I've never been a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins, I certainly respect him as an actor, and feel he is very talented, but for me he just didn't stand out in comparison to so many others. His role in this film not only changed my mind, as well as prove to be my favorite of his roles, but is done so incredibly well and so personal and emotional anyone with common sense will be blown away. It's such a well executed story, so raw and personal, without ever striving away from confusion, and feeling so complete in the process. It's truly a miracle of filmmaking, and besides a slightly slow start, I have absolutely nothing to complain about it. Olivia Colman holds her own in her supporting role as the aging Hopkin's daughter, and again you will be moved to tears by her performance. We have an excellent supporting cast to follow, but no one quite sticks out as much as those too, although Imogen Poots, despite her short runtime, does prove to be rather memorable. The score is brilliant, and so is the cinematography. Every aspect of this film seems developed to its full potential, and i've never left a film feeling so emotionally impacted, emotionally drained, and satisfied all at once. In the end, The Father is an experience i'll never forget, and certainly one of the best movies of the year.
My Rating: 10/10"
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,9/10,"Most of us have had a loved one who has or is suffering from dementia. It's a horrible disease that's both frustrating for the sufferer and the carer.This is an absolutely brilliant portrayal of an old man who refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, and how he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind .The way this film is made is so clever .The story is told as if the viewer is seeing what the sufferer is experiencing .We are never quite clear what is real or what is In Anthony's head .As the film goes on and the dementia gets worse his confusion comes to the boil and it's heartbreaking.Anthony Hopkins should win the best actor Oscar for his performance but he won't .That will go posthumously to Chadwick Boseman but any previous year , before the Academy's agenda changed , he would have done and it's a shame that political correctness now wins over what is actually the most deserving .If The Father doesn't finish in my top 3 films of 2021 , I'll be surprised. I gave it four and a half stars but it very nearly got the full five .Absolutely fantastic film ."
THE FATHER,2 July 2021,9/10,"The Father is an incredible drama that's emotional, complex and smart. Anthony Hopkins gives a phenomenal lead performance and Olivia Colman is incredible. Mark Gatiss, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell are all great. Florian Zeller's direction is fantastic even if it feels a little too much like a play at the beginning, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is excellent."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,,"All of the other awards available in any existing Movie Festivals. Best actor, best supporting actress, best screenplay, best director, best.... If all the mentioned not won in this year's BESTs, then it only proves that the Oscar has a serious 'Demetia' problem, just a worthless nomination farce, period.Of course, there're still some good productions this past year, but none of them could be that better than this one.Reminder: Hopkins had already played a similar role, a college professor, who got developed dementia in ""Proof (2005)"". That movie is also very very good to give you a fantastic viewing experience by his great acting and at the same time, with a great screenplay, two great young actor and actress, one great director, and all of the necessary ingredients for a great movie."
THE FATHER,4 January 2021,10/10,"IN BRIEF: Great performances and sensitive direction create a haunting journey into dementia.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) It's been a few days since I have seen Florian Zeller's brilliant film, The Father, and it still haunts me with its vivid depiction of the ravages of dementia. Other films have previously tackled this tragic disease very well. Amour, Still Alice, Away From Her, Iris, these exceptional films do come to mind, but no moviegoing experience will prepare you for this emotional free-fall.We witness Anthony's mental decline directly as we are transported to his ever-changing world. It is a jarring and disturbing view. Scenes are flipped and repeated by different characters. Actors trade roles and utter familiar dialog heard before. Items are lost or found and settings are slightly askew with changes in decor hinting at his mental disarray and anguish. As moviegoers, we cannot recognize the real from the surreal and the film accomplishes what no other film has done before...we become as dead to the real world, just as Anthony has, lost in a parallel universe and unable to find an easy escape. The emotional upheaval is palpable and moving.This is a great movie. French playwright Florian Zeller takes his play (with the assistance from Christopher Hampton) and adapts it for the screen in his glorious directorial debut and it's a stunner. His dialog captures the outrage and angst of a patient slowly being erased. Mr. Zeller's sensitive touches throughout the film indicate vast changes in Anthony's time frame (a misplaced fork, artwork that moves and shifts placement in the apartment, a whole kitchen redo, etc.).Production values are top-notch. Special kudos to Peter Francis' stylish production design and Ludovico Einaudi's brooding and lyrical music score which sets the perfect bittersweet tone. Yorgos Lamprinos removes all of the play's stagy theatrics from this adaptation with his concise editing and the lens of Ben Smithard lights and composes areas of the apartment with a sense of cluttered isolation with equal parts Edward Hopper or David Hockney.In the title role is Sir Anthony Hopkins and he is mesmerizing in his portrayal of a man unable to come to terms with his demise. He cajoles, bullies, and demands attention of those he loves. His final break-down scene is a masterclass in acting. This is a towering performance by an actor at his peak. The whole ensemble is splendid. Rufus Sewell, Imogen Poots, Mark Gatliss, and Olivia Williams shine in their transferable identities and add layers to the story, but it is Olivia Coleman as Anne, Anthony's sorrowful daughter, who impresses. The actress brings such deep nuance to her part. Her frightened glances, disoriented manner, and expressive line delivery is devastating. Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Coleman deserve every accolade this award season.Simply stated, The Father is one of the year's finest films. Do not miss this gripping movie."
THE FATHER,8 June 2021,8/10,"My Rating : 8/10Well, I really loved this film. The way the story is told is refreshing and keeps the viewer guessing - you will know when you watch it!I'm sure this will touch many hearts, it's a drama which really gives you something to feel.Go ahead, seek it out!"
THE FATHER,26 February 2021,8/10,"A beautifully-made and moving film, The Father depicts dementia in its raw, brutal essence and will surely make an imprint on your soul.The French-British film centers around aging Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an Englishman who ""has his ways,"" as his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) says. As Anthony develops dementia and his condition worsens, Anne finds it difficult to balance her life with caring for her father. The film traces how the two of them go about their lives together and how the disease progresses. The Father is told in a jumbled manner because our perspective of the film is as Anthony would see it: All out of order. Anne's husband Paul (Rufus Sewell) and another man who claims to be her husband, a woman, and several caretakers all appear and disappear throughout the film. Even the settings shift, and you're never really sure where you are. Director Florian Zeller and his crew design both Anne and Anthony's apartments to look relatively similar which enhances that perspective of disorientation.Anthony Hopkins has always played cerebral roles, so this more emotional one is unique in his repertoire. He sheds tears, flies into fits of rage, and immerses himself in the character of a strong-willed man slowly losing his grip on what's happening. The last scene is especially poignant and hard-hitting; no spoilers, though! Olivia Colman's portrayal of Anne is one that many who have dealt with a relative suffering from a progressive mental illness will identify with. It's incredibly realistic, and, at times, you forget that she's an actress playing a character. Anne herself is layered, especially in how she copes with Anthony's dementia, first keeping her emotions bundled up, escalating to emotional breakdowns, and eventually to some scary fantasies. Colman deals with these feelings beautifully, immersing herself much like Hopkins does. Director Florian Zeller isn't actually a director by profession; he's a playwright, and this film was adapted from his play Le Pére. He's a master storyteller, and you couldn't tell this is his first gig as a director. His attention to detail (especially with sets, something I'm sure he took from his career in playwriting), combined with his personal experiences (his grandmother was diagnosed with dementia when Zeller was 12) make this film an earnest yet unsettling project.The Father cries out to its viewers to enjoy life while they have their senses and to show compassion toward those who have begun to lose (or have already lost) a clear view of the world. It's a sobering portrait of mental illness and yet an empowering film for those coping with their individual struggles. There is some profanity, slight violence (Paul slaps Anthony), and Anthony and Anne's father-daughter relationship gets a bit abusive at times.I give The Father 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults; younger kids could watch the film if they feel comfortable with themes like mental illness. The Father releases on-demand on March 12, 2021.Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!"
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,8/10,"Just back from seeing this film & well... it's pretty haunting yet very realistic to life.The film follows Anthony, an elderly man slowly deteriorating from the devastating effects of dementia.I found the film to be quite moving, it has some moments of humour laced in with the more serious sad scenes, the end scene was especially was pretty sad & moving.It's pretty good, so good that's it's quite depressing & gives a realistic insight/depiction of what suffers of the disease go through & how it effects them & those around them.I noticed that the film is edited in such a way that you as the viewer are put ion the shoes of Anthony.Overall, it's a pretty good film, but it is also pretty sad & heart wrenching, not to mention haunting. The film will stay with you after the credits roll it's that deep. 8/10."
THE FATHER,20 April 2021,10/10,"You may go into this movie thinking you know what it is about. What is surprising is, what another reviewer called, the unreliable narrator. Nominated for six 2021 Oscars, this film is incredible. The adaption from stage to film is powerful (nominated). It is a masterclass in acting, Anthony Hopkins (nominated) and Olivia Coleman (nominated) are perfect in their roles. Definitely one of the best pictures of the year (nominated)! This film will break your heart and it is all the more poignant the older you are. It can be terrifying. This is a movie you may not be able to bear seeing again. I give this film a 10 (intensely perfect) out of 10. {Drama, Psychological Twister, Horror}"
THE FATHER,28 May 2021,1/10,"The movie is a raging flop. Yet it manages to get all those super high ratings? Please. The infamous scene where Hopkins calling out his momma, was more than enough for me. I see trolls desperately trying to keep the ratings up, there too. Pathetic..."
THE FATHER,14 May 2021,8/10,"What makes The Father a brilliant film is its unwavering depiction of an elderly man with dementia. The said man (oddly enough, named Anthony) is played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (who's picking up his second Academy Award win in his 80s), with fragmented episodes playing out to audiences exactly the way they would in front of his eyes. The deliberately disjointed narrative is the outcome of a masterfully penned screenplay by Florian Zeller (whose play ""Le Père"", the film is based on) and Christopher Hampton - the information presented to us in tidbits keeps us wildly guessing all through.Performances complement the writing in uplifting the film. Apart from Hopkins, the most notable show is from Olivia Colman who plays Anne (Anthony's daughter). It also includes neat work from Imogen Poots, Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell, and a few others. Editor Yorgos Lamprinos marvellously (dis)connects Anthony's fading memories and present events - faces, personas, settings, and situations changing within seconds of each other. Hopkins gracefully transitions between distressed, anxious, sad, and elated in a manner that, by all means, gives dementia a multi-layered perspective.The Father startled me in ways conventional psychological horror-thrillers wouldn't, with its overall disorientation. When I heard Anthony say ""..I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves"", it left me both restless and helpless. Restless, because I wanted Anthony to feel wholesome once again even for a few seconds, but that wasn't going to be the case. Helpless, because it could be you or me in the same situation later in life. When a film leaves that sort of aftertaste, it's either exceptionally good or downright horrible. In this case, it's the former."
THE FATHER,8 May 2021,8/10,"The FatherThe foundation of this movie lay with one simple idea, how can we, the director, script writer and cast, show the viewer what it must be like, in a very visceral way, to have dementia. They chose several clever and comprehensive ways to make us feel, confused, unsettled, uncomfortable, upset and mostly all at the same time. It was an emotional rollercoaster for anyone who has had a loved one in this predicament.Just when we thought the ""watch"" was an anchor, then the ""chicken"" was an anchor, or even a blue top, it was ripped away by cutting time, changing furniture or even changing characters faces.The bigger question must be did these theatrical tricks achieve their goal and work their magic. I think on reflection the answer must be a solid yes, by proxy we felt totally befuddled throughout.With regard to the acting, it was a tour-de-force performance from Anthony Hopkins, totally stellar in its micro-gestures, the plastic bag in the pocket, or the furtive glance at a watch. This was an obvious Oscar winner in a year when there was nothing else to challenge, however that observation does not diminish this achievement.Olivia Colman really turned it out and I would say her performance here was much better than the blank expression of Francis McDormand in Nomadland, but what do I know!This was a miserable, tedious and worthy movie that I endured and experienced, I admired its scope and delivery but I never want to see it again, never ever, and I do not suggest anyone else sees it for the first time, as it would just not be possible to enjoy this movie on any level.I give this a solid 8 out of 10 meaning its good and you should watch it, but if something is showing in the next screen go and see that instead."
THE FATHER,19 June 2021,8/10,"The way this film examines what it may be like for somebody suffering from dementia is devastating. It's difficult to imagine how it would be to watch anyone who is going through this in real life; or indeed has a loved one with dementia. One of the things best aspects of this film is how, for the most part, we are watching the story from Anthony's perspective. We see him becoming confused and forgetful. With that comes a repetitiveness, often combined with confusion. As an audience we see events happen in different ways. We're not always sure about when things are happening, what time of day it is or how much time has passed. We see parts of the room change from scene to scene. Some of the actors and actresses change, signifying Anthony's inability to remember who people are. Sir Anthony Hopkins was magnificent in the role. Totally believable. Prior to watching this film, i always thought Chadwick Boseman deserved an Oscar for his performance, but now having seen this film, I have to rethink that idea as Sir Anthony Hopkins truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. The supporting cast were also great. Technically, the production design and editing were brilliant. The way the sets and characters change from scene to scene means that we experience some of the confusion that he goes through was creative. The score was good too. Overall, a fantastically written, well acted and directed film. Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,9/10,"... the days get shorter, darkness encroaches, the past begins to fade and confusion reigns. A remarkable piece of cinema, profoundly performed and presented, both touching and terrifying and relevant - your own experience uniquely yours but one you'll never forget... until."
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,10/10,"The Father - Oscar Worthy (A+)The Father has achieved what many drama movies unable to achieve to creat a thrilling sharp portrayal of dementia that keeps you on edge till the end of the movie. The movie is sharply written, directed and edited to achieve this quality in a movie which is a rarity in drama films.Anthony Hopkins has given a performance of a lifetime. His portrayal of person going through dementia is uncanny resemblance to many in our own families. We all have lovedones about whom we heard or seen going through Alzheimer's disease. Seeing through that person's eye is truly heart wrenching experience.This a beautiful film, with beautiful cast which deserves all the accolades. I hope it won't go empty handed at the BAFTAs or OSCARs as this story needs to be seen to understand what elderly goes through in case of dementia to create more empathy in younger generation."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,,"Many films have been made about the last stages of life, but, it's hard to recall one which so doggedly adheres to capturing those last glimpses of a rational mind as does Florian Zeller's THE FATHER from the main character's own viewpoint. Adapted from his own play (with critical input from acclaimed screenwriter Christopher Hampton), Zeller focuses his entire attention on his title character, Anthony, magnificently performed by Oscar nominated Anthony Hopkins.The viewer is presented with Anthony as a widower and former engineer who is cared for by his loving daughter Annie (Olivia Coleman; also justly nominated) and a parade of day-care workers, including, most prominently, Laura (Imogen Poots). We also see Anthony in both his own flat and in that of Annie. The complex screenplay is never played strictly chronological, and there are other phantoms and figures lurking in the reaches of Anthony's mind. Scenes and dialogue are repeated, sometimes exactly, and other times with a twist. Events may be taking place over five years as easily as in one. The theme that every day is a ""new"" day for one with dementia is eloquently depicted. It's a difficult task for the actors as well, and they have to play everything straight or the movie would collapse. Hopkins, Coleman, Poots and the rest of the cast are all equal to the challenge and go beyond. Of particular note is Olivia Williams as another caregiver. Her screen-time is rather brief, but no less effective. Peter Francis' Production Design subtly but effectively portrays the confusion in Anthony's mind. Yorgos Lamprinos' editing is precise and there is a grace to Ben Smithard's cinematography and Ludovico Einaldi's score (abetted by some choice classical music).THE FATHER isn't a technical achievement (as well as it produced). It is a heartbreaking personal one. Zeller is the conductor here, but it is Hopkins who must play the notes. This is a case where one's familiarity with the actor and his long worthy career could have been a burden, but Hopkins easily allays any doubts, and, even when we recognize a bit or two from his acting repertoire, it only adds to the poignancy of the screenplay. As Hopkins descends deeper into the void, it comes not just with sadness, but, with sweet mercy for his soul."
THE FATHER,27 May 2021,9/10,"On the one hand I feel like I want to list The Father as one of the rare movies that I respect greatly but never want to watch again. However, the style of the storytelling is so inventive and different that I find myself thinking about it a lot and wondering if I should take a chance watching it again, so I can explore how they pulled it off. It's truly astounding how this movie allows the viewer to feel a bit like a person who is actually suffering from dementia. I watched for several years as my own grandfather suffered through this condition, and the movie perfectly nailed the way he could swing from totally lucid to utterly confused in a matter of moments. I always imagined it all made sense in his head, even though it was often nonsense to us. Anthony Hopkins deserves all the awards for this performance because he goes through so much emotionally in this movie and all of it felt right.If I were to complain about anything when it comes to The Father (aside from the fact that it is about a subject which is hard to watch) it would be that sometimes the way the story is told feels too smart for its own good. Getting things that happened in the past confused with the present is realistic for the main character, but when he starts mixing things he wouldn't experience until the future into his present circumstances that didn't make sense. However, it still worked for me because it muddled things enough for the audience so we were in the shoes of the protagonist. I genuinely found myself afraid when he was left alone because I knew that another disorienting change could hit him in a matter of moments. The Father is a great film that is only hard to recommend because not everyone can emotionally handle this kind of story, since it feels so authentic."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,7/10,"The failing mental health of an elderly parent is a perennial topic for critically-acclaimed movies. Most of the time, the focus is on how their supportive family watches them steadily deteriorate until they can do nothing else. The Father (2020) is one such film, but with a unique twist that makes it hit a lot harder than the standard Alzheimers fare. While attempting to present this disease from the aging parent's perspective is a bold choice, The Father leans into some radically artistic choices that might leave some viewers more confused than enlightened. I'm trying to avoid discussing the avant-garde method The Father uses to induce the kind of confusion that comes with Alzheimer's, mostly because I don't want to spoil the effect for anyone who hasn't seen this film yet. Needless to say, things make sense...eventually. The point isn't to understand it; it's to empathize with the main character. Of course, with the current era being what it is, even this fails to break through the dislike of the entitled, old white guy who ends up making things difficult for everyone around him. Anthony Hopkins certainly nails this role (especially at the end), and all the supporting characters are equally as strong in their performances. It's just that the role of an elderly white man is played almost too well. The stubbornness that Hopkins' character exudes is so frustrating as to make him entirely unsympathetic. If anything, I almost relate more to Paul (Rufus Sewell), who sees the detrimental effect Anthony is having on his daughter, Anne (Olivia Colman). I can only hope that I don't suffer from the same stubbornness when I get to the age where my mind is failing because it is not a good look on anyone. A confusing but ultimately enlightening look into Alzheimer's, I give The Father 3.5 stars out of 5."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,"THE FATHER is one of those types of films that, generally, I would not seek out - except at Oscar time. A small, ""drawing room"" type of drama, based on a stage play and starring a couple of Oscar winning performers at it's core.And that is enough to make this film very entertaining and interesting...but, unfortunately...this piece of entertainment falls flat at the end, so one will have to be contented to watching a decent drawing room drama (based on a Stage play) starring 2 strong Oscar winning actors at it's core.Written and Directed by Florian Zeller, THE FATHER tells the tale of a...well...FATHER, who is aging and mentally deteriorating. His daughter is trying to aide him and bring him comfort, but his befuddled mind begins to see things (conspiracies) that are not there...or are they?Zeller wrote the lead role, specifically for Anthony Hopkins and it is a very good thing that Hopkins agree to this role for he is in EVERY scene and commands this picture as only a performer of Hopkins stature and abilities can. Hopkins is, rightfully, nominated for this performance and could pull the upset (but I highly doubt it).Strongly supporting him - in an Oscar nominated turn herself - as Olivia Colman as his daughter. She has the much less flashy - but no less important - role in this drama and Hopkins would not be as good as he is without her to play against.Zeller (who was nominated for an Oscar for his Screenplay adaptation of his Stage Play) was smart to cast a strong ensemble of British Stage Actors for this film - Mark Gattis, Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell and Imogen Poots are all strong, interesting people to watch on screen and they help bring an air of seriousness and gravitas to the proceedings.The first half of this film is extremely fascinating to watch and I was intrigued by the premise, the direction, the script and the direction it seemed to be headed. But...unfortunately (at least for me) the 2nd half of the film (and I would imagine, the Stage Play) never, really capitalizes on the promise of the first half and THE FATHER just sorts of peters out in the end.Which, I guess, you could say for the poor souls who suffer from dementia, but I don't think that was the point that Zeller was trying to make.Letter Grade: A- (did I mention that I really, really liked the first half)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"Wow, I just finished watching this film and I was floored by his performance. When he was calling out for his mother, this grown man writing this review had a tear in my eye. This might be the best performance I have seen Hopkins play out of all of the movies I watched him in over the last 30+ years.The subject matter was also dear to me since I dealt with this very issue with my own mother who suffered from dementia 20-years-ago and how this disease tears apart the hearts of close family caregivers. I feel Hopkins did an amazing job. But he wasn't alone. Olivia Colman, Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots were amazing supporting actors too.This maybe a touchy film to watch if you have a close family member going through this because it feels so real. I would be really disappointed if Anthony Hopkins does not win the Best Actor award.SOLID 10 OF 10."
THE FATHER,20 May 2021,,"REVIEW - THE FATHERUK release date 11 June 21Dementia is fast becoming one of the most suffered illnesses, this film follows such a story.Anthony is experiencing memory loss, literary walking out of one room and into another and literally months have passed, but the exceptional thing about this film is that you experience the confusion for yourself because while watching this film you see just what Anthony remembers.Confusing yes, scary yes, powerful yes but most of all just experiencing what someone with dementia is going through is, I simply cannot put into words.Amazing acting from everyone but credit to Anthony Hopkins for what I feel is his best performance yet, better than silence of the lambs!Rating 9 out of 10."
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,10/10,"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is elderly and living in his flat. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) keeps dropping by to check he is OK. But is this right? Strange things keep happening to him, from losing his watch to having strange people turn up at the flat. For Anthony is battling against dementia, and reality and fantasy are not quite as distinct as they once were.Positives:
I was one of those disappointed that Chadwick Boseman didn't posthumously win the Best Actor Oscar for ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"". But, boy oh boy, after seeing this I am fully supportive of the Academy's position. Anthony Hopkins has delivered some astonishingly powerful performances during his career - from the tortured ventriloquist in ""Magic"", to Hannibal Lector to the elderly pope in ""The Two Popes"". But he really excels himself here, tapping both your emotions and your sympathies as the confused and terrified old man.The Oscar- and BAFTA-winning screenplay by Florian Zeller, based on his stage play, is devastating, subtly twisting the knife. It will be particularly telling/upsetting for those who are getting on in years and/or have/had elderly parents affected by dementia. I would personally not have included (being deliberately vague) the ""Williams entry"" scene in the trailer, since it is a jolt of a twist in the film. But there are so many other clever devices in the screenplay that you don't see coming. The ending in particular is brutal on the emotions.The production design (an Oscar nomination for Peter Francis and Cathy Featherstone) is ingenious, as the set subtly and progressively transforms. Almost a 'spot the difference' in movie form.The score by Ludovico Einaudi uses atonal strings to great effect, as Anthony's reality keeps shifting from under him.Negatives:
I've nothing here, hence my 10/10 rating. I've seen some reviews that have thought that the movie was too ""stagey"" (which is a criticism I have levelled before at a bunch of ""stage to screen"" adaptations such as ""Fences"" and - more recently - ""One Night in Miami"" and ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom""). But I really didn't feel that way about ""The Father"". The claustrophobic nature of the plot was well served I thought by the (largely) single set location.Summary Thoughts on ""The Father"": Dementia is a cruel and heartless disease that robs any affected elderly person of their memories, logic and - ultimately - their dignity. I thought the movie was extremely clever in reflecting this decline, anchored by the astonishing career-best performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins. But this in turns makes this a very hard watch indeed!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. There is also a new onemannsmovies Tiktok channel. Thanks.)"
THE FATHER,19 September 2021,7/10,"I had a great deal of COVID anticipation for this film having missed the brief theatrical run and seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins being awarded at the Academy Awards 2021 as Best Actor for his performance as the lead also called Anthony (which I found an annoyance at first strangely enough).The technical abilities on display including set design and cinematography in a single location (Anthony's flat) is second to none.Hopkins does indeed deliver an Oscar worthy performance as the supporting cast including Olivia Colman should also receive praise in bringing an all to common problem that afflicts many families unfortunately, dementia/Alzheimers Disease to a film.Without revealing plot the director plays mind games with the viewer. Okay maybe one then. Look at the furniture and decoration! I am sure that was the intention. It sure did confuse me!However other films deal with the harrowing subject matter in a more satisfying way and I was left underwhelmed with this film compared to other Academy Award fare in 2021."
THE FATHER,2 October 2021,,"Based on comments (and awards) most people were mostly taken by Hopkins performance in this film. It was apt, i think, he does well. But really what's fine about this film lies elsewhere.Telling a story is, i suppose, a matter of framing a subject. The ""what"" are you looking at matters not as much as the ""who"" is looking and, specially ""from where"". Literature used to explore these paths, but eventually gave way for cinema. Books evolved to a stance of essay and pure thought, but have been abandoning its narrative drive. Cinema picked up on it, and for the moment is still the medium where narratives are experimented (series are, for the moment, mere illustrations of story facts, in the Griffith tradition).So here we have a story of a man in his late moments. He tells the story, apart from a few establishing shots, no action happens outside Hopkins' scope. He is the one we follow, he is our narrator. But he is senil, and what he sees, or remembers, or says, cannot be trusted, not by us, and even less by him. What is true (if anything) and what is not? Here we enter a fantastic, well plowed field of cinematic narrative (and detective fiction) that has to do with the unreliability of what is being told: Rashomon, Roger Ackroyd, Memento... this is not the ""look at the drama of the old person in pain"", but ""how can i live in this world if i can't trust anything"".The cinematic tricks here are extremely simple (never abandon Hopkins' stance) and incredibly powerful. What takes away from this are two things:-most of the production seems to have been made around the intent to make Hopkins shine (i imagine that may have been one of his conditions to get on board), so much is focused on his character's suffering, and not on the ambiguity of the narrative-closed spaces (flats, prisions, boats) are a cinematic mine. See what Polansky or Hitchcock did with it in terms of making space into a character, making space tell the story. None of that is here... the sets are lush and fine, i suppose, but they never loose the smell of a set. Filming architecture meaningfully remains one of the most challenging subjects in film."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,8/10,"The Father. An old man with dementia and we learned about his life through his perspective.First of all, the movie was extremely disorienting and confusing. One can say that it was a big puzzle, but the problem was that audiences don't even know what's real and what's not. The first half was especially hecka confusing, and the second half filled in some of the pieces.This disorienting and nonlinear story telling was meant to make us see what Anthony Hopkins's character saw, and the director was really good at that aspect. This showed the biggest theme of the movie, which was how sad and anxious life could be for people with dementia. With how sad the story turned out, the story helped me to have a glimpse at the life of many elder people with dementia.And of course the story wouldn't be convincing and powerful without Anthony Hopkins's phenomenal performance as the father. I definitely saw an old man with dementia who tried to maintain his sanity, but slowly lost it. As creepy as Hopkins was in Science of the Lambs, here he was very sad and made us felt for him.Another good performance was from Olivia Colman, who played the daughter. We saw the pain that she went through dealing with the situation, and I again felt bad for her character. This shows another important theme about the effect of the condition on the loved ones around the patient.Overall, a purposefully disorganized plot that showed the negative effect of dementia. 8/10."
THE FATHER,29 May 2021,9/10,"Great performances, production, and editing create this powerful and sad story about an aging man with dementia who can no longer distinguish between past and future, often unable to differentiate between dreams and reality. He sees parts of his memories throughout his life, tries to grab on to something he perceives as his reality. Having lost almost all his memories, and left with the only deepest of them, the memory of his mother, aware of his own confusion, he has no choice but to hide from it all and seek protection from the person closest to him.The film hits much harder if you can relate, it's just this state of hopelessness when you know you cannot do much to help your loved ones.I definitely recommend this movie for viewing, and I hope this story will be something you will never have to experience in your life."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,"My Review- The Father
My Rating 10/10The Father is nominated for 6 Oscars this year and deserving every one of them . If there exists a true unbiased and fair award for acting excellence this year Sir Anthony Hopkins should win his 2nd Best Actor Oscar. His performance as Anthony an elderly man and the father of Anne who in another perfect role is played by Olivia Coleman is beyond superb. This is a Masterclass in cinema acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman. Some might say Anthony Hopkins who is 83 years old is just playing a man his own age . To the contrary it takes incredibly fine acting and precise timing to play a man with rapidly advancing dementia convincingly. It could only be played by an Actor of experience and deep sensitivity. This is the finest portrait of dementia as far as I'm concerned since Dame Judi Dench played Iris Murdoch in 2001 . Dame Judi who was also nominated as Best Actress in
2002 lost to Halle Berry for Monsters Ball. I feel a similar result will occur this year judging by predictions this so far . The far superior performance of Anthony Hopkins will probably lose out to a sentimental vote for a far lesser performance by Chadwick Boseman who tragically died last year. Sir Anthony Hopkins was the only choice for Director and author of the play Florian Zeller . He wanted Anthony Hopkins specifically for the part. He sent Hopkins the script in 2017 and waited for a reply. In the meantime, he did not pursue production with any other actors in the lead role. He said if Hopkins had not agreed to the film, then it likely would have been made in French instead. Christopher Hampton who wrote the screenplays for Atonement ( 2007) and Dangerous Liaisons 1998 (which he won an Oscar for his screenplay) and The Quiet American 2002 co wrote the Screenplay for The Father with Florian Zeller and both have deservedly been recognised by their nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for 2021. I don't rate films on feel good value or entertainment enjoyment alone in fact as an elderly man over 70 years of age this movie is more than a little disturbing and confronting but it's cinematic excellence and performances make it one f the great films of 2021 and if you love the craft of acting it's a must see. In all Academy Award nominated performances I look for the moment you say yes! That's an Oscar moment in The Father I counted at least 3 Oscar winning moments for the brilliance of Sir Anthony Hopkins this may be his last Oscar nominated role of his long life I hope not but I'm also hoping that he wins this year's Academy Award for Best Actor."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,"Moving from non-diegetic sound to diegetic sound of classical music the dementia-afflicted titular father is listening to while relaxing, we right away found ourselves slipping into his mind and, subsequently, descending into his deteriorating mental state. Thus, we're instantly warned that what we're going to witness of events are, by and large, untrustworthy. Adopting such narrative technique isn't the easiest to pull off, never mind when applied to a character-driven story about a man doubting ""the fabric of his reality."" For in case it failed, the story would be in total shambles (Capone is a case in point, assuming that was its intent in the first place); and if it paid off, the story would offer us a sympathetic look at its main character. Florian Zeller managed to do the near-impossible, generating empathy towards a character we're not suffering from what it suffers by tapping on the truth we relentlessly evade each time we see our grandparents, for instance, fail to recall words, our names or even to recognise who we are while they're doing their utmost to convince us otherwise. This film embraces this fear to a disturbingly horrifying degree. We found ourselves pondering over what we see as an impending condition so much so we're simultaneously letting the uneasiness dominates our thoughts while we're sitting watching the movie.Zeller also managed here to give The Father a clinical quality reminiscent of psychological horror films to keep us always on the verge of being painfully unsettled at any time. High pitched sharp sounds and disquietingly cozy furniture(s) are here to accentuate this feeling so that a little boundary-pushing moment would send a shiver down the spine along with some suppressed tears begging to be shed. And then we have Hopkins delivering a tour de force performance that will soon or later be regarded as one of his best. Through his character, we see him in an utter bewilderment, incessantly trying to figure out what's happening around him and make sense of all that ""nonsense"" in such manner that force you to do so along with him. That's the definition of an engaging performance. Another thing I noticed through his facial expressions is the that he seems to be constantly processing his surroundings as well as every words he hears. A truly brilliant performance that dictates how similar characters should be played. I'm really hoping Riz Ahmed wins since it would be his first Oscar but, truth be told, Sir Hopkins is more worthy of it. Olivia Colman is absolutely amazing as always, but it's Imogen Poots as the nurse (Laura) that caught me off guard with the scenes she shares with Anthony. The spontaneity of elderly people that can be inadvertently offensive and their fear of being mocked at or at least of being treated rather as children collide here in way that made me continuously switch back and forth between sympathising towards each of them. This is a unique, unprecedented cinematic achievement, and definitely my favourite movie of 2020.(10/10)~Spoiler Alert~A spoiler warning here as I'm talking about a certain motif in this movie, that is the ""watch"". Besides the ""apples"" in Pieces of a Woman, this is yet another deft use of motifs in movies from the last year. The watch here indicates Anthony's grasp of the sense of time and age. His watch is first mentioned as being snatched by Laura. Later on, we see Anthony suspects Paul to be wearing his watch. In both occasions, it was the first time for him to be introduced to these characters, and the fact he failed to recognise them made them sources of intimidation that threaten his supposed control over his memory. In the soul-crushing ending scene where he's with his nurse, Catherine, he says that he wants his mom but his nurse corrects him, saying he means his daughter. However, he insists that it's his mom, then he mentions that he wants her and that he's losing his leaves. Then, in a last desperate attempt to convince himself of his sanity, he says that he knows that his watch is on his wrist. From all this we may gather that his last monologue seems to sum up all his life, and his aging to be precise. His life went in full circle and now he's a child again in a pressing need of his mom."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,7/10,"Really liked this movie. Made me think of 2012's ""amour"". But when push comes to shove, there is only so much you can do with the subject. So it does kinda feel like a simple story, and relies more on the human emotion of the film. So I can respect the movie, and it's certainly one of the best in what it's trying to be. But for what it is, it will never really blow my socks off.7/10: very good, held back but by it's identity."
THE FATHER,24 February 2021,10/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've watched some incredible films during my life. Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be ""just another film"" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn't have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be.While the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller's creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by Zeller and Christopher Hampton, adapted from the former's award-winning play, Le Père. This could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but Zeller's brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist's skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. From the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany Anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective.I genuinely don't know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it's a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. Watching Anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. In fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that Anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real.Zeller and Hampton's script doesn't only approach Anthony's feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which I firmly believe was both necessary and honest. The Father doesn't shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. I have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful Zeller's storytelling method ends up being. I found myself remarkably surprised once I realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. The control of the movie's pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. Technically, Yorgos Lamprinos' editing work is as impeccable as Ben Smithard's lingering cinematography.However, it's Ludovico Einaudi's outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. From the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, Einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in Anthony's perception of reality. Zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. Being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. And since I mentioned the cast...Anthony Hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom) a serious rival for this year's awards season. Hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I never anticipated I'd shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it's not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. During most of the runtime, I don't really feel sadness or anger. Instead, I feel every character's pain because it's incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. Hopkins and Olivia Colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots also add a lot to the sentimental component.I insinuate above that The Father impacted me at a personal level. A little bit about my life: my grandfather didn't have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. Still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his ""normal"" state remains intact. I always feared that if I visited him often in his last days of living, I'd only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. This movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life...The Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. Florian Zeller's extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist's mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. Zeller and Christopher Hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. From the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it's Ludovico Einaudi's gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. Zeller's use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers' attention to Anthony Hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. One of my favorites of his entire career. Hopefully, this will be the closest I'll ever be to experience this mental condition. My personal connection to this film justifies why I'll offer it my highest rating since November 2019 (Ford v Ferrari). One of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years. Do not miss it!Rating: A+"
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,"Adapted from a play named Le Père, written by Mr. Zeller himself; ""The Father"" with its shrewd narrative makes an attempt to captivate our conscience! A fitting illustration of a cruel disease that tears apart one's happy & healthy life. A frightful state of mind where the whole caboodle seems to be breaking down!""Memories and thoughts age, just as people do. But certain thoughts can never age, and certain memories can never fade"" - Haruki Murakami'Dementia' is a group of conditions that deteriorate your memory, behavior and the typical way you perceive regular activities. The patients suffering from this not so uncommon malady fail to distinguish between what is reality and what is not! We couldn't possibly imagine what difficulties they and their loved ones go through every single day!Perhaps for that reason, the makers thought; 'Why not we do the honors?'Delving deeper into the psyche of such a patient and his gradual descent into nothingness. The storyline puts us through an intriguing pathway, where we get to descry an old man who's slowly losing his ability to function in an appropriate manner!In parallel, a Daughter's helplessness to deal with her father's newly found disorder. In spite of crumbling affection, she just wants the best for her 'Little Daddy'. A heart-wrenching portrayal, that makes us emotionally attached and sympathetic toward this father-daughter duo!Further strengthened by staggering performances from both Sir Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. I don't have enough words for the amount of conviction & credibility they offer in their respective acts. It got them the nominations in the 93rd Academy Awards and deservedly so!Once in a while, some films do leave a mark. By transcending our intuitive understanding; they simply make us spellbound. They compel us to change our perspective of seeing the world! It is clearly one of those special creations."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,"What a unique film. Told out of a unique perspective with a unique direction and way of storytelling. It is confusing but that is exactly the state of mind of the main character. We see the entire film out of his perspective. Just like him we are lost in the twilight zone between reality, memories, misinterpretation and fantasy. There is no straight line in this film and this is exactly how a person suffering from dementia must experience the world around him. In this way the film is perfect and it is something we never saw before. Another aspect which makes the film perfect are the performances. First of all you have heavy weight actor Anthony Hopkins playing the role of the protagonist. It is amazing how Hopkins portrays this role. The switch between all kind of different emotions that all feel so real and natural. He perfectly let me enter the mind of his character and you felt with him. It was like watching a real person. Hopkins is fantastic. Many say its his best since ""The Silence of the Lambs"". I am saying it is his best performance. Period.Olivia Colman was also wonderful, Not sure if she is supporting, its definitely borderline. But nevertheless its a very heartbreaking performance of a daughter who looks for the right solution and who is caring but that care is not recognized nor is it appreciated nor is it understood. Its a helpless situation her character finds herself in and Colman wonderfully brought that helplessness on screen in just the same believable way. Watching both brilliant actors shooting their acting weapons at each other is just a phenomenon of itself.The whole ensemble is fantastic. Notable mentions especially to Oliver Williams who is very underrated for her role but especially in the last third she really captures the screen with her tenderness. Great job. The direction is perfect. The way the film is set up is not an easy task to portray such a realistic confusion and transmit it to the audience surely isn't either. Great screenplay, editing and soundtrack. A very intimate movie that is important to be seen."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,9/10,"""The Father"" is a drama film directed and co-written by Florian Zeller, based on his stage play of the same name. Starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, it is one of the most heartbreaking depictions of a debilitating illness I have ever seen on screen.In London, the elderly Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives alone in his flat as he struggles to cope with his crippling dementia affecting both his short and long term memory. Anthony's daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) offers to help him through various means, from sending him live-in nurses to placing him in a retirement home, but he stubbornly refuses all assistance. As his condition worsens, Anthony starts to realise he is now unable to distinguish between events that happened minutes ago with ones that happened days, months, and even years ago. This causes him to become distrustful of his family and puts a huge strain on his relationship with everyone around him.It is a sad reality that the older we get, the more vulnerable we are to the degradation of our mental wellbeing. From personal experience, I have watched as my 98-year-old grandma deals with frequent memory loss and severe hearing difficulties whenever it is my family's time to look after her. What a film like ""The Father"" does so brilliantly is invite the audience to adopt the perspective of similar elderly individuals, showing us that their problems are way more serious than we may have been initially aware. We see as poor Anthony tries to make sense of simple tasks like remembering what location he placed his wristwatch in his flat, even though it is established by his daughter that he always places it underneath the bathtub. Something like that may seem trivial to us, but to him it is a key factor in identifying the rate at which his mind is deteriorating. Another thing worth mentioning is that he is also unable to recall what people look like, mentally superimposing other's faces onto the bodies of his loved ones. Scenes like this particularly stuck out to me as it reminded me of how annoyed my grandma must feel as she is beginning to forget things like which of her great-grandchildren was given an award at school. These are just some of the many difficulties that senior citizens around the world must face that this film shows in such a heart-wrenching manner.Being based on a play, the film makes use of a minimalistic setting, with the action taking place primarily inside either Anthony's flat or Anne's house. Director Florian Zeller uses some inventive cinematography here to depict how closed in and empty Anthony's world is as his dementia gets worse over time. Zeller also utilises subtle visual metaphors such as the brooding muted colours of wall tiles and choices in clothing to convey how Anthony's declining mental state is taking its toll on not only himself, but his own family. It is made very clear that Anne is suffering greatly as well, caring for her father through his ever-growing outbursts of frustration, which is a true test of her patience. Again, I must compare something like this to how my grandma is handling her own issues in her advanced age. It makes me reflect on all the situations where I may have been tempted to dismiss her complaints as typical old people's problems that I don't have to worry about, however, this film opened my eyes to the fact that this is something that can and will affect us all one day and that we should all try to exercise a little empathy from time to time.As one should expect by now, Anthony Hopkins gives an outstanding performance as the main character who shares his first name (so named by the director as he was the only actor he envisioned for this role). Even well into his eighties, Hopkins shows no sign that he is losing his ability to blow us away with his realistic approach to acting, giving his character a tragic sense of pathos we can immediately sympathise with. It is worth noting that Hopkins is apparently known for his uncanny ability to memorise entire scripts back to front, so this makes it even more impressive that he is able to play someone whose memory is in such a terrible state so perfectly. Olivia Colman was also great as Anne, who tries hard to deal with her father as his condition continues to diminish. Anybody who has dealt with the pain of an elderly loved one going through such problematic illnesses will find much to identify with in her character, as she wants his constant suffering to end just as much as he does.Although it is easy for films nowadays to touch on topics like dementia/Alzheimer's for the sake of cheap entertainment, this one truly feels like they've done a respectable job at doing so, especially since it doesn't sugarcoat its themes the way most others would. There's so much to appreciate in the sense of realism it presents in the long lasting emotional impact these illnesses can leave on families. Very few films have moved me to the brink of tears but I believe this one deservedly holds such a rare distinction. If you are still in contact with any elderly relatives, I implore you to reach out to them before they are gone forever and take the time to ensure they feel loved.I rate it a solid 9/10."
THE FATHER,2 September 2021,10/10,"Masterful performances, top notch direction that shows main character's illness from a different point of view and a sensitive build up that ends on a tearfully fashion makes this movie an eerie but perfect experience. Masterpiece!"
THE FATHER,16 October 2021,10/10,Anthony you did it again OSCAR MAN BRAVO. This was a very hard film to watch. I had a Grandpa that went threw this also a step uncle. This is a very hard to deal with one of them was in a old folks home back in the day he did not work in about 30s. He kept screaming and yelling he must be up at 4am to eat breakfast. Have the everything ready to go. All the time both of them had weird things to do. If i did not show up on the 3rd Sunday at 11am to see one of them. He would have a total fit. Oh every time you seen the both of them you had to remind them how you are. A lot of times also no no no this is WHERE YOU LIVE. No really sorry your wife cant come she past away 10 years ago. Then sometimes one of them would scream out how killed her. Just a Great Film Big reminder of this Medical Issue.
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*It's amazing what Anthony Hopkins can do despite being in his 80s. His work in The Silence of the Lambs is iconic but I think his performance in this film can rival that.The Father follows Anthony, an ageing man who refuses assistance from his daughter Anne. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his mind and even reality.This is genuinely one of the saddest and most painful films I've had to sit through. Based off his own play, Florian Zeller gives us a devastating film about dementia and one that I feel will connect with many people. I don't know anyone with this illness but I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for the person and the people around them to deal with this problem. There is a great amount of confidence displayed by Zeller in portraying this. The film does such a phenomenal job of putting us into the same perspective as Hopkins. Yorgos Lamprinos' editing is fantastic as the structure becomes more confusing. Locations and actors would change wth time going forwards and backwards. It was a great visual choice to have different actors play the same character as it captured the memory loss and confused state Hopkins was in. All of these elements combined gave so much more clarity to how it would feel having dementia. The script by Florian Zeller and Christopher Hampton is very well written. Every single piece of dialogue sounds incredibly natural making all of the characters feel like real people and that added to the emotional value of the story.The performances in conjunction with the dialogues make this film as emotional as can be. Anthony Hopkins delivers an astounding performance that feels all too real and depicts dementia to the best of his ability. There are some great subtleties in the way he delivers dialogues and even changes moods in a smooth manner. His acting in the ending alone where he breaks down after being unable to understand the world is enough to make anyone cry which is a further testament as to how great he is here. Olivia Colman is also excellent. She puts forth an incredible performance that showcases the pain and distress a daughter feels seeing her father in this state gracefully.The Father might just be my favourite film of 2020. It does such an amazing job putting the audience into the shoes of Hopkins' character and helping us get a better understanding of this illness. It's very depressing and I don't know if I want to go through this experience again. All I know is that Florian Zeller is a master storyteller and Hopkins deserves to win an Oscar."
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,9/10,Wow. What a terrifying movie. Give that Oscar to Anthony Hopkins already. We shouldn't even compare.
THE FATHER,5 January 2021,10/10,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This is a heartbreaking movie that really hit home for me because my own parents are aging and requiring extra help. My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my step-mom with Parkinson's, and both my father and step-father are struggling with dementia. For me, this film was painful to watch, yet I recommend it. It's extremely well made. Kudos to director Florian Zeller who is making his directorial debut full of Oscar Buzz. The movie is directed by Florian Zeller and stars Academy Award-winning actors Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

RealityTHINGS I LIKED:
And the Oscar goes to... Anthony Hopkins is a national treasure. He's sure to be nominated for Best Actor for an Academy Award and will probably win. Director Florian Zeller wanted Anthony Hopkins for this part and said he wouldn't have made this film without him. Zeller is a French playwright who had adapted his play ""Le Pere"" from 2012 into this movie.
Academy Award-winning Olivia Coleman sure has been busy lately! While pumping out episodes of the dramatic TV masterpiece The Crown - Season 03, she also filmed this movie. I just adore her and think she's superb in everything she does.
Some viewers will be very confused watching this, but that's absolutely intentional and brilliant. You will get a taste of how Alzheimer's feels.
The editing team will probably also earn an Oscar nomination for creating dreamlike scenes and transitions that mimic what an aging brain experiences.
It's heartbreaking and spellbinding.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers will just be bored and confused, thinking that nothing happened.
It's a slow burn.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,8/10,"This is cinema. So powerful, so meaningful, so real, so scary.Superb acting by Hopkins and also really well done by Colman. Fantastic screenplay and a great direction (I'm really surprised this wasn't nominated for Director).To be honest, I wanted a longer duration, as the 90 minutes looked like 45."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,,"A very simple storyline, scenario, not even with an interesting enough plot, but this movie is just so good to watch from the very beginning to the end. The script was absolutely great and the movie itself was simply made alive and real by Hopkins alone. He indeed is a great treasure to visual performing art. One more Oscar for him, please!"
THE FATHER,23 June 2021,10/10,"Plot: it's a very delicate topic but extremely well manage!Actors & Actress and Acting: nothing to say about it. It's one of the best cast possible! Especially Hopkins since he is the main character. Wow.Soundtrack: perfect!Direction: stunning, a new interesting point of view. Very well managed!Conclusions: a must for everyone. It's a new point of view, extremely interesting. It makes you think."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,"This film is genius at work! The filmmakers have complete control over the viewer in ways that is almost impossible to do. Hopkins nailed the role of a deteriorating man with Dementia who is rightfully paranoid of what's happening around him, and we as an audience are right along with him questioning what the hell is going on. The cast and crew should be very proud of this film that will last through the ages. If I could give it 12 stars I would."
THE FATHER,2 June 2021,10/10,What a beautiful evocative film.The writers took a very difficult subject matter and produced a very sensitive story that so many of us have/ will experience in one way or another .Personally my father also suffered from dementia and it is a heart wrenching disease for both the person suffering and the family and the writers managed to convey this so well in a limited amount of time.The choice of cast was superb Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman were both outstanding and delivered a masterclass performance .The film took me back to the days when I cared for my father I watched with tears in my eyes.
THE FATHER,30 October 2020,9/10,"""Why do you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything's fine.""The Father follows a man suffering from memory problems as he refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. I honestly don't know where to begin. This is a mind-bender for the ages. Florian Zeller adapted his play into a screenplay along with Christopher Hampton. Naturally, Zeller also directed the film as well. Had he not collaborated on this project, I don't think it would ever be the same. He brought so much to this through his writing and directing. The way he made this confusing for both the viewers and Anthony (Anthony Hopkins' character) only enhances the experience. The first 30 minutes had me questioning everything I was watching. More questions are answered as the film continues but not in the most conventional way. We have to piece everything together. Any when I say everything I mean literally everything. Characters, timelines, location, just everything. It's not till the last moments where absolutely everything comes together in a way that makes sense. The screenplay is strong in the sense of storytelling, though a little bit of clarity would've been nice at a couple parts, but the dialogue is even stronger. The scenes that Anthony Hopkins are in-and it's basically every scene-he has hefty monologues. Every single scene is an award winning scene for both the actors, writing, and directing. Zeller directs the hell out of every scene. He gets the most out of the actors through expression and blocking. I find that those who have worked with stage production, whether it's writing or directing, have a way of knowing how to send a message through the screen. I know the awards shows don't favor stage-to-screen directing as much but I hope Zeller can pull through.Now if Anthony Hopkins doesn't win almost every award for his role, I'm going to be furious. If he doesn't win the Oscar it might go down as one of the biggest snubs in history. The only exception would be if Chadwick Boseman wins and it seems that they are going to campaign him in lead instead of supporting now. Hopkins goes through every emotion possible and takes the viewers with him. And like I said before, every scene he's in jail an award worthy scene. The very last scene had my pillow soaked in tears. The realistic acting and dialogue immersed you into the film and you forget this is acting. The same can be said for Olivia Colman. It's funny how she didn't become a household name until The Favourite. Now there's another chance she will get another Oscar. That is if she can beat Glen Close a second time. We, assuming you don't have severe memory problems, can associate with her character the most. She just wants what's best for her father but struggles to deal with his condition every day. Almost al of her scenes are heavy with emotional dialogue. Emotional doesn't always mean sad or angry, but the emotion put in to make the performance realistic is always evident. The rest of the cast does great as well. They don't have that much screen time, with the exception of Imogen Poots, but they use every minute they have. Speaking of Imogen Poots, I love to see how much she's grown as an actress. Every role keeps getting better and better. If she wasn't in the shadow of Colman, she very well could have a fair shot for awards nominations.It's hard to express words for The Father. It's been over a week since I watched it and I still can't stop thinking about it. Once it finished I considered watching it again. Even though I had three classes the next day, I should've watched it again. Time flies by so fast while watching. What felt like 30 minutes turned out to be an hour. But it's the use of time that's done so well. Both in the sense of runtime and the time in the film, the execution couldn't have been better. When this comes out, whether it's in theaters or online, please, please, please watch The Father!"
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,7/10,"Don't watch this movie before you have to deal with a parent with dementia. It's (probably) an honest, but horrible look from their perspective."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,8/10,"It occurred to me to watch this film after hearing a review of it on Nightlife (ABC Local radio, Australia, 06/04/2021). The regular film reviewer, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, mentioned how it put you into the circumstances of the main character, an elderly man who is losing his mental proficiency. That aspect intrigued me, so I thought that I would see it and this cinematic technique prompts my headline of it being an 'old person simulator'.Anthony Hopkins heads a strong cast as the elderly father of the title, Antony (that's how the cast pronounce the name). He is fiercely independent and resists the attempts of his daughter, Anne (played by Olivia Colman), to have someone look after him at his flat. Hopkins is so believable in his portrayal of a man in those circumstances that it would be quite easy to believe that one was watching a documentary on this topic. For that reason, he deserves to be in contention for Best Actor awards this year.Despite its subject matter, The Father can be funny at times, either because of the occasional boyish charm of Antony or because of the dramatic irony of the things that he says. There was one striking moment for me though, when I caught a glimpse of Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, near the end of a sequence with Laura, a carer Anne had arranged to meet Antony for the first time that day. Antony was an engineer but up until that moment, amuses her with accounts of what he used to do. These seem like banter to me, rather than symptomatic of anything.If it wasn't for the review on Nightlife, I might not have thought to wonder if the film was playing tricks with me, with regard to a sequence with Antony and a woman telling him that she is his daughter. Later in the film you do get noticeable instances of characters unexpectedly appearing and reappearing again in different form. This is all part of the 'old person simulator' that I speak of. It's engaging as a cinematic device, as I like how it afforded me the opportunity to reinterpret what I had seen before and to try and grasp reality with this knowledge. One way to characterise this cinematic device would be to say that it messes with your head. That is in no way is a negative for the film. Some things remain mysterious without being annoying, like the 'other' daughter that Antony constantly speaks about but whom we never see.Despite the narrative device of an 'old person simulator' being used, I did find some moments more marked for perhaps inexplicable reasons. For example, there is one sequence where Antony overhears a conversation between Anne and her partner. This moment serves as bookends for a sequence. For some reason I found that bookended sequence more incongruous than anything else in the film.In the same way that I enjoyed reinterpreting what I had seen earlier in the film and feeling that I could touch reality with it, I wonder whether Antony could too, at the end. There is dramatic irony in the closing sequence and if Antony does gain the insight that the viewer can, you might feel sure that it is only momentary.Notes to self:* Listening to the music at the start of the film, I felt that it would be a Michael Nyman composition (a frequent collaborator with director Peter Greenaway) but the opening credits proved me wrong. Later on there is some, I assume, classical music which predates Nyman's compositions, which makes me think that the influence is going the other way, as far as Nyman is concerned. In any case, it might be worth buying the soundtrack to this album, as it seems to include both original compositions and classical music repertoire.* An initial query on my part as to the plausibility of the events of this film concerned the woman at the end of the film. I did wonder whether her patience with Antony was believable. Not long after that, I did wonder whether Anne's approach was believable too. In other words, it occurred to me that maybe this story of a daughter and her elderly father might be more believable in another context, for example, if set in France (the film is co-written as well as directed by Frenchman Florian Zeller, based on his earlier play). I'm not familiar with these scenarios in any case, so it might be easily plausible on both counts.* There was one concerning scene between Antony and Anne's partner, where Antony ended up crying. I did wonder whether the incident actually occurred or not.* Lastly, with regard to where the film ended up finishing, I am left to wonder whether what we saw from the start of the film actually occurs before then, as in the film being a sequence of temporal slices which actually happen and are witnessed by the viewer as they happen. If not, then that seems to me to make less incongruous that bookend scene where Antony overhears a conversation between Anne and her partner. However, it now does occur to me that maybe I am put in the position of Antony and one of his 'tests' for whether carers are thieves or not."
THE FATHER,7 October 2021,3/10,"Yes, Hopkins delivers his usual great performance, but the movie moves at the pace of a turtle, is a little convoluted in spots and has LONG pauses in the dialogue that are filled with the most irritating caterwauling. When it is all done, you just ask yourself, what is the point? Terrible film."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,9/10,"A masterpiece of human understanding of the depths of a sick mind. Everything that defines dementia is shown in this short, concise but incredibly expressive film. Nothing is more confusing than this disease, and seldom is it brought so very close in the life of a person with this disease. Anyone who knows a person who suffers from this disease will probably understand this film twice. Anthony Hopkins plays brilliantly, a remarkable achievement. Olivia Colman is looking for her own kind."
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,9/10,"It's slow and subtle psychological horror (the poignant production design parallels are powerful here, as is the intentionally convoluted time/place/person-jumping script) that ditches easy ""losing mind"" thrills in favour of a meaty, beating-heart character drama core which Hopkins masterfully drives home to the homelessness of the crushing final scene (""I have nowhere to put my head down anymore"") with the many emotions of the journey (confusion, anger, and bittersweet charm and ignorance).8.5/10."
THE FATHER,15 November 2021,8/10,"It's set in the late 2010s in London, England, and captures part of an 80-year-old man's journey with increasing dementia.Anne (Olivia Colman) has come to the end of the line with her father, Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), who has just caused his last caretaker to quit because he accused her of stealing his watch. Anne, who is divorced, tells Anthony she has met a man and will be moving to Paris. However, she will try once more with another caregiver before putting him in a nursing home.The bulk of the film is primarily flashes of Anthony's changing memories and moods. It is not clear what is reality and what is not. It's not clear where he is living until the end of the film. Did Anne actually have a husband, Paul (Rufus Sewell)? If so, which man is the husband? Sometimes even Anne is a stranger.This is an unsettling film to watch, especially if you're 75 years old! Anthony Hopkins won an Academy Award for his performance, and it was outstanding. Olivia Colman is also excellent. The other characters are a bit slippery since we don't really know what reality they emerge from.My biggest problem with the film is that most characters do not respond appropriately to dementia. But does that matter, since Anthony denies dementia's reality, and it's his film."
THE FATHER,19 September 2021,7/10,"Films that revolve around a protagonist whose life is in flux usually make for compelling stories. When that individual is portrayed by someone of the caliber of Sir Anthony Hopkins, it makes things that much more interesting.In 'The Father,' we're treated to an acting battle royale between Hopkins and the queen herself, Olivia Colman, the latter of whom is a middle-aged daughter who must cope with taking care of her father who is in the midst of a long, slow decline due to Alzheimer's disease. This is a scenario that is playing out with too many families across the world, which makes it that much more relatable to the masses.The film is pretty stationery from a set perspective, so the emphasis is instead on the dialogue between the cast. Fortunately, it's solid. The editing in 'Father' also mirrors the confusion that Hopkins' ""Anthony"" experiences, which brings to life his struggles in a way that is hard for many of us to understand.'The Father' may not seem like an example of riveting film, but it's certainly a standout in Hopkins' long storied career."
THE FATHER,8 August 2021,9/10,"""The Father"" is not an easy movie to go through. It shows what it means to slowly but inevitably lose the grasp of reality, from the point of view of a person affected by advanced senile dementia. I felt constantly confused, there are a lot of sequences where I did not understand what was happening at all, but hopefully everything is clarified by the end of the film. Anthony Hopkins delivers a wonderful performance, its interpretation is spotless. You can see the pain in his expressions, the confusion in his eyes and gestures. It is a punch of reality, directly on your face. The director managed to depict the sickness in a meaningful and truthful way: Anthony has its good moments where he laughs and he is full of life, but then, the more we go on, the more we see his condition getting worse and worse: he loses track of time and space, he swap events and people in his life, he is not able to think logically. The ending is heartbreaking, I was in tears.It is scary to see what aging can do to some people. This movie is like a lucid nightmare. It is slow paced, and lets the audience sink deeper and deeper into a malfunctioning brain. I am speechless, Florian Zeller partially restored my hope in modern cinema. I am happy to see that the mainstream market is still able to deliver good stories. The cast is small, and every single actor plays a specific role that fits in the plot. Everyone had the perfect amount of screen time. If I have to find one weakness, it would be some dialogues lines in a couple of dialogues with professional carers, that are not very believable. May this film be a lesson for all production companies: stop paying your attention exclusively to franchises and release more meaningful movies like ""The Father"". I am craving for them."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,7/10,"It is a good movie, the way that is handled the mind in this movie is excellent. What to say about Anthony Hopkins, really good performance."
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,8/10,"I am now permanently cancelling my trip to Paris .""They don't even speak English there""
Commanding Performances and great that the script found some Humor to cushion story about such a Horrible Disease.Tap Dancing making a come back ?"
THE FATHER,2 December 2021,10/10,"The Father is the 2020 directorial debut of French playwright Florian Zeller, with he co-wrote with Christopher Hampton based on his play Le Père. It received considerable praise on its release, not least for the central performance of Anthony Hopkins as the eponymous protagonist, which won him several awards including an Oscar for Best Actor. It was well deserved, but there's considerably more to the film than just Hopkins' acting.The Father is a heartbreakingly convincing portrayal of dementia, and the film's masterstroke lies in telling the story from the central character Anthony's point of view. Zeller achieves a remarkable insight into the mind of somebody with dementia, capturing the frustration, confusion, loneliness and fear of a man who is, literally, losing his mind. It's a superb piece of writing, with a narrative as fractured as the faculties of its protagonist who struggles to make sense of his life; dramatic coherence demands that the audience is allowed to do so, but only by assembling Anthony's snapshot, jumbled memories into a picture that he can no longer fully appreciate. The film is remarkable in capturing the unpleasant effects of dementia, remembering that it doesn't just cause benign memory loss, but can result in spite, anger, aggression, and deep emotional hurt to the victim's loved ones. As Anthony's condition worsens, so too does the confusion in the script: the audience is left uncertain as to whether Paul slapping Anthony really happens, or if he imagines it; only at the end do we learn that Anne really has moved to Paris, despite contradictory claims earlier in the film.Zeller and Hampton tease out the details of Anthony's past and present through his interaction with family members and carers, but obfuscate them by capturing Anthony's confused point of view in the shifting sets, cast changes and non-linear narrative. To convey Anthony's confusion, his daughter Anne is played by two different actresses, as is her husband Paul. Our understanding of those around Anthony changes from scene to scene and from actor to actor, proving as disorientating for the audience as it is for Anthony. This is reflected in the cinematography of Ben Smithard, whose camerawork manages to make the familiar seem suddenly cold and alien at times, and who uses point of view shots to make things less clear, not more. Ludovico Einaudi's subtle score helps, adding discordance at moments of confusion to create an unsettling air that reflects Anthony's state of mind.And the acting does ultimately contribute a great deal. Hopkins' naturalistically portrays Anthony's gradual deterioration over the course of the film, culminating in the much-praised scene of him crying for his mummy, and it is possibly a career best performance from a man with a very impressive career indeed. He's joined by Olivia Colman, who is very convincing as a loving daughter driven to her wit's end by her father's condition and his occasionally hurtful outbursts. She even imagines smothering him with a pillow at one point, whilst Anthony's needs also put strain on her marriage. These are painfully realistic depictions of what dementia can be like, in contrast to its occasional depiction in the arts and media as a sort of benign memory loss.The Father is hard to watch at times, but it is both worthwhile and rewarding, and as skilfully directed as it is written. It deserved all the plaudits lavished upon it, and it is to be hoped that Zeller's next feature film is just as impressive."
THE FATHER,30 July 2021,9/10,The best acting I've seen in a long time. The story is well done. Loved this film.
THE FATHER,27 June 2021,8/10,"The Father does such a great job at displaying what it may be like to have mental illnesses such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It's pretty trippy and scary at the same time, and Anthony Hopkins gives such a believable performance. You really do feel like you're on the same ride as Anthony, all thanks to the great screenplay and directing.You also have Olivia Colman playing the daughter, Anne, and we can all agree that she can act on as high a level as Anthony Hopkins. Both give great performances, and it really adds to the realism.But, there is one major issue that I can't overlook. The story gets very pale about half way through. I had to take multiple breaks because it felt so long. There's a lot of repetition, which is what the director and screenwriters wanted, but it does get boring since the audience has already seen this exact scene already.All in all, The Father brings a sad and realistic story that can and will get boring depending on who's viewing it. But I think it's definitely worth experiencing because of how well the message was delivered, and how well produced it was."

Overall rating 99/100The father is about an elderly man called Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) who refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality.Wow what a beautiful and cleverly constructed film that was very moving. The script was absolutely fantastic, some truly brilliant righting here. The performances were absolutely phenomenal, Olivia Colman was fantastic, but Anthony Hopkins was outstanding. His performance was powerful, moving and authentically told, showing the horrible effects dementia and Alzheimer's has on people, his Oscar was deserved. The soundtrack was cleverly linked with some scenes. The character of Anne (Olivia Colman) was a very likeable and strong character with how she handled her fathers declining health. The character conflict was great and understandable. The character development and depth was fantastic. Whilst also showing a fantastic balance to conflicting attitudes towards care homes and what's right for the different people involved. It was extremely cleverly constructed, it was like we were watching the film from the perspective of Anthony and jumbled plot represented his declining health, it was exceptionally well done. It also snuck in a bit of humour, the deep themes and emotional weight were very touching and hard to watch in places. The twists were well executed, and the ending was very moving.My only slight little nitpick would be that there was some unlikeable character decisions, but I sort of understood them.So overall, The Father is a cleverly constructed and beautiful film. That tells the story of someones battle with dementia so beautifully, authentically and cleverly, it was amazing to watch. It tackled the emotional themes well, and Olivia and Anthony did fantastic jobs. A must see film."
THE FATHER,28 May 2021,9/10,"The Father is a thoroughly realistic and powerful depiction of dementia. Not only are the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman masterful, but the featured perspective is an unforgettable gem. This film is definitely an important must watch for teens and adults, and accurately earns it's truthful rewards.So not only is The Father a masterpiece; it's a total experience. What the film does is it grabs and places you in the perspective of a sufferer, meaning that the devastating story indeed relies on the realistic acting. This compelling tale is structured and gets very personal at times, but still manages to be a moving drama to be added to the must-watch list.So what else can you say? The Father is a wounding, heartbreaking and jaw-dropping masterpiece in which Anthony Hopkins delivers a breath-snatching performance. Now go ahead and experience this cleverly-made Alzheimer's drama.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,,"The Father is about an ailing, old man, Anthony, dealing with Alzheimer's. He is not a sweet, old man and portrayed as a victim, but rather, is cantankerous and rebellious. We see the struggle of his daughter, Anne, to take care of him. The film puts us in Anthony's mind, with jarring editing and story that distorts our sense of time. Like Anthony, we never have a true grasp on time - symbolically, Anthony is always losing his watch - and the order of events that are happening. We end with Anthony at a nursing home - or has he been there all along? - crying and powerless. The Father does a chilling job of putting us in the shoes of someone with Alzheimer's."
THE FATHER,29 September 2021,7/10,Cleverly made film dominated by a towering performance from Anthony Hopkins.
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,8/10,"Out of the 5 films nominated for best film Oscar that I have seen (yet to see Nomadland, Minari and Mank) this is easily the best.If Chadwick Bozeman were alive, Anthony Hopkins would have been a sure shot winner. He is utterly brilliant, much better than his best known turn as Hannibal Lecter. The range of emotions on display will take your breath away. Utterly spellbinding.You would think that this would be a drama that would be purely driven by the strength of the performances. You would be slightly off the mark as the direction and the screenplay are top notch and will leave you unsettled, with their twists.Loved it. *My choice for best actor and best adapted screenplay Academy Awards*"
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,,"Only a few hours after watching this very interesting work I am here trying to find the right word to describe my emotional state during the viewing. We actually weren't only watching but we were participating. Not participating from our own volition but from the very intelligent plotting of this film. This film is about dementia, and dementia we get as an audience as we are so manipulated that we too experience the symptoms of dementia. We also go through the grief and despair of such situation. We get a few laughs to sooth the pain that is growing through the acting performance. The reality of this unreal world is atrocious as we can tell they can't be a very good ending...unless one can settle for a 'matter or fact'. But we all have our own particular take on what we would like the outcome to be. Are we kinder to...the horses?I'll have to say yes to spoilers ..."
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,8/10,"An old man and his daughter struggle with his dementia.This is a near-flawless film, and Anthony Hopkins is pitch perfect in every heartbreaking moment as the title character experiencing the pieces of his mind continually slipping through his fingers. After Silence of The Lambs, it's probably his best ever performance.The story is structured and edited in innovative ways to make us, the audience, feel as disorientated and confused as Hopkins, making us experience what he experiences in ways I don't think I've ever quite seen on film before (with the possible exception of Memento). It often feels closer to a horror film than anything else, but in a very quiet, sad, tender way that scares us by hitting so close to mundane, real world fears for ourselves and our loved ones, rather than through jump-scares, gore and violence.It's a very small story, impeccably played out by a very small cast, and perhaps some might find there's not enough surprises or a big enough payoff by the end. But it tells the story it has to tell perfectly well, and is by far the most powerful and compelling depiction of dementia ever put onscreen. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be the best film I see this year, as well."
THE FATHER,31 August 2021,9/10,"I won't elaborate here on Anthony Hopkins's superlative performance. It was superlative, but I've got nothing more to say about it that wasn't said already. Same is true of the rest of the cast - they were all amazing, but that's not my point. What I want to speak about is the cinematic brilliance of this entire experience (as it was much more than just a movie).Let us begin with the fact that the whole story is seen through the eyes of the father - which means that we the viewers are as lost as he is. We can't tell what's going on and it shakes us to the core.Now, let's speak about camera angles, in this movie the camera angles talks. They tell us things that Florian Zeller wants to tell us without saying them aloud. Think about the number of times you saw a horizontal picture of a wall with a door cracked open in the middle, but the camera didn't get any closer it was kept were we could see the wall at both sides of the door. Because Florian Zeller wants us to know there's a wider picture here - we simply don't get to see it since he, the director, doesn't want us to see it. And now let's try and count the number of long corridors with closed doors on both sides, usually dark corridors this is an old visual hint that our hero is moving on an unescapable rout to his destiny. No matter what he does - this story will end the same waySo you see, I love this movie because on top of a great performance and a great story - it speaks cinema. And now think of the fact that this is Florian Zeller's first movie. All he did so far is write brilliant plays the very first time he does cinema, he speaks its language as fluently as the very best. If that's not genius I don't know what is.It's dark and depressing but it's a masterpiece you simply have to see."
THE FATHER,28 August 2021,3/10,This is nothing like real life. I love Anthony Hopkins but this is a terrible portrayal of what living with someone with dementia is like. So disappointing.
THE FATHER,24 May 2021,8/10,"Directed by Florian Zeller An old man named Anthony(Anthony Hopkins) suffers from an extreme case of Alzheimer's but refuses help from anyone and lives at home with his daughter Ann (Olivia Coleman) who does all she can to try to help him. However it's emotional struggle as her fathers health continues to deteriorate over the year and doesn't know what's left to do. Touching and heartwarming but rather depressing film. This this is a film that touches on a rather common real world issue that affects so many families it's a story that everyone can get behind even f you don't know anybody personally however it does has a certain impact on those who know somebody or themselves have succumb to Alzheimer. The movie deliverance shows how much of a struggle it is to dealing with, however not just from Ann's perspective but also from Anthony Hopkins whodelivers one of the best performances in his career. Hand down me of his most Memorable rolls fitting to go along side Hannibal Lecter & Pope Benedict It's not a straightforward story the film is all over the place multiple interpretations and different perspectives it does a great job keeping you off track and unaware what's fully going on. Someone's would probably say that that's a problem and it causes the point to where they're confused about what's going on. That's the point You can see that they tried to make you feel more what would be like to be in his position. Where everything is not as clear or an order now things to be misinterpreted or confused. It has more immerse immersion to the audience on that note. There's One scene the movie where Ann returns home but it's indicated to the point that he doesn't even fully recognize his own daughter and she literally looks like an entirely different person to him. Constantly their points were scenes play out but they play out varied. Olivia Colman does a marvelous job you feel her struggle, you want her to do her to try to do wants best what is the course not as simple as one wish it was. They're both in a helpless state each with in a struggle. The Father manages to captivated audience emotionally and keep you invested It was a magnificent performance highly warranted of its acclaim."
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,6/10,"Usually watching a film is a bit of escapism and entertainment but sometimes it's hard hitting and close to home. This film is undoubtedly the latter.Both Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman play their roles really well and convey the toughness of the situation.My only issue was, I understood what they were trying to do with the film, but there were parts of the plot that were hard to understand but maybe that was the point."
THE FATHER,9 July 2021,2/10,British play turned into a sad two hours of tears and heartbreak. Would not recommend.
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,8/10,Great acting! Indeed an Oscar winner! He was so into the character.
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,8/10,Great acting. Indeed an Oscar winner. He is very into the character. Howey the story/characters are kind of confusing through out the movie.
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,8/10,"The best film about the misfortune of aging since Umberto D by De Sica and Wild Strawberries by Bergman. Michael Haeneke's Amour does not even come close, despite its own merits & cast. The Father operates with a multifaceted, subtle and tricky point of view as soon as it sets the perspective pattern of a protagonist taken by dementia and / or Alzheimer's disease. The script doesn't sweeten anything. The dialog acts a message of ultimate understanding. In the Kammerspiele style, Anthony Hopkins demonstrates once again to be one of the greatest among actors. The crowd prefers it generally like Lecter, Richard Nixon or Titus Andronicus. I prefer him as C. S. Lewis and the steward of The Remains of the Day. This movie doesn't hide how dementia makes someone unrecognizable to their loved ones. It does trigger a storytelling trick (by the way, as its origin is a thetarical play, I imagine how it'd have been to frequently exchange same-role-performers on stage)."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,9/10,"For middle-aged and above, we would not find the movie boring, though all the things just happen within a house, and with just a few actors.My mum has dimentia. My dad begins to have early stage of dimentia. Dimentia is my daily life, and I think is the intruder to lives of many. First we have to know it, before we can face it. I do not know if the writer has do some medical research on the illusion of dimentia patient or not. I hope he has. So, in a way, the movie helps us, as daughters and sons, to get to know our parents from thier point of view. It is simply educational.PS. It is a blessing that before my mum died, she can recognise all of us. And we will keep my dad recognising all of us too. To some extent, they can be trained."
THE FATHER,1 June 2021,7/10,"RATED 7/10
Language: EnglishSlow paced family drama told in non-linear way... other than this non-linear presentation, nothing impressive on this one...
some scenes are hard hitting and most are easily passable...
more art less entertainer...."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,9/10,"This was...just...damn.Some might say it's repetitive, has no real plot, or that the characters aren't very developed. I can't really disagree with any of that, but what this film also is is absolute bloody genius.Because rarely, if ever, will I see a film with a non-linear and intentionally confusing narrative and love it immediately without thinking about it more or watching it again, but this one managed it. For reasons I won't go into, however, because if you don't know what this is about, please keep it that way and just watch it.All you need to know is that the direction is flawless, the cinematography is great, especially for the limited setting, the structure is certainly unusual, but you'll understand why really quickly, the dialogue is amazing, Anthony bloody Hopkins, Olivia bloody Colman, and that it brought me to actual tears.The only thing I'll gripe about a little is the music, but aside from that, if everything I just said isn't enough to convince you to watch this, then...well, I don't know what to say other than you're just...wrong."
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,9/10,"An exceptional and ingenious film that impressed me. An unusual and courageous move to follow the plot of the film from the perspective of an old, senile and demented man, but I really liked the end product. It looks like a show because we learn almost everything from dialogues that don't always make sense and because ""nothing happens"" in the film, something I don't like at all, but here I really liked it. Interestingly, the lead role was written exclusively for Anthony Hopkins because the main character and he have the same name and even share the same birthday. Hopkins is the soul and heart of this film as everything revolves around it. He goes through several different phases and moods, and he delivered everything neatly and we got one of the best male roles last year, but also in the entire career of the great Sir Anthony Hopkins, which says a lot about the quality. The supporting roles are at a high level because everyone does their part the way they should or the way the film demands, for the purpose of the action and the role. A movie that holds your attention all the time and is by no means a feel good movie or a movie to relax. I hope it finds his audience and gets some award because this movie deserves it."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,9/10,"....but somewhat depressing for the over 80 viewers who may suffer from forgetfulness.Sir Anthony Hopkins gives an extraordinary performance, flanked by the great Olivia Colman - both nominated for Oscars. The film is also Oscar nominated for best picture."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,10/10,"Now this is what I would call the Best Picture of 2020 and Anthony Hopkins surely deserved his Oscar for such a complex character he portrayed.As I was watching the movie, it was as if I was in Anthony's head, trying to figure out heads and tails of everything that was going on: who am I, where am I, what's my story, who are the people around me, is it my apartment, what happened ten minutes ago, and finally, is it real at all? The cinematography is fantastic, how the transitions are made up into one big loop of events that round up to make sense but in the end nothing really makes sense when you're losing your memory to a weary old mind.I guess it will take multiple watches for me to look out for all of the details I missed to make a picture to at least seem whole but as of now The Father is a perfect representation of what's really happening inside the head of an old sick man and Sir Anthony played his part gracefully and was very touching. So did Olivia Colman and all the rest of the cast.Overall I feel like there's so much left for me to discover in this movie and this is literally the best thing about the art of cinema: that it puts a seed of wisdom or a thought into your brain and let it blossom naturally, and, when the movie is as great as this one is, with every new rewatch it will give your tree of thoughts more and more branches, colors and beauty."
THE FATHER,23 March 2021,9/10,"We don't just lose our memories when our brains deteriorate. Sometimes memories are corrupted; misplaced. Sometimes they appear to get repeated. In any case, we lose our ability to perceive the world - and our very lives - as we once did.We can discuss the existential implication of the way our minds operate another time (I have a friend who believes the human brain could be rewired to perceive time nonlinearly but still be considered functional, though I would have some questions on logistics and semantics there). I'm only here to tell you about The Father, one of the best films of this year's #KeepingUpWithTheOscars marathon and one of the most moving portrayals of dementia since Haneke's Amour (2012). Notably, this one lets us see things from the dementia patient's point of view.This is the first film Florian Zeller has directed, although it is based on a similarly named stage play of his. Sometimes (as with Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, another multi-category Oscar nominee, from the same playwright as 2016's Fences), this can be almost too obvious; the scenery rarely changes and not much ""happens"", per se.But The Father has nightmarish sequences worthy of Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things. I don't know how some of these scenes must have looked on a live stage, but they might've made me forget I was watching real people perform with little-to-no magic involved. It's hard for any of us to remember going to live shows in general, but you know what I mean.Anthony Hopkins gives what's possibly his finest performance since Hannibal Lecter, in the role of a British geezer named Anthony (perhaps indicating that Hopkins himself is beginning to muse on these things). But instead of a menacing force of evil, this is a character we all recognize too well from real life; a stubborn old goat who's certain he doesn't need any help, even as he begins to lose track of his recent memories, and soon also distant ones.Time is played around with in other ways throughout the film, but I dare not reveal too much. I can tell you that Anthony's daughter, played by the always-phenomenal Olivia Colman, begins to appear to him with different faces, different life plans, and even different husbands. Sometimes he doesn't remember the faces he's shown; sometimes he remembers them from the wrong places. The plot makes us wonder if someone is messing with him; gaslighting him until he must be dumped in a nursing home to live out his deterioration in solitude.People often wonder, what's even the point of a film like The Father? These days especially, surely escapist entertainment or something hopeful is what we need? This, to me, indicates a narrow understanding of film, presuming that filmmakers must never make films for themselves; that their duty is always to entertain, instead of translating their thoughts and worries into an artistic expression.Films like that aren't always fun, I agree. But The Father is legitimately powerful and clever in its presentation - and for some of us (especially if we're currently going through something eerily similar to what's being explored), watching a movie like it is a reminder that there are people out there who understand. It's not an Avengers sequel, but I assure you those are still around."
THE FATHER,25 November 2021,8/10,"A very impressive feature length directorial debut by Florian Zeller who also co-wrote this. It's about a man experiencing the final decline of Alzheimer's created with a clever, disorienting point of view causing the viewer to sometimes have the same confusion as the father in the title. Anthony Hopkins gives a very memorable performance, though I kind of wish it weren't, and the rest of the cast is fine, but this is Hopkins' show and it is an extremely depressing one. Also outstanding was the production design that is also clever. This is a good movie, but I had to immediately do something else as this left me far too sad. The actor, director and editor have made probably created one of the few films that gives us a feel of this terrible condition."
THE FATHER,26 May 2021,10/10,"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) has Dementia and cannot understand why things are not the same and becomes confused all the time. He gets rid of Caretakers because he doesn't like them. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) takes care of him, but needs to have him put into a home where she can live her life and he will be, hopefully, happy there.In the beginning we believe everything we see and hear according to Anthony's way of seeing things. Takes a few minutes for us to realize there are things we cannot really see or hear. Because Mr. Hopkins is what he is even when in Anthony's character, who has Dementia, the way he sees and says things we believe him. After a while we realize our mistake and we have to keep fighting this belief.Notables: Rufus Sewell as Paul, Anne's former husband who Anthony sees as real and, who tells Paul that Anne will move to Paris to be with another man and Paul tells Anthony that he, knows nothing about Paris and that Anthony is living in Paul's flat, but Anthony still believes he is in his own flat; Mark Gatiss as Bill, Anne's current husband, who asks Anthony how long will he (Anthony) live off Anne; and later Bill tells Anne that Anthony should be in a home for others to care for him; Imogene Poots as Laura, the only Caretaker Anthony likes and misses when she is no longer there and Anthony sees another woman who calls herself that Laura; Olivia Williams as Catherine, as the Nurse at the Nursing Home, who simulates Anthony's mother in the way she soothes Anthony, And there is a scene where Olivia Williams plays Anthony's daughter Anne, and Anthony does not recognize the difference. See? Will you notice?Some of the scenes are confusing, but all will straighten out in time. I am still not sure if Anne is actually married to Bill or not. I do kind of wish Mr. Hopkin's character was not named Anthony for obvious reasons.This is very sad, tragic, heart wrenching and we are at a loss like Anthony because no matter what Caretakers do, it's really not enough. As we watch this, we not only see a confused Anthony and his daughter Anne who fights back tears all the time, we think of the many families out there who have the same or similar problems with a loved family member and feel helpless.Anthony Hopkins received the Oscar for Best Actor Award for this story. For a while I thought that almost any actor could perform the job as good as anyone else, but I was wrong. This time Anthony Hopkins brought something else to the story - a kind of new dimension - and I felt as though he was my family member and I was as helpless as we saw Anne helplessly deal with everything.This was probably the best performance ever by Mr. Anthony Hopkins. Multiple Kudos. (10/10)Violence: No.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor: Kinda. There are some good lines by Mr. Hopkins as Anthony.Language: Yes, but only 2-times.Rating: A."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,6/10,"Hopkins is a brilliant actor. His performance might have worked very well for a stage performance. Here it comes across as overacting.And let's face it, while it might have seemed like a good idea in 2020 to make a movie about a confused old man, now we have Biden on TV each day.Give the Ocsar to Sir Anthony, but not one for the movie."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,9/10,"The movie is just incredible, first, the cinematography is beautiful, and the movie looks gorgeous, the acting is just insanely great, Anthony Hopkins is at his best here, giving a truly Oscar winning performance, you can fell his confusedness, you can really enjoy the good and happy moments he has with his love ones, but also the moments of sadness and loneliness too. And that's not all, Olivia Colman is also great, and you can feel how fragile the situation is to her in every scene, how challenging it is, and how she just loves Anthony. Imogen Poots has a bit of screen time too, and she is also pretty good, Mark Gatiss as always as well. Anyways, the cast is great.But probably what makes this movie different from everything I have ever seem is the structure of the story itself, the constant changing of scenarios, and actors or even characters suddenly, with often conflicting information been given by more than one character, puts you in Anthony's shoes, and see how just helpless a person on that situation feels like, and how insanely confusing everything is.The mix of this perfect story structure, with top notch performances, makes this movie just an immersive and breathtaking experience from start to finish. I loved it."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,8/10,"I watched this movie as soon as I heard it received Oscar. The movie is really good. It makes us realize how old people suffers but we even don't realize. We try to get rid of them though we know, we are hurting their feeling. So cruel! It is even more difficult for a person having demensia. Anthony Hopkins did a amazing job and it is as good as'' The silence of the lambs''.Anyone may finds this movie a bit boring as it is kind of realistic movie about elderly aged person situations, feelings. But,for acting heads down, can't compliant."
THE FATHER,2 November 2021,10/10,"It portrays what getting old is like and how it feels.This movie is wonderful, the script and the direction puts you in the place of the protagonist and you feel his emotions without even reaching that age, it is sad to see that one day we will reach that age and unfortunately we will feel unloved and abandoned. Everything is very good, the performances, the script, the production design, the photography, the music and absolutely everything.It seems to me a magnificent film, with a story that takes time to understand but in the end everything makes sense and with a very valuable lesson about being older and feeling lonely."
THE FATHER,30 May 2021,9/10,"Anthony, 80 years old, rejects all the caregivers his daughter, Anne, hires to help him, leading her to exhaustion.There are films that are good, others that are really good, and then there is a very restricted selection where The Father is in.Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman are two colossus, of those who do not need awards to be recognized.The aspect of continuity in this film is at a level that I don't remember seeing in a long time, being almost perfect from start to finish.The cinematography is really smart, confusing everything and everyone, with transitions between scenarios and characters that leave the viewer with doubt and not knowing what to believe.It's real, emotional, rational, in the midst of the irrationality of dementia, it's a desolate chaos that plants doubt and suspicion, and exposes the vulnerability and the absence, while present, of a person who is lost between memories and suffering."
THE FATHER,21 April 2021,9/10,"We are truly spoiled for choice at this years Oscars, especially in the Best Actor Category.In delivering their career-best performances in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and the Father, Chadwick Boseman and Anthony Hopkins are in my opinion, deadlocked as favourites for the Oscar.In the Father, Anthony Hopkins leaves you spellbound as a geriatric father of two slowly devolving into advanced stages of dementia.The non-linear narration and side characters coming thick and fast caused some confusion in the beginning, but the director resolves all the threads towards the end and in turn, brilliantly communicates the confusion and hysteria that must be going through the mind of dementia patients.Hopkins certainly deserves the Best Actor Oscar for this, clearly his career-best performance."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,7/10,"This movie made me sad, made me for a short while experience the life lived by family members of those suffering from dementia. The wonderful performances by these actors and actresses can never be forgotten, great directing to a great cast with powerful dialogues that ring in your head after the movie is over. The movie does a good job of making you scared for a bit and later switches you back to sadness mode. I really did enjoy this movie and I highly recommend it."
THE FATHER,15 March 2021,8/10,"The Father is a great movie. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances as an elderly father who is unlikable at times, but also empathetic and relatable too. The film is simple, but keeps you engaged the whole time and doesn't outstay its welcome due to its 90 minute runtime.It's shot nicely, the supporting actors give very good performances too, and
you really feel for the characters. Of all the Best Picture 2021 nominations, this might be the best one for me. Sure it's not the most original story ever, but it's the execution that matters the most, and by the end it hit me harder than expected. I really connected with it.8/10"
THE FATHER,7 September 2021,,"The Father is a devastating film. One man's descent into dementia becomes a gutting reminder of your own mortality. The heartbreak of watching Anthony's mind, and with it his relationships, unravel is almost unbearable at times. The film reminded me of the famous Gerard Manley Hopkins poem Spring and Fall, in which the poet begins by asking a young child, ""Margaret are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?"" He goes on to say: ""Now no matter, child, the name; Sorrow's springs are the same,"" and concludes with the lines, ""It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for."" By the end of The Father, I was a blubbering mess, mourning as much for Anthony as for myself.Read the full review on Film Companion."
THE FATHER,21 April 2021,10/10,"It just makes me want to give anyone with Alzheimer's a hug and tell them it's going to be okay. An incredibly insightful and relevant film into such a misunderstood and cruel disease. Watch it and figure out why the elderly deserve so much respect. Anthony Hopkins was perfect for the role, showing that he's still at the top of his game after all these yearsHopefully we'll find a way to end this horrible disease one day."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,10/10,"Used to work as a live-in carer for years. I am glad this story goes out and hope more people will understand better all three sides; the elderly Individual, the family and the caretaker. Thank you.Brilliant movie. Excellent acting- but obviously with the greatest actors it wasn't a surprise."
THE FATHER,25 March 2021,9/10,"Dementia.
Spoiler, this may not end well, but that's not the point.In Florian Zeller's ""The Father"", a one room play turned expertly into a gripping two hours of cinema, the blubbery heartbreak or the cheerleadery miracle usually reserved for this genre are absent. Instead we are tricked into inhabiting Anthony Hopkin's wandering mind. And it is an unsettling, frightful, place, where surroundings shift, names change, events may or may not happen, bluster resides, and paranoia reigns. Perspective is thrown out the window. Yet each vignette seems real enough to believe. The hopeful ones are easy to cling to. The harsh ones are shattering.As his taxed daughter, her father's lone connection to a world that is slowly leaving him, Olivia Colman makes this a two actor tour de force. Her conflict, to live for herself or offer selfless support, is an anvil sized weight on both of their minds. Yet it is unclear which direction she favours, if in fact she favours any at all. Sprinkled with just enough amusing asides - the obsessive infatuation with and reliance on a watch for instance - there is enough levity for Hopkins to stretch like he's never stretched before. The two leads are fabulous on screen.Just as the play starts to roll, it changes gears. The flat is different. The characters too. A promised plan is no longer on the table. What is this? Who are they? Where are we? What is reality? And who's reality is it? Infuriating, but cleverly diabolical, these curve balls are subtle enough not to jar, but they do build to a powerful crescendo. It is a bit of an accomplishment to deliver a series of deliberately confusing acts without losing the audience to frustration. Oh there is frustration, but that is part of the experience. This is not an easy view, but a worthwhile one.hipCRANK"
THE FATHER,24 March 2021,9/10,"We often hear that health is the most important thing. The older we get, the more we realize that as our backs start to feel stiff in the morning or our knees begin to ache from driving. Mental health is different because you might feel that you are in tip-top shape while in reality, those around you have been trying to cope with your symptoms for a long time. The Father is a story of an old man who is stubborn about moving to an elderly home and instead chooses to live in his daughter's flat. Or does the daughter live in his flat?He isn't quite sure where he actually lives as each day the surroundings seem to change without his consent. Despite that, he is going about his business as if everything is normal while in reality it's far from that and his daughter is the one who is heartbroken because her father is not in his right mind.It's obvious that the events are tragic but because of how Anthony acts and the way in which the film presents his ""adventures"", it feels ok to laugh. As a matter of fact, Hopkins wants you to laugh up until a certain point where both his acting and the film's mood signify that things have become quite serious. ""Where has all my life gone?"" - he says and at that instant, you can't help but feel a certain pain in your heart. What's more, your head will begin to spin in an attempt to connect the small pieces to the big picture.We all know that Sir Anthony Hopkins is a Titan of acting but he seemingly disappeared during the last decade. Turns out he has been saving up his acting for the right role and this outstanding performance puts him right next to Riz Ahmed in the lead to win the Oscar. Oh, and Olivia Colman managed to surprise once again. Like many of Sir Anthony's movies, this one is filled both intelligence and profound depth which makes you want to watch it more than once. The tricky part is that the emotions of the first experience are not so easy to get over.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and tv revirws"
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,9/10,Anthony Hopkins plays a man suffering from dementia and having to deal with his daughter Anne played brilliantly by Olivia Colman caring for him. Hopkins is equally brilliant. You feel his sense of loses his mind and not knowing what is real and what is not. The film is so beautifully written and constructed. The film is so well acted by Colman and Hopkins. At times it is hard to watch and you really feel for the characters. I think it is one of best films you can see right now. I can see why it got so many Oscar nominations. I would not be surprised if Hopkins and Colman both win. It is a deeply moving film that will stay with you for a long time.
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,8/10,"Move over ""Suspiria,"" ""The Conjuring"" and ""Hereditary"" - there's a new film that has claimed the title as the scariest movie of the past decade. It's not demons, witches or serial killers that make this new movie scary; it's something that has affected our loved ones and may affect us in the future: dementia.""The Father"" is a triumphant directorial debut by Florian Zeller, who puts us within the deteriorating mental state of our main character, Anthony. We experience his confusion as if it were our own. The film also takes on the perspective of the caretakers who are left helpless as they try to aid Anthony in making sense of a world he cannot recognize anymore.Zeller's play ""The Father"" debuted in Paris in 2012 to rapturous reviews. Its success spurred an acclaimed Broadway run with Frank Langella winning a Tony award for his performance. Now Zeller, with the help of esteemed screenwriter Christopher Hampton, has taken his stage play to the screen.At the center of the film playing the character of Anthony is veteran actor Anthony Hopkins (Zeller was so adamant about getting Hopkins for the role that he renamed the character specifically for him).With a nearly 60-year career in the rearview, including notable roles as Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's aptly named ""Nixon,"" Hopkins' performance here may be his very best. He is charismatic, fierce and vulnerable, sometimes all at the same time.If not for Chadwick Boseman's untimely death and larger-than-life performance in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" Hopkins would be the undisputed favorite to win his second Oscar this year.The world we see is through Anthony's eyes. Initially, his world is quiet and still, often filled with days listening to classical music in his luxurious London flat and taking walks in the nearby park. After a while, however, things slowly start to come apart. He's displacing items more regularly, days are getting harder to separate and conversational details are getting lost in the shuffle.One day, his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him she's leaving London to go live in Paris with her new significant other. Feeling he's being abandoned, Anthony is hurt by his daughter's decision. The next morning, however, Anthony is still in his flat and has no recollection of Paris.Maybe that conversation happened a long time ago or never happened at all. Maybe this isn't Anthony's flat - maybe it's Anne's and she's taken him in to stay with her. Maybe she has a husband here named James (or is it Paul?) and she's now being played by a different actress than before.Like a Charlie Kaufman or Christopher Nolan film, Zeller plays with time and setting to tell his story. Conversations are repeated several times over from different perspectives, adding another level to the complex task of discerning what is fact and what is fiction.Anthony's physical surroundings seem to be rearranging at impossible speeds and the chronology of events is becoming increasingly muddled. Production designer Peter Francis and editor Yorgos Lamprinos deserve immense credit for their work here as their craftsmanship helps tell a complicated story.The confusion and frustration that Anthony feels are equally placed onto us as we are never sure what is happening and what order it is happening in. It's like watching a balloon being inflated and waiting for it to pop, yet it never does as your anxiety keeps building.It's a terrifying and heartbreaking process to watch as Anthony's mood begins to darken. He never knows what is going to come next and what has just happened. He's left in a perpetual state of fright and feels that everyone is out to get him.Those around him are equally as confused and scared as he is. Anne doesn't know what to do with her father and is fighting a losing battle of keeping an optimistic look at things. Colman, a recent Oscar winner for her role in ""The Favourite,"" acts somewhat as our guide through this mess. Imogen Poots, Olivia Williams, Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell all play well-cast supporting roles.Like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""The Father"" is a superb film that you will only want to watch once. Its subject matter may hit too close to home for some viewers or be an introduction for others. No matter your familiarity, the film's take on dementia and the toll it places on everyone involved is so incredibly well done that it demands to be seen."
THE FATHER,18 June 2021,9/10,"POSITIVES:1) Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman both deliver the best performances of their career in my opinion. Breathtakingly amazing. Hopkins deserved the Oscar
2) The way the film makes the setting, mainly the flat, seem like its own character was extremely well done. I found the film becomes claustrophobic because of how much the flat becomes like a prison. Anthony is always looking at the window but never once do we see him go outside
3) The way the film plays with time and narrative is genius. As an audience member we feel like we are the ones slowly losing our minds, just like Anthony. The way scenes loop back round on each other and get seen from slightly different perspectives really kept me engaged
4) The emotion of the film was incredibly impactful to me, partly because I have experienced this to a certain extent in my family, but also because the film and the performances are masterfulNEGATIVES:1) Anthony became difficult to sympathise with at times when he was being rude, belittling or even hostile towards his daughter and his carer. I understand that this probably adds to the realism of the film, but as a character it made me find Anthony too frustrating at times
2) I wish there was just 10 minutes at the end where we went back and saw the film objectively / through Anne's eyes. I left the film still confused about which events actually happened and which didn't, in what order things were meant to have happened, was Paul really rude and aggressive towards Anthony or was all that made up?"
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,8/10,"Anthony is great as always. He is losing the grasp on reality is very well portrayed. You go through the dementia along with him. Her daughter, fragile yet charming displays a range of emotions going through this tough time. Its not only the ill who goes through the illness the one taking care also gets affected and tested. You will be left too emotional at the end of this."
THE FATHER,12 September 2021,1/10,Anthony Hopkins's one man show. Belongs on the stage. As a movie rather boring.
THE FATHER,11 October 2020,7/10,"I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, so I was really looking forward to this one after it got rave reviews out of Sundance. This film is based on a stage play, and centers around a woman in a relationship who visits her aging father, who is beginning to show signs of dementia, in London due to concerns that he can no longer take care of herself. Narratively, it's not always as memorable as one would hope, but the strong performances and careful direction carry the film home at the end of the day and overall craft something certainly worth watching.Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly terrific here. He is able to convey both frailty yet genuine shock and empathy, while trying to better understand those around him that even he regularly connects with. Colman's performance is compassionate yet multi-layered, conveying clear emotional depth. The film's aesthetic is simple, modest and unpretentious, yet it manages to skillfully and quietly play a role within the film as a whole by adding to an atmosphere of confusion about what is real and what is not real due to Hopkins' character's dementia. The screenplay is generally well-written, but the dialogue is not quite as sharp or powerful as one would hope. Despite a fleeting running time, the film is leisurely paced, which is fine because it allows viewers the ability to take in the details of the characters' interpersonal relations. Yet while very moving in parts, the story doesn't quite build up to a true emotional crescendo that one would expect from a powerful, character-driven drama. That said, the acting combined with a thoughtful tone of generally subdued reverence makes the film very worthwhile viewing. 7.5/10"
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,3/10,"Movie was done From dementia patients perspective of view ,it's was way correct from it as dementia patients tends to RMB the lines but forgot who's the person say it. But it's way wrong to put in the movie that was dull due to its repeatedly lines and Scene.luckily the performance by all cast was superb.that's many movie about dementia was sad and touching just 10min way better than this movie."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,7/10,"I guess the titel says it all. One thing I learned, though, is that Olivia Colman did not put up any kind of act when she did the Queen. Apparently that is how she looks and talks, because she looked and sounded identical in The Father as to her appearance in the Queen."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,8/10,"If you've ever known anyone with Alzheimer's, this film and it's brilliant deconstruction of time and place do an incredible job of capturing the confusion and disorientation of dementia. It's so well written and masterfully laid out, you won't understand all the fragments yourself at first. Brilliantly takes the viewer into that frightening and upsetting experience. And what can I say about Anthony Hopkins performance? He's been turning in one great performance after another for decades, and this is one of his best ever. Not an easy film, but well worth the watch."
THE FATHER,8 November 2021,9/10,"This film will tug at your heart strings. Anthony Hopkins takes us on a ride that many of us will deal with someday, dementia. With every emotion he acts out you feel that emotion deep in your soul. After the movie it took awhile for myself to disengage from it."
THE FATHER,21 April 2021,7/10,"Anthony Hopkins delivered one of his greatest performances. I would have enjoyed the movie more, if it wasn't that depressing and sad."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins performance in this film is so unbelievably, amazingly heartbreaking.Florian Zeller tells a story focused around dementia that is super well edited and will take you on a wild, jarring, ride that's complimented beautifully with a very serene and emotional score.I did feel like for an hour and a half runtime it was a bit slow, but I was in for the ride and the pacing never bothered me at all. This film really messes around with time, reality, and perception in such a fascinating, confusing and heartbreaking way that seemed really special and unique.It's definitely worth the watch especially for Hopkins breathtaking performance alone."
THE FATHER,11 September 2021,9/10,"This movie is like a maze, we're taken on a journey through Tony's mind. Tony's who suffers from dementia cannot recognize the people around him. Zeller manages to manipulates the audience to experienced the same thing, unable to fully understand what's going on and never know who to trust thus making this movie a bit terrifying.While the frequent changes of perspective can cause quite a confusion, what's happening throughout with the apartment design is cunning and subtle. Little changes to major changes can be seen throughout the movie, from tiles to cabinet pattern to the clothing and even plastic bag, it was really neat. Different color palettes and different layouts were use to tell whose character perspective are we looking at.Hopkins performance was off the roof, he was charismatic and playful but sometimes cruel. Definitely one of his best performance. To sum it up this movie was horrifying, compelling and confusing, I had a great time."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"The movie The father by Director Florian Zeller is about what aging does to a loving relationship between a father Anthony (actor Anthony Hopkins) and a caring daughter Anne (actress Olivia Colman) . Early signs of dementia and Anthony sitting alone in his chair with vivid memories of his two daughters , Anne who is alive and Lucy who died years back are depicted very well. Coming in and out of past into the present oblivious to who is around him, Anthony interacts with guests in his usual charming manner. Anne as a patient and caring daughter who shares with her dad the unhappiness of losing her only sibling is authentic. Anne listens to her father talking proudly about artistic talents of Lucy who is long gone but father makes it sound like Lucy is alive . Screenplay by Florian Zeller and Christopher Hampton is excellent. Antony Hopkins as the father is great. Loved the scenes when Anthony is trying to get up from his chair, scenes where he patiently tries again and again to slide his arms into sleeve of sweater while Anne watches father struggle with simple acts taken for granted , scene while driving Anne gently puts her hand on dad's hand and he avoids the touch. Olivia Colman is extremely talented and was adored in the movie The favourite . Anthony Hopkins , great in movies like Silence of the Lambs and The Two Popes , is definitely perfect as The father. Oscar worthy Direction, screenplay, editing. Oscar worthy acting by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. My first movie on the big screen after 365 days.97minutes of best emotional display."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,8/10,"Just look into the film only because Anthony Hopkins won the Best Actor award at Oscar 2021, but along with his performance the film provides something new. Already went through lot of movies dealing with the subject, 'dementia' or some sort of mental problems but this one found a different path of story telling. A new way of narrative technique were we just fell along with Anthony and the surprises on his way and the revelations that he is undergone. He was exceptional in his role and that is unquestionable because we saw the shade in the well-known Hannibal Lector. This one is completely opposite to it because the physicality is even less here than in The Silence of Lambs. Here he is an octogenarian, a man struggling with dementia. Hopkins wonderfully carried that character. Not but the least Olivia Colman's Anne was also superb. Hats off to the production designer and the Editor too."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,10/10,"I started watching the film not knowing what to expect. Then, throughout the film, it was twists and turns, one after the other... so beautifully and elegantly done. Anthony Hopkins was superb, an absolute masterpiece of excellent acting. Just amazing...BTW, the other actors were excellent - Olivia Colman was super, Mark Gatiss, as usual, excellent, the nurse, the carer, the husband... all wonderfully portrayed. Watch it again??? Yes, definitely!Highly recommended - and the final scene was powerful and emotional.!WoW!"
THE FATHER,23 October 2021,5/10,"Dementia is distressing
The Script is cleverly woven to show us what its like to live through dementia from the view of the victim. Anthony Hopkins does a wonderful job of portraying the victim. The change of principle characters is confusing but imagine how upsetting it is for someone actually living through it.The sound is ok
The Photography is ok
The Acting is GoodIts worth a watch 👍"
THE FATHER,17 September 2020,8/10,"TIFF 2020 12
The Father
Base on the stage play by the same name, director Florian Zeller adapts his own play to the big screen, telling the story of Anthony (Sir Anthony Hopkins), an elderly man dealing with severe case of Alzheimer disease with some stages of dementia and his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) who tries her best to take care of her father.With the help of an unconventional script and some illusion-inducing cinematic techniques, we are seeing the most parts of the film from Anthony's viewpoint. Some scenes repeats themselves with completely another character replaced, some elements form the set are altered or entirely disappeared, even the house Anthony is living in may change completely and through these modifications we get to experience the dementia that is affecting Anthony (or many real life people for that matter) and his sense of perception.This film makes brilliant use of every part and aspect to tell its story in the most compelling and intriguing way possible. Both performances by Hopkins and Colman are phenomenal and writer/director Zeller knows exactly what he wants to do and does it with eagerness and care. It is not certainly enjoyable per se, but it is surely thought-provoking and memorable."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"""The Father"" blew me away! Anthony Hopkins is getting all manner of accolades for his performance and deservedly so, but Olivia Colman is brilliant too.The film plays out from the point of view of the man with Alzheimer's. Consequently, the storyline is hallucinatory, disjointed, confusing, filled with internal contradictions, and makes dizzying leaps in time. All that works to the movie's advantage as it shows us how that loathsome disease will turn a once-vital man into a desiccated husk of his former self.Having witnessed the ravages of Alzheimer's as it destroyed two people I loved, I found a lot to relate to in ""The Father."" One example is the fantasy segment in which Ann imagines herself choking the life out of the old man. She has these thoughts not out of malice or resentment, but because she wishes to end her father's suffering, as well as her own.One issue the film does not address is finances. The characters are well off enough that when Ann makes the heartbreaking decision to put her father in a nursing home, he gets a private room in a comfortable-looking facility with a nurse who gives him one-on-one attention.Having once held a driving job for a pharmacy, I delivered to a lot of nursing homes. Many of them stank of urine and feces, crammed several patients into a room, and were severely understaffed so that one-on-one care was impossible. I would be interested in someday seeing a film about Alzheimer's in which the victim and his loved ones are working-class or poor.Having seen only a handful of movies from the Year of Covid, I can't say for sure that ""The Father"" is the best film of 2020. It is, however, the best one I've seen. This is nothing to watch if you're looking for escapist entertainment; but if you want a film for the ages, you've found it."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,8/10,"Wow wow Anthony Hopkins and the director did incredible work , the story is very simple but the way they show you how the mind tricks the old, yes the movie is emotional but it is worth every minute ."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,10/10,"One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. It's one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony, but with the underlying vigilance that what's ""wrong"" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of one's rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible, and it's what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins' performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall, a very intense yet rewarding viewing experience that no one should miss out on. Do yourselves a favor and check it out!!!"
THE FATHER,7 October 2021,8/10,"Oh my God!!!! I really dont have words to explain this movie. I really live the way in which we are also passing through the same disease from which Anthony is passing through. I really was so much curious to know what happens in end so that I know what was happening in this whole movie. And in last scene after watching it,I like kind of felt the numbness of my life and and saw it very closely. The way Anthony acts Oh God it was toooooo perfect. I can watch this movie again and again seriously. I do got the movie but for 100% complete satisfaction I watched the explanation of this movie and after watching it I love this movie even more."
THE FATHER,18 July 2021,10/10,"This movie is mind-blowing. Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting. Who would've thought that after 30 years of his legendary Hannibal Lecter, he would top himself with this one? I look forward to more Anthony Hopkins films to come!"
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,2/10,"The movie has some meaning but is overly repetitive and dull, highly overrated. Except for the perfect acting from hopkins the whole movie can be told in 15 minutes reducing all the unnecessary repetition and drag, which the story is completely empty. If you want to see a better movie of this kind watch a moment to remember or the judge, where these movies actually has a much better emotional story with characters development relating to the disease. I am kind of surprised how so many people are unaware what kind of disease this is and feel shocked to see this movie. Also people should avoid having too much cakes and alcohol at old age. Cakes and bakery uses baking powder that contains lots of aluminum can cause dementia and oligozoospermia, rather eat more apples or apple pectin that repairs neuron by increasing the brain derived neurotropic factor."
THE FATHER,6 July 2021,9/10,Absorbing Drama with Alternative Perspectives never seen before.An original and Personal Take on Mental Illness and an unforgettable Hopkins Performance Bravado only Anthony is known for.A can't-Miss- Movie!
THE FATHER,21 April 2021,9/10,"It is a different kind of ride that this movie takes you on, to see the perspective of demented father and the pain and struggle he had to go through everyday it makes you feel quite confused and not sure, at the same time gives you a deeper gaze at the atmosphere of such a house that has the same case. It is so dramatic and a real life situation that you may be put through someday which is pretty darn scary."
THE FATHER,4 October 2021,9/10,"What an unbelievable performance by Anthony Hopkins.The Father is a proper experience - beyond sitting back and enjoying the movie - and it stays with you for hours, or even days after. The journey throughout that hour and half is as emotionally intense as anything I've seen.What a film."
THE FATHER,28 August 2021,6/10,A dying man gets mental issues as aging. The only one he knows is his daughter. The shot of movie is quite confusing. It is hard for audiences to know which scene is real and which one is not. It is so confusing.
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,6/10,"The Father is a good film with great performances and about the mind of a man suffering from dementia. It starts off like a typical father/daughter drama but as it progresses it takes a serious turn and we are left wondering what actually happened and was everything we witnessed just delusions?Anthony Hopkins is at his top of his game here, his performance is as good as Emmanuelle Riva in Amour which deals with a similar topic but depicted in a straight forward and unambiguous manner. The problem with The Father is not the concept but rather the presentation, the entire film feels like a play. Right from the production design to the dialogue, even the actors walk into the scene like its a performance stage."
THE FATHER,1 October 2021,9/10,"A devastating portrayal of Dementia told through a masterpiece of a film, where the audience is thrust into the mind of Sir Anthony Hopkins and gives you a truly unique experience of how it feels when your reality crumbles and changes every 5 minutes, you dont know what or who is real anymore, you lose your perception of time. We, the outsiders, in our ignorance, might get annoyed or angry at their hysterics but we dont know how their world is crashing down around them and they can just helplessly watch. Sir Anthony gives one of his career best performance, rivalling his Hannibal Lecter, and breaks our heart into million pieces. Olivia Colman is also superb as his daughter. The set design, editing, direction, music, cinematography all are top notch. A really important film for understanding Dementia and its Terrible Reality."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,7/10,"Florian Zeller's first job as director manages to move by capturing the story of Anthony, an old man being little by little consumed by dementia accompanied by the help of his daughter who does what she can in this vulnerable situation for both of them.First of all, the choice of how we see the film from Anthony's perspective makes it confusing at first for the viewer since it is not possible to differentiate the plane from reality, but when you realize that it is intentional it is a tool that you achieve. Empathize much more with the character and the pain is shared. It is a script that, as I said at the beginning, confuses but achieves emotions with the situation and with the main character, for my taste I prefer something more linear but I admit that it convinces and captivates.The color palette is magnificent, everything accompanies the scenes and vibes of the characters.Anthony Hopkins is not surprising, he is simply the acting beast that we are used to. Every time it generates more pain to see him and his face of not understanding and not knowing why, the final scene of him asking for his mother destroys you, 10 points.However, on the side of Olivia Colman I left much to be desired, I do not know if it was the expectations for what was said or that but her character did not reach me, I feel that I achieve emotions but not to the maximum, each scene that appeared a break for know more about her character, it was cut. I did not finish meeting that daughter with so much pain, I do not know if it was the script that failed to highlight her character or the linear interpretation of Colman that left me nothing but a neat performance."
THE FATHER,14 April 2021,8/10,"This is the kind of movie which needs to be seen at least twice. Once in a lifetime one gets to see a performance so perfect. Anthony Hopkins plays a 84 year old man ( his real age) battling dementia , senility and a fading memory where he keeps forgetting names, faces, events and even timelines. His is a performance full of nuances, subtle, refined and memorable. When told by daughter Anne that she is leaving for Paris, Anthony ( also his name in the film) is bitter and says that rats are abandoning ship. He also keeps talking about his late younger daughter as if she was still alive. The film should relate to everyone since we have all seen old relatives with similar ailments.Director Florian Zeller skillfully uses different actors for same characters within the confines of the claustrophobic London flat. The director brings out the angst, distress, confusion and frustration of Anthony so effectively as he weaves the riveting narrative. It is a treat to watch Anthony as he cajoles his carer and does some tap dancing for her.The location of this film is the flat, and for immensely talented Anthony this is his stage where he delivers his lines with mastery. ( Luckily for audience the verbal communication of Anthony is perfect ). The most touching moment is towards the end when Anthony breaks down in a sort of catharsis as the carer comforts him. "" I am losing all my leaves "" he says sadly.The camera and characters do not move out of the flat. Only once the camera moves to the window to look outside and see a little boy playing and Anthony smiles. The film has excellent cinematography , editing and sound."
THE FATHER,20 September 2021,6/10,I can't decide if its a clever movie that's about dementia or just a clever movie that uses Alzeimers as it's medium. Anyone who has experienced Alzeimers knows these movies are just popcorn representations of what's involved .
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,9/10,"I have seen all this, all of it firsthand with my grandmama. Every thing, every nuance, every situation and every conversation was very true and real. You have to understand that it's not a piece of fiction anymore.Olivia Colman, since discovered has been in such amazing projects that it's incredible. Sir Anthony? He has always been a legend. Hope he gets his first Oscar with this movie. Liked Riz Ahmed but he'll get a chance soon! Cheers!"
THE FATHER,2 October 2021,2/10,"Let's be honest, Anthony Hopkins is a brilliant actor and he is certainty not letting us down in The Father. Unfortunately that alone doesn't save this movie. The storyline looks very promising at the surface but unfortunately it is nothing but a bad excuse for attention. Drama and mystery are here misused to distort the image of a tragic disease, which basically is exploiting the disease to get creds and good reviews."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,"This movie is highly recomendable, it is great, solid direction and performances, I hope Mr Hopkins get the Oscar Award, very good work, amazing movie."
THE FATHER,25 September 2021,4/10,"I don't like this movie, it is a boring movie and it is not upto mark."
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,9/10,"Such a moving film. Anthony Hopkins is the star and is brilliant and kudos must be given to the writer and the direction. This movie portrays the confusion and frustration of all the parties involved. I loved this from start to finish. Sad, depressing but poignant."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,10/10,"This is one of the hardest movie reviews I've ever had to write in my life.Mainly because of the films subject matter, Dementia.I've seen my own father succumb to this dreaded disease and it scares the hell out of my, worse than any horror movie I've watched.I sadly remember some of the last words my own father spoke to me were, ""Be a good boy at School today.""
I was 46 at the time.The beauty of ""The Father"" is how Director, Florian Zeller, takes you into this descent of losing your grip on reality through the eyes of the marvellous veteran and Academy Award wining actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins.At times his character Anthony is part Hannibal Lecter and at others a peaceful, but confused ageing Father to Olivia Colmans, Anne.Another Academy Award winner who puts in a highly believable performance as his daughter who's trying to deal with helping a man who refuses to accept assistance from her or carers.Fun Fact: Colman was named Anne is both roles she's been Oscar nominated for.Also great supporting roles form Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell.Overall ""The Father"" has been nominated for 6 Oscars, after already having over 20 wins in other awards and once you've seen this film you'll know why it deserves to win in Hollywood.At 83, Hopkins, is the oldest winner of a Best Male Actor BAFTA and a dark horse to scoop up the big one.This film feels like everything he has learnt in his craft is on display effortlessly for 97 minutes.It's hard to believe this is Zellers' feature film directorial debut, because it's a masterclass in cinema adapted from his own acclaimed play ""Le Pere"" from 2012.The role of Anthony was specifically written for Hopkins.One of the things that got the living legend to agree to this film apart from the top shelf script (adapted by Christopher Hampton) was the inclusion of one of Hopkins favourite pieces of music from Georges Bizet Opera ""The Pearl Fishers"".He's always dreamt of making a movie with this music in it.With lines from Anthony like: ""I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves"" ""The Father"" is so close to perfect I'm giving it 10 stars."
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,8/10,"The choice of jarring cuts and filming style hyped up the tension of a horrific film of the disintegration of a once keen mind
Hopkins is perfect in his magmatic performance
Just don't expect an uplifting ending with this type of story material."
THE FATHER,3 June 2021,9/10,Very experimental movie with Hopkins' phenomenal performance. Must-see for everyone.
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,9/10,"The outstanding film by Florian Zeller brings vivid depiction of the ravages of dementia taking you to an unforgiving brutal journey seen through the sufferer's perspective...This remarkable cinematic art, profoundly performed and presented, will expose you to touching feelings and terrifying moments while staying relevant and truthful to the reality which is mysteriously blurred through the deceptions of the brain.A must see for all of those who enjoy a good masterpiece!"
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,9/10,"If you have elderly relatives, or know anyone with dementia, then you will find this movie a terrifying watch. Having been in Anne's position myself I feel desperately for her character and I would have this movie firmly categorised in the horror category.Hopkins is absolutely at the top of his game and the script, sets, supporting cast and direction provide an exquisite but heart-breaking composition."
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,9/10,"Poor Anthony. He is confused. Who's taken his watch, what's happened to his daughter, and where the hell is he? He is confused, but defiant. He refuses help. He insists he will outlive those who are plotting against him. If you know someone with dementia, or even if you don't, this film will ultimately make you feel sympathy for the one who has it yet does not realize it. It's like being in a hostage situation, while being stuck in a time warp. Such a person, like Anthony, may be irritating but is ultimately to be pitied. You wouldn't want to be in his shoes. ""Nobody tells me anything,"" he declares. ""I'm not an idiot,"" he insists. These are statements someone with the condition would typically make. Anthony Hopkins plays Anthony brilliantly, and he is well-supported by a competent cast. Go watch this movie, and leave with eyes opened."
THE FATHER,22 June 2021,8/10,"Last movie I saw I liked of his was his supporting role in Meet Joe Black, he's acting just gets better with age... This time dealing with Dementia and questioning his every move, very well made and supporting actress Olivia Coleman, playing his loyal daughter... Very moving to watch... Cleverly made leaving the audience questioning what's real and feeling disoriented, a great movie!"
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,8/10,"Let me start off that this is my second viewing before I rate it..Of all the best movie nominees I kinda of watched this movie first with great expectations but it is just feels kind of a drag from my first watch so decided to give it another try after watching the rest of the nominee before coming back to this artsy movieMy review is this movie indeed is a tragic and is was shot in the actors perspective which is a newAnthony Hopkins was really great with Olivia Colman too, the scene where he switch from a good and funny conversation to a hostile and confrontational type of figure was mesmerisingAs well as the mummy scene was uncanny I really hope Anthony won for best actor in this category he is far more deserving that Chadwick Boseman..The things I don't really like about the movie is the pacing and the confusion that make me feels regarding which scene is real from imagination.. may be this is what the directors trying to achieveOf course this movie will not be the best picture I hope the academy won't disappoint me in the acting categoryIf it wasn't for Hopkins and Colman uncanny performance I would definitely rate this movie 5-6I am rating this higher purely on the acting not the story line."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,8/10,"The Father is a movie that starts with subtle elements to soothe our mind. The film goes on keeping a steady pace from start to finish which will be suited for many people but not for everyone. Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Williams literally put their soul into this film and delivered their one of the best, especially Anthony Hopkins who's character is so damn enjoyable in the whole 90 minutes run. Screenplay is put together so well. With all it's elements combined this movie has its own thing to bind the audience in it's own thrill and questions. Overall The Father is a movie which everyone will recommend others to watch. For some people it may fall in one time watch club and for others it will take position in multiple time watches."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,10/10,"""Meu pai"" Eu amo o Anthony Hopkins em todos os seu papéis. Mas acho que de fato esse foi o papel mais difícil, porque é difícil de assistir. Angustiante. Aterrador. A velhice é assustadora, e através dos olhos dele e de sua incomparável performance não há como não se envolver com esse drama. No Google Play. I love Anthony Hopkins in all of his roles. But I think that was in fact the most difficult role, because it is difficult even to watch. Distressing. Terrifying. Old age is scary, and through his eyes and his incomparable performance there is no way not to get involved in this drama. On Google Play. #movieslover #googleplay #anthonyhopkins."
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,9/10,"This film is a special reminder of how grand and extraordinary Anthony Hopkins is as an actor.I've seen many films that examines from different angles the subject of mental deterioration such as alzheimer's, but I think that this film portrays with harsh realism the essence of dementia, and how it can damage, hurt and torture a person on a daily basis. And how it can impact his surrounding. Florian Zeller combined his directorial skills and artistic vision with Ben Smithard' steady work of cinematography to bring the senses of confusion and ignorance to the viewer, so that we would feel gradually a pure and sincere connection with the main character. Putting Anthony Hopkins' performance aside, the whole cast from Olivia Colman to Rufus Sewell did a brilliant job.A truly fantastic work that deserves all its awards and nominations this year."
THE FATHER,4 May 2021,10/10,"What can I say? I just watched The father and I'm speechless. Anthony Hopkins is an acting genius. It doesn't matter. Silence of the lamb, Westworld, it don't matter, he always takes acting to another level. That Oscar was well deserved sir.Pairing him here with Olivia Coleman was like a match made in heaven. Every human should watch this movie."
THE FATHER,18 August 2021,8/10,"I like it very much. It belongs to high-level works at the script and performance levels. Adapted from the stage play, the scene is more concentrated and single, but it can go deeper into the character's heart and create a strong sense of narrowness. The fragmented narrative not only enhances the sense of suspense, but also peels off the reality of the later life layer by layer, adding a heavy weight to the hearts of the audience. Although there are many films about Alzheimer's disease, there are few that can make the audience of all ages have such practical experience. From this level, this film should not only remember Hopkins's exquisite acting skills, but also applaud the humanistic care of this film. It is one of my biggest regrets in 2021 that the film group did not make the film and brought more viewers to see it."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,8/10,"Hopkins' performance is an amazing piece of art. One of the best performances I have ever seen. The film is also really good, but if it wasn't, just watching Hopkins' performance would make it worth watching. Awesome, amazing acting."
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,9/10,"A realistic, touching yet terrifying, mind bending and absorbing film with great dialogues, amazing performances, settings and story.And Anthony rules!"
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,8/10,"This was the last movie I saw from the main Oscar categories and I was very surprised, I knew what the movie would be about but I wasn't expecting how the director would tackle it.It's a story about how dementia affects a relationship between a father and his daughter, but what makes it original is how we are presented the story, we see the movie as if we were in the mind of Anthony Hopkins and how scary the distortion of reality can be when you suffer from such an awful disease.It's both scary and fantastic in terms of how we the spectator have the chance to experience the downward journey of someone who starts to lose sense of what's around him.It has brilliant performances as you would expect and indeed I haven't seen Hopkins do such an amazing job for a long time, it was for sure one of the best performances of the Oscars this year, I would put it side to side with Boseman's but its definitely a class act!"
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,8/10,"Great intelligent movie with an extraordinary cast. 2020 wasn't a great year for movies (lol), but I guess The Father should grab maybe 2 or 3 Oscars? I mean, who else deserves it? Maybe Nomadland for best Actress, but that's it. Well, this is my opinion anyway. Enjoy the movie and respect all elderly people."
THE FATHER,8 August 2021,9/10,"The lead, Anthony Hopkins portrays his role and character so well, this is an amazing acting job by Hopkins. Now the story, the story was made brilliantly. I was very emotional in those closing minutes of this film.Overall 9/10."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,"Sir Anthony Hopkins, I applaud you."" Who am I really? You're Anthony.I reckon my mom gave me that name, what a beautiful name.""Character played by ANTHONY HOPKINS."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,9/10,"An award-winning play is being made for the big screen - and by its director, who had no previous film experience. Can that work? Florian Zeller proves that it can. Dementia-stricken and proud Anthony learns from his daughter Anne that she will soon be moving to Paris. From then on, Zeller narrates the successive decline of Anthony's mind in complex but highly emotional and, above all, human ways.Anthony Hopkins is ideally cast for the lead role of Anthony. On the one hand, he is an empathetic father who means well for his daughter, but on the other, his pride and one-dimensionality make him sullen and critical of her decisions. Hopkins has never been seen in this simplicity. His character does not want to accept that his illness is getting the upper hand and is sure that he can manage without the help of care. At the same time, the increasing memory loss is told exclusively from his point of view, which automatically leads you to sympathise with the protagonist despite his often impossible deeds. This sympathy factor that Hopkins permanently carries with him makes it much easier to relate to him. It is arguably his best performance since his legendary one as Dr Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, albeit much more nuanced and realistic. While the strong female role at his side then was Jodie Foster, this time it is Olivia Colman as Anthony's daughter Anne. She logically disagrees with her father and does everything possible to organise the help he needs before she leaves for Paris. Colman is the heart of the film. She is heartbreaking in this role and often cannot emotionally withstand the pain that the sight of her suffering father causes her. Her chemistry with Hopkins is also very deep and often one would think that the two actually share this kind of father-daughter relationship. Colman is fragile in her individual scenes, but also forcefully strong and always torn about her father's treatment. Rounding out the great cast are Imogen Poots, Rufus Sewell and Olivia Williams, all constantly taking on different roles due to the confusion in Anthony's head. Williams in particular adds an enormous amount of vulnerability to her few moments, especially the final scene.Zeller has succeeded in a very particular kind of filmmaking with The Father. In its simplicity, the film is nevertheless very complexly constructed, especially in the first hour, and one cannot believe that dementia can apparently really trigger this process in a person's head. Because Hopkins does such a fantastic job of translating this and the editing also relies very effectively on surprise and suddenness, it never becomes too much to bear. Zeller also manages not to make the film seem exclusively sad, but also enriches the plot with thoroughly funny interludes. Basically, however, The Father is a sentimental drama that continuously makes hearts beat faster and that you can hardly get through without shedding a tear. An instructive, authentic and fascinating piece of filmmaking that is an absolute hit for a directorial debut and should be seen by everyone despite the vehemence of its subject matter."
THE FATHER,6 October 2021,10/10,"I usually won't watch films about this subject, due to real life. Our family has had to deal with a lot of dementia, genetically, and early onset. So I have avoided the subject for 60yrs.But quality films like this one are extremely difficult to find these days, and I figured Anthony Hopkins would be good for it (didn't know he won an Oscar for it, as I don't keep up with the mostly corrupt awards industry), so I had to give it a go. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning, and stayed there until the very end. It is the most realistic portrayal of dementia I have ever seen. My dad is stuck on me being 35 (I am 68), so he's in a time machine not in his control. This film brought it very close, and helped me understand my dad's mind.I rarely give a film 10*, but this one is close to being perfect in every way.My favorite Hopkins film/performance is Remains of the Day. But this may be a new one, although much more difficult to re-watch. Hopkins is masterful here, as ever, but he's calling on all of his acting experience to deliver an effortless (seemingly!) performance. Nothing over the top, no melodrama, just one of the best crafted characters I've seen. He has help from a great script, direction, editing, sets, and co-stars, but the focus is Anthony. His character is as broad as it is deep, but so skilled is Hopkins that it seems effortless. I'm very grateful that Hopkins agreed to do this very difficult role, at his age. He could just sit on his laurels now.My age and health, as well as family members, begs many questions about aging and quality of life, which this film inherently, but without stating, highlights. I hope we can find ways for the mind to keep up with the longevity of our bodies, or provide for an acceptable alternative to warehousing our endless last days of confusion."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,"Not always a movie about dementia is so honest and objective from the patient's point of view as The Father. It's a simple and honest picture, we feel the pain from the both sides, the father and daughter.Hopkins' performance is just amazing, superb. It's a delight to watch him transform his character into pieces little by little. And on the opposite side we sense the painful journey Colman's character goes through.All the accolades go to the strong direction of Florian Zeller. We will probably hear his name many many times from now on."
THE FATHER,1 June 2021,9/10,"I think all elements of this movie is very greatly gathered and match to eachother, Anthony Hopkins is perfect!! After watching this movie I knew that why he won academy reward for this movie.At the end of movie I was cried when he said
""I feel as if I'm...I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves(😔😭)""
I think think everybody who has father should wathch this movie...
at the first part of movie I thought that ""Anthony"" is really healthyaand his daughter want catch his house or sth like that... I said with myself ""it's a repetitive movie!!""
but after a while it was more & more attractive than before and really thrilled me to watch it to the end! And now not only I'm not regretful about watch that but also, definitely I was losing a gem if I don't!!About the structure of movie,I think the director makes some perfect loops in some part of movie to show us repetitious life or illusions of Anthony's life. But despite I think this a very very perfect thing but caused that the movie lose its coherence in some parts and it's really confusing!!Anyway I love this movie!!"
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,8/10,"One of the highlights of his remarkable career, likely one of his best ever perfomances. Bravo. Film is great, but it's all about acting. Olivia is decent as always."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"2 great actors, great directing, masterful movie as the rendition of last chapter of human journey slowly end. It's like sitting on calm yet poignant Dusk, beautiful yet sad because we know the Night will finally come."
THE FATHER,2 July 2021,10/10,"From birth the mind grows wise. Accumulating knowledge. It shares its bounty throughout life. It stays sharp and expands with every emotion a human can express. Then, when Its least expected, the colors fade. Images blur and blend. Memories travel on multiple tracks with no certain destination. Uncontrolled, thoughts entwine and imagination explodes into a new reality. Or is it? This film is a must see. A must feel. Hopkins is quite possibly the greatest actor alive today. Experience his character! Absorb him. He is us tomorrow. Or the day after....."
THE FATHER,23 May 2021,8/10,A very difficult and painful movie to watch about real life. Anthony Hopkins' best performance by far since Silence of the Lambs.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,1/10,"I can't believe I just awarded one star to a film with substantial roles for Olivia Colman and Rufus Sewell, two of my favourite actors.Hopkins just drags it down ... and down ... to the point where it become totally predictable and utterly unwatchable.Hopkins is, in my opinion, an insanely overrated actor. He had his best moment 30 years ago in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and never quite showed anything new since then. In fact, it seems as if he has regressed to his pre-Lechter mediocrity. His last turn, in ""The Two Popes,"" was another totally forgettable appearance.The writing for his character offers him no chance to break-out of an endless loop of confusing daughters, chickens, husbands, and that damned, perpetually-missing wristwatch.Would he have received an Oscar nomination in a non-pandemic year when the release of fresh films had not been so drastically truncated?There is some solace that Academy Award for Best Actor will most certainly go to the well-deserving Chadwick Boseman, a great talent taken from us all too soon.Hopefully this will be the last we see of 83-year-old Hopkins. Even Laurence Olivier, an actor with a far, far greater range, had the good sense to retire, returning to the screen for a final three-minute cameo appearance in the year of his death at age 82 in the non-speaking role of a wheelchair-bound World War I soldier (his voice, reciting a poem, is overdubbed).The director is to be faulted as well. Just as with ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" ""Father"" began its life as a stage-play set mostly in one room, to be performed for live audiences of about 1.000. In both cases, nothing was done to open up the story, and they do not meet the criteria of film: they are but documents of stage dramas, complete with five-minute monologues which would work well onstage, but not in film. But if I need to hear someone rant for five minutes, I'd much rather it be Viola Davis."
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,9/10,"Hopkins delivers a performance of a lifetime- nuanced, graceful, elegant and emotionally overwhelming. I have seldomly emphasized this much with a character on screen. Simply thinking about certain moments bring up a distressing feeling inside my body and mind. Hopkins vulnerable acting is masterfully transported onto the viewer, he is the core of the film, this is by all means his film.But lest we forget the expertly crafted direction of Florian Zeller who constantly shakes us up with the disorienting unfolding and modification of events. He doesn't deceive us by inserting distasteful pathetic music choices but rather uses music only when it is really warranted and doesn't take anything from the performances away. Thus a healthy co-existence is created and the film doesn't feel emotionally manipulative.As I said, this is a devastating film whose overall nature lingers with you long after the credits roll. A film which makes you remember why cinema is often called an ""empathy machine"". It is because of films like these."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,6/10,This is a slow and sad film . A lot of it takes place in an apartment. It is based on a play . Anthony Hopkins puts in a brilliant performance as the elderly man Antony suffering dementia . Olivia Coleman puts in a good performance as his daughter .
THE FATHER,28 October 2021,9/10,"This is the best acted, presented and directed movie I have seen in ages. All the actors involved were superb, especially Hopkins of course.When the movie finished, and still now, it had me thinking about my own life and relationships a lot.I would recommend this movie to anyone, and would happily watch it again. It made me cry, especially that heart-wrenching ending!"
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,10/10,"Finally! A decent and perfect movie after waiting for quite a while. I didn't expect any quality lately, in past several years, almost all produced movies have been below the average. Especially Academy award nominees and winners have been the worst in most of the cases. So, This one surprised me big time. Great scenario, amazing story telling, superb acting and perfect directing. You see the world as an Alzheimer patient sees it and it gets terrifying. I haven't ever terrified this much by watching a movie before. This one is a sad terrifying story that could happen to you and your loved ones in a very realistic view and by a considerable probability.It is decidedly the best movie that has been produced in last 4-5 years. But the academy awards as always( at least it has been the case lately) failed to do its job. It is a shame that this movie did not win the best picture."
THE FATHER,1 July 2021,2/10,This film is a joke sir Anthony Hopkins is a rich person living the high life flat. Well that's not the people I live with my mum had a stroke and rich people can address it.
THE FATHER,12 September 2021,3/10,"So this is a study in dementia. It left me feeling like I had dementia because I spent 137 watching a flick whose narrative was revealed within the first 10 minutes and then did not really go anywhere particularly interesting, after that.If it wasn't for the actors and in particular Hopkins' performance, I would not have bothered, Florian Zeller/Christopher Hampton or not!!"
THE FATHER,10 June 2021,1/10,"This movie should be BANNED and ERASED from the history of movies. I couldn't take it. It was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow. Every line was like a knife that just cut deeper into me.The entire time I kept hoping for a twist... something... ANYTHING... to actually happen. I knew that Anthony was sick from the very beginning - that was pretty obvious. But I can't believe that's all there was to it though. No twist. No surprise. No nothing. Obviously not even a happy ending. He's sick. That's the whole story. Goodbye.Every other line is ""What do you mean?"". Not even kidding you. I seriously doubt that whoever wrote this script has ever spent even 5 minutes with someone who has dementia or Alzheimer's. If someone is sick and you know they're sick and they start talking about something that clearly doesn't make sense you don't ask them ""What do you mean"" every 3 seconds and then act surprised that they don't remember what you told them 2 days ago - THEY ARE SICK! HELLO??The director clearly thought ""Maybe if I slow this down to a painfully slow pace they'll think it's a masterpiece!""10 minutes of this movie was someone doing stuff in the kitchen that had nothing to do with the story.This was first written as a book and then adapted to be a play in a theater where you have just one or two locations and they never bothered to adapt it for film. It all just happens in that one apartment. As soon as I saw in the credits that it was based on a book I knew I'd be wasting my time. But I thought - let me see what all the fuss is about.Believe me when I say this - I put more effort into writing this review than the writer of this movie when he wrote the script.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!"
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,10/10,What else should I say? This movie is flawless . Anthony Hopkin's acting in this movie is impeccable and one of the best of his career !! The ending is so touching and sad .
THE FATHER,15 July 2021,9/10,"The Father draws you in, and through a )initially confusing) plot device tries, mostly successfully, to immerse the audience inside the experience of the father, flawlessly played by Hopkins, and magnificently acted all round . The films stage origins are clear, but the overall effect remains heart rending and deeply affecting."
THE FATHER,31 May 2021,10/10,"The kind of unexpected perfection you get when you combine Anthony Hopkins, Olivia Coleman, British filmmaking, and a very low budget of just six million dollars.Watch, join dad in his mind, try to make sense of what is happening, where you are... who you are.Watch true artists at work, in front of and behind the camera. A Masterpiece. A tour de force."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,7/10,I think I've got dementia now that I've watched this it left me very confused and irritable. Great acting by Anthony hopkins and Olivia conman. It was very sad but sometimes funny. Well worth the watch.
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,5/10,"This movie confuses the heck out of you and you can't really figure out what it's supposed to be about until it's almost over. So in theory you should watch it once to get an idea of what it's about then watch it again to appreciate the fine acting. The only problem is that it's not interesting enough to watch twice. Sure, there may be some great acting performances but great acting does not a great movie make. Somebody could play the perfect performance as Hamlet, for instance, but if he's playing to an audience that doesn't like Shakespeare nobody is going to care how great his performance is. And that's the problem with The Father. A lot of people will go to see it just based on the name of the stars but most of them won't want to stick around to figure out what it was supposed to be about. My wife's mother had Dementia and her brother cared for her by himself and eventually with a carer for years before she died, so they might empathize with it. People who haven't experienced that will just see a confusing mess."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"Heartbreaking and haunting, a perfect portrait of dementia as the mind slips away memories fade and are replaced with hallucinations and paranoia and once a perfect gentleman is reduced to the state of infancy , his only remaining daughter is no longer able to care for him and he is sent to a nursing home . But that is not all to it , with proper care and in hands of professional and kind medical staff he too is able to find comfort and peace of mind in hands and embrace of them , so that his remaining days are peaceful. Having dealt with a granny who suffered from dementia this movie's portrayal of sickness as accurate and informative, kindness and patience are the most important thing to keep in mind when dealing with people with dementia and maybe perhaps professional help is required."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"An amazing film for a first feature. A brutal subject that has been a theme in several movies, but this one goes deeper allowing us to see from a different point of view. Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman never disappoint, both gave astonishing performances."
THE FATHER,27 June 2021,9/10,"It's a must for every single one who was out of touch with reality at least once. Frankly speaking, this movie touches upon lots of different social issues such as distrust of your own relatives, chronic mental diseases and also misunderstanding between people. Having watching that, a viewer could think thoroughly about mutual support and self-belief. This was a triumphal performance of Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins! Don't hesitate to watch and enjoy this movie - it's definitely worth a shot!"
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,9/10,"Truly amazing story and the performances were all excellent. One of the best films I've seen in a while. It really puts the viewer into the story in a way not many other films can. Hopkins was incredible as usual and Colman, OMG....what an amazing actor."
THE FATHER,13 July 2021,7/10,"As good as this was, what was missing for me was an acknowledgement that what we're seeing is advanced dementia, and particularly severe at that - someone who is not just frightened, confused and forgetful, but paranoid, aggressive and suspicious. The film perfectly captures what the final 6 weeks with my dad were like before he went into care, and how he often continued to behave while in care. It also conveys how frightening a large aggressive man with dementia can be to those trying to care for him, as well as the terror of alienation when a loved one with dementia turns against you. As a couple of other reviewers have commented, most of the characters don't handle the man's condition well and act in ways that make him more agitated - the fact that even experienced care professionals are shown repeatedly asking him ""What do you mean?"" and ""Do you remember?"", and being surprised that he forgets things even when his condition is clearly severe, simply isn't realistic and is used to artificially drive the point home. There's no sense that his family and carers have acclimatised to the situation and learned to modify their behavior, when in fact that's one of the first things that happens when you have a loved one with dementia.Because the film is designed as an immersive experience from the perspective of someone highly agitated with severe dementia, what's missing are all the moments of joy and love in between. There's no recognition in the film that many people have much gentler manifestations of dementia, and can live for years with dementia with a good quality of life. This film will terrify people and generate huge fear around dementia, and I really want to emphasise that although many psychological and behavioral aspects ring true, it represents an extreme scenario (one more reminiscent of Lewy Body dementia than Alzheimer's) and that having dementia doesn't have to be like this. I know people with dementia who still actively pursue and enjoy their hobbies and who have put all kinds of practical coping strategies in place (either independently or with their family's support) to ensure they can carry out their daily activities safely. I know people who have had dementia for many years, whose short-term memory is completely shot and who are reliant on others for help with certain tasks, but who can still cook, garden, read, do puzzles, follow politics and current affairs, engage with friends and family, and generally take an interest in the world - and who enjoy their day almost every day. That's what dementia can be too, and what it is for many, not just an unremitting horror show. Please don't think it has to be this bad, at least not all the time."
THE FATHER,31 December 2020,9/10,"The Father is carried by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. This movie is told from Hopkins' perspective, as he ages his memory fades and things get more confusing. This movie was emotionally powerful, beautiful, and sad. While the point of this movie was to confuse us, and put us in Hopkins' shoes, I still got a little lost. I felt like there should have been a little more explanation or at least a little bit more of a sense of what was really going on. Nevertheless, the performances are fantastic. Anthony Hopkins is amazing, best I've seen him in years."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,9/10,"Exploring a diseased mind of a demented being is hard to watch, harder to act out. Anthony Hopkins deserves the Oscar for a difficult role of an octogenarian afflicted by Alzymer. Coming soon after his unforgettable Pope in Two Popes, he establishes himself in the pantheon of Cinema's Greats if that was at all doubted.A disturbing story with confusing overlaps of the demented mind is nightmarish for observers more so than for the sufferer.Olivia Colman is superb in a restrained role of the daughter who suffers the sufferer.Background score is noteworthy.A worthy nominee or awardee for the Best Picture."
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,10/10,"The Father doesn't really have a story. There's no place and time. Not really. ""Real"" being the key word. What is real? When, where? Who? Anthony, played by Anthony Hopkins, who rightfully won an Oscar for it, is real. He's the titular Father - a retired engineer suffering from dementia. His daughter Anne (wonderful Olivia Coleman) is also real. His son-in-law (Rufus Sewell)? Probably. But when? And what about the home care aide named Laura (Imogen Poots), who reminded Anthony of his other daughter Lucy?The most striking thing about The Father is that the narrative is driven by Anthony's point of view. To him it's all real. But familiar people and places morph into unfamiliar, reality blurs with dreams, and he is desperately trying tether himself to at least the time with his trusty watch, but he keeps misplacing it. Or rather mis-hiding. Because the only way this nonsense can be explained is that everyone is out to get him and his stuff. He's suspicious, angry, and abusive towards his loving, heartbroken daughter. And the moments of clarity are even more devastating as fear of abandonment sets in - unavoidable, blameless, and real."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,8/10,"""The Father"" is adapted from director Florian Zeller's stage play by the same name. It is lead by Sir Anthony Hopkins, who delivers a mindblowing Oscar-worthy performance. He acts as an aging man, who slowly loses the sense of reality due to dementia.The audience doesn't know what is reality and is as confused as Anthony. Director disorients us by having different actors play the same characters and even the set keeps changing. We hear different versions of Anthony's life, and we even seem to experience events out of order.This movie is a tear-jerker and a unique piece of art because it focuses on the feeling and not the truth of the experience."
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,"Everyone is mentioning Anthony Hopkins and rightfully so, he did an amazing job here, something you may not be used to this days. But I also want to take a moment to thanks all others who worked on this movie. Everything is all so cleverly put together you forget everything else around you and totally get captivated by the story. It just shows how you really don't need a huge budget to make a really good movie (well I'm guessing 90% of the budget is for the 5 actors).Ps. Fun fact about Paris: they don't even speak english in there."
THE FATHER,12 September 2021,10/10,"Wow just wowFor me one of the greatest films of all timeThis breaks down the myths of Alzheimer's disease and educates the viewer on what the afflicted, and their loved ones are experiencingAnthony Hopkins fully deserves his oscar he received for this and Olivia Coleman also deserves oneThought provoking, gut wrenching and an absolute tear jerkerThis should be required viewing for all care workers who really do deserve to be paid like rockstars."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"This really surprised me. Rather more than just about a family trying to care for the needs of a loved one with dementia, it really goes some way to offer some idea about what that could be like for some people. It's actually quite a difficult movie to watch, remarkably draining, in it's approach. I don't want to say too much more, would only serve to spoil it, though the trailer gives some idea about it's approach in this regard.It would be interesting to watch again, in that I'll know what I'm in for, but going in somewhat blind, as I did the first time, I found it strangely unsettling! Nothing horrible in it, there's just something about it...I would be surprised if it doesn't do very well at the Oscars, in one way or another."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance, one of the best in his career, is hard to decide who deserve more the best actor between him and Chadwick Boseman, i know is controversial, but i would vote for Hopkins.Olivia Colman also gives a great performance, showing all the sadness a person would feel in this situation, but Hopkins is the one who elevated the whole material.The ending scene is very emotional and sad, showing once again how amazing is Hopkins performance, when he cries asking for his mother who is obviously dead a long time ago, this just shows even deeper how much he's lost in the time of his own life, the scene also make us see that a person in his condition can feel like a helpless kid who lived a entire life and now is completely lost and confused, sometimes not even capable to remember who he actually is."
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,10/10,"THE FATHER is one of the most powerful films in recent memory, with two knockout performances from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. Hopkins plays an old man who is plagued by dementia, and who is refusing care from his daughter, played by Colman, because he believes that he can take care of himself adequately on his own. The movie is structured from the perspective of Hopkins -- the audience often sees things in a non-linear fashion and is not introduced to certain major characters, making them just as strange to us as they are to Hopkins in his mind.The writing from Florian Zeller is impeccable, managing to be creative while also giving us a devastating look into how it feels to suffer from dementia. While it sometimes feels just as much like a play as a movie, it never bores the audience with any superfluous details and implores the audience to attempt to find their way through a maze that has no ending. The editing and direction makes us feel as though we are being deceived, making us empathize with Hopkins while also siding with his caretaker, who is doing everything she can to care for her sick father.The performances are the best of 2020, with Hopkins being possibly the best he has been on-screen in decades. (If Chadwick Boseman weren't such a strong contender for lead actor, I'd say give the Oscar to Hopkins.) Colman, however, may be my pick for best supporting actress, because she portrays the pain of watching a loved one slip into confusion and paranoia with heartbreaking reality.The final ten minutes of the movie are my favorite scenes acting-wise of the past year. THE FATHER is an essential watch that everyone should seek out.A"
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,9/10,"If you liked:
Nebraska
Amour
Relic""The Father"" is one of the 2021 Oscar frontrunners, a heartbreaking drama about aging. An old man named Anthony is refusing help from his daughter as he ages. They are at a point when the child is worried enough about their parent to try to get them a professional carer; and the parent, fighting for the last bits of their independence, is proud enough to insistently believe that they can perfectly manage on their own. A terribly awkward situation for both to find themselves in and although we sort of side with Anthony in the beginning; we eventually do see that his mind starts to slowly disintegrate and fragment, starting with simple forgetfulness, and ending up with a nasty habit of believing that everyone is out there to steal from him.What makes this movie so unique and borderline genius is that we see the whole story from Anthony's perspective only. He is clearly showing early signs of dementia; and we only get the side of the picture that he himself recognizes and sees through his confused memory and eyes; to the point where we ourselves become paranoid and confused. The faces are confusing, the time of the day is confusing, the surroundings are confusing. Because of that, the film isn't constructed like a dull drama, but rather as a some twisted kind of mystery thriller bordering on horror. Probably most of us have at least once contemplated on our own mortality and the paralyzing fear of losing one's memory as we become older. This film is not scary-horror, but it should scare the stuffing out of anyone, since this problem is universal for all of us humans. The prospect of getting lost in your own head is far scarier and far more real than anything some Boogeyman from a generic horror film can throw at us. It's what I have been afraid of ever since I could think hard enough. It's also one of the reasons why I became a biologist, I am planning to delve into Biology of Aging research so that we can live healthier lives as we get older, and avoid this kind of horror in our lives and the lives of our loved ones.All of this was brought to life by the never-changing excellency of my favorite actor Anthony Hopkins, rightly earning Hopkins his 6th nomination; and the superb directing of Florian Zeller, for which he confusingly wasn't nominated, but his film did get the ""mysterious"" Film Editing nomination for all those cuts that made the confusion of a fading mind tangible.This brutally real film won't provide you with any answers, but it will give you a ton of questions to ponder on. Comparatively very short, running for 90 minutes only, it is definitely one of the best films of 2020 that nobody should miss. Available in some theaters."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"Shining a spotlight on a deeply upsetting subject but telling it's story in a way we can empathise with all parties involved. THE FATHER is devastating in it's deliverance, Anthony Hopkins is incredible in his performance, dementia is truly awful and this film has left me totally broken."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,Who else but Sir Anthony Hopkins could portray the lead in this sad story of a man with dementia and the different worlds he sees and lives in. Very sad and by the end of the film all you want to do is hug him and tell him things are ok.It hits the right note for anyone who doesn't understand Dementia. Cracking movie!
THE FATHER,27 May 2021,9/10,"This movie is hard to watch, In a good way. This utterly realistic depiction of a man losing his mind is one that goes to really emotional depths. All of the movie's emotion is expressed through Hopkin's acting and a screenplay that shows its premise through the writing. This movie is told in mostly first person, and that at times causes scenes to have shockingly horrific moments in the idea of a man's mind attacking him. You as an audience cannot follow the events of the movie without having to piece nuggets of information that other characters mention. Be ready for heartbreaking scenes that make you want to reach out and save our main character. Bring tissues."
THE FATHER,15 August 2021,10/10,"I think this is what they say, twinning between director and the actor.No offence! But Anthony's age and the character is matched in a perfect way and the experience he gives us while watching, makes us think about senile father what he goes through.Grateful to the director and actor, giving a different perspective."
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,9/10,"This film has a simple story just following a man with dementia and how the people around him are affected by it. The acting and screenplay is what makes this film and this showed with the Oscar wins. Hopkins plays a simple character suffering with dementia and captures the struggle he has when people don't believe what he sees with his illness. Production was great as well. I was able to stay engaged even with the film being in one setting (mostly). Do watch this film, some may be able to relate to the story as well."
THE FATHER,6 June 2021,9/10,"A very emotional film, after watching you start thinking about life. The main strength of the film is Anthony Hopkins' distinctive acting. Honored Oscar!"
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,5/10,"I really wanted to see this film and deliberately didn't read any reviews or watch the trailers because of this. I think the plot is fairly simple and nothing is being given away with the synopsis of how it describes the characters demise into dementia.As an explanation of the condition its great, but as a film it doesn't really work. It does a very good job of describing the descent of the main character, and gives a fairly vivid description of his confusion, despair and random behaviour, but this becomes quite tiresome and repetitive as the film progresses.There just isn't enough of a story here, nothing of significance happens, and even when changes occur to the character or his circumstances, they happen within the disconnected framework of his condition which is a very low key, subtle affair.There are no developments that take place to draw you into the story, the characters plight, or that of his family. The screenplay in general is very one dimensional and offers no real emotional investment in the film, other than pity of his condition to progress past this fairly slight and unrewarding concept.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure many people can identify with the film and even realise with so much more understanding how dementia affects people (especially loved ones) because of this film. It highlights the effects of the condition exceptionally well. I'm also sure older people watching this will probably have an unpleasant experience on what's possibly awaiting them in the short to medium term, but as a movie it still doesn't work, it isn't enough. It is more of a documentary, as a movie it simply doesn't deliver.I'm struggling to give it a fair score for movie value whilst recognising the intent of the film makers may not have been specifically entertain per se, and I'm finding it quite difficult. What the film does, it does very well, but outside that it has little to offer, and I think as a result 5/10 is a fair score."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,7/10,"Excellent script, seamless narration, and life-brimming performances!That being said, I would add, people should watch the movie: Android Kunjappan Ver 5.25 (2019)"
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"That's what cinema was used to be like. In teh good ole days. This is more than film, it's a masterpiece. I don't know how it came to be and I don't even want to know. Let it remain a little mystery. But I'm glad it did.Not sure if I can even try to give this a score - it's very unlike anything in past say 5 years. So I have nothing as a gauge.Let's say 8.5/10 exactly. And this is my Academy Award winner all around (review is being posted pre ceremony). <---- Came back minutes later to adjust this to 9.5
9.5! I'm kind of scared of how long will the aftershocks last now.PS. I somewhat disliked Olivia Coleman since her Peep Show days purely for her looks (yes, I was that shallow) and probably biased by her character in the same. Years gone by, staggering performances delivered, but I was still 'iffy' about her (imho!). After The Father I've changed my mind finally. She's an amazing actress and a wonderfully beautiful human being.Third edit here. This is an addendum. Come to think of it during the watch I was vaguely reminded for some reason of a film called Locke. And then I remembered that Olivia was in it as well. Huh. Thing is - Locke IS kind of a gauge for The Father. Or the vise versa now? The only one that came to mind. Hmm."
THE FATHER,1 August 2021,9/10,"Brilliant acting, taut writing and deft direction; this should be the benchmark for all films. Anthony Hopkins never lets up as an actor, he puts everything he has into each and every performance and refuses to sink to the pedestrian levels that actors like Travolta, Willis, Cage (except for ""Pig""), Brosnan and many others do in the later years of their careers. The Father is a treat."
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins breathes Cinema and Pure Acting in this.What an emotive mvie . I am not afraid to say that the ending brought me to tears. For sure a magnific performance, what a well deserved Oscar.This man will never be forgotten, he will be immortalised as one of the Best.Hopkins turns a Great film into a Masterpiece to be studied!!!!!!!!!!!!"
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,8/10,"A tremendous movie that accurately portrays how life is for dementia sufferers.The movie shows the audience someone with the onset of dementia, struggling to determine what is true and what is not, confusion and reality sometimes colliding and the viewer, like the character, really not knowing what is real and what is not.This movie takes the viewer to a place unfortunately many will see either as a victim of dementia or a son/daughter or carer of those with dementia, it is a journey sadly many will make.I believe this movie will help many understand the frightening world our loved ones are in and hopefully we will be more understanding for those that have it and those that care for them.Anthony Hopkins is deserving of an Oscar for his performance.Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,26 August 2021,10/10,"If Hopkins hadn't reached immortality for his acting already, his latest artistic achievement would have owned him this status even once more. He gives a nuanced powerhouse performance of an old man loosing his connection to reality, to his relations, and at last to his own identity, caused by dementia.It goes totally under your skin and leaves you in tears.The fact that you see the action from Hopkins point of view gives you a disturbing and sometimes even frightening impression of what you might have to expect suffering from dementia yourself.Hopkins is accompanied by the wonderful Olivia Coleman, both playing a wide range of emotions between tenderness, rage, fear, sadness and humour.Those two save the script and the movie from being a bit too tricky sometimes, if those tricks wouldn't work all so well.Brilliant!"
THE FATHER,15 June 2021,10/10,"Dementia is an awful disorder, and it's every child's nightmare to have to watch their parent deteriorate and disappear right before their eyes. Florian Zeller manages to capture this experience magnificently here in this film adaptation of the play Le Père which he co-wrote with fellow playwright Christopher Hampton.Anthony Hopkins is everything in this film - funny, charming and also utterly heart-breaking - he completely deserves his Oscar win after putting in what will surely be remembered as one of his all time great performances. The way we enter his seemingly coherent mind and reality only to watch it gradually unravel until he is left as a broken man unsure of his own existence is stunning. Praise also has to be reserved for Olivia Colman who has to portray the daughter having to watch her father go through this nightmare. Some of her best work is done when she is not speaking, but instead letting her face do the talking. She could have easily won a second Oscar for her role here.The original score from Ludovico Einaudi is also great (but I love everything that man does) and I liked the use of the set design to illustrate the subtle differences in the constantly shifting and changing reality we inhabit for those 97 minutes.The entire screening was completely stunned into silence as the credits started rolling, as everyone was trying to come to terms with what we had just seen. This may prove to be one of the finest film experiences I'll have this year."
THE FATHER,18 January 2021,10/10,"A Brutal, Trippy Portrait Of Reality - Showff, An Oscar-Worthy Performance By Anthony Hopkins. This Movie All About, A Haunting and Devastating View of Dementia.. Just Watch This Heart Wreanching Masterpiece'"
THE FATHER,29 October 2021,7/10,"This movie broke my heart about a thousand times, and quite frankly in the beginning/first half: I thought I was losing my mind. What is scarier is that this is a real possibility for me. As I get older, I worry about it more and more. Genetically, we thought my paternal grandmother had Alzheimer's (when it was first being recognized). Then, my father ""had the cardiovascular system of an 80yo"" in his 40s. Blamed cigarettes. Fast forward to when I was 40yo. A neurologist told me I had a problem that is only found in 80yo people or ""is there something genetic to this?"" Well. I've been terrified since.Now, what these people SHOULD have done was have photos of his daughters/wife around him AND a current calendar. This helps so much (till they become really out of control and think everyone is conspiring, but not many places mass produce calendars for the future with all sorts of information on them). Even then, you can reason with them to a point. My grandmother was so much better with 100 calendars, and we kept old ones with photos of her (and grandpa) together: A calendar from 1925 accompanied by photos of her, gramps and my father as a baby. Just a tip to try to help anyone reading this. You'll do anything to spare them this if you can.Ok, the movie, I'm sorry: Excellent and devastating. The acting was wonderful, and I'm glad they didn't have a huge cast. Two Olivias playing Anns. Truly a heartbreaking movie and I cried more than once. And to add to the sadness, you have to see everyone else's point of view. The struggling daughter, the impatient husband, the young caregiver trying to be the good girl which mingled more with his mind...it was a rough ride. But I do NOT regret watching it. I'm going to suggest my children and grandchildren watch it as well."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,8/10,"The only flaw I can find to this movie is that is too sad and poignant, to the point that by the end it had me sobbing like a little girl. It's the kind of movie I wouldn't be willing to watch a second time. In a fair world, I can't see how any other movie would stand a chance at winning the Academy Awards or any actor other than Anthony Hopkins (at 83!) at winning Best Leading Actor, but sadly, we all know how things operate this days..."
THE FATHER,2 June 2021,9/10,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie with this caliber. The acting is truly superb with each of the actors and actresses. The way ""reality"" is depicted for a person descending into the depths of dementia is frighteningly accurate. Everything was executed beautifully. I believe that it is extremely important for everyone in the healthcare industry, for family, friends, church, and community members to see this. As one who is assisting in the care of a loved one with dementia, it is so very important to be patient and also to not show a surprised expression to common odd behaviors or comments, which can alarm and shame the one who is ill. They need our love, attention, and assurance. Do not hesitate to see this!"
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,9/10,"Heartbreak and confusion are two ideas and themes I've encountered before in my life. But never before have I seen it so brutally abused in The Father. The Father doesn't just tell a story about the character Anthony and his scenario, rather it places us into the mind of Anthony and his mental deterioration, showing us the heartbreak that is experienced by the ones around him and the confusion and even acceptance of his own situation. At one point, Anthony' consciousness fully acknowledges that he is a burden to his family members in a dramatic, and devastating scene. It's unsettling and sad, and the films depiction of caring for a loved one with dementia is what we possibly may experience later in our lives, even now. And it's this idea of empathy through the audience and fictional characters that Florian Zeller communicates through the film with his heartfelt and unbearable narrative.I happened to catch this in theatres today, as it's my first time back since a year now. I never realized how much a luxury the theaters are and the impression it could make on an individuals connection to a film. For some reason, the fact that I was watching the movie in a theatre rather then in a living room felt more impactful to the nature of the story. Again that idea of empathy, the closeness with the characters I witnessed through gazing at the big screen. I give credit to this from the cinematography and camerawork, writing, and especially the acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. What largely made an impact on me was this film's transitory depiction of home. The people we rely on to define us may suddenly seem unrecognizable, and that's just disturbing. But I think Zeller's use of empathy also provides us with an alternative effect of comfort on the viewers."
THE FATHER,21 May 2021,10/10,"The way this film is edited is incredible, putting the viewer in the shoes of a person suffering dementia with the confusing time jumps and inconsistencies within the stories chronology. It's hard to grasp on what's going on, but that's the point as that's how it connects you with the character. Anthony Hopkins also gave an incredible performance which attaches the viewer to this struggling old man. He made me feel all the emotions of his character, it's simply beautiful. It really deserves acclaim for being so original in its approach to storytelling by making the audience feel like they're experiencing the characters life rather than just observing it."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,7/10,"Those who have or have had close experiences with relatives who suffer from senile dementia or Alzheimer's will find in this film a very moving story. For those who do not, they could also fall into the sensitivity presented by the masterful role of Anthony Hopkins.However, when the story is already set, it could be a little bit slow and predictable.Nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Actor and Best Picture, ""The Father"" bears some resemblance to another great film, ""Still Alice"" (2014) starring the great and only Julianne Moore, who actually won the Oscar that year for best actress.Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,Was not expecting that I did not stop guessing who was the baddie. Give that man an Oscar.
THE FATHER,3 July 2021,10/10,"The highest point of acting is when you don't see the actor, you see the character. For the entire runtime of The Father, I only see the main character, the father, instead of Anthony Hopkins.The movie stars only about 10 people. It sort of creates an illusion that there are a lot of actors. But no, they're the same people.Illusion. A great way to describe The Father. It's very confusing at times, but you eventually find out that the whole film is in the father's perspective. It's a brilliant way of directing and also writing, which is done by Florian Zeller.All actors have done great job. Namely Olivia Colman and Imogen Poots, a surprisingly good actress if you don't count Black Christmas. Sir Anthony Hopkins did such a perfect job that you are in his character.This movie is acting, directing and writing at their greatest. It is a boring drama for some immature moviegoers, but people who have a brain will appreciate this a lot.The Father tells an emotional and heartbreaking story, and it's one hell of an example of brilliant filmmaking, it will forever have a special place in my heart."
THE FATHER,2 August 2021,10/10,"This falls under the category of ""exceptional movies I never want to watch again"". A painfully accurate depiction of a man suffering from the progression of dementia and the effect on those around him. Hopkins is phenomenal. One of his greatest performances. And one of the best movies I have seen in a long time."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,9/10,I just wanna thank to film's team for showed us how hard it is to our oldmen who is in like that condition. Thank you. Very sad & touching but it is a SAD which we need to understand in real life. Thank you.
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,Remember you must die and the old age is inevitable.
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,9/10,"If you have any experience or personal history with dementia in your life, I would highly recommend skipping this one. Not because it is a bad movie, the opposite actually. The movie would probably hit so close to home that, even for me, it will be a bit too much to handle at times. This is one of the most realistic movies I have ever seen. Even tho I have never experienced anything in a form of dementia in my life, I could feel the realism and tragedy that is going on. Anthony Hopkins gives one of (if not the) greatest performance of his career. He nails every aspect of his character. From the big memory loss moment to the subtle little movements, everything has meaning and consequences. I would also highly recommend watching it twice. The first time you will experience the movie with the main character and try to puzzle everything together. The second viewing you will appreciate the story a lot more. There are a lot of little moments and sequences that make the story even more complete. Some scenes go on for a bit to long, but it all works out at the end. It didn't hit me as hard as I thought it would at the end, but it still left me with an appreciation for dementia and everyone who has been in contact with this horrible disease."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"Such intriguing, moving, stressful way of showing this conditioning I appreciate it so much, having family members living with it, is appreciated Beautiful filmmaking amazing performance such a talented cast."
THE FATHER,16 May 2021,9/10,"The father is a masterpiece. Period. If black comunity is angry because the Academy doesn't give the Oscar to Chadwick Boseman is because Antonhy Hopkins' performance on this film is just superb. Sorry. Boseman doesn't deserve an Oscar for a just right performance. If you can't deal with that, sorry. In a scale of 1 to 10, Boseman has a 6 or 6.5. Hopkins is beyond 10. This is the lifetime performance on which every actor would like to arrive in his silver years.The film is about an old man who starts to lose control of his mind, and what mr. Hopkins delivers is just impressive. Not only the world of confussion, regression, and halucinations, but the very frailty of human condition are portrayed with supreme craftmanship, but with a big understanding of what all these means in the eyes of the surrounding familiars and the spectator. The most oustanding feature on Hopkins displayed is the absolute dignity and humanity of his character. The most impressive thing about the film is the slow crescendo on which Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is involved, which ends with that astonishing monologue on which he claims for her mother. I can say that that is one of the most incredible scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. I almost burst in tears when look the absolute loniless and frailty of his character. I came back to this at the end of mi review.Is an impreessive accomplishment from one of the most relevant actors of the last half century. Doesn't deserve that performance the highest acknowledge from the Academy? That's what what's happened in the 2021 Academy ceremony. Few awards reward such oustanding performance, and that's hasn't to be with racial issues but with a supreme actoral craftmanship.Nevertheless, I have to say that The Father barely rose the real ordeal on which patient and family members have to get through on this illness. BTW, senil dementia is not anymore an accepted term in psychiatry, because normalize something that is not normal. Instead, modern psychatry suggest Brain damage with 3 levels: minimun, medium and great or severe brain damage, since not all the ancients suffer from this. Other thing on which the film fails is in the treatment to release the patient from this condition on hallucinations, confusion and mental regressions. That's not cure or relief with pills but with haloperidol, wich stabilizes the brain and help the patient to avoid suffer from this symptoms. It's so obvious that the film doesn't want to deeper on this condition, instead it suggest the part on wich all involved in this condition suffers. In that, Anthony Hopkin's performance is absolute devastating. The film accomplish in show us how frailty is our humanity and the suffering both the patient and the family, portraying both with such respect and human dignity that very few films attempt.By personal experience, my mother recently has that kind of episodes, everyone is a truly nightmare with a length from ten to 16 hours on wich my mother and us, her family, were driven, I can say that the film doesn't explore that nightmerish experience. The final scene on which Hopkins cry for her mommy is an exactly portrarit of the ordeal on which my mother was driven by this illness, and is absolutely devastanting, one of the most impressive and painfully scenes I have ever watched.Never an actor has deserved more an award that the 2021 Oscar for mr. Anthony Hopkins. There is no point of comparison between his performance and that of the late mr. Chadwick Boseman. Just can't be compared. It's not a racial issue, but an artistic all in all, and in that field, mr. Hopkings delivers his most impressive performance. A masterclass in acting. Best male (or female) acting of the XXI century by far. Period."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,9/10,"My mother suffered from dementia for her final years. The outsider looking into her life, her behaviour, would have seen something like what this movie portrays. What sets this film apart, of course, is that we never -- not ever -- could know what was going on inside my mother's head, while the film imagines it brilliantly.At first, it seemed as if this would be *just another* cinematic effort to deal with this awful illness, and there have been so many. But I don't remember any one of them triggering such empathy. Wow. And full marks too, to all carers, whether within the family or professionals. Really a very, very moving film experience."
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,10/10,"Yes, if you ever thought he couldn't top his turn as Lecter, here it is. One of the best masterpieces I've ever witnessed."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins has always shown how great an actor he is in this film his portrayal of a man suffering dementia is very moving and I couldn't help feeling how I imagine that's what it is like. How things appear to change one minute to the next He deserves an Oscar for getting it just right not over stated not about him it really was a good storyline doubt he will get an Oscar the Oscars will be going to whoever. But if you want to see the best portrayal of what dementia is like this is the film. Not sympathetic, not about the other.people who are suffering in coming to terms with it although there are brilliant moments where the Father can make such put downs. It's a must see film. Simple as that."
THE FATHER,22 May 2021,3/10,"Apart from great acting of the cast I didn't liked anything else from this film..
.Well it's my personal opinion
Story didn't worked out well for me
Screenplay same
At the end I was left completely disappointed."
THE FATHER,20 March 2021,10/10,"If you know someone with dementia or it runs in your family, you must see this film. Truly a masterpiece and an amazing glimpse into this terrible disease. Don't believe the bad reviews. They know not what they write."
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,10/10,Such touching story and movie went to cinema to see this so some bits our funny but u can tell how the father is suffering from brain trauma and u can tell he can see things at end of the movie he said he wants he mum back and he's daughter back who died in car accident so sad.
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,9/10,"You really legend hopkins great acting indeed,,,,,,, despite that it is 1:37 but i felt like it was more and more i enjoy it and i will change my vision for people which has that kind of ill."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,10/10,"This masterpiece movie is a Poem for humanity Talk about our common feeling like fear about to be alone and lost our family memebers , And this movie is suggested common for all of people with all culture in the world , not like majority of useless movies in hollywood like woke and majorty of lgbt or useless blockbusters movies.And I cry a lot at last.one of the best feeling Ive ever
experienced."
THE FATHER,13 September 2021,10/10,"Wow that was so hard to watch for me. I was raised by my father after my mom died when I was 3. He is 80 now and starting to have memories problems after his stroke 4 years ago. He is a different man now. Anthony Hopkins is so amazing, such a brilliant actor. I love him in everything he does but this is now my favorite. Everyone was great. It took a bit to get catch on the the same few days were being plaid over and over but once I did then my mind started putting things together. What a nightmare I hope I never get dementia and I hope my father doesn't either. Be prepared to ugly cry, I couldn't breath out of my nose for half an hour after I watched it."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,8/10,Great performance by Anthony Hopkins! Just thinking about this characters suffering was awful.
THE FATHER,15 September 2021,7/10,Sad movie! If you think about it this is a possible nightmare we could all face!!!
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,9/10,"I have a grandmother with alzheimer who no longer recognizes me, one day I am my father, the other my grandfather, the next an unknown person, but although I always try to understand what she is thinking, we will always analyze the situation with our own eyes. And this is what makes this film incredible, for being able, in an impeccable way, to show us what my grandmother's life is like through her eyes.Everyone should watch this film, especially those who have someone with the same diagnosis in the family."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,9/10,Anthony Hopkins really delivered an incredible performance. Sad and touching movie.
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,9/10,"I hope she will come and see me sometime. Do you think ? Mommy.You were saying she might come occasionally at the weekend. My mommy.(Start to cry) I want my mommy. I want get out of here. Have,have someone come and fetch me. No,no,I want my mommy. I want her to come and fetch me. I want to go home. I feel as if I am losing all my leaves. The branches and the wind and the rain. I do not know what is happening anymore. Do you know what is happening? All this business about the flat. I have nowhere to put my head down anymore. But I know my Watch is on my wrist, thatI do know. For the journey. If not,I do not know if I will be ready to ...------- The father."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"No Oscar is worthy of Anthony Hopkins performance here. One of the World's best actors of all time just raised the bar to a height that I can't see being bettered anytime soon. Olivia Colman's performance is utterly superb. This is not the type of film I would watch. My wife suggested we give it a try. At the end, we were both speechless and in awe of the best film we have seen in many, many years. I felt is if I was living in the story, as if I were there, in his shoes, in their shoes. I highly recommend this film. The story may not be for everyone, but the acting by Hopkins & Colman is as convincing and real as it can ever get."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,5/10,"If you are scared of dying or growing old you're going to be very moved by this. If you're very empathetic toward others you're also going to be very moved. If like me, you're a perhaps little more emotionally cold, and watch drama with a sense of detachment, then you're not going to be moved but you will see some very good acting from Anthony Hopkins.This should work for me. Hopkins has always reminded me of my father and my father faced some mental decline toward the end. Parts of it are quite good but what lets it down for me is the script. I know it's an award winning play but so many of the characters around 'The Father' talk to him in unrealistic ways. What they say is not totally unbelievable, but it's not natural either. Even though he's been in decline for a while they all seem surprised every time he forgets something. If you've dealt with this sort of thing, even once, you roll with it. You explain what you need to explain, what you think will get through, and you move on. You don't act all surprised that a man who's losing his memory has forgotten something again.It's somewhat off-putting and serves to remind you that the playwright is making a point rather than an observation.I get that it's mostly from his point of view, but with better direction the actors could have played it with a more realistic world-weariness that comes from dealing with this stuff every day, without seeming like they were trying to explain and reveal things to the audience.It's still a good film and should hold most people's attention to the end. Those who get caught up in the story may miss the obvious clues on the 'twists', but it's not a film where the plot really matters. It's more about creating a sense of empathy. And based on that, and the fact that that aspect of the film failed for me, I can only rate it 5. Which is not to say it's good or bad. It's a solid film. It just didn't personally connect with me."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,,"Heartbreaking, and doesn't feel like a movie. Terrifying, really."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,8/10,The final scene is utterly heartbreaking and incredibly played by both actors. This felt like a stage play on screen to me and there isn't a step out of place from a single character or performance. That final scene will stay with me for some time.
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,7/10,"The Father is entrancing. It will keep you bewildered throughout, as Anthony Hopkins flashes his acting prowess. He keeps getting better with age. This movie is eerie and too real."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"I think this might be a film I remember for a long time. The Father is a film that will slowly, emotionally collapse you from the beginning to end. It really makes you feel like you're inside the mind of someone with dementia, and it's truly heartbreaking. In many ways you could compare The Father to a psychological thriller."
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,9/10,I am 67 so this was a tough watch. It is brilliantly acted and the script masterful. Where did reality start and dementia takeover? Makes you realise that for some it is gonna be a hard path.
THE FATHER,24 October 2021,10/10,"What a performance by Anthony Hopkins , really a brilliant actor this performance made me terrified that when i will be old i will be like him every moment I got more attached to this story , i really liked this movie very much and i think i will watch it again just for pleasure."
THE FATHER,9 September 2021,10/10,"Fantastic movie.According to my girlfriend who works for so many years with people with dementia, this is as close as it can get...
Beautiful! Worth 2 Oscars."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,7/10,"We see the movie in the father eyes or if I sure from his memories , it's take you in deferent level , Anthony Hopkins take us to his mind to nowhere , and when the movie finsh you sit and think abote future when you need your mammy , lose your leaves and your self , then no one can helps you !!!!"
THE FATHER,1 October 2021,8/10,"This movie touched me on many levels , first of all , the acting was great , the directing and story telling , however my admire for this movie is for personal reasons, my grandma passed away 2 months before this was released , and she had Alzheimer, she had the exact same symptoms , she always remembered her dead child , and asked to be moved back to her mom house , but only now I understood what she faced an what she went through , the fear and the isolation , the distraction and the fuzziness in every single thing , I cried a lot while I'm watching for everything that i did wrong cause I did not understand , and now i can see and feel, hope everyone who is in touch with a patient to see this masterpiece and try to learn from it ."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,10/10,"It is very hard to write about this movie because i can´t really describe how great it is, it captures feelings so well what a great performance Olivia Colman and Anthony Hopkins.And let´s not even talk about the film editing so great
this deserves more recognizition i´m very surprised and angry that the academy didn´t nominate Florian Zeller for best director, it´s his first film but it feels like he has directed over 30 films.Simply amazing."
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,9/10,"Going into this I was expecting an hour and a half of some painful emotional scenes of dementia from the perspective of the daughter. Instead I was taken by surprise at the ingenious decision to immerse us in the perspective of Anthony himself. We see things from his perspective, which wasn't just more insightful, it also allowed the movie to become one giant mystery. The story wasn't just emotional, but it was suspenseful and filled with plot twists that make you watch until the end. In fact, the plot was so layered that it almost requires a rewatch. I compare this a lot to Christopher Nolan's memento except is not in reverse and not as violent. Personal favorite awards season movie. Underrated!!!"
THE FATHER,13 September 2021,10/10,"Damn. I had this in my queue to watch with my mom and aunt, both in their 70s, when we went on vacation. But then I realized that maybe it would be too difficult for them to watch so I watched on my ownAt 53, this movie will have a lasting impression on me that I in no way expected.Amazing acting by all actors. I've probably seen all of Anthony Hopkins' movies and this might perhaps be one of his best performances. Hard to tell though- he's such an amazing actor in everything.Poignant, haunting, brilliantly honest."
THE FATHER,15 November 2021,8/10,"This film was one of the most raw and most real movies I have watched. It tells the story of one of the worst diseases humanity faces in such a gut-wrenching way, staying away from the sometimes unnecessary and drawn out melodrama that film tends to produce. What makes this film so beautiful is the fact that we experience the film through Anthony's perspective (save a scene or two). Though Anthony is the being that suffers from the illness, we are there with him. We feel the confusion and the desperation for fulfillment. We crave answers to the questions that are posed to us through Anthony's eyes. He wants to know who he is, what he's doing, and what's going on around him, and we want the same. In this way, Anthony's experiences become ours. We see what he sees, and we feel what he feels.Something I want to make note of is the film's setting, which takes place mainly in a few flats. The sets are all complicated - there are numerous doorways, a clutter of furniture, and several different rooms. The disorganized set is so carefully designed to mimic Anthony's mental space. Just like parts of his brain are hard for him to access, it is hard for us to assuredly recognize the characteristics of the flats and to easily notice the switching between them. This is all excluding one single part of each flat: the doorway at the end of the hall. The way that the camera always steadily follows Anthony in and out of that room highlights the inevitable truth of the situation... As Anthony continues to rely on the solitude that the room at the end of the hall offers him, the eery shots of it force us into reckoning with the uncomfortable truth that Anthony won't be able to escape to it forever. Though the film chose not to display Anthony's eventual death, we all know that it's soon to come. Instead, the film shows one last heartbreaking moment where Anthony cries for his mother, stripping his mind and being into the likes of a child's."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,1/10,"I hoped for this movie to get in different directions except the obvious one.I thought about a conspiracy / ghost / going in circles - but not the boring nothing that was this movie until the very end.All the good reviews are given solely because Anthony Hopkins is playing the main character in this movie. Replace him in your mind with a regular actor, not a very acclaimed movie actor and you get the boring nothing."
THE FATHER,9 August 2021,10/10,"Colman and Hopkins are absolutely brilliant! What a great movie, well deserved Oscar wins. Also, one of the most depressing movie I've seen, because it is so real, the situation, the emotions of everyone involved, the dark side of aging, the fragility of life....all so real. Will touch many hearts, especially of those with aging parents."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,10/10,"This is a powerful film.Sir Anthony Hopkins is not in it.There is a man, old then getting older, who finally disappears. He knows that he is gone. With wringing hands, he asks who he is. He is terribly confused and afraid of being abandoned. I wanted to hold him, to kiss away his tears. What could I do to help?In 1965, The Who released an album called ""My Generation."" The lyrics include ""Hope I die before I get old.""In this film, Sir Anthony is the epitome of Alzheimer's.In this film, Sir Anthony is extraordinary.I hope Sir Anthony receives the academy award."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,4/10,"Technically, The Father is well made, with good quality direction, cinematography, editing and sets. But the script, acting and general atmosphere left me cold. Already too long at 1 hour 37 minutes, this movie is the cinematic equivalent of falling into depression over several hours (it actually feels like centuries). One of the UK's most over-rated actors, Anthony Hopkins, executes his lines with his usual hallmark 'character' and aplomb, but was operating in an empathy-free zone and I felt strangely unmoved by his plight. The other actors take a workaday approach to the job, but all those middle-class English accents prattling on froze my brain, and I missed a lot of their lines because I was yawning (my jaw still aches). This movie is unattractive, uninspiring, tedious, annoying, and life-draining.But it did make me feel something: it made me feel depressed about the prospect of getting old, and the growing probability we all have of getting dementia. Having relatives with dementia is bad enough, but watching someone's mind dissolve in front of your eyes for entertainment must be appealing only to people with a sick sense of humour or disturbed morality. Hope I die before I get old. Or at least before I ever have to watch this movie again."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,5/10,"If you want to know what it's like to have dementia or want to know what it's like to care for someone who has it, then you found the right movie. I don't think I really needed this movie, though, because I kinda figured that's what it would be like. The performances are good but I'm not sure why this needed to be a film, except to get more people to see it. I feel like it would have been more powerful and meaningful to see the play. It left me pretty flat, like the screen it played on."
THE FATHER,15 October 2021,9/10,"Before there was ""Iris"" and "" Amour"". Two fantastic movies about Dementia/illness.Then there was that horrible candycoated film called ""Still Alice"" which was like a Hallmark TV movie. Dreadful and Julianne Moore should have that Oscar taken away for that mess.Now we have ""The Father"". My fellow reviewers have painstakingly dissected it's wondrous attributes. So all I will say is 'Watch It.' Just a damn good film. Thank you ,Sir Anthony. Watching your performance is pure joy and pathos. Hold that Oscar high.This film should be on the List of 1000 movies to see before dying.Put the kids to bed, don't have snacks or alcoholic beverages. Turn your phones off. Savour this."
THE FATHER,16 May 2021,9/10,"I watched this with an open mind as I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie at the start played almost like a psychological thriller with character changes to unsettle you. Subtle changes of the scene with each shot and a real deja vu on conversations are then made to disorient and confuse you and put you into the shoes of Anthony Hopkins' character. It works very well indeed and near the end you don't know if you're coming or going. The last 5 minutes are overwhelmingly sad and hits home the subject matter of the film. From reading some of the low rating reviews it is clear these people have no clue what is a good film. Unless it's The Fast and the Furious or a no brainer action movie, it will be boring and confusing to them. To others who have a modicum of intelligence, an appreciation for good filmmaking and an understanding of the subject matter, this will be an absolutely outstanding gem with a strong resonating beat that cuts straight to the heart of you. Such is the utter emotional devastation this movie fills you with at the end, to watch it again would be painful. Hopkins deserves his Oscar for this without doubt."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,What a performance!. Anthony Hopkins told all the young actors to sit down with this performance . They will be showing this in theater and acting schools for a long time.
THE FATHER,23 June 2021,8/10,"My sister-in-law and I chose this for our first post-lockdown cinema visit. Both of us have experience of having cared for parents with dementia, although that is not why we chose to see it: indeed, we struggled for a while making up our minds whether it would be wise to watch a movie that had great potential to be triggering. Given the option, we'd probably have chosen something more cheerful! In the end, our decision to watch it came down to the fact that we knew it was a well-regarded piece, and nothing else on our local picture house bill held any appeal at all.I'm glad we saw it. Florian Zeller is to be congratulated for his brilliant trick of playing with the audience's perceptions of who is who, where is where and even when is when, in order to offer some insight into what the world must feel like for someone descending into dementia. He should also be congratulated for the unflinchingly unsentimental treatment of the story. We are presented with the pain, sorrow, conflicted emotions and occasional flashes of humour that make up the ""loved one with dementia"" experience - sadly, one with which all too many people are familiar - without any overt attempts to manipulate our emotions or tell us how to think. ""The Father"" is a totally absorbing drama, and Anthony Hopkins (cast - almost disturbingly so - as a man called Anthony) inhabits the role with absolute conviction and believability, supported by a superb ensemble of top-notch talent.Without wishing to rain on its parade, though, I would raise a couple of points of detail re. The care of patients with dementia:1) In the final scene of the film, which takes place in a (clearly very expensive) care home, none of the staff is wearing a name-badge. They should be. It helps the patients keep some kind of grip on who is who in their lives.2) In the same scene, Anthony tries to describe how he is feeling. ""I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves,"" he says - to which the nurse replies ""What do you mean?"" WRONG: no trained dementia nurse would ever say such a thing to a patient. If the patient were able to assemble the words to express themself more clearly, they would do so, and requiring them to explain what they mean only heightens their distress and anxiety. I'm surprised that this slip-up was not spotted and removed from what is an otherwise excellent script."
THE FATHER,3 January 2021,10/10,"My grandfather struggled with dementia for the last few years of his life, and this movie helps me understand his experience and struggles so much better. I am blown away with how moving and incredible this movie was. This is a film everybody should watch. Motion Pictures like this are the reason I love film.Edit: I just saw the news tonight about Anthony Hopkins getting his second Oscar. I think this is one of the most well deserved Oscar wins I have seen. Although he will probably never see this, I would like to thank Anthony for providing his incredible acting. It was one of the most heart wrenching things I have watched and it means so much to me. The Oscar is definitely an incredible accolade for Anthony, but most importantly, this is a performance that I know will touch the hearts of many as it did mine."
THE FATHER,10 July 2021,10/10,"See it.Brilliant acting
Hopkins at the top of his game
Brilliant script
Genius director."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,9/10,"Beautifully acted, written, directed and very well paced. I can't understand why it hasn't won more Oscar's. Who am I kidding? Academy Awards have become a sham now.This movie is one of those that will go down in history as one of those classics that everyone agrees to be a masterpiece."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,10/10,"Thank you, Anthony Hopkins, for giving me an eternal fear of forgetting everyone and everything I hold dear.I just cried so much. What a heartbreaking story, backed by amazing cast.I'm just gonna go to my bed and cry, if you don't mind."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,8/10,"This movie was perfect: the directing, acting, script, editing... everything! It's so impressive how drastic changes happens all the time and it seems so smooth the way it flows, perfect directing! The film is also powerful and real, everyone that has someone in the family with Alzheimer will relate with it a lot. One of the best movies. I love it, decent 8/10."
THE FATHER,9 September 2021,10/10,"""The Father"" is nothing short of a heartbreaking film, about an elderly man suffering from dementia. Throughout the film, you are shown the perspective of Anthony, the dementia patient with characters appearing and disappearing (e.g. His son-in-law) not to mention dialogue that contradicts what was said before (e.g. His daughter denying that she was going to move to Paris despite her saying that she would earlier in the film). This creates confusion in the audience, which is the intended effect. I think this movie is a great way of showing people what dementia is like and just how horrible it can be.As for negatives, I honestly can't think of any. The performances were all brilliant (especially Anthony Hopkins'), the cinematography, editing, music etc. All fit together really nicely to create an immersive, unforgettable, and saddening experience.So, to conclude, watch this movie if you're fine with watching an extremely well-made yet depressing movie that you won't forget any time soon."
THE FATHER,22 November 2020,10/10,Anthony Hopkins is phenonmenal. 100% better than the marvel star
THE FATHER,2 October 2021,9/10,"What a beautifully constructed film. The intricate film-making creates such an immersive experience, the audience real delve into the life of the characters, which in this case is quite a heart-breaking place to be, despite its striking reality. This is especially effective in such a contained setting, which is just one of the many brilliant directorial decisions made in The Father.You see this is really a very simple film. There are only a few characters, which gives more room for each to be fully fleshed out, which allows us to engage with each person and their role in the story a lot more. The narrative is told somewhat in a linear manor but fuddled up and moved around to reflect the state of mind of Anthony Hopkins' character (sort of similar to that of Memento) and that's it. Only that isn't it, although technically so little is done so much effect is made, this story benefits so much from simplicity because there we have so much. So much raw emotion and so much heart-breaking realism. You really feel like you are in this world firstly as a viewer, but then you begin to question yourself and your own perception and sense of being and when everything becomes clear at the end of the film you instead think of the people around you and not yourself. You think of those close to you, your family or anyone who is slowly losing touch with themselves and the world around them, only able to hold onto a few fragments of their memories. And that hits you like a ton of bricks.I watched this with two of my friends in the cinema a few weeks ago and all of our reactions when the film had finished was around the lines of ""I want to call my Mum... I want to check up on my Grandad. ... I miss ..."". That's impact for you. I think that gives you plenty of reason to watch this film if you are emotionally stable enough to be taken through the ringer quite a bit. But oh my what a beautifully tragic piece of cinema."
THE FATHER,13 March 2021,8/10,"There are many reasons that this film is one that I one would consider a must see. The still frames in this movie are painted like wonderful paintings. Beautiful contrast and detail in each shot.The acting is so incredible, and the the way the dialogue is nuanced and reveals the true details of the dementia as well as how they tell this through visual storytelling is masterful.The range of emotions and ability to transition the entire mood, tone, and pacing of the scene with or without music is masterful. It almost feels like you are seeing it as a play.The flow of the scenes is impeccable, and there are moments that make your gut sink. Truly an incredible piece of cinema and a worthwhile watch."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,9/10,I think that this is one of the best movie of the last 20 years. You can really explore the dementia sufferer's mind: it's possible to watch the world from his perspective.Anthony Hopkins had one of his best performance ever and Olivia Colman supports him magnificently.The emotions that made me feel are such that I can't not give a 9.
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,9/10,This film takes you through the mind of ab old man with amnesia. It's 100% thought provoking.
THE FATHER,17 April 2021,9/10,"The father is a great drama with a great performance by the cast. Obviously age is just a number for Anthony Hopkins the man is a true legend other cast members are great as well but Imogen Poots could have been better, really good cinematography, other than some minor plot holes I saw nothing wrong with this movie and I absolutely liked it and highly recommend watching it."
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,8/10,"I'm not usually a big fan of movies adapted from stage plays, because the very nature of writing for the theatre places the audience's focus on dialogue, structure and performance, and I'm more of a visuals and music guy when it comes to movies. I can appreciate sharp writing but I need the extra zest of overall fine filmmaking to bring an adaptation above and beyond the theatre. I tend to be more forgiving if a beautiful looking and great sounding movie is relatively lacking in plot or dialogue, versus the opposite (a movie with great writing, but technically bland).I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, but the potentially sensitive subject of dementia, and the fact that this was adapted from a play by a director who was making his screen directorial debut, had me worried. Would it be as stodgy or emotionally manipulative as it could have been? The material might have worked well on stage but would it as cinema?In that regard I was pleasantly surprised. Clearly this was a play, because it is indeed driven by the dialogue and character interactions, and almost entirely set indoors. But Florian Zeller provides some nice cinematic touches that help to raise the experience, mainly in three ways. One, his use of music. The few classical pieces here come in at just the right moments and are extremely effective whenever they do. I suspect that the music was also part of the stage production, because it's important to the protagonist's characterization; listening to music is Anthony's favored escape from reality. But here, the soundtrack fits the movie like a glove and gives it more dynamism. Two, Zeller's cinematographer, Ben Smithard, a veteran of numerous films and shows, vividly captures both the indoor and outdoor environments, most notably the main flat that contains most of the ""action."" The apartment complex becomes its own character, in a way, as the viewer gets to know its geography and objects. Credit must also go to the production and set designers, of course. Three, and probably most importantly, you have the excellent work by Greek film editor Yorgos Lamprinos. I haven't seen anything else he has done, but his editing here is a huge part of what makes this material translate so well as a movie. He was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.But those are all factors that personally made this such an excellent film for ME. Of course, the main draws here for most people will be Anthony Hopkins and the writing, by an award-winning playwright. And those things are as strong as you've heard. The writing is witty, unpredictable and, by the end, poignant, as you enter the frayed mind of Anthony while he deals with encroaching dementia. Zeller's treatment of such a sensitive subject is refreshingly free of sentimentality or emotional manipulation. This is pitched almost as much like a Hitchcockian mystery as it is a drama of old age and family, and the pacing is fantastic; at a tight 97 minutes, it never overstays its welcome or drags. As is typical of great writing, the script drops only as much detail as it needs to throughout, while leaving just enough lingering questions in the viewers' minds. And beware, not all of those questions will be answered. Even after the end credits begin rolling, you will need to interpret certain plot points in your own way, and there is a lot of fodder for discussion and debate here. My partner and I couldn't agree on what really transpired in the family's past. It frustrated her, but I loved the ambiguity.Hopkins is simply amazing here. He brings humor, anger, sadness, irascibility, strength and fragility in one fully formed and complex package of a character. He's such a natural in the role that I assumed he originated the part on stage. So It was to my surprise that I found out that not only was this film Hopkins's first time playing ""Anthony,"" but the play was originally in French and therefore began life with a French lead in the role. Christopher Hampton, the translator, rightly receives a co-writing credit because he is a large part of why the English dialogue still crackled so well. Anybody would think it was the original language. The immensely talented Olivia Colman holds her own as the titular character's loving yet conflicted daughter, but this is mainly Hopkins's show and he is absolutely engrossing every second he's on the screen. And it's not just his facial expressions and line delivery either; it's a surprisingly physical performance; the viewer can easily gleam Anthony's varying moods and emotions merely from his body language (and he shows off some dance moves too). I haven't yet seen the late Chadwick Boseman in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, but after witnessing Hopkins's incredible work here, I can't imagine anyone else more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. Mads Mikkelsen for Another Round, maybe, but he somehow wasn't even nominated."
THE FATHER,1 March 2021,9/10,"It's so uncommon for an actor of Hopkins' talent and reputation to achieve quite possibly the best performance of his career so deep into it. He's acted brilliantly for so long and I don't mean to undermine anything he's ever accomplished in the past, but normally by now actors start phoning it in. But wow. He was not.This film was devastating to watch. In the best way possible. From the acting - which was lead by Hopkins but was not just great because of him! - to the writing, directing, scoring, editing, cinematography on and on and on everything was amazing! The only reason I did not give it a perfect 10/10 is because I so rarely give them out I'm afraid to act too rashly and give it out too soon but trust me... I may end up doing just that.As someone who has experienced the subject matter of this film personally in my family I cannot express how painfully accurate every little detail was in the writing and in Hopkins' beautiful performance. The confusion, the anger, the regret, the brutal honesty and lack of self awareness, the fear, the bipolar nature was all so frighteningly accurate that I forgot many times that I was watching a film not a documentary or even real life.I don't say this lightly.. this may not only be the best film of the past year but of the past decade. Absolutely amazing."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,The Father is an absolute masterpiece and deserves all the accolades that it's getting. Anthony Hopkins gives the best performance in his career. This is a film that stays with you.
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,10/10,"Give Anthony Hopkins the Oscar on April 26. He gives you the best performance of the decade. An old man with dementia loses his ties to reality. His mind deteriorates, and reality stops making any sense. This movie will haunt you, especially if you have a relative with dementia. Such a heartbreaking movie. ABSOLUTELY the best movie of the year and the best performance of the year by Hopkins."
THE FATHER,4 June 2021,10/10,My favorite movie of the year. Anthony Hopkins does one of the best performance i've ever seen. The cinematography and directing is perfect. By the ending scene I wasn't able to cry because I was so awed by Hopkin's performance.
THE FATHER,18 June 2021,9/10,"If I'm honest I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm an action fan, people blowing stuff up car chases loud noises that kinda thing. This was my wife's choice and as I'm a good husband I dutifully went along. And I'm so glad I did. All of the performances were spot on. Olivia Colman never lets me down in anything she's done and her performance as Anne is fantastic. But the real star and rightly so is Sir Anthony Hopkins. His performance as the titular Father is just magnificent. The film itself is at times so moving and at others so hard but it kept me guessing right up to the end. It's a must watch movie, maybe not a big screen movie but a must watch all the same. 9 out of ten."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,10/10,"After experiencing the downfall of my father myself at close hand to this hideous condition ....I'm so glad someone has realistically portrayed if only by a fraction the hurt and horror .i applaud you for observations ,a true horror film which is sometimes the life we live . A new benchmark in film on this subject imho."
THE FATHER,22 November 2021,9/10,"Really powerful, it really hit me hard, seeing this family struggling with memory loss, confusion and some backstory. The acting is amazing, emotions feel real and it's even stronger when you personally know someone with Alzheimer's.Kinda disappointed with the soundtrack, which is good but was sold like a masterpiece. But like I said, it's good."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,9/10,"I love Anthony Hopkins from the first time I saw him in The silence of the lambs.Amazing performance, very good movie , very very moving and touching.Worth to watch it."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,10/10,No words for this unbelievably incredible performance . Just hand him all the awards academy!!!!
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,10/10,Don't come into this movie thinking you've seen it all. It's not an easy watch /: Hermit crabs love their flats.
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,9/10,"Simple stories & good actors. Simply it's real, believable, short & sad but you will never regret watching it."
THE FATHER,14 May 2021,10/10,"The Father is a difficult film to review. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is not an exploitative trauma film like so many other movies and shows out there right now. In some ways, The Father is the scariest horror film that I have ever seen. You need to be emotionally prepared to watch this film and the Alzheimer's disease reality that it presents. This is not a ""date night"" movie. Schindler's List has more lighthearted moments in it than The Father.Do not let these comments discourage you from watching The Father, though. If you are a fan of cinema and the wide breadth of emotions that it can elicit, The Father is simply a jaw-dropping exposition into the very raw emotions that this disease can, and has, inflicted on countless generations of families, including my own. You will probably not want to re-watch The Father as soon as it is finished, and that is okay. It reminds me of Requiem for a Dream (2000) in that both films are very emotionally powerful, but I was not dying to see either of them again right after I saw them the first time. Some films are better left to marinate on our consciousness, and The Father is certainly one of those."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,9/10,"I watched every movie nominated for each Oscar nominated actor & if somebody else wins not named Anthony Hopkins, then the Academy Awards should cease & desist. To play this role at that level is remarkable."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,10/10,"A gut punch of a movie about an elderly widower and his increasingly tenuous grip on reality. People come, people go--his former helper, his new helper, his daughter, his son-in-law--but we are never quite sure who is real and who is not, because some of them exist only in his imagination. It is precisely this confusion, on his part and ours, that is at the core of this heartbreaking film. As the title character, Anthony Hopkins is better than ever, losing little bits of himself (and large chunks of his memory) as he withers away before our eyes, turning in a performance that is as fully realized and richly detailed as any you will see this year. (If by the end of the film you still aren't weeping, you'd better have your tear ducts checked.) The splendid Olivia Colman is every bit as moving as his daughter, who desperately wants to do what's best for her dad but is not at all sure how to go about it. The lighting--generally subdued, and often downright dim--serves as a perfect metaphor for the darkness in his mind, and the long, long night that lies ahead. Flawlessly directed by Florian Zeller, who co-wrote the screenplay with Christopher Hampton. A Tony-winner in 2016 for Frank Langella, who starred in the stage version, also written by Zeller. Hopkins may be taking home a trophy or two of his own, and deservedly so."
THE FATHER,22 July 2021,1/10,"It doesn't take more than 5 minutes to realize you will be watching a television theatre. Like that crap with Ewan McGregor I can't even remember the name of. This is exactly the same, pretentious, quasi-philosophical type of play. And a mundane, annoying one. One even sir Anthony would not save. As a matter of fact, this movie's only value hides in his participation. If you can even talk about value here. The rest is literally just a bland, ordinary story, the outcome of which you can easily guess. I mean, at first one may even think there will be some sort of mystery involved. Some sort of suspense. And to its credit, the first 15 minutes feel like there will be some mystery, some suspense. But then you realize there won't be anything like that and actually there won't be much at all. Just cheap thrills for the masses. Yes, you got that right. This movie is a cleverly disguised cheap thrill. And judging by the ratings, in that it actually succeeded."
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,1/10,"My title says it. I watched his film for an hour until I said, enough. I wasn't going to be one who said I wasted the full 1:37. I had already wasted an hour and I quit. It was going nowhere and I had no anticipation that the other 37 minutes would be any better. I'd say if you go 30 minutes and don't get it, then you probably will not at all."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"Really - unbelievable. Beautiful. Compelling. Within a few minutes I could already see why he won the Oscar (last night!). It does all become clear in the end, I think, although I might just watch it again to be sure. Olivia Colman is lovely, as always, so emotive... Really, a terrific film - just phenomenal, particularly because of Mr. Hopkins."
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,8/10,"What an unsettling, horrifying, heartbreaking portrayal of the inside the mind of a person living with Alzheimer's. The desperation, helplessness, vulnerability, and unbearable confusion of living with Alzheimer's are portrayed perfectly in the movie. Such brilliant performances..."
THE FATHER,18 March 2021,9/10,"Sir Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman are sublime in ""The Father,"" co-written and directed by Florian Zeller based on his Play. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins is simply masterful as an aging man suffering memory loss and Academy Award winner Olivia Colman (""The Favourite"") is his daughter and caretaker Anne, equally skillful in her supporting role. The moments of quiet in this film, particularly at the end, are as powerful and significant to the story as the heart-wrenching, emotionally effective performances from the cast."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,4/10,The kind of movie that you'll watch once and then forget about it.But ... an Oscar ??!!Anthony Hopkins one the best profurmnce award ??How ? Why ??
THE FATHER,21 June 2021,6/10,"Acting is top notch; you'd already guess by the actors. The problem is the story is not that interesting. The ""trick"" or gimmick is kinda new, but not worth the investment in time. I blame the trailer for misleading one to believe there was more intrigue in store. Story was obviously meant for a play; not a movie. Unless you get pleasure from a sharp stick in the eye, pass this one by."
THE FATHER,15 August 2021,9/10,"The narrative is similar to Memento. We watch the story through the eyes of the main character (Anthony Hopkins plays divinely). Having an ailment, he can only improvise in situations where fate throws him. The director shows how important it is for people to be certain in their lives."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,8/10,"Between emotions and mind games, curiosity is evolved in our minds, many probabilities kept us thrilled till the end to know what is exactly going on there.It's a trip through dementia and obstinacy, clarifying the bad influences of them on the other people around you, who are concerned about and trying really hard to help you and put you into your comfort zone.The method of actions and post-actions that is applied by the great actor Anthony Hopkins (the father), and the genius Olivia Coleman (the daughter) to show the Emotions, the Obstacles, and the Disturbances that they are having between themselves and between each other, all of these themes are shown through repeated dialogues and repeated scenes.The movie represents how Anthony is lost in memories, and the what's the perfect explanation of dementia, the director - or maybe the writer - chose to show us the story through an image that contains themes of dementia and insanity, and this scenes of memories also show the struggle of Anne (Olivia Coleman) throughout her life wasting years attached to her father, afraid of leaving him alone, he was arrogant that he was not convinced that he is complaining and also a little bit selfish. Which brings us to the dilemma of love is sometimes devastating."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"Amazing acting, Amazing writing.Some of us may well wind up the way he does one day.I pray to God I don't."
THE FATHER,17 June 2021,10/10,Holy smokes they are only in a flat and from start to finish was absolutely brilliant no doubt the acting was extremely good amd convincing. I recommend to anyone sit and watch this film and you will be impressed.
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,9/10,"This movie is really something for a second there I really thought am I watching this movie or I'm the part of it.This is one of those movies where it plays mind games with you, confuse you, thrills you and finally shows you the harsh reality how it can be scary sometimes.Sir Anthony Hopkins did a great job, he's acting was just magnificent and he really deserved the oscar for it."
THE FATHER,13 March 2021,9/10,Hopkins is brilliant as an aging father dealing with dementia and Colman a loving daughter faced with decisions concerning his eventual long term care.
THE FATHER,6 November 2021,10/10,"Absolutely brilliant performance from both Academy Award winners - Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman; two actors who never fail to deliver. A fascinating and emotional insight into what it is like for a person slowly descending into dementia, a cruel and vicious illness that steals little bits of a person on a daily basis until nothing is left."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,9/10,"I have nothing to add to the informative and interesting assessments of this great movie. Just for clinical interest....many reviewers mention Alzheimers, but my husband, who's a psychiatrist, felt Anthony's dementia was caused by Lewy Body Disease. It's very common, but not as well known by its name and is most often characterized by hallucinations and cognitive disonance, along with the memory loss it shares with Alzheimers."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,9/10,.. I lost my father the day before new years eve to demensia. Anthony Hopkins - you are a genius. You acted my father and his illness and you did it so well it broke my heart again.
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,7/10,Great to see sir hopkins in a new film. Always such a great actor. The movie was hard to watch because it hit home. Definitely a tough look at the horrible reality of dementia and everywhere affected by it. My grandmother is in the early stages and it breaks my heart.
THE FATHER,18 March 2021,9/10,"What a beautiful movie, good job Florian Zeller , you skillfully created all this fascinating drama and brought us into Anthony's world , the border between reality and dream , what a good script , what a beautiful decoupage and what mezzanines Simple but at the same time special , the soundtrack captures the human heart and doubles the dramatic burden of the film.
But Anthony Hopkins , this inexhaustible man in the world of cinema to whom you owe an Oscar , all my respect to you anthony hopkins , Olivia Coleman, you are a full-fledged actress.
This movie should be seen many times and enjoy every moment of it ."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"What a wonderful, amazing, humane way to tell a story.As a viewer I was immersed and felt every bit of the characters sense of reality.Simply wonderful the way it's told."
THE FATHER,25 May 2021,9/10,"Many films have depicted this disease, but few have dared to do it from the perspective of the person who suffers from it. It is appreciated that the scriptwriter is a pioneer in this regard. In addition, creative decisions are correct regarding the message. The best thing about the movie is Anthony Hopkins, who deserves much more than an Oscar for this performance. The only flaw is that, on very few occasions, the tape feels tedious and perhaps it could have been even shorter. If not for that (like one or two scenes), I would give it 10/10."
THE FATHER,24 October 2021,10/10,"Mr Hopkins will get his award for sure after such a good acting. Second of all, the visual production was amazing! First half hour of the movie I have found myself at struggling to figure out the design of the house; the objects were constantly changing as well as the places of rooms (even it did not, they succeed to deceive me right there) and I completely felt the same as Anthony. It gives you a chance to identify with the main character, so that was really good attempt and a directorial success."
THE FATHER,31 July 2021,9/10,This movie gives us a message that we never abandon our elder ones. I literally cried at the ending.And acting is totally lit. Great work.
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,"Wow! This film blew my mind. Having just dealt with the death of my dementia-ridden elderly mother, this story cut a bit too close to my own experience. While Alzheimer's is a horror story for the victim, this film shows us that the family and caregivers need sympathy, too. So true! Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as is Olivia Coleman. First-rate performances and fine filmmaking. A must see. Bring a box of Kleenex. Hope for a cure for this terrible brain-wasting disease."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"I'm at a loss for words, I just can't describe the mix of emotions I felt watching this movie. The editing of the film is wonderful, in the beginning everything seems very confusing, in fact, until the end of the film many of the things are still confused. However, I believe that this is what the film wants to go through when we watch it, this is how it goes in the head of a person with Alzheimer's, this is really how he feels ... Confused, confused with everything, confused with his feelings and confused why people don't understand what happens to them.It is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, it is about a daughter's true love towards her father, it is about the obstacles that she has to face in relation to her illness and the extent to which she could take it this ... After all, we are all human, nobody is made of iron and to what extent can we endure situations like these by someone we love?I really hope this movie wins some Oscars, I will advise everyone!"
THE FATHER,27 September 2021,10/10,I had such a mix of emotion watching this movie. In parts it's strange and almost horror movie like. Other parts are very emotional. The fantastic acting of Anthony Hopkins makes the portrayal of a elderly man suffering with mental illness so very real.I'd recommend this movie to everyone.
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,Anyone who a aw me watch this just saw a 40year old white male cry his eyes out. Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins on a subject many don't understand or choose to ignore. The end scene almost killed me.
THE FATHER,6 May 2021,7/10,"Except I don't appreciate the music being too heavy, it definitely worths your watching. You'll have the idea of what dementia is and how you probably should do to deal with it or to face it yourself."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,10/10,"""I feel as if I'm losing my all leaves""some movies are really hard to describe,
some movies never actually feels like a movie,
some movies keep haunting us all the time,
this is that movieThe Father is a breathtaking work of art. Have come across a lots of work on memory loss, dementia etc, but it's not like any of them. It's like a dream, a confusing one, we often see; a constant fight with reality. A remarkable style of story telling, mind-blowing direction, Sir Anthony Hopkins' genius, unforgettable scenes and top notch editing - this uncanny thing is the finest of movies I ever watched. Can't say more!Have seen Minari & Nomadland, and personally I think The Father deserves Oscar more than anyone. Have no doubt on Hopkins' 2nd Academy this year. Hope it will get all the 6! Yes.."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,8/10,"Trigger warning for anyone who cant handle seeing old men break down.. like me. I really needed that warning. Sobbing, this really broke me. Dementia through the lens of the sufferer. This movie nailed what it must feel like on both ends of the spectrum. Anyway I'm going to call my dad now."
THE FATHER,23 June 2021,7/10,"Anne (Olivia Colman) attempts to care for her aging father (Anthony Hopkins) that refuses to accept his need for assistance. Florian Zeller wrote the stage play, wrote the adapted screenplay (with help from Christopher Hampton), and directed the film. (Sheesh!)Immediately after watching all 8 2021 Best Picture nominees, I ranked The Father #6 out of 8. After watching for the second time, I think it probably should've been upped to 4 or 5. Even though I still think there were better films in the mix, I have yet to get over how PHENOMENAL this film's screenplay, performances, and general production were.Other than Best Picture, The Father was nominated for five other awards at this year's Oscars: Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia Colman), Film Editing, Production Design, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Per usual, I completely agree with all of these nominations, but I would've liked to see Cinematography in there as well. The cinematography was simple yet so well executed. There were many times where the camera stayed in one place as the characters moved around it, and it was notably impressive.Without a doubt, the two best aspects of the film were the screenplay and Mr. Anthony Hopkins (which aligns with the Oscar wins). The screenplay is original and a brilliant way to tell the story of dementia. Hopkins' performance in this film should be studied in acting school. He flips the switch from comfortable to scared at the drop of a hat, and he does it seamlessly. His expressions, body language, and tone are perfect for the role, and his Oscar is very well deserved.The search is still on for a film adapted from a play where we don't feel stuck in one location. Thankfully, the flat we were bound to in The Father was absolutely beautiful. It was charming and warm and the Opera music we heard so often added to that warmth aptly. Despite the lack of diversity, I ended up enjoying the production design quite a bit.Now, even after all of those wonderful accolades (and minor criticisms), I still wouldn't say that I was thoroughly entertained for the entire run-time. Many aspects wowed me, yet I still found myself to be a little bored. I was happy that the run-time was a short hour and 37 minutes because it felt repetitive once I understood what was happening. There didn't seem to be a real climax, although I did think the ending was pretty remarkable. I needed a bit more ebb and flow to keep me interested.Out of all the movies nominated for Oscars this year, this is definitely one you need to see. Watch to see a master of acting, a remarkable screenplay, and dementia through a different lens.@boomroastedmoviecritic on Instagram."
THE FATHER,20 June 2021,7/10,"This was extremely well acted and was very moving, but I felt it jumped around too much I know its supposed to show the confusion but it felt a little too rushed and unexplained."
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,10/10,"If you never experienced dementia in family, then you'll probably find this movie kinda.. boring. Watching repeatable simple dialogs and scenes isn't really entertaining. Some will maybe be touched at the end of the movie.. either because they're sensitive or simply because that is ""expected"" when watching such movie.My father had dementia and all I can say is, this movie is the closest I've ever seen. I say closest, because movie mostly shows demented person's view and behavior and doesn't touch much other's family members feelings and thoughts (in this case, daughter and her husband). I think that was made on purpose, so observer can concentrate more on main character -so observer can understand him better (as far that's even possible).In that sense, this is an one actor movie. And what an act it is! Hopkins's execution in brilliant... real... he IS demented -and I know what I am talking about.No, I won't watch this movie ever again.. too many memories become alive."
THE FATHER,24 March 2021,8/10,"82/100The Father is a truly mesmerizing, seamless and devastating placement into the perspective of an aging and mentally ill man. all of the twists and turns faced by Anthony in the film are just as daunting and confusing for the viewer as they are for him in the film, and it makes this film a brutal but addicting watch. The movie is a seemingly endless episode of The Twilight Zone and i could have been captivated by it for at least another 30 minutes of added runtime. Hopkins and Colman both deliver master class and award-worthy performances as one would expect, just adding on to the greatness of the film"
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,10/10,Best movie of 2021. Anthony Hopkins was truly amazing. If he doesn't get best actor it will be a travesty.
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,10/10,"Exquisite, unique, so painfully that I started to cry... Full of emotions and feelings... Anthony Hopkins must win this academy award. Bravo! 👏 👏 👏"
THE FATHER,6 February 2021,10/10,"This is Anthony Hopkins best film to date , his performance his peerless. This told entirely from his perspective and understanding. It is bewildering and tragic. I loved this film but it is sad and pulls no punches in regards to growing old with dementia."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,8/10,"The Father was a well-done movie. There were many things that I have liked about it. First of all, Anthony Hopkin's acting was incredible. He excellently represented the inner conflicts and emotions of his character that the audience also felt. He is one of the best names in acting even when he is old. Secondly, storytelling was incredible. This kind of storytelling is something that many of us have never experienced before. Even though it got really confusing, it felt really realistic in a way that you think you are actually suffering from it. With the combination of storytelling and acting, you can easily get into the story. Finally, the length of the movie was just okay. I think it would get really out of hand if the movie was about 2.30 hours long.However, I didn't like the complexity that the movie tries to create very much. I know it is the point of it, but it starts to make everything harder for the audience, in my opinion. I believe it is not a good idea to reveal the truth after creating so much confusion. I think this way because, after a moment, you can't remember every detail about the previous scenes, and it becomes hard for you to make connections and realize the reality in the movie. I know that the last scene of the film was powerful. But it still annoyed me a bit and dropped my pleasure of watching because I couldn't grasp what was actually going on. Maybe, that is the point."
THE FATHER,8 May 2021,8/10,"We see the importance of the edition here because it's really another character in the movie. However, over everything, the end broke my mind, because to think about the role interpreted by Anthony Hopkins on How he wakes up every morning thinking that he is at home with his daughter, that who doesn't love as much as the other one who died by an accident, he wakes up confused and with an attitude similar like a child one... It's very scary to think about getting older in this way, so raw and real."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,10/10,"The story is to portray about the old and Alzheimer dad, but it's so tender, sentimental and real honestly. It can't deny that the leading actor is a legend and totally agree with why he got an Oscar award. Beside, the way of telling story makes me feel touch, sad, and laugh sometimes. It's hard to tell people what Alzheimer people think, but this movie can show visually these concerns. Honestly, the relationship between my dad and I isn't smooth and rich, however, I need to think again about this relationship after done this movie."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,10/10,"There is no doubt that Alzheimer's is one of the most difficult diseases and conditions that a person goes through in the last stages of his life. We hear about it and read it continuously, but this is the first time we touch this sad experience and live it as if it were a personal experience during our viewing of this masterpiece ""The Father""Directing is unparalleled, as it's made the viewers as if they were a member of this elderly man's family, they were literally able to reverse what is going on in the patient's mind from random memories, loss and fear to a moving picture, and he was able to connect the unconnected and intertwined events in his mind by a smooth and coherent manner at the same time this is exactly what Alzheimer's means.When the big-screen giant Anthony Hopkins is in the work, we can't just close our eyes for a second. His acting level isn't reached by an actor before, every detail, every behavior and involuntary and involuntary reaction that the elderly perform in the role without even noticing that he is acting, but rather actually doing it even intuitively.Of course, there was some incomprehensible scenes and put us in a questionable position, for which we will not find an answer, but this is exactly the point of those scenes."
THE FATHER,17 June 2021,10/10,One of the greatest actor of all time in his best performance. This will remains with you forever.
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,10/10,"Not much to say, it's beautifully done, it's truly profound and inspired and Hopkins gives the performance of his career. This film is a must-see, once-in-a-lifetime piece that accurately depicts dementia, and ends on one of the most heartbreaking scenes in all of cinema. Please watch this movie, it deserves every second of your time."
THE FATHER,2 September 2021,8/10,"Anthony is an intelligent man in his early 80s, who is slowly descending into the twilight world of dementia. We see events from his perspective, which means a Kafkaesque, nightmarish world in which people switch identity, and even his own flat alters its appearance. The only downside of this approach is that we are never sure whether the conversations he experiences have ever happened, or may be memories of past events, or with other people. Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor, who conveys the part with great depth and conviction. Don't expect a happy ending, though."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,10/10,My grandmother has an alzheimer's disease. When i take her photo and show her she says who's this old lady? When she realise that this is her she is starting cry I think this is the one of most killing illness cause when you don't remember anything what's the point of your life?
THE FATHER,24 September 2021,10/10,"First off - it's the best acted film I've ever seen. Across the board. Just sensational. And yes, it's Hopkins' greatest ever screen performance by some distance - and with his stellar body of work - that's some statement, and subsequently some performance. Holy Cow. Delighted for him and his win, the most deserving of my lifetime I think.Beyond the acting, though - we have one of the most powerful and important films ever made. It's the best debut I've ever seen. It's the saddest film I've ever seen, but I've seen it 3 times. I can't stop thinking about it.As with every awards season, I check out all the major contenders. This should have won everything. Nothing was better, and it was a pretty bloody strong year.For me? This could be the best film of the century so far."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,2/10,"If you have hoped to find a movie that makes you feel like you are trapped in a terrible nightmare, hoping, praying and inexplicably waiting for some sort of twist... look no further because this is that movie.With all the talent in this movie, I really wanted to love it, sadly I am mad at myself for not turning it off because I can never unsee this abomination.Surely the sheep will droll on about how real and deep this is but rest assured it's only ""real"" and ""deep"" in the sense that you will really want to jump in the deep end of a hard drink after watching this never ending horror film."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,1/10,"Whole movie except final scene told me that there is something fishy like a conspiracy over Anthony's flat.Movie has some Alzheimer's desease but if it is about psycho desease then it should had other additional psycho illnesses. Not only Anthony, all other roles and writer, directors are mad and lunatic.Edit: I am just saying that only 10 or 20 percent scenes of this movie truly show how Alzheimer works. Other parts seems dreams with hallucinations, schizophrenia possibly some other mental illness that I can not name."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,8/10,"83 year old Anthony Hopkins portrays the father role who have a skewed and delusional memory due to the demantia adapted by the play *La Pere* to the cinema. Considering his age, his performance was spectacular and made me cry a few times while i was watching it. One of his finest acting along with The Elephant man and Remains of the Day. The Grade for Sir Anthony Hopkins acting and musical score of the film for Ludovico Einaudi are 9 but the film does not deserve more than 8."
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,9/10,"Being a Hopkins fan, I was looking forward to seeing his latest film, playing an old man entering the final chapter of his life.The film is brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, but was far too violent to my heart for me to say I enjoyed it.Having fairly recently gone through a very similar experience with my own father just a few years ago, the film brought back, with shining clarity, all of the horrible memories of his final months."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,,"It's safe to say that Sir Anthony Hopkins is a national treasure and he is just breathtaking in this role.My god, what a performance!"
THE FATHER,21 August 2021,1/10,"The wasted hour and a half (the film's short duration is its only plus) gives me the right to say, don't watch this crap. There is no drama, no plot, no nothing. The movie is empty. Sick ramblings of an old man."
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,8/10,"Wonderfully shot and acted. Thoughtful approach to dementia and insights into how muddled the mind can become, messing with time. This will do more for your long-term care planning than anything else.8/10."
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,Anthony and Olivia deliver a deeply powerful and utterly heart-wrenching perspective of life with dementia. Anthony has such a way to switch emotion on a pin drop with such immovable force that to watch till the end had me holding back the tears.Such a subject could not be handled nor portrayed by any greater cast and crew with such accuracy in editing nor better symphony of acting.
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,The performance of Hopkins is superb! I hope he wins an Oscar for this. This is a very touching film and what I liked about it is that we see dementia from a different perspective (the perspective of the person who suffers from it). Bravo!
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,9/10,"Brilliantly crafted story, have never seen anything quite like it."
THE FATHER,22 June 2021,10/10,This will stay with me for a long time. My mum had dementia and Anthony Hopkins absolutely got it. May be his strongest performance ever. Totally mesmerising.
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,One of the greatest movies and acting I've ever seen...
THE FATHER,6 May 2021,10/10,"What a beautiful movie about a condition often forgotten. After working as an at home nurse, you often see people struggle with Alzheimers, where they sometimes remember you, and other times they don't. It is a scary condition explained perfectly in this movie, and how it effects yourself and others around you. Should be a must see for everyone."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,6/10,"A gripping movie and sad movie that brings you on an emotional rollercoaster. Anthony Hopkins steals the show, an absolutely fantastic performance.I have to say I was a little disappointed with the ending. I get why they did it, but still thought it could have ended differently."
THE FATHER,6 June 2021,10/10,Anthony Hopkins delivers the greatest performance I have ever seen on film. So much for actors being at the height of their powers when young. Olivia Coleman is also very good as his daughter. The filming and the way the set decorations changed helped me to feel how he felt losing his mind. This is what movies are for. I highly recommend.
THE FATHER,18 September 2021,10/10,"This isn't just a film about dementia, it's an journey and what a ride!This film deliberately leaves the audience a bit lost and confused throughout as we're not just watching we're a part Antony's word as he sees it.It's a tough call but I think this is the best I have ever seen Sir Anthony Hopkins in. One of the most deserved Oscars.I was a mess by the end.""I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves"". I broke right there."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,9/10,"The Good: Firstly, the actors. Of course, Anthony Hopkins shows us a master class in acting - but that wouldn't be enough if everyone around him faltered. Thankfully, they don't - with the entire (small) cast performing astonishingly well with gripping, believable and nuanced performances. The directing is also tight and assured (in a directorial debut no less) - in keeping the setting small, the first-time director can play to his strengths - using the same amount of space he would have in a stage play. Using the unreliable narrator trope is also a clever move - as it keeps the story engaging and interesting when there's actually not much going on in the 'timeline'.The Bad: There isn't much to complain about really. It's a small script that doesn't really go anywhere outside the main characters - this is not a criticism, but don't expect a grand tale with sweeping cinematic gestures - this is firmly about a father, daughter and those in close proximity.Should you watch it: This is an intense film with a gripping final scene. If you are OK with the subject matter (my mum can't watch this as my grandfather went through this), then the film will leave you with a lasting impression. Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,30 August 2021,10/10,"A perspective of the world from a man with dementia. This is an absolute masterpiece. So powerful, so sad I will never watch this movie again."
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,7/10,"One of the best acting of Anthoni Hopkins, if he at the end of this month get an Oscar, he will deserve it, the movie generally has nice story and editing is so great,"
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,3/10,"I appreciate that Anthony Hopkins is a skilled actor and so forth, but I gave the movie The Father a 1/10, a fat ONE. - I am not a member of the 1% who needs a movie to experience how depressed life can be. For me movies are an escape pod to a few joyful, entertaining moments. I don't understand why movies are made to depress us. Who are the people that actually like to watch how old people embarrass themselves? This is so extremely sad. Go for love and enjoy life. - Well, okay a 3/10 because it wasn't ALL bad."
THE FATHER,27 November 2021,9/10,"Anyone with elderly parents, regardless of their mental state, will instantly recognize and empathize with many of the characters. It's the main reason the story is so compelling.The second reason is the magnificent performances by all the actors especially Olivia Coleman who shows the full gamut of emotions she goes through in an understated way. In the age of overacting, this was refreshing indeed.We all know about Anthony Hopkins so I will say no more but he becomes everyone's elderly father the the duration of the movie."
THE FATHER,7 November 2021,8/10,"It is a Big movie, that show us how people with dementia are living day by day. Their life isn't easy, but it's harder to live with relative, who has dementia, - watching every day, how your lovely person can not remember easiest things. But the hardest it's to do the right thing, which wiIl be the best for everyone. I think all this important things were showed perfectly on screen. Also, I'm not sure that there exist the better actor than Anthony Hopkins, who could play this role. Bravo for director and for actors! Bravo!"
THE FATHER,22 September 2021,,"And that's how you make a film. Great acting by Sir Anthony Hopkins and no wonder he got an Oscar for his fabulous performance as Anthony, rest of the cast, moved along with the flow. What a fantabulous film."
THE FATHER,18 September 2021,7/10,"Great acting and engaging story but an absolutely class-based depiction of dementia as a challenge for individuals, families and health systems. This is a highly sanitised upper class private health care view of dementia care. Having lived through my grandfather and father-in-law dying of dementia and working as a GP in Australia in a disadvantaged community I can tell you the choices and options facing most families are much more acute and problematic than this. This is a well acted sanitised upper class view of dementia as a community anc health system problem."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,10/10,Absolutely Hopkins masterclass. This movie is brilliant in every sense of the word. And an amazing insight into the world of dementia. Very well done. Thoroughly enjoyed.
THE FATHER,4 December 2020,9/10,"The father is one of the best movies of 2020
I was lucky to see it during Cairo international film festival inside Cairo opera house
The movie have 2 important points
Firstly of course the great performance specially bu sir Anthony Hopkins and I think he has a good chance to win his second Oscar
Secondly the way of narrative was great as we watch the movie by the eye of old man with divagation , we don't know what we see is real or not , this help us to understand the the idea of the movie
If we talk about oscars I think this movie deserves nominations in : the leading actor, adaptation screenplay, best picture, supporting actress for Olivia Colman"
THE FATHER,7 May 2021,10/10,"Zellman's 'The Father' is a lot more than a film that merely exists to tell you a story. This is an experience and a journey into an unstable world that is just as real, as it is make-believe.At once stupendously effective and profoundly upsetting, ""The Father"" might be the first movie about dementia to give me actual chills.Combining mystery and psychodrama, ""The Father"" is a majestic depiction of things falling away: People, surroundings and time itself are becoming ever more slippery.It's a brutal, terrifyingly simple technique, backed by a production design that manipulates the details of his surroundings just enough to make us question where - and when - we are.Father belongs to the veteran actor Anthony Hopkins who won Oscars for the Best Actor for The Fatherand the debutant director who has moved beyond cliche and sentimentality to reveal the true nature of dementia."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,10/10,"When her time comes, shall his grandchildren put her in the same institution and even in the SAME ROOM of his. Quoting the movie: ""It'd be better for HER"". And finally, suggesting an idea for a Part 2 of the movie: he ultimately dies and reincarnates as her nurse..."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,"It's actually the first time that I see a realistic point of view of a person with dementia and amnesia. It makes me think how difficult it is. These guys did a really great job showing it to us. This is really a great, great movie. And Anthony Hopkins of course... well... you know..."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,"I will never watch this movie ever again, ever.But everyone should atleast try and watch it once."
THE FATHER,13 June 2021,9/10,"This film does an amazing job of giving an insight into the confusing world that a dementia sufferer inhabits. Memories of people, events and places lost or distorted and sometimes imagined; faces and names changing, time shifting.Hopkins plays Anthony, a man struggling to make sense of what is happening to him. Visited by Anne (his daughter) who is trying to care for her father while holding her life together the story centres around their exchanges, difficult, scary, sometimes humourous, and for the greater part bewildering, we are given Anthony's version of reality to decipher.What the film does so well is to bring some of that disorientation to the viewer, without becoming inaccessible. Hopkins does an astonishing job - but credit has to go to everyone involved, the entire cast, the direction, the writing, the music, and everything in-between.The film's stage roots are evident in the simplicity of its location, set almost entirely in an apartment, and this is crucial in creating a feeling of claustrophobic, but also in letting us experience the life of the characters.Never slipping into sentimentality, we are nevertheless taken on a bruising emotional journey, never 100% sure of what is real (which of course is the point) somehow I left the cinema feeling that I understood a whole lot more about the reality, and surrealities of life for a sufferer, which is an incredible achievement."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,I was getting confused and bored before I realised that was a small part of the necessary experience and at that realisation was drawn into the journey of dementia and the revelation of the importance of a simple watch. (You'll understand when you hear 'Anthony' explain in a throw away line of great importance.Anthony Hopkins' performance is incredible as he draws you into a distorted but honest reality.Not for the feint hearted or those without compassion but a must see for those seeking to understand dementia.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"You know a feeling of when you are sucking and wandering, and your brain flips a map while you are lost in it
A time when you feel a feeling of fear and anxiety, a feeling that gives your body a shudder, a feeling of your own joy.A film that is classified under I am not a movie, I am life
Your age is until he walks through you to reach the place of nowhere by reaching the starting point like a circle you are in its surroundings
I mean, there is no feeling or words that describe the cinematic masterpiece that I saw from a little bit, and from this moment we agree with the Oscar.Literally an hour and 36 minutes, let me forget that I am sitting in front of a screen."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,9/10,"Incredible acting, I just felt everything he felt. Literally, it is a performance that should win an Oscar. The script is very remarkable that takes your attention at the very beginning and holds it untill the very end. And in the end, he left me in tears. We missed you Sir Hopkins."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"Having lost my mother after a long illness, and her father before her to Alzheimer's, I knew this movie would be emotional for me. Even though he has been my all-time favorite actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins surprised me. I cried twice during the film. If ever there was an Oscar-worthy performance, this was it. I'll never forget it as long as I live. Unless, perhaps, I get dementia someday. I've worried about that ever since my grandfather died. 10/10."
THE FATHER,19 August 2021,10/10,You'll get to see such amazing performances only once in a while the story direction everything was so good do watch it.
THE FATHER,7 September 2021,7/10,"I understand Anthony Hopkins is in the movie, but how does that automatically make it a 10? Yes, his performance was fantastic, yes, the supporting characters also did very well. In my opinion, there wasn't any climax to the movie, not really a whole ton of excitement, just a very steady rhythm of confusion (intended) and uncertainty. Yes I get it, there's meant to be confusion because it's really supposed to emphasize how an individual with dementia and/or Alzheimer's would feel. I think they did an excellent job highlighting the fear that comes with this type of condition, and the family challenges that may develop. I'd consider it more of an educational movie with plain avenues of entertainment versus a jaw-dropping, box office breaking film. I'll more than likely get a lot of criticism for this, but everyone's entitled to their opinion."
THE FATHER,6 May 2021,7/10,"It's an Prospective View
More Relatable sometimes
It's messed up."
THE FATHER,15 March 2021,10/10,"I saw this at the Woodstock film festival and it stayed with me long after. The conceit of experiencing dementia and confusion through the eyes of the person suffering from it it very effective, and coupled with great performances, this is a great little piece of cinema."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"I have worked for years with talking care of the old. Only a year with dementia and this movie is the most real depiction I have ever seen. Incredibly powerful, we still cant understand whats going on for real in a brain plagued by this illness, but this is as close as we can get, I really do believe so. Anthony Hopkins will win best actor and best picture, without a doubt, what a masterful performance, wow."
THE FATHER,30 September 2021,10/10,"Holy s**t! Everything and everyone was superb, but Anthony Hopkins' acting was... mind-blowing is an understatement!"
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,9/10,"I can't believe how mind blowing and brain exhausting this movie is, such case was brought by the magnificent performance of the great Anthony Hopkins.This movie enlighten a well known problem but with a very different and intelligent approach, how could the patient feel? How burning is his mind and soul when there is no reality or you can't perceive it?"
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,10/10,"I just finished watching the film and I am speechless. Acting, writing and directing are all absolutely brilliant. This picture is a breath of fresh air in the polluted world of today's cinema.Sir Anthony Hopkins gives one of the finest performances ever put on film. My grandfather had dementia and seeing this film brought back the memories so vividly that it almost made me want to stop watching. The gestures, the sudden mood swings and the slow fall into the horrible word that is dementia are all perfectly portrayed by Mr. Hopkins.Olivia Colman also delivers a powerhouse of a performance in this film. The role is not an easy one, playing the daughter of a man affected by Alzheimer's, but she shines through the whole film and honestly deserves as much praise as Hopkins."
THE FATHER,22 May 2021,10/10,Most movies are 3rd person watching all of the characters as things happen. This movie is 1st person through the eyes of the person suffering mental decline. We were confused at first and then realized that is the intent.
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,This is one of those movies that will keep you thinking for a long time. The performance which Anthony Hopkins provided us is a brilliant but scary look at what many of us may have to look forward to as we age.
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,5/10,"Confusing flick. Perhaps it was intended that way. While the ensemble cast acted this flick wonderfully, the subject of dementia as portrayed by Anthony Hopkins was frightening and confusing.If the intention was to confuse the audience, then it gets a solid 9. But the subject matter and the way it was presented was pretty jarring.Suggest that ""millennials"" watch this to see what's in store for them in later life.I found the film tedious and confusing."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,10/10,After watching this movie I really have a great understanding not only with dementia but with old age. How can you keep up with the present if your reality keeps messing up in a matter of minutes with different details? 😢 This is very heartbreaking to watch and you'll be left there with all of the emotions of someone who has this illness. 😢 I just love how amazing Anthony Hopkins portray Anthony here. He's really a great actor. So awesome performance.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,8/10,"I'm just really blown away by Anthony Hopkins's performance. Tender, moving, and heartbreaking look at dementia from the point of view of the person suffering from it. If this movie does not bring tears to your eyes, your heart is made of stone."
THE FATHER,9 September 2021,10/10,"The whole film is a masterpiece. But without giving anything away, the last ten minutes of this incredible film, is the best single piece of acting I have ever seen. As a man suffering desperately from dementia, Anthony Hopkins gives a mesmerising performance."
THE FATHER,29 May 2021,9/10,"As a viewer, you become emotionally attached to Anthony Hopkins character and feel at one with him. You feel what it's like for people with Dementia and on their life coming to a slow end. Absolutely brilliantly portrayed."
THE FATHER,5 October 2021,10/10,"Both of the actor's acting was incredible!! I loved watching this. They treated the subject of the movie very softly that it made this movie so easy to watch even though the whole topic is sad and heart breaking. I loved the scenario and cinematography. And i also loved seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman together. Superb acting and a quality movie!! Must watch.By the way, during the movie i cried several times but when the movie was over, i got out of the mall and went to the car and cried my eyes out like i could not even believe that was just yesterday. I remembered every single pain i've been through since i've lost my grandparents 3 years in a row. I felt connected to that money. Definitely will watch later again to witness this beautiful acting for one more time."
THE FATHER,17 April 2021,9/10,"First of all, Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances as a man struggling with dementia, only topped by his role in Silence of the Lambs.Secondly, The Father shows how powerful storytelling can be. It shows incredibly well what it is like for a person with dementia to realise his slowly loosing his mind and there is nothing to be done about it.It isn't confusing or complex. It is just storytelling at its best and a short set of actores giving some of the best performances of their carrers.One of the best movies of the year."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,10/10,"Having just watched this knowing as little as possible about it, other than it was based on a play about a dementia sufferer and Hopkins won an Oscar, I expected the usual drama on how difficult the patients are to manage & the pain the family go through.What I did not expect was the brilliant playwrighting, the set pieces that fantastically illustrate the sinister tricks decaying memory plays on the afflicted, the way the film drops you almost into the mind of the man via those illustrations and of course the overall well above average acting; helmed by Hopkins himself in probably the best acting he has done in his entire career.I'm trying to emphasise just how brilliantly crafted the whole thing is without giving any spoilers and you really should go in to it with a similar mindset outlined in the first paragraph of this review.This goes straight to the top of my ""plays turned into movies"" top 3 - followed by Glengarry Glen Ross and The Sunset Limited.Ironically, this film about dementia or Alzheimer's will stay with you forever."
THE FATHER,29 May 2021,5/10,"Well, a well made film on mental illness but- hard to watch. Informative yes, entertaining, no. Good for students maybe or professionals, or some type of medical training. Not a good film to watch on a saturday night with your girlfriend."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,"Great directing, superb acting particularly by Anthony Hopkins. Dealing with a hard subject sympatheticly. Not a light view but it will leave you emotional."
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,10/10,If you do or if you don't know anyone who has had dementia this film will leave you chilled to the bone. I have always been a HUGE Hopkins fan and this is why.This film will make you think twice before you put off that phone call you should of made or that visit you didn't make to someone who needs you.We can all hope and pray that our minds don't go like in this film.An absolute film to watch...!!!!
THE FATHER,1 October 2021,9/10,"Simple story, well played, no better way to describe Alzheimer's ......"
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,9/10,"Sir Anthony Hopkins is quite literally the best actor I have ever seen. His performance is so startlingly honest and impeccable that the mere recollection of the final scene possesses the power to immediately illicit tears and render me a heaving pulp. It is witnessing a triumvirate; the excellently-written character, the finest of actors bringing the page to life ultimately culminating in a truth so powerful that simultaneously shows both the fragile human mind and the indomitable human spirit."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,10/10,"A very sad, very realistic, touching story that gives you a look to a troubled aging mind. If you ever had a person with dimentia in your family this film is definitely gonna touch you and stick with you. Anthony Hopkins is amazing and there is no way you don't feel sympathetic to his character. At the end of the film you just want to give the old boy a hug. Since we can't give him a hug, please give him the oscar."
THE FATHER,3 October 2020,8/10,"It's undeniably stagy but that doesn't bother at all. The fantastic script, adapted from the play, combined with the outstanding editing are only surpassed by a superb cast, lead by Anthony Hopkins who delivers a mindblowing performance."
THE FATHER,2 July 2021,8/10,Movie portrays the cruelty of dementia in vivid colors and Hopkins delivers big time.
THE FATHER,3 June 2021,9/10,Easy to say this is Hopkins' best performance.It is so easy for him to be natural yet delivers heart wrenching performance.How did u react when he was slapped by that man??I was mad like hell. Like someone slapped my own parent. That how great his performance was. This movie will haunt you for years.Great movie. Great movie indeed.
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,10/10,"What a performance..
Great movie with a hard-to-forget kind of message.The actors did a great job but Hopkins really steals the show once again.One of the best films in recent years, trully remarkable work."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"Tears welled up almost from the beginning of Sir Anthonys performance! Silly I know but goodness me what a film, a wonderful subject matter, performences by our finest actors are awe-inspiring. A must-watch film for all ages as it would & could happen to any of us, if not already! Just be kind.xx."
THE FATHER,9 June 2021,9/10,"Acting, directing, and writing are all outstanding. Also, the art in this film is fantastic! Surprises throughout the film... so brilliantly and gracefully performed. Highly recommended.. !!!"
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,9/10,"There are some stupid reviews which their posters are simply idiots ... who don't even know what dementia is.Watch it to feel who suffers from this diseaseI am glad that the director is a genius...
Thank u for this masterpiece."
THE FATHER,1 August 2021,10/10,"Brilliant portrayal of ageing of an extreme
condition
The cast is outstanding."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins at his best! The perspective of the movie is extraordinary, an exceptionally original approach to the subject. Recommending it wholeheartedly."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,The movie gives the audience a view of reality from the perspective of a man suffering from dementia. A beautiful movie.
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,8/10,This is a realistic portrayal of dementia and the hardships that come with it for the person afflicted and family.
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,9/10,"So we have tons of movies that show us how is the live of a family member or nurse that take care of people with dementia, I don't recall a movie that portraits the person himself with the disease.Worst than a horror movie, you imagine yourself in that prison and abyss of which you can't just run or get out by yourself, either you have someone that has the courage to help you or you are in it forever..My grandma had dementia and was somewhat like this, my mother has Alzheimer and seems softer than the dementia, but still o can see she is not there anymore and we can't do nothing, they are there to stay and go into the void day by day.What a cruel end of live this is, and the movie showed me a side I haver never thought of, or I chose not to think on... this movie stays with you, specially if you have someone in your family but also stays with you if maybe one day we can suffer of this what then?Brilliant acting of Lord Anthony Hopkins (he actually uses his own name), the cry he does in the last scenes makes me feel like I have a baby in front of me and it is exactly what they are defenseless babies.Watch it if you are ok to look into the abyss of you are to sensitive don't watch it."
THE FATHER,4 September 2021,10/10,"This film is a masterpiece. Acting, cinematography, direction, production, story... All first class.An absolute, full-blown, outstanding, wonderful, haunting, beautiful, devastating, mind-bending masterpiece.Congratulations to all involved.Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,23 July 2021,10/10,"This movie is straight up A Masterpiece. Anthony Hopkins acting is phenomenal. A sad, confusing, horrifying And a Well made, well directed movie. Every supporting actor/actresses were too good. I pray for those elderly who have dementia."
THE FATHER,19 September 2021,10/10,Well done to all. Antony Hopkins never fails to deliver. He shows dementia from the side of the sufferer. At times it's almost like a psychological thriller.
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,10/10,"This movie is absolutely amazing! Scary, sad, funny, surprising, daunting, name it whatever because it is everything and nothing at the same time. A true depiction of whats like to have dementia. A scary world where time does not move forward, nor backwards. A natural pathway of all of us, the dissolution of our cognition to levels of hallucinations where we just want mummy to protect us from the wilderness of reality to finally going back being the trees connected to the air, to gravity and the cosmos."
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,10/10,"Anthony hopkins is marvelous. I don't know if I'll be able to understand this at 80+ but I sure do know that this is the closest reality I've seen. It is so meaningful that you can understand it only if you've experienced it, definitely not as our protagonist😂"
THE FATHER,28 June 2021,8/10,"Anthony Hopkins is brilliant (as he is in 99% of the movies in which he stars). The movie - a bit convoluted in that one might question whether we are looking at the scenes through the eyes and mind of ""Anthony"" (the character) or through the lens of the camera.........or a bit of both angles but overall a moving, heart wrenching portrayal by not only Anthony Hopkins but Olivia Colman (who plays the part of his loving and distressed daughter), Anne. A movie probably not for everyone or all ages but for mature audiences (who DON'T NEED to hear an F-word every 5 minutes or view explicit sex scenes that serve no point or purpose)."
THE FATHER,15 March 2021,,This is another amazing performance from both Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. It takes place largely in a single apartment with a minimal cast. The film is about a father who is starting to go crazy. We as an audience are witnessing this through Anthony's eyes so you aren't quite sure what is going on. You can personally feel the confusion that he feels. It all comes together in a sad but satisfying ending. Really good watch!
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,9/10,"I had to watch this movie mostly, to be able to decide on my own, if the Academy made some sort of terrible mistake by giving the Oscar to, Sir Hopkins. After watching Chad's performance I thought, how could this possibly be!?. But, this a much better vehicle then what Chad had. To see this decease turn this man inside out was both, painful and riveting. I don't know if he was better, but he was definitely as good as he can possibly be. I'm reminded of Schindler's List. I'm referring to the gut wrenching pain the film makes you go through while watching it. It definitely made that kind of impression that, stays with you for longer than I'd care to carry it. I always knew this decease was atrocious but, experiencing it from the affected individual really sheds a blinding light on it. And to me those are the movies that deserve all and, more of the attention it so rightfully deserves."
THE FATHER,30 September 2020,9/10,"I had the wonderful opportunity to see The Father at CIFF this year. I went in excited to see what Sir Anthony Hopkins would do with a study on dementia. As I consider Sir Anthony as arguable the best actor in film these days I had pretty high expectations. And I was not at all let down. When his character, also named Anthony, become confused or curmudgeonly you recognize some of his other great performances. But in fact I was most impressed at how warm and charming of a character Sir Anthony could also play. He was just simply spell binding when his character was his ""old self"". With all this being said perhaps the most remarkable performance of the film comes from Olivia Colman who plays Anthony's daughter, Anne. The patience, frustration, hurt and unwavering love depicted while Anne tries to find the best way to care for her father is truly remarkable. I'm sure there will be Oscar buzz for both of these performances and for the adapted screen play of Director Florian Zeller.
Now a little SPOILER to help people better enjoy this film. The Father in a way is shot like a mystery. Time lines are repeated , characters change in the story all while the audience sits confused. You do by the end understand that this is done to represent the progression of Anthony's disease. And you as an audience get to experience the strangeness of a mind that is being let down by itself. This is presented as a kind of plot twist. But I think the film will be more enjoyable for most if you understand in advance what is going on."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,9/10,"Since I was the trailer
I was convinced that film was targeting awards .The story hunts down your interest and keep it .You want to know if he in a parallel dimension or if he was tricked or ill.Despite the story lines the film was direct, and was not tricking you due to the nature of the topic."
THE FATHER,8 August 2021,10/10,"If you have old parents, you will feel identified. I understand why he won the oscar."
THE FATHER,5 September 2021,7/10,"It's a good movie. The film is shot in one location and the storyline is a bit slow, however it is not boring at all. I was just confused about the story."
THE FATHER,11 September 2021,10/10,"Possibly the most heart wrenching movie I've ever seen. My mother had 5 strokes and became senile, confused and forgetful. Anthony Hopkins performance was spellbinding and the way it was shot from his perspective brought back vivid memories for me and also an understanding of why people with it behave the way they do.It's one you have to watch and not half watch whilst doing other things, but it's worth it."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,9/10,"Might be the best movie of 2020.The way dementia is portrayed and puts you in the shoes of the person suffering from it, lifted by a memorable soundtrack and immersive performances - it really shows how powerful of a medium films can be. My feelings echo what others are saying about Anthony Hopkins' performance, and how he overshadowed everyone else. The writing and direction is no joke - making the audience connect emotionally with a confused character to a level where you feel like you're the one suffering when he does - is a feat in itself.I highly recommend it, because it brings in a sense of sympathy and patience in high doses for the people suffering from dementia, something the people who made this movie were aiming for."
THE FATHER,29 August 2021,10/10,"Sometimes, movies speak to us in a powerful way. They're personal accounts, intense stories that at some point may touch our lives in ways that we never anticipated.Regardless, ""The Father"" is much more. It's an account of all those alive. Those that have, and those that haven't looked at dementia deep down in its eyes.I agree that this movie is so good that I never want to watch it again. It's moving, it's powerful, and it's absolute magic delivered by all of those involved - from scriptwriter, to actors, director, down to editing.Thank you. Thank you. There aren't that many stories crafted in such a way that we're certain they'll never leave our hearts."
THE FATHER,5 September 2021,10/10,"Watching The Father I kept feeling a sense of confusion while questioning what I was missing and where I was in the day. I realised by the end, this film had given me a sense of what it was like to be this incredible character The Father. Beautifully crafted."
THE FATHER,1 June 2021,9/10,"Stunning, beautiful portrayal of the curse of dementia played by Anthony Hopkins with a heavyweight supporting cast lead by Olivia Coleman. I challenge anyone to exit without shedding at least a few years! Brilliant stuff and we'll deserving of their awards."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,10/10,This is how brilliant it was done that it will scare you by the fact that this is reality. Its been two weeks and I can't stop thinking about this movie. Its flawless in each act. I'm so thankful Sir Anthony said yes to this. I always had the understanding pf the disease but I could never grasp it intil I've watchdd this. Truly brilliant and a must watch.
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,6/10,But so hard to follow. Reality is in my opinion the issue but is it the audience that has to make that distinction? I enjoyed it but left with no answers. Disappointed.
THE FATHER,3 July 2021,10/10,"The most moving and haunting picture I've seen since... I don't even remember when. I poured my eyes out. This is a contained film, with small budget, the one that a debutant director makes, where all the money go into writing and acting. It's cinematography in the most pure form. The story is also intelligently directed, making yourself doubt throughout the film what's real, pushing the public to identify with the main character, living his tragic experience.The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself an 83-84 years old senior, plays a man born in 1937 named Anthony, makes the film the more soul-wrenching.Olivia Colman also gives a most powerful performance, showing her extraordinary acting range, from the light-hearted Hot Fuzz to The Favourite and now this. I don't have enough words to praise this picture. A must watch."
THE FATHER,20 July 2021,10/10,"One of THE best films Mr. Hopkins has ever been in! This story is exactly what me and my family watched happened to my Papa. In the last 10 years of his life he slowly slipped into Dementia and Alzheimer's. He never forgot who we were, but most times he wasn't even sure where or who he was. He would go from cloud 9 to irritated beyond all belief. And Mr. Hopkins made this part spot on. For the first time I truly understand what it's like to be in my Papa's shoes or head rather. And, when I realized what he actually experienced.. I bawled like a baby! Thank you to the wonderful actors and staff for giving this movie to the world. This is exactly what people need to understand for those who suffer from this horrific disease! This movie is a must see!!"
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"I am speechless at Hopkins acting. My grandma was an Alzheimer's patient. Seeing the movie through an eye of a patient going through memory loss, I realized how traumatizing it would have been for her too. I didn't watch movies of other Oscar nominated actors but this acting was
beyond well deserved. Olivia Colman's acting was shattering. I was surprised to know its Director's debut.But can't forget the last scene. Brutal, heartbreaking and traumatizing. It will be in my memory quite some time."
THE FATHER,5 October 2021,9/10,The script is good. The way of shooting is wonderful. The cast is amazing. Anthony Hopkins's performing is incredible.
THE FATHER,10 September 2021,9/10,"Chrisblogger8g
3.5/4
The Father (2021)The Father is undoubtedly well-acted, well-crafted and densely packed with raw emotions, with the amazing performances from the two lead actors, Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, and seems to work without a proper narrative. I myself got very confused watching Hopkins' character realize he was in somebody else's flat and then it is revealed he is in his flat after all, or how each scene transcends into eternal madness, ending up in a hospital, with characters that change names and appearances as if they were in a spinning lottery wheel. I would have appreciated if the movie was also presented out of Anthony's point of view, but, I guess, this is the brutal and realistic depiction of someone suffering from dementia.Other than Hopkins and Colman the other characters just revolve and are here to confuse Anthony (that's the name of his character) and the viewer more. This confusion was made on purpose, like I said, to depict a person suffering from dementia and how his surroundings and his 'fabric of reality' start to fade around him. We watch as the most sophisticated phrases like 'manage on my own' is repeated countless times, and how the plot sequences start to repeat later on in the movie, and mostly feel straight up from a Quentin Tarantino non-linear narrative.Here's one example: Anthony meets a caretaker that reminds him of his daughter, Lucy, whom he has no idea has passed, and the next day the caretaker takes care of him. A painting he has had for a very long time has gone. The following day, it is revealed that he had the meeting with the caretaker a day ago and the caretaker looks like the daughter he couldn't recognize about an hour ago when I first started watching it.Plot aside, I like how Anthony and Anne are characters that feel like actual human beings, one with emotion, feelings like grief, one that we can at least sympathize with and they make their intentions clear, through their actions. Anthony is just an 80-plus year old man who insists he can manage on his own. His daughter, on the other hand, thinks otherwise as he keeps on forgetting things and mixing imagination with reality, and suggests a caretaker.A side villain who is almost as convincing pops up and is in disapproval for Anne to take care of her father as he is a 'nuisance' and demands her to send him to an institution, which actually happens at the end of the movie. Is this man her husband? Has she met someone else? Or is she already divorced?By the end of the movie, Anthony is already unable to bear his everchanging circumstances and cries for his mommy, which provokes pity, sadness and sympathy to the viewer. It's agonizing and haunting.Tag it for a re-watch."
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,9/10,"In daily life, there are a lot of things that change very fast. We can't stop time, everything is changing around us. Sometimes a healthy mind might have be missed the changes or might refuse them. In this script, we see this changes through the eyes of an old man. The old man that can't adapt the changes as fast as the speed of change. There is no one reality for this man. He just splashes in the timeline and find out the thinks just he can remember. With magnificent acting of Antony Hopkins, we watch the old man's despair.
This movie shows us the world from point of view of the old man. It makes us realized how fast the world changes and how fast we are adapt the changes."
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,9/10,It's such a great movie! You get a glimpse of what they go through and how frustrating and sad it must be. I loved it.
THE FATHER,8 May 2021,10/10,"I've always had a fear of death and growing old but this movie showed me just how sad and merciless life can be as you age, you get confused, you lose time and the worst you can't tell what's real or not. Anthony hopkins was practically made for this role, he delivered an oscar worthy performance that made me feel as if I was anne taking care of anthony. The helplessness and dread this movie invokes is amazing."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,1/10,Boring. Boring. Boring. Thought maybe it would get better. It didn't.
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,"This film should be watched as a lesson/warning to help understand the curse of Alzheimers/Senility.My dad developed Alzheimers and over the years became a different man to the one I knew. It started with little things. He'd 'lose' his wallet. A couple of times he'd take the cash from Ma's purse and 'lose' it. He had worked as a plumber. One day I went to visit him. As I opened the front door I smelt gas. There was dad,in the front room with a stripped out gas fire,about to use a blow torch. That was the day Ma told me she couldn't cope and so I moved back home to help look after him. Slowly he got worse. He'd go out early in the morning for walks. Sometimes in just his underwear. Once he managed to leave the house and we ended up having to call the Police. They found him. I started staying awake most nights to watch him. I was already an insomniac. Watching him change from my dad into someone who didn't know me was difficult. The Dr's told Ma that dad needed to go into a 'care' home. We had to have him 'committed'. I have always regretted that. He was visited everyday whilst in the 'care' home. When he was living at home I had given up my job to care for dad and so I could spend several hours with him daily. We'd go for walks. Have a fish & chips lunch. By this time I was almost a stranger to him. Occasionally he'd think I was his brother. Though he always spoke of the sons who never bothered to visit him. Ma would quite often have to buy dad a new watch as he'd 'lose' them. The hardest part of this cruel disease for us was that dad,like the man in this film,had forgotten that his daughter had been killed in a traffic accident 20 years before. He'd often ask where she was. We never told him the truth. There were times when he became violent(something the illness seemed to bring out in him). Sometimes dad would have a lucid moment. It always surprised me when he called me by my name. Those were the times that became really special to me. I'd ask him questions about his life. Those moments only lasted a few mins. I used to wonder what dad would say if,during a lucid moment,I had shown him a video of the man he had become. I'm fairly certain he'd have asked me to put him out of his misery. He was always a very proud man."
THE FATHER,25 May 2021,1/10,No doubt acting of each actor is good. But they movie is baseless and confusing. Monotonous and not meant for entertainment.
THE FATHER,17 September 2021,8/10,"Different movie from the classics. Incredibly it tells of a situation that no one hopes will happen to their father. Sometimes you get lost and don't know if what you are seeing is reality or Anthony's imagination, great idea!"
THE FATHER,29 October 2021,8/10,"The emotional bond I did not think I would relate, but this film has shown me the real struggle of identity crisis and inevitable trauma. It hit me, a lot."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"I'm not really sure where to start! I've just finished stopping myself from ugly crying.I'm not going to give away any spoilers so here is 5 reasons to watch this movie.1. Outstanding acting by the entire cast
2. Keeps you engrossed as to what's actually happening
3. Anthony Hopkins!4. Olivia Coleman
5. It will make you reflect on something usually hidden to most of the general public and that's absolutely devastatingAnthony Hopkins deserves every award for his performance in this movie. I can't say that enough!Just watch it!"
THE FATHER,9 October 2021,10/10,"About halfway into the movie, I suddenly realized I felt drunk or stoned even though I was actually sober. The script, the acting, the direction, the filmography - everything about this film created an immersive story that dragged me into Hopkins' character's mind. I vicerally FELT his character's confusion and disorientation. I literally FELT like I was drunk and stoned even though I was sober. I FELT like I'd lost track of what was happening in the film even though I KNEW I hadn't. Masterful!"
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,10/10,I've never given a 10 rating. What else is there to say except.... what are you doing in my flat?
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,10/10,"...""figure it out""; that's only SEMI-possible -- if at all: even the ending, for instance, can be taken at least 2 different ways, in terms of what's real & what isn't, given the condition of the point-of-view character (played to perfection by Sir Hopkins). No, I watched the film 3x in 2 days because it's so compelling. And yes, each time I perhaps ""got it"" a bit more, but more to the point, I got more OUT OF IT. This isn't ""Memento"" (another fine film); it's not a puzzle-ox to ""solve."" I suggest simply experiencing it, again & again, as your experience OF it deepens and broadens and thickens. MASTERPIECE."
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,9/10,This move is a great guide to those who do not understand dementia.At times it's a little scary that one may relate this to themselves. Anthony the powerhouse of the most realistic acting.
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,9/10,"A masterclass in acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivier Coleman in a movie which catapults the viewer inside the frightening confusion of dementia. A film that explores this highly charged, emotive subject from within and without, and never releases the audience from the ever-changing perspectives of that shifting inner landscape."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a very very long time. Anthony Hopkins delivers an incredible and flawless performance. I can't imagine anyone else more deserving of an Oscar this year!
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,1/10,"The story was boring, I check time bar in my player almost 100 times to find out how much i need to waste my time on this movie.Anthony hopkins was good? Yes, he was great, But this movie still was most boring movie, animation or TV Show i ever saw.Please please please stop over rate a movie just because of an actor."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"Directed by Florian Zeller and based on his own play (with Christopher Hampton), The Father is, quite simply, a brilliant movie that deals with one man's descent into the world of dementia. Anthony Hopkins gives what is quite simply his greatest screen performance of his long career, and Olivia Coleman provides excellent support as his caring daughter. This is one movie that will stay with you long after the credits roll. The Father contains some of the best film editing seen on screen in a very long time. It's heartbreaking yet empathetic. A very strong contender for this year's best actor and best supporting actress awards. You must see this movie. Anthony Hopkins delivers a masterclass in acting."
THE FATHER,25 June 2021,10/10,What a powerful film. I can't even explain as it as I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But if you like movies about real life then it won't disappoint you.
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,10/10,My grandmother suffered from Alzheimer's and the film reminded me a lot. It treats the subject with respect and some bittersweet humour.It also used the unique properties of the medium of film to portray the experience of suffering dementia in an incredible way which I don't wish to spoil by describing it in detail.I would strongly recommend the film.
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,6/10,"Brilliant acting by the two protagonists, father and daughter,but tremendously boring and without climax. It's a smooth continuous narration of the world seen by a man with dementia. I don't find that interesting. Why did we need a movie like this in the first place?"
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,10/10,"""Father"" is wonderful and watching it is recommended for anyone interested in cinema. Florian Zeller's solid screenplay, along with stage design, editing, spectacular filming, and the unparalleled acting of the film's actors, makes the ""Father"" viewing experience enjoyable. By making ""Father"", Zeller proved that there is no need for a third-party narrative to tell the story of dementia, and that one can see life through the mind of a person with dementia and feel what these people are experiencing. ""Father"" is by far the best work on dementia to date."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,10/10,"Let me start saying that Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman are absolutely brilliant in this movie and both deserve the Oscar praise they got, it's quite heartbreaking to see Anthony suffering like that, things already happened for him, others he doesn't even remember and everyone just doesn't get it, it's a great movie with great actors and a great story.10/10."
THE FATHER,5 July 2021,9/10,"Really great movie, unfortunately in the family we have already had a loved one who has suffered from dementia, and this movie has just reminded me how she had acted, and can help to understand people who has dementia.Everyone should see."
THE FATHER,1 April 2021,10/10,"That's a rare thing sometimes. He plays the father exceptionally well. It grows upon you, it confuses you and you'll feel."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,7/10,Might have been as well written by a literature student first year project. The whole painting of past events with future information as an quote artistic unquote way to explain dementia is somewhat arrogant.The actors made the film worth watching though.
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,6/10,"Due to the closing of the cinemas, it has been a long wait for me to see this movie, and I'm, well... Not impressed. It's about an old man who's developing dementia, and a daughter who's struggling with the decision of whether or not she should send him to a nursing home. As a nurse who had worked in nursing home for sometime in the past, I can confirm it's quite a popular case in Europe, and it has also been going on for quite a long time. So since this drama wanted to be many things else, with sci-fi and mystery are among those, it forgot to actually present anything special to the situation, and became not so much worth paying attention to. It looks more like a backstory episode in a TV series than a movie, and the fact that it also leads to the inevitable, to the norm, it makes itself quite unimportant. I have to say I can hardly understand all the praise for this movie. Anthony Hopskins is amazing in it but as the story repeats a common reality, his performance gets old quickly. The only saving grace for it is probably the vibrant and excellent choices of opera soundtrack, but even with that, I was struggling quite much to finish this movie."
THE FATHER,2 August 2021,2/10,"I'm rating two stars only because of the splendid acting of Anthony Hopkins, otherwise this movie would only be worthy of one star. Yes, it must be terrible going through dementia, which is the only point of this movie. Otherwise there is virtually no story-line other than the poorly executed teaser about the possible accidental death of Anthony's other daughter. I felt suffocated watching this movie and constant replaying of the same events over and over. While I absolutely enjoy all movie genres, be they comedies, dramas, musicals, etc., I do want to be entertained, enlightened, or educated, and this movie fails to deliver. Simply awful."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,"Defintely one of the best movies I've seen in couple of years ,this defines Anthony Hopkins as one of the genius actors of this generation.A truely and deeply affecting view of dementia and how it impacts the people around the sufferer.Highly recommended."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,"The last time I cried so hard for a movie was Lion and that was based on a true story. Everything about this movie designed to make you understand something that is so hard to explain, it is a more poignant version of Still Alice. The magical quality of the scenes fading in and out of one another takes you all the way to the end."
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,10/10,"I watched it with my wife, and we are both in our mid thirties. My wife was in tears for the last 20 mins of the movie, and did I find my eyes wet, too? We were never so moved after watching anything. I'm glad I can still take care of my parents, and will keep doing so to the best of my abilities, until the last leaf!"
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"I watched this last night and was totally blown away by Hopkins yet again. I laughed, I cried, I was confused, but the whole film had me captivated from start to finish.Can't recommend this enough. I don't like to give films 10's for some reason but I had to for this."
THE FATHER,4 July 2021,10/10,"My short review will reflect the title of my short review: I didn't get the chance to see it in the cinema, but I watched it TWICE on a 10 hour flight from Heathrow to Dallas. This film hit me hard. Both in that I do have relatives who are suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's: please bare in mind that the condition Anthony has is never specified. But both of those conditions is known for confusing things for the sufferer, and the film is presented that way. It will mess with your mind but come together at the end. So sad, brilliantly written, beautiful film making."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,9/10,"Creative film-making techniques and extraordinary acting used to give some impression of the what Alzheimer's is like. It's hard to watch at times, as it must be. Might not be a good watch for people who have experienced the real thing up close, but it's eye-opening for the rest of us. It's also a really beautiful film. And Hopkins is amazing, as always."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"It now seems incredible to me that never before a film had approached this illness from the perspective of the one suffering. It is a wonderful and harrowing view into losing your mind.You imagine how it might be for someone to lose their memory and be confused about reality, but this movie really manages to convey the real complexity of it. It gives you a perspective you never thought you needed and that you will never forget.Amazing movie, incredible acting, wonderful music and perfect pase. Truly a masterpiece."
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,8/10,Anthony Hopkins is so good. He deserves all the awards there are.
THE FATHER,20 October 2021,10/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film thinking it would be a depressing story about an aging parent. However the story being told was done in such a unique way and it kept you guessing as to what the truth was. Also Sir Anthony's performance was mesmerizing and brilliant and I was emotionally involved in the story. See this movie, you won't be disappointed."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,Brilliant! Clearly oscar prize chances!!! Fantastic story!!
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,"Uncomfortable truth about the future that awaits us all. Brilliantly shown perspective from a person with dementia. Marvelous acting.Sad but good and true, we need more movies this good."
THE FATHER,26 May 2021,1/10,"Yes, I get the subject matter hits home for some but the truth us thus could be a 15 minute short film. Standard Hopkins acting which us good but not Oscar worthy. The story is non-existent. I'm baffled that anyone would actually like this movie. As entertainment it is totally boring."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,4/10,"Anthony Hopkins is my favorite actor, and he deserves all the Oscars out there in my opinion. But I just didn't like the movie, dementia or no dementia it was such a boring movie. At least I watched it for free, otherwise I would want my money back."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,10/10,"It's really rare, especially these days, to watch a fantastic work in all aspects..!A great artist who embodied elderly in way u feel it emotionally since it happened exactly the same to someone u love!Gorgeous work! .. one of my best movies that I've ever seen..!Frustratingly, didn't take what it deserves unlike some other garbage ones.."
THE FATHER,14 May 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins absolutely deserves this Oscar. His perfomance is not just great, its shocking. He made me understand how bad and frightening a mental disorder like dementia is. I'm really scared in the idea of being in Anne's( Olivia Colman's acting is also very good) place and have to go through all of this with my father. Overall a great and touching story everyone has to watch."
THE FATHER,18 July 2021,10/10,"A deliberately confusing movie depicting the confusion dementia causes, brilliantly told and directed, and above all absolutely astonishing acting from Anthony Hoping. After watching this you will definitely be worried about growing old."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,A beautiful depiction about the process of aging and how ones memories begin to fade. This is a story of a daughter and her father who are both going through the journey of age and the senility that comes with it. The story is entangled in what is both the father and the daughters journey of this loss of connection. I think this movie is very important to both the young and young at heart who really need to understand that our memories are fragile and we must make every opportunity to ensure we enrich other with as many good memories as possible.Olivia Coleman gives such a beautiful performance as the dutiful daughter whose love for her father is to be commended and how one copes when there is are dark days in caring for a parent who is slowing loosing the grip on reality.
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,10/10,"I really have been straggling for hours to find the truth behind this movie. The idea and the whole consept is incredible I'm really confussed and it's made me feel that I had amnesia. I still feel it cause I haven't understand what is the truth about Ann, her husband etc.Although, it's not the meaning of the movie to understand what really happened but how Anthony feels and what he thinks. We frequently see him to look for his watch and I think this is symbolism for trying to remember when all these things happened. His memories is so messed up and some of his thoughts may haven't had happened at all.The scene where he is crying and he wants his mommy like a little boy it's really intens. The nurse calls him ""baby"" and tell him that ""everything is gonna be alright"" like a mom would do. I think about it and it really breaks my heart.No words about Anthony Hokings one of the best actors of all times. He should definitely win an Oscar. Olivia Coleman is very good too.In colcusion, this movie it may be one of the saddest things I have ever seen but its masterpiece. The actors, the editing, the directing they are all wonderful."
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,10/10,It is the best movie in Anthony Hopkins Film History.
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,I suggest you see this movie.with an extraordinary acting of Anthony Hopkins.
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,9/10,Anthony Hopkins with his very subtle skills shows how dementia really feels like..pure class acting.
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,10/10,Haven't seen such a good movie in ages. First time I rate 10/10.
THE FATHER,12 October 2021,10/10,"A year ago if I have to recommend a movie about Dementia and Alzheimer, Still Alice would have been a very easy choice. Somehow, that movie stuck with me since I was a kid and it broke me in a very good way.The Father though... it left me so devastated. You don't just 'watch' this movie, you 'EXPERIENCE' it. The Father will make you know how it feels to have dementia. How confusing and frustrating it would be. Anthony's fear of abandonment is the most heartbreaking part of the movie. On top of that, every little joy that he had, it lasted very short and we all know that it will be gone. At least the movie gave us a chance to hug him at the end but left us wondering which is reality or which is Anthony's scattered memories or was he in the hospital all this time?Just only Anthony Hopkins's acting is already made this movie worth watching. A masterclass without a doubt. On top of that, it's amazing how well this movie tell its story. The camera angles, costumes and the script are so refined. The flat designs are also worth mentioning. 10/10 for sure and probably one the best 2021 movie so far."
THE FATHER,23 October 2021,8/10,"Antohny Hopkins shows that he really deserved Oscar. His performance carries the movie. That does not mean movie would be not satisfactory without Hopkins's performance. Movie itself has great storytelling , cinematography and cast."
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,"Sir Anthony Hopkins deserves all the accolades he gets for this most deeply personal performance in, The Father. This is one of those first movies that delves into what is involved in dementia/Alzheimers patients. Sir Hopkins takes us on this journey that involves confusion, memory loss and burden. We are taking his footsteps, on his way, into this confusion world he's been sent to live, much without his knowledge or consent.I had to pause the movie to contain myself 😢 because Anthony's performance was on par with genius. His very moving journey into the road of dementia/Alzheimer leads us to a road of Netherland, and then to pick up the pieces afterwards.You may not be able to switch off after the movie ends, but Anthony's performance 🎭 will thankfully stay on for others to watch in awe."
THE FATHER,12 August 2021,9/10,"The acting is a masterpiece of chambre play magic. The cinematic engine put to work with what it does best, to image the cognitive process, to allow us to experience rather than watch from the outside the disintegration of the self, until its constituents left like rubble on the floor, early childhood, melancholic or show man, characters alternatingly appearing out of thin air in the spiralling mental rewind. And the saddened realization of all the missing time, all the gaps, the five years obviously lost between anne being martied and going to paris without a minute passing, the years of not seeing lucy felt as months and eventually the time gap from being an infant with a mother to being an old man with a daughter perceived as simultaneous. The film medium is strikingly well suited to depict this breakdown of time, chronology and causality, because it is the editing language by which we read film, hence his lack of mental grip over these becomes our frustration and our lack of comprehension, and yet still we can cinematically also read what he is left with - an association montage, scenes linked by resemblance only."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,9/10,The father makes you wonder if dieing at a young isnt better.
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,1/10,Not sure how anyone could give this movie a good review. Tried watching again after wanting to bash my head into a wall and left me wanting to do the same again! Boring and dreadful!
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"The story broke my heart, it reminded me of what will happen when we get old."
THE FATHER,13 March 2021,10/10,Anthony Hopkins at his finest!!! This film sucks you in to the point you don't know what's real and what isn't. Leaves stuck there and your feel for all the characters!ACADEMY AWARD for Hopkins!!!!
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,8/10,"I had.a Grandpa who suffers.from dementia for years and actually passed away last year on October 21st, watching this really made me tear up in many scenes, Sir Anthony Hopkins performance is brilliant, the way he struggle to put on his shirt, how he keep forgetting people he meet the other day, even someone that really close to him, how he had hallucinations, and he think someone tried to harm him, how he keep talking about someone he really love and really wanted to see that person so bad even though he can't, oh i can relate to almost every single thing that happen in this movie to my own grandpaand finally, when he become acting like a baby and start calling his mom, that one hit me harder than the rest because my own grandpa actually saying the same thing, how he miss his father and mother whilst crying endlessly in his bed, oh grandpa how i feel sorry and i know it's hard for you to spend your final days suffering like that, but we can't do anything other than to take care of you as best as we couldI'm glad that we didn't actually send him to nursing home, we just can't, that's too sad to even think about, at least for us, and he actually passed away in peace and in complete silent early in the morning, and to tell you the truth, i'm actually glad that he already passed away, it means his suffering is finally over and leaving this cruel world behind, i can't keep thinking about how happy he is right now to finally meet his friends, his mother and father up there somewhereRest in peace Grandpa, you are gone, but will not be forgotten, and we love you foreverAnd thank you again for your.beautiful performance Sir Anthony, been watching your movies for years and i must say, this will be my top 3 favorite, you truly deserves the best lead actor this year."

THE FATHER,9 September 2021,10/10,"Truly a masterpiece, acting, concept, everything. After it was over I was literally left staring at the screen in deep contemplation and awe."
THE FATHER,26 August 2021,5/10,"I hope no one go through dementia. If you have not been with such a person, you cannot relate with the movie, I believe. Acting is awesome but fortunately or unfortunately, I couldn't relate with movie."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,"This film left me in sadness it is very sad to see Anthony is getting to old that was not just acting this is how he is living right now
great performance and oscar for best actor
long live the king."
THE FATHER,8 September 2021,6/10,"Reason i gave it 6 was that: Movies purpose was 10 , content. Intentions . Educational and productional side
all was 10, but the same time , movie itself very boring. Usual real life to what it is, sadly."
THE FATHER,16 September 2021,1/10,"I hate movies like this, you keep waiting for something to happen, but it doesn't it. Don't watch it."
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,8/10,"It's one of the best of 2020-21.It's a brilliantly made, wonderfully scripted and awesomely acted piece of cinema.It leaves you as confused as Anthony Hopkins character. The perspective from which the movie is shot is as good as real life.You have to work your way to understand the emotion of being lost and forgotten.Anthony Hopkins is marvellous. He shifts his emotions so subtly that you will be in awe.And a special mention for the screenplay.Go for it. It will stay with for long."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"There have been very few movies that make me want to pause the movie halfway to fully look at my partners face to tell them how amazing this movie is. A wonderfully and beautifully told story of such a sad and depressing topic. It leaves you questioning what's going on in the same tone that the main character, Antoine, is questioning his episodes. Amazing story telling with beautiful music interwoven throughout. A magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins. Bravo."
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,3/10,"First of all I really like Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman, but this has to be the most depressing film I've seen in a long time.When it actually ends your left thinking ""is that it?""The acting is very good, but not my type of film."
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,"Before watching the movie I was surprised to see Anthony got the Oscar this year, when everybody was expecting something else. Not anymore. This is honestly the best acting I've seen in years (and let's not forget The Two Popes is actually still fresh!).After watching this I find it almost impossible to put anything into words. For the first time in a while after watching a movie I can say I really am speechless and heartbroken."
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,8/10,What an impressive and moving movie! I really enjoyed the play and the real acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins and his caring daughter Olivia Coleman. This is a movie I reccomend everybody to watch.
THE FATHER,23 March 2021,10/10,This is a first movie...I'm just blown awayAmazing job from all the actors too and clearly a modern cinematic masterpiece.
THE FATHER,5 June 2021,10/10,"Heartbreaking film .Alzahimer disease is one of the most difficult diseases for both patients and their family, which require from the family a huge amount of psycological and emotional support and alot of understanding and patience. As my grandfather had suffered from it, I can understand the film very well and can feel every single moment of how the patient live, there were many times when my grandparent told me that he didn't know what he was thinking at that moment .The leading actor (Anthony ) is very profissional and talented . Bravo!"
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,10/10,An amazing film with top notch performances about a important subject: Alzheimer and its effects on everyone.
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,10/10,I'm out of words. What can I say. If this isn't a masterpiece then nothing is. This is the best movie in Oscars 2021.
THE FATHER,1 September 2021,4/10,"Anthony Hopkins extraordinary acting notwithstanding, this is the darkest, harshest and most insensitive portrayal of dementia I've ever encountered. While I appreciate the unusual viewpoint and the attempt to convey the experience of the person with dementia, it is a very partial view at best.Having lived with dementia in my own family as well as working with dementia patients professionally, this view is incredibly distorted. Most people who have actually cared for someone with dementia would not characterize it so darkly. There are beautiful, loving, and yes, many funny moments. Dementia is always changing with varying degrees of lucidity--which was not shown in the film. And while there may be despairing moments, dementia patients often feel quite jolly. In other words, they have a full range of feelings just like anyone.But what really stung about this movie was the insensitivity and selfishness of everyone around him. Neither the daughter nor her boy friend had the slightest clue how to respond to someone with memory loss. Their insensitivity was painful. The carer was more on target, and the nurse at the end finally came through in a loving manner.If the intent was an empathic portrayal of dementia, the result falls far short. The scenes where he was a bit jolly fell kind of flat against all the despair and darkness.Dementia, which is a progressive malady, is increasingly and incredibly difficult. And yet, everyone I know, myself included, who has stuck it out with a loved one considers it one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. Even if it does become necessary to put someone in a facility, it is so important for the loving family caregiver role to continue.This movie could have been so much better if it had been better researched and consulted on by people with actual experience."
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,9/10,"I finally got around to watching The Father and it was an absolute revelation. An acting MASTERCLASS from the giant that is Anthony Hopkins.First, let's get the elephant in the room out of the way, I ADORED the late Chadwick Boseman in Ma Raney's Black Bottom, and I too, sung his praises the moment I saw his incredible performance, but whoever's on Twitter saying Hopkins doesn't deserve the Oscar is either pretty dense or hasn't seen either films. The two performances could trade blows until the end of time, but at the end of day, it's Hopkins' subtlety, and the confidence in his craft that he effortlessly puts out that bring it home for me.The film is a rasw and honest look into a world virtually unknown to anyone on this planet, at least not completely accurately, visited only by an unlucky few who never got the chance to tell the tale. A dollop of humanity that shakes you to your deepest core. An experienced I wish I'll never get to witness first hand, or any hand for that matter.My most encouraging slow claps to Florian Zeller for a smashing directorial debut."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,9/10,"Hopkins' best performance after Silence of the Lambs, and I realized that he was perfect in the roles of strength and weakness. And He has given us something to live like the old people and looking to the way they going to thinking and looking And the way they see juveniles makes us afraid of getting old. Hearing stories about elderly people is not the same as living like them."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,In one line: what a performance sir Anthony! What a performance!
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,This movie lets you understand Alzheimer's disease fully and flawlessly. This movie made a big change in my life and it's a lesson to be kinder to older people who have lost their strength through time.
THE FATHER,8 September 2021,10/10,"I am almost eighty, and, though I found the film riveting, I also found it confusing. Like Anthony, I couldn't work out who those strange men were. And the music was far too loud, even though I have 'hearing difficulties'. (Is everyone deaf now ?)As I went upstairs to bed I felt that I too was suffering from some form of dementia or other - even though I'm not."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,10/10,Devastating. A masterpiece. It must have had a great research team to display the struggles so accurately. Anthony Hopkins never disappoints.
THE FATHER,11 September 2021,10/10,"A true masterpiece. This movie will stay in my heart forever. ""I feel as if I'm losing my all leaves"""
THE FATHER,24 March 2021,10/10,"What a movie! I'm not sure where to start.The casting was perfect. Anthony Hopkins, one of the greatest actors of our time delivers one of the best performances of his career. Olivia Colman was fantastic too. Both performances are definitely Oscar-worthy.Very well written and directed as well, it left me speechless long after watching it. It never dragged and had the perfect runtime in my opinion.The Father was a very beautiful and emotional movie. I highly recommend it. By @Als.Reviews on Instagram"
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,9/10,Loving the story plot and the emotional shared between the cast is so deep and I really love this movie.
THE FATHER,29 May 2021,10/10,"I don't usually watch dramatic movies, but honestly, I don't regret watching this one, it's really heart touching and at the end I tried to resist crying but I couldn't, the acting is just sooo good and I think everyone should watch it."
THE FATHER,22 June 2021,10/10,"The screenplay is really successful in using cinematic devices such as point of view to put you in the head of someone who has dementia. Original, and Hopkins deserves a lot of credit for it."
THE FATHER,10 July 2021,10/10,"I love the perspective in this film, it's quite different from an movie like ""The Notebook"".Must watch."
THE FATHER,22 July 2021,10/10,"I read the reviews marking this movie 10/10 and I had my doubts, not until I saw it. It brought back my grandmother's memories, by the time I didn't know it's a sickness, I just thought she's been difficult to handle, and with her attitude thinking she can't stay with anyone little did I know that she equally didn't know what was happening to her. Wish I had seen the movie the time she was alive. Rest in peace grandmother. Hollywood thanks for the movie."
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,,"I just finished watching The Father. Its ending made me cry a little. I'm only saying this to signify how uneasy it can be.It's difficult to write about this film immediately after seeing it therefore I'll keep this post short and casual.Firstly, it's a play adaptation and it is visible that the film is kept in the spirit of the stage performance. Setting is fairly static, performances strong and the film language limited to the realist-impressionist style.Secondly, this film really does a great job showing how the dementia might feel for the ones affected with it the most directly (the ones who actually suffer it, inside their heads). Mixing times, faces, events, places while still trying to keep the bits of own identity as well as to make sense of the happenings progressively lacking in the immediate coherence is painful to watch from a perspective of an informed spectator, knowing what is going on - contrary to the main protagonist of the film - and having had witnessed similar illness in the past.Finally, my purely subjective view on this film is that this the film and the performances that should be talked about. After Quo Vadis, Aida? The Father is another 10/10 film and together they highlight the mediocrity of relatively popular, recent films such as Sound of Metal and Promising Young Woman which for some strange reason seem to get the most of critical as well as public attention this award season."
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,9/10,"Actuslly I'vent been soo indulged with all this saddness and heartbreaking emotion in such a movie , I've been reminding myself while I'm watching this , thats its just an acting and its such a movie , really Antonio Hoppikins and Olivia were extraordinary in delievering the idea of this movie , I think its an oscar for Antonio."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,9/10,Anthony Hopkins my favourite actor ever.My father suffered memory loss only a month before passing away but Anthony the character in this movie seems to have had memory issues for years it's not quite certain but this movie is clever in making you feel like you are Anthony seeing life through his eyes .It made me cry at the end and if you don't I'd be amazed.Best film I seen in years deserves all the high ratings.
THE FATHER,4 May 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins, take a bow! This is the best hes been in years. The film is beautifully shot, it really conveys a sense of place and the direction keeps everything ticking along nicely.You can't help but become invested in the father character and try to unravel events as they happen. The movie is paced well and never drags. The score is on point, and the films climax brings a lot of emotion - its a truly thoughtful and relatable piece of cinema that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."
THE FATHER,14 August 2021,10/10,In one sentence...... Amazing performance by Anthony Hopkins..... Leaves you in tears...... Definitely an Oscar worthy production..... Don't miss it!.
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,10/10,"What I appreciate most about The Father is the choice of narrator - who is telling the story? This leads to the questions: How sane are they? How confident are they in this? And how confident should we be that this is true?The film progresses with a sense of temporal dysphoria. People come and go, disappear, change names, change faces, change attitudes, and sometimes, events completely contradict one another. However, our character remains confident in his sanity, and instead reacts to this seemingly changing world with hostility, some of which falls on his own daughter.This is a powerful example of how changing the reference frame from which a story is told can paint a clearer picture. Often, we watch mentally unstable characters through the eyes of others, and in our minds, create the association that that character is very odd, in comparison with our narrator, the other person. If we instead tell the story from the point of view of that so-called mentally unstable person, then they are completely sane, yet almost the entire world around them is incomprehensibly peculiar. Which of the two stories do you think emphasises the extent of the psychological disorder? In the case of The Father, it is by far the latter.The movie ends with a touching soliloquy, which probably secured Hopkins his Oscar for the performance. ""I feel as if I'm losing my leaves"" he cries, as he begs for his mother - as a man in his 80s. In the end, our character finally admitted that he was ill, and for a brief moment before the end, things seemed normal. We can hope that he came to terms with himself, and found some sense of peace, in the days he had left on this Earth."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,8/10,"A punch in the stomach. A film that shows the struggle of people suffering from Alzheimer so realisticaly that makes you feel uncofrotable.A movie i wouldn't suggest to sensitive people with relatives who suffer from this difficult disease. A movie I would deffinetly suggest to people that want to know how it feels like.An oscaric perfomance by Anthony Hopkins, probably the best of his entire life."
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,10/10,"This film is exceptional. The performances from Hopkins and Colman are both first class, in my view, Olivia Colman is one of the most versatile actresses out there. The production design is very limited, and seeing as the film is based on a play, I can see why that choice was made. It worked very well, made the film feel a lot more real. The final scene with Anthony Hopkins was perfectly executed. This is a film that I will remember for a very, very long time."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,Absolute masterpiece. Loved it. Anthony was brilliant.
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,1/10,This is the most confusing movie I've ever seen. It was so confusing to the point that after the entire movie was over and I came out of the cinema I had a bloody migraine. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.
THE FATHER,18 November 2021,8/10,"Anthony Hopkins impressed me a lot. He had a charming acting. Literally wonderfull. Other than that scenario was limped beauty, familiar and also striking."
THE FATHER,9 September 2021,10/10,"I'm really surprised that some don't ""get"" this film, especially those who say they were confused. The filmmakers declare exactly what their intentions are very early, and we get to feel the pain of a family unraveling from dementia. Others complain that this doesn't exactly depict their experience with the topic. Don't listen to these reviews and see this film ASAP. It's a uniquely brutal look at a heartbreaking ailment - and it will stay with you forever."
THE FATHER,4 July 2021,9/10,"Not sure how too sum it up. Stunning performances. Both my parents suffered from dementia, this film hit so many of the experiences we went through in trying to care for them.We were in tears during the film and after, I think we relived our experiences. Masterpiece of cinema."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,9/10,"Leaving the theater, I felt as if I was the one that had dementia. That's a near-certain mark of the movie's success.It's wonderful to see such success from the playwright directing the film based on his play. Florian Zeller supplements his all-too-real end of life tale with timely artistic shots (the painting, the broken face sculpture, the tree full of leaves) and brilliant use of perspective. This is dementia from the sufferer's point of view.Anyone who has spent time around a person slowly losing touch with reality has seen the paranoia, the misplaced confidence, and the fear - each displayed by Anthony Hopkins with unparalleled realism.If you have lost someone or are currently caring for someone with this condition and you know that experiencing it will only cause pain, this movie is certainly capable of bringing pain. But if you want to let the magic of movies show you what others experience - what it is like when you cannot trust your own mind - then go see THE FATHER."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins is a rare unrepeatable actor who has performed a difficult role for those of his age.As for Olivia Coleman, she is an actor who can get an Oscar with only facial features and expression."
THE FATHER,2 July 2021,2/10,"If I watched this film on my TV I don't think I would have sat though it all. Hopkins and Colman though, we're excellent."
THE FATHER,17 August 2021,10/10,"Such a wonderful directing and acting.Need to watch every scenes very carefully, as it all comes to some point of connection."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,10/10,"It's like someone filmed my life right now. A few days ago I had to place my father in a nursing home, which was very difficult for me.I hope he will enjoy the new ambience as much as possible.In any case, my heart breaks because of his mental state - dementia.For all parents, but also for all children who love their parents. Even if they are patients with dementia.Thanks to Mr. Hopkins for his acting in this film is too perfect."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,The movie absolutely thrilling and so perfectly twisted that you cannot keep your mind focused like in the SUPER HERO MOVIES .. NOW THIS IS A 🍿🎥 NO STERIOD JUNKIES JUMPING AROUND WITH ROPES AND UNDERWEARS .. THE PERFECTION OF EDITING IS ONE OF KIND.. THIS MOVIE DESERVES AN OSCAR.. omg the HOPKINS ACTING IS SO GOOD I GOT GOOSEBUMPS..had a good time watching this movie.. it was like watching Interstellar ...perfect 10/10 movie.. loved it to the core.
THE FATHER,21 May 2021,1/10,"It's a slow and awful movie also so confusing but not in a good way, if you wanna bore yourself to death watch this master pee."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,3/10,Good acting but other than that it's a quite boring movie.
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,10/10,"There is not much to say about the movie. We've watched an acting lesson from the master, Anthony Hopkins for 90 minutes and I was just speechless at the end with the contribution of the soundtrack from another master Ludovico Einaudi.It was such a realistic drama reminding me my beloved grandfather that I've lost few years ago. It should definitely win the Oscar."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,7/10,First of all Anthony Hopkins really nailed this movie with his acting skills. I don't think that anybody else could have done a better job than Anthony did. This movie gave the viewers a close look to someone who struggles with dementia and did it very well. The viewer was as confused as the main character was and we could fell empathy for the old man. The ending was satisfying and beautiful.
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,10/10,"An invaluable road map into the mind of the disappearing person you once knew, it gives you the fuel to carry - and care - on."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,9/10,"This film provides a compelling and moving portrayal of the onset of dementia (or potentially Alzheimer's) by its lead character, masterfully played by the legend Anthony Hopkins. What I really appreciated was that the story is told from his perspective, and you can feel his sense of confusion, loss and fear of having to let go. What was also depicted in an honest and nuanced way was the relationship between the parent and the child-caregiver. Olivia Colman did a fantastic job of conveying a sense of moral ambivalence between having to constantly take care of her father or to move on with her own life. While she does eventually take the decision, motivated in part by her partner, her lack of resolution is clear and her sense of guilt is relatable to anyone who is or has been in a similar situation. Really enjoyed the film."
THE FATHER,3 April 2021,8/10,"We watched many films about Alzheimer's disease and dementia, but from the eyes of the people surrounding the patient himself, here in a movie we see the disease from the patient's point of view, we deeply sympathize with him and remind us of the people we met who were suffering in the final stages of their lives. Outstanding performance by Hopkins and excellent directing by Florian Zeller in his first feature film."
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,"Brilliant. Sad. True. Human. It is ruthless, as it should be. It is uncomfortably familiar. Brilliant."
THE FATHER,4 September 2021,9/10,"While watching 'The Father', I thought the dialogues were completely unrealistic. How could the daughter be surprised by the father's reactions every time... She knows he is demented.But then I thought about this as one of the really great things in the movie: It's all the perception of the father. It's his reality. The one that is mixed and confused. What a great movie!!!"
THE FATHER,23 November 2021,9/10,At the end of the movie Anthony eats pancakes. The ease of talking and at the same time spreading the butter/sirop routinely on the pancakes suprised me a little.
THE FATHER,10 May 2021,9/10,"One of the best movies of this year.Both Oscars are absolutely well deserved!The screenplay is so original and the actors' performances are all stunning.This is a different way to tell a story that will leave you as disoriented and surprised as the main character himself.Sometimes I kinda felt like watching Memento by Nolan, even if we're talking about really different things.Its strength it's in details and originality.Not for everyone."
THE FATHER,27 May 2021,10/10,"After watching this movie, I have an idea of what dementia patients suffer and let me just say that I don't wish this fate on anyone I hate.Anthony Hopkins brought such a beautiful and realistic performance to his character. I felt like crying a couple of times, that's how moved I was.I hope many people watch this movie and when they do, I hope they learn to be more patient with Alzheimer and dementia patient. They are really suffering."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,So glad the writer stuck to their guns and waited for Sir Anthony to accept this role!Hopkins' performance is incredible!
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,10/10,"Unexpected! You don't see such things coming, you start watching and try to understand what's going on but then you figure out there's nothing to understand! This's literally the opposite of understanding, this's what disorientation and incomprehension looks like! The whole experience defies your need to understand, which beautifully, brilliantly and in the saddest of ways delivers what dementia means and feels like
An extremely well deserved 6 oscar nominations especially Sir Anthony Hopkins who couldn't be more demented!"
THE FATHER,22 August 2021,9/10,"Lets start this review with Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman. They make this film to a masterpiece, brilliantly subtile in their acting and in the twists and turns of this drama. But all the actors in the film is making a great performance and becomes a perfect conducted reflection of the sanity and craziness that comes with the sickness of dementia.The film is based on a stage play and you feel it in the dialouge that is both poetic and emotional without being overacted or to obvious.The film has a nightmarish feel to it without losing the warmth and depth of the human relations.The sadness of getting old or see someone you love get old is in a tender way portrayed by Hopkins and Colman all the way to the very moving ending.Hopkins acting in this film should be a must to watch for every young actor or actress that want to know how to be convincing and true on screen."
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,It's so good and especially for the people who want to learn acting anthony hopkins is the best if you guys really want to learn watch this movie and Anthony will take the Oscar👍🏻
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,This movie made me cry so much. This movie gets 10 stars up from best movie of the year I will buy this movie when it comes out on blue ray this year please which this movie 10 stars up.
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"I've never written a review before. I'm a big film buff but no matter how good or bad a movie is I just can't be bothered. This film has made me bother. The film as a whole is fantastic, the dialogue, staging, sets and story. Everyone in this film puts in a fantastic performance but Hopkins is captivating. I think it may be his best performance. And he's Anthony Hopkins! Within any scene, he just turns on a dime and delivers his lines more convincingly than I've ever seen an actor do. Anthony Hopkins deserves the Oscar for this movie."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"This is the first time i have ever given an IMDB rating.Thought about it so many times, but no movie was so good that i just had to rate it.This was!What a movie, and what a performance by Anthony Hopkins. No doubt he deserved that oscar 100%. Maybe the best performence i've ever seen in this type of role.The movie is so authentic and sad but at the same time so good.Watch it now."
THE FATHER,19 July 2021,9/10,This movie is amazing from the very beginning till the very end. The subject is so important nowadays and you cannot choose any better way to show the relationships between an old and ill man and his daughter who has to both take care of her dad and continue living her life. All scenes are so true and actors' performance is just astonishing. I wish there were more movies like that.
THE FATHER,2 August 2021,10/10,"This movie is one of the perfect excecuted movies throughout 2020-2021. It was brilliant, just brilliant masterpiece. Once in a lifetime you should watch this."
THE FATHER,2 October 2021,9/10,"My mother suffered from vascular dementia.First I was afraid to see this movie, but the performance of the actors was fenobinable. Not emotional, but real and sometimes a bit of humor.It is quite an experience to see dementia through the eyes of the person itself.I recognised several things, it's a terrible disease.The end was heartbreaking, I looked away."
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,10/10,The experience of watching someone deteriorating from their perspective is powerful and important. Suddenly someone's behaviour while getting older begins to make sense.Hopkins Greatest Horror Movie Since Silence of the Lambs.
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,10/10,"I hope Zeller moves from the theatre to film full time because this thing is sublime. Dementia (Alzheimer's disease) runs through both sides of the family, I've seen the disease full throttle. It is nasty and heart-breaking; it destroys everyone around the person suffering.I've a big soft spot for almighty performances. I get a buzz off seeing an actor harness everything in their being to master the craft (DDL in There Will Be Blood; PSH in Capote, The Master). Hopkins is 83; he delivers an absolutely abnormally outrageous performance. One in which, if you're watching it right, will linger long after. It's mesmerising.But to oversell on the acting alone is to do Zeller a disservice. Coleman is also great. The film and its script (adapted from the stage) is just beautiful. It sucks you in, allowing you to fully realise the disease in all its terrible, and dare I say it, funny, contradictions. I wouldn't want to spoil this for anyone. I reckon you should go for it; the worst that can happen is you turn it off after 20 minutes when you realise it's not for you. It was for me. Utterly brilliant."
THE FATHER,3 July 2021,10/10,"Just saw ""The Father"". Wow! Movie of the year. Excellent performances by all, especially Sir Anthony. A very sensitive, emotional journey through the mind of age. Expertly written and directed. In every aspect has it succeeded as an extremely moving and revelatory portrayal."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,,"My mother has lived through this same thing with my grandmother. At the beginning of the film I thought this ought be good, I have to recommend this to my mother. I believed I will be in tears. But really film just repeats itself over and over again and the thing gets old really fast. Would not recommend."
THE FATHER,20 September 2021,10/10,Sir Anthony Hopkins is wonderful in this movie. The end is perfect. No matter what we never forget our mother. Loved all the actors even Rufus Sewell being overly evil!
THE FATHER,12 September 2021,10/10,"Very tough to watch, it is incredibly sad. It is an absolute masterpiece."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"Myself confused when I watched the movie my head go around like ground all day first I think people doing on purpose to him and I realised what happening even my self get upset and feel sorry people like that very emotional movie I recommend everyone to watch it
Well done Anthony you smashed again."
THE FATHER,17 April 2021,9/10,"When I think about all time great performances, I think about Marlon Brando's Vitto Corleone, Robert De Niro's Jake LaMotta, Tom Hank's Forest Gump, Daniel Day Lewis's Daniel Plainview, Jack Nicholson's R. P. McMurphy, Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man and, of course, Anthony Hopkins's Hanibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. And with no fear to make an overstatement, I can easily say that an 83 years old Anthony Hopkins did it again.Hopkins's performance is technically perfect, very emotional and powerfull. The result is a character with diferent layers, that is not just a man with a disease, but a man who once was charismatic, intelligent and proud. His struggle to not be able to be that anymore can be noticed on his lost look, his pain and in the solitude that his condition holds him. The intensity of all this fellings is brought to us in a raw way that just a great actor can do.And although Hopkin's performance is the main factor of the movie, it isn't just that what makes The Father a great movie. The editing is a crucial factor to creat confusion and imerse the audience in the main character's perspective. The screenplay is able to make the family drama comprensible as well the fellings of the diferent characters, besides all the confusion we are all imerse. And last, but not least, Olivia's Colman's great performance just makes the movie a more powerfull experience and reminds that this dificult situation can be lived by anyone who has an aged parent.All these makeThe Father a necessary, unconfortable and powerfull experience."
THE FATHER,14 March 2021,1/10,Can someone please tell me the point of this movie?
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"This is a difficult film, difficult to experience and even more difficult to digest. And that is precisely why it is a brilliant work! Another theater play brought to the cinema, as it has been in fashion lately, but what an extraordinary way to do it. This is the film that answers the question that we all must have asked ourselves even for a brief moment: ""what would it be like to live with dementia?"" Through the direccional choices we are transported to Anthony's mind and, consequently, confronted with a distorted perception of reality which, no matter the effort we make to understand, ends up being incomprehensible.The film lives and dies by its interpretations (like any good play) and Oliva Colman and Anthony Hopkins are at the peak of their game. Olive with a measured, smooth, but meaningful interpretation; Hopkins in the best performance of his career (and that's saying something!) shows us everything he is capable of, starting the film full of layers that will be removed throughout until nothing is left, the confidence and charm that we know of so many psychopaths that he's portrayed until the vulnerability of a small child and with everything in between.The director only admitted to making this film with Anthony Hopkins in the main role, hence the name of the character, and we can understand why.When, at the end, you hear the rustle of leaves as the camera flies over the park, we are left with a thud in our hearts and are overwhelmed by the fear that one day we will be able to experience in ourselves what we have just experienced on the screen. Still, this is an exercise that we should all do, everyone should see this film.Deep, Touching, ... Terrifying, here is: The Father.Undoubtedly the Film of the Year and the Interpretation of a Lifetime!"
THE FATHER,19 May 2021,3/10,"I understand that film expresses many experiences and tells many stories, some fact and some fiction.This is a story of fiction. But don't be fooled because it is very possible and very real.I wonder how films like this can be viewed with much of any pleasure or ...entertainment.Cause after all what is film of not to tell a story to amuse or intrigue. And well there can be expressions of violence and gore in some film, at least that expression is perhaps more blatant.As I found this film to be disturbing and sad.You are pulled into the main character, Anthony's life as he loses his mind to dementia. In a setting that ultimately becomes a world that has no time for such insanity. Where people get taken somewhere, and put away, to let someone else deal with them.That reality is very real. And more horrific than any gory horror film.Anthony Hopkins who plays the character of Anthony, is a great actor, but he could likely be just playing himself, as he has reached an age when losing parts of ourselves is the reality. And so I don't see it as an award worthy performance. But who am I to say and well I'm certainly not involved in all the politics that go into those ceremonies.Watch it, if you're curious. Most will probably feel some sort of complaisant agreeability with the story. Empathize. And you only have to seen the news or followed along any social media outlet to see that people revel in the discomfort of others.Makes you wonder."
THE FATHER,7 November 2021,9/10,A movie captivating with all it's elements from story to music to cinematography and surely with the cherry on top heartbreaking performance of Anthony Hopkins and the rest of cast.
THE FATHER,14 March 2021,10/10,"The Father might be the saddest film I've ever seen. With a heartbreaking powerhouse of a performance, Anthony Hopkins is at his absolute best. This puts you in the shoes of a man whose mind is deteriorating. I fully recommend that everyone see this movie. As great as it is, it is not one I want to rewatch anytime soon."
THE FATHER,21 September 2021,8/10,"Movie is good, but not great, but his acting... Anthony Masterpiece Hopkins! Oscar award apsolutely deserved!"
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,8/10,The best picture of the year. Best actor and actress. You have to see it.
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,10/10,"Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen! A MUST WATCH..
Brilliant acting, directing and writing. Also the art in this movie is something else!"
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,10/10,Not exactly but kind of a psychological horror cause it messes with your mind.. a masterpiece nonetheless. It successfully tries to put through the perspective of a dementia patient.. It is so heartbreaking may haunt you for days. But a must watch!
THE FATHER,1 June 2021,8/10,"Brilliant in so many ways, but also very upsetting. I also left thinking 'I'd be very surprised if it didn't win best actor Oscar or best screenplay'.. And it won both!"
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,9/10,"A wonderful and touching movie, with a fantastic performance of Anthony Hopkins."
THE FATHER,18 April 2021,10/10,"Sir Anthony Hopkins gives the best performance as always, the movie will makes you laugh and cry and cry again
Other insight that was the editing is exceptional."
THE FATHER,22 August 2021,10/10,"Going in to watch this, I knew this film would resonate with me. Anthony Hopkins gives an absolutely stellar performance of a man suffering from the hourly/daily kaleidoscopic twists and turns of dementia. I absolutely loved how the film was able to depict the confusion and warping of time from the father's point of view.From his insistence that someone was stealing personal items, to his staunch refusal to leave his flat, it all too keenly reminded me of the last chapter in my mother's life. The final scene hit closer to home than anticipated -- so painfully, but realistically captured. Brilliant."
THE FATHER,31 May 2021,8/10,Anthony Hopkins at his very best. A truly masterful performance.
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"Amazing, fascinating and beautiful horror movie. I think we all agree that we were absolutely scared and terrified at some point, this movie made me understand what my grandmother goes through and made me terribly sad cuz I can't do anything about it. The directing is incredible and the screen play is perfectly written. All of the cast did very well but sir Anthony did one of his best performances ever and he definitely deserved his Oscar."
THE FATHER,12 May 2021,8/10,Best movie 🎥 for me. Very learning lesson inside. I miss my father.
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,10/10,I've never cried watching a movie..until now. Unforgettable.This movie will stay with me for years. A sad insight into growing old.
THE FATHER,2 June 2021,10/10,"The Father; the film ends and the cinema auditorium is silent, a very sombre atmosphere. That's because it's an extremely emotional film, I didn't cry in the cinema but I did when I was alone in my car. Anthony Hopkins is incredible, as is Olivia Colman and the supporting cast including Olivia Williams and Mark Gatiss.It's a disorientating film, hard to know when one scene ends and another starts. Often there is repetition of the same dialogue, altered through slight changes in setting and major changes in character as seen through the eyes and mind of the father. I'd say it's one of the most original films I've seen, in terms of its structure, both in the way the story is told and how the audience along with the father is unsure of who's who. It very much reminded me of Michael Haneke's, Amour, in places, especially the inner city grandiose setting of the flat. Florian Zeller is the director, who also wrote the screenplay from the play the film is based on, which Zeller also wrote."
THE FATHER,6 June 2021,7/10,"My mom died last year, in 2020, six years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She had lived with us for 15 years helping to raise my kids, and it was nice having her be a part of our family until the very end.There are many things in this movie that just don't comport with the reality of how a family deals with a family member with Alzheimer's. Good families know how to de-escalate situations, and to create a safe environment for the family member with Alzheimer's. You don't question or raise doubt about something they should have remembered from yesterday. It does not help. This includes the end of the moive when Anthony gets the full attention of his nurse caregiver who is there even to go on two walks a day with him. Based on my experience with multiple memory care facilities in the USA, that level of care is simply not to be found. When I checked my mom into facilities for short respite stays, the cost is very high, the food, and quality of care is marginal at best. No one gets individualized care. One place left my mom in a wet bed all day. If it were not for my business trips I would have kept her home all the time.If you wanted to create a movie that showed how hard it can be on a family to care for someone with Alzheimer's they could have showed changing wet bedding every day, or the struggle of getting them into a bathtub to take a bath. My mom would cause ringing in my ears from screaming as I try to give her a bath. Bottom line, this movie was not very true to the reality of the situation family members face.However Anthony Hopkins did a tremendous acting job worthy of his Oscar winning performance and the cinematography of this movie was amazing. It was very inventive how the scenes worked to confuse the audience and give us a sense of what Alzheimer's is like. For these reasons alone the movies deserves a viewing, even though I found it frustratingly removed from the reality of caring for someone with this horrible disease."
THE FATHER,13 July 2021,1/10,"Okay, he has dementia, but why are all the characters changing? Who is his daughter? Who is the husband/boyfriend? Why does he end up in a hospital magically? Its like more of magic shape shifting scenes that is a full of repeat scenes and boredom.PLEASE save your time and skip."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,"The Father, Finally a (new) great movie about an illness or condition that is not just focused on appearance and third party observation of the illness, but it brightens up the experience of the person engaged with the problem and the aspects of someone living with dementia specially around what's most important which is mostly our relationships and dear ones.The writing of this movie is just great with every dialogue and rotation of camera that should be closely watched.Next is just Phenomenal and in tone music, really helping to connect to each part from the composed soundtracks made for the movie to each song selected.And last lets just stand and give a big round of applause for Antony Hopkins that proved age in cinema is no effective element on acting and toward that great legends like DeNiro, Pacino, Hofman and etc are just not taking it seriously enough as they did once.An outstanding, definitely Oscar-Worthy acting (which I highly believe he will win) by Hopkins and really good ones by other actors and actresses.A movie highly worth watching and one those Masterpieces that wont age thorough time."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,9/10,"No movie before ever took you by the hand this way through the meanderings, red herrings and scary dead ends of dementia. Writing and acting doesn't get any better than this, sorry. As if Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman had anything left to prove, they just proved they kept getting even better."
THE FATHER,9 September 2021,7/10,"The Father is a good movie and depiction of dementia. It is heartwrenching to see an old man lose his sense of reality and how this effects his daugther.This movie really plays with perspective as we see the confusing life of a man with Alzheimers. Altough its done on purpose the whole movie is quite tedious, nothing big really happens and there are no real plot points except the disease and paranoia of this man.The acting is absolutely top class and this movie can really evoke emotions, but at the end of the day this is not my type of movie as I found it quite boring and annoying at times."
THE FATHER,26 July 2021,10/10,"At first i planned to watch it just for Anthony Hopkins, he was terrific in this role. And in my opinion it was one of the best performances of all time. After watching movie i can't imagine
Another actor on behalf of him . In addition to great performance , screenplay and directing were as nice as possible. Can't criticize it even a bit. Just say it is Wonderful!"
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,Anything below a 10 is not acceptable for this masterpiece.
THE FATHER,23 June 2021,8/10,"Anthony Hopkins just made the best performance for an old man I have ever seen on the screen. His acting was so actual that I forgot this was a movie and started crying. And It was never a one-good-actor movie, everyone who performed in this masterpiece was incredible. They were so good that ,sometimes, I doubted them, too (along with Anthony) . And there are no words good enough to describe the amazing soundtrack of the film. It touched me deeply in the moments of doubt, sadness, despair and, most of all, truth. What's really special about the movie is that it descusses a real life issue that we all see and hear about every day. And just picturing the agony of these old people is torturing. Imagine what it would be like as your world falls apart around you, as every minute passing in front of you does nothing but assure you more of your inability, as you hurt the ones you love most by just wanting to live on your own in your flat . That's what generates the great collapse of (I need my mommy to come and fitch me) in the end. In conclusion, I just want to say The Father made a great choice when it decided to capture the father's point of view."
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,8/10,This film is such a masterpiece in terms of the social message that tries to pass on. In terms of performance Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a strong believable and relatable character.
THE FATHER,20 June 2021,9/10,"This was actually a really difficult watch, despite the fact I've seen it 3 times in the cinema. The acting from Hopkins and Coleman was out of this world and it really opened my eyes to the world of dementia. It almost felt like a horror film because of how real it was but I do think everyone should watch this at least once."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"A true master piece, with brilliant acting. Exceptional movie in every single way."
THE FATHER,2 August 2021,1/10,"Yes Anthony Hopkins did some great acting but the movie in general was EXTREMELY slow and boring. There's no actual point, or plot. When the movie ended I was so upset I wasted all that time wathcing nothing.Steer clear from this movie."
THE FATHER,5 November 2021,9/10,"Drifted somewhat unsuspecting into this film and certainly didn't expect the effect it would have on me, nor was I prepared for it.Having lost my father two years ago to a mix of old age and dementia Anthony Hopkins nails it, halfway through the film it hit me hard.I'm glad I saw it though, if you have a loved one who's going through this, watch this film. It'll make you more compassionate and understanding. That was the effect it had on me anyways.Brilliant. Thank you Sir Hopkins."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,9/10,"No matter how much the filming was, it was a great acting and it puts the audience in the position and feeling of a patient very well."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,"What a heart-breaking film! Fantastic lead performances from both Hopkins and Colman. A very basic and simple concept made so much more than it could have been. The cinematography, editing, score, all of it was great. Some of the disorientation throughout that the film was a bit confusing but besides that a truly great film."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,Things like this movie reminds you how much your father loves ...respect him.
THE FATHER,5 April 2021,10/10,"I loved this movie, it is very well done so you can feel how the main character is struggling, you can feel his suffering and confussion. Great performances, I love Olivia Colman and well we all know that Antony hopskin is an excellent actor. The music score is also remarkable."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,10/10,"This movie needs to win ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actors"" this Sunday at the Oscars.The script, the actors, the simplicity of the settings, the directing...everything is on point.The quality of the film is so rare, it just has to be showered in awards.Not to give anything away: Sir Anthony Hopkins is already one of the best actors alive, and this is one of his beyond fantastic performances."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,10/10,"I've watched all the movies nominated for best picture this year. After I saw Promising Young Women I thought that nothing will top this movie.. And then came the Father which came unbelivable close.Positive:
breathtaking performances by Anthony Hopkins an Olivia Colemanheartbreaking moments (especially the ending)the violin playing in the background brings tears to your eyesthe production design is so cleverthe writing is just on another levelnegativ:
NOTHINGfavourite scene:
The beginning: Olivia Coleman walks to Anthonys apartment to a classic song (at that moment I knew it will be a fantastic movie)favourite performence
The MASTER: Sir Anthony HopkinsBUT: Olivia Coleman is also great (as always."
THE FATHER,29 October 2021,7/10,"I hope God takes me before I lose my wits... this movie is sad and thought provoking and you best have your tissues ready. Outstanding acting by Sir Anthony Hopkins, as one would expect."
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,10/10,"This was a cleverly crafted film, with a great script, acted wonderfully, particularly by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman.As a viewer you experience the confusion of Anthony as his condition impacts on him more and more. The first time you experience his shift in reality it comes out of the blue and is so unexpected. The shifts in time and characters give you a taste of what he is experiencing as a result of his illness.The final scene is truly heartbreaking.You have to see this film!"
THE FATHER,6 September 2021,10/10,"I'm a Geriatric nurse and as such, I see a lot of Alzheimer's and Dementia patients. This film is by far one of the best depections of Dementia that I've ever seen. The plot feels disoriented but it's a purposeful disorientation as you realize that's what these patients feel. Names, faces, and memories all become jumbled. Alzheimer's patients do not experience time in the same linear concept that we do, and this movie captures that so perfectly. Sir Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of bringing us into the mind of Anthony, an elderly gentleman suffering from Dementia, and Olivia Coleman captures the emotions and trials that her character, Anne, must endure as Anthony's daughter and caregiver. I hope that every medical professional sees this in order to help us provide better care for our patients, and I hope this brings a greater understanding to the public about those suffering from this illness, leading to more acceptance and a kinder world for us all. This movie is a must watch as it will keep you in your seat, and keep you guessing every step of the way. I'd also like to take a moment to explain that while not every person with Dementia may be this way, a large part are. There are different versions of Dementia, with some patients not gaining lucidity the way Anthony does, and some patients being completely pleasant in manner and mood. However, all the characteristics of the illness portrayed in this film are accurate, are not dramatized, and unfortunately are very real for millions across the globe. If you or someone you know is suffering from, or caring for, someone with Dementia, please call 1-800-272-3900 for support and services in your area."
THE FATHER,20 October 2021,8/10,I'm not the type of person to write reviews about films and watch films like these but this movie really really hit me in my emotions. Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman did such a good job in this film it really pulls at your heartstrings. Definitely hits the point of what it is like to live with a parent with a disease like this.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"In my opinion, THE FATHER deserve oscar's Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Actor, Best Actress!"
THE FATHER,8 May 2021,10/10,"Anthony hopkins is just brilliant, truly deserved oscar. The movie itself is just perfect, fresh, well tought! Will get you into a dementia/alzheimer case. Just go and see it!"
THE FATHER,17 September 2020,9/10,"This is a film that stays with you. Of course there's the brilliant performances but there's more. While other films have taken on old age and dementia, those films took on coping with a significant other's condition. The difference here is that the film is from the sufferer's perspective. You therefore see these events as if you yourself have dementia. And it's stunning how, when you walk away, you know you can."
THE FATHER,27 February 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins easily the greatest actor of our times in his gut wrenching portrayal of a man suffering from Alzheimer's. Seamlessly expressing ranges of humanity from Hannibal the monster in The Silence of the Lambs to his latest nominated role in The Father as he slowly slides into the horror of this father as he loses his mind witnessed primarily through his caregiving daughter portrayed by the brilliant Olivia Colman. The sliding in and out of his past and present flows beautifully through the steady direction of writer/director Florian Zeller an acclaimed playwrite from France, breaks your heart, terrorizes you as you travel through his life's trauma giving way to his rage as it seethes through every expression from a long life survived as he's losing his grip on reality. Nominated for 4 Golden Globes."
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,More movies like this and sound of metal should come so that people can understand the lives of the people suffering from these diseases.
THE FATHER,12 May 2021,10/10,"Must-see movie, but you really have to be in the special mood to watch it.After watching it for the first time I was confused and sad, but wanted to watch it one more time.It presents the dementia in really strong and realistic way. I had two family members who suffered from dementia and these moments showing Anthony's obsession with the time (watch), mood swings, different feelings about his 2 daughters..., are so realistic and presented in excellent way.I watched the movie two times and after every watching I had different impression, different thoughts about what is reality...many question marks above my head.And Hopkins performance is just incredible. My reaction at the end was ""I do not want to see him like this"" 💔"
THE FATHER,8 July 2021,6/10,It made me rethink my own sanity. It made me think of my mother's death. The movie confuses everything. He does not forgive and does not spare the viewer. Even break the fourth wall. I even thought that the crazy person was the daughter. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. But the time signature of the movie is too slow. And the movie has no surprises.
THE FATHER,30 August 2021,10/10,"Brilliantly made movie. Immerses the viewer into the crumbling world and mind of Anthony. Anthony Hopkins rightly deserved best actor for this carefully crafted, very touching movie. A movie that brought me and the wife to tears."
THE FATHER,24 June 2021,9/10,I'm not crying 😭you crying😭 Anthony's at his best performance.
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,9/10,"Highly recommend you see this touching movie.Sir Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman are superb in their respective roles brilliantly written and directed by Florian Zeller.It's a sad, insightful and moving story giving us a glimpse of what ilife is like battling dementia."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,Anthony Hopkins has beaten his best ever performance and Olivia Coleman has outdone herself. Movie direction par excellence The Father is probably one of the best movies of the past 25 years. A gargatuian performance by all involved. Excellent script that describes the realities of Alzheimer's.
THE FATHER,11 June 2021,7/10,Yes it's an impressive acting role to Hopkins but not to that extent of Oscar.. i liked the idea of presenting the illness from inside the patients head not from others eyes.
THE FATHER,29 August 2021,9/10,"This film is exceptional. Masterful performances from everyone, incredible screen play, beautifully executed."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,9/10,Hope Anthony Hopkins wins Oscar for this!! Such grate acting in this age bravo!!
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,10/10,One of the best movies I've ever seen. A true representation of the scourge that is dementia. It accompanies your slow descent into the horrors of questioning your own reality with a beautiful music score..
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,10/10,This film is truly a masterpiece and has one of the best Sir Anthony Hopkins role. He should get an Oscar for this acting.Must be watched.
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,9/10,"My grandmother lost her battler against Alzheimer a year ago. As someone who has helped to take care of a patient with dementia, I certainly recommend this film. It is done from the patient's perspective and it shows really well what they suffer every day.The most important thing is that the film will help you understand and empathize with people suffering dementia but, I'm not leaving aside that the acting of Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is superb."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,1/10,"Don't waste your money or time, amazing acting by all especially Anthony but didn't like the film!So depressing and confusing!"
THE FATHER,15 April 2021,10/10,"I can imagine all the team behind the scene who should have enjoyed a lot having participated in this adventure. Brilliant work. Such a performance with 83! Chapeau Monsieur HopkinsI just want to give a big hug my dad now.Tony
One of those who doesn't speak english ;-)"
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"Before watching this movie, you should know nothing about it (literary nothing) 'cause movie leads congitive, mental and emotional process. At the very begining, you question the need of caregiver. As soon as you get it, you are in the process. Then you catch what is his imagination and what is real. And then you catch that there's no real, everything is in his head (or maybe not, but it doesn't matter). And then, when you finally understand that the whole movie is his imagination, you face the repeated dialogues: repeated, but in different circumstances, and now they have more different meaning (doesn't we, who don't suffer from that diagnozis, do the same? Remembering is variable thing...)."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,9/10,"Some movies plot could look normal but the character and performance of the actor make it thrilling. So you don't see the plot or the story rather than the performance of the actor ""Anthony Hopkins"" and the supporting actress. It's amazing. I might sound biased because I am in love with Anthony!"
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"What an ABSOLUTELY incredible film. Sir Anthony Hopkins is really unforgettable. He deserves ALL the awards for this film.His portrayal of someone with dementia is spot on. The toll it takes on not only the patient suffering but those around them and their loved ones will bring you to tears.Not only is it a must watch if you can handle it but for those with loved ones going through it then its some incredible insight into the devastating world of dementia. BRAVO to this incredible film, cast and creators.... all the awards I tell you. I haven't been this moved about a film in ages. #thefather #siranthonyhopkins."
THE FATHER,6 July 2021,5/10,I don't really care how good the actors played but the movie felt to be the reputation of the first 5 minutes over and over again. It was very frustrating to watch. The 5 stars I gave to the actors.
THE FATHER,2 June 2021,3/10,"It is more like a documentary from a sufferer of dementia's perspective, but only reflects part of it, does not cover the lack of bodily functions. Most people will think it highly over rated, I felt an evening wasted, not entertaining in any manner."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,"Extraordinaria película, con actuaciones magistrales."
THE FATHER,6 August 2021,10/10,"A complex theme to treat in the cinema as old age with all the respect it deserves. No one could play this role better than Anthony Hopkins himself, in a role that could lead him to win an Oscar again.This film will touch all your fibers and will make you excited, sensitize and most importantly empathize with people who unfortunately do not have high visibility today and deserve all our respect and support. In the end they show us the way."
THE FATHER,23 March 2021,10/10,"This is the film that hooks you and dont let go until the final shot. Sir Tony is just incredible in this one. His character is loveable, relatable and has that charm that, in spite of dementia, still shines through him. As the title says, he plays the father of adorable and caring Olivia Coldman which is in mine book, after seeing her astonishing performance, one of the best actresses in the world of cinema right now. She is soo good in emitting emotions to the screen that she could do that with her mimicking alone, no words needed. Seeing sorrow in her eyes while looking after the man who raised her is just hard to watch. But the preformanse at the end of the film given by the veteran of cinema sir Antony Hopkins is just OUT OF THIS WORLD. I never felt that way while watching a movie. It was like a giant stone was pressed on my chest and i started sobbing like a child, first time after untimely death of my father 10 years ago. Thanks God I watched the movie alone. Anyway, cinematography and direction are great, also the script, lighting and music. And, no matter witch ""political correct"" movie get Oscar this year, for me will always be this one.."
THE FATHER,20 April 2021,8/10,"I started watching this movie because of it being nominated in the Oscars. This movie will go on to haunt me for quite sometime. Hopkins acting truly makes him deserving of an Oscar. My grandmother is suffering from forgetfulness and this reminded me of her a lot. A very emotionally powerful, and beautiful movie. Must watch for anyone who has a closed one dealing with dementia to look at the life from their perspective."
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,10/10,"Simply the best film I have seen in a long long time with not only a masterclass from Anthony Hopkins and exceptional performances from Olivia Coleman and Olivia Williams. However it is the writing by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller that makes this a masterpiece.For anyone who has witnessed a someone close suffering from dementia, this will be a tough watch. It's not hard to appreciate how difficult it is for A family watching their loved one deteriorate day by day, going from being a bit absent minded and forgetting where they left things to no longer recognizing their spouse or children. The Father takes us on that same journey but from the perspective of the sufferer and once you realize that, it rips your heart in two."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,10/10,"This movie was fantastic! Tremendous acting by Anthony hopkins,at times the movie even has you wondering what is happening. This movie does a good job of showing you what dementia/ allzheimers can do to a family."
THE FATHER,21 April 2021,9/10,"Getting to watch Anthony Hopkins in ""The Father"" is like going on a journey with the main character as he experiences and develops the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Although we recognize the theme of the story from the beginning of the film, the aggravation of the Anthony's situation leads to more and more contradictions and nonsensical scenes towards the end of the movie, and perhaps this is mainly because we are seeing the outside world from Anthony's perspective. The movie is humble and doesn't convey a feeling of ostentatious directing, acting, etc, to the viewers, though Hopkin's performance is splendid. Really enjoyed watching it!"
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,9/10,"This movie really rips your heart out!No happy end, no hollywoodish over dramatizing, just the sad truth about dementia/alzheimer with outstanding acting!"
THE FATHER,23 June 2021,2/10,The same film done 5 years later. Watch the original!Florida (2015 by Philippe Le Guay)
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,9/10,"When I started watching an Oscar movie with the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins I didn't know what ""I'm getting into""!The Father -2020 is a film that does not make you feel good but makes you deeply sad, it makes you go through all the possible states and even makes you think that ... you never know what fate is preparing for you!Quite static (taking place in 3-4 rooms and a long hallway) the film becomes dynamic due to the fact that the action takes place, in fact, in the ravaged mind of a father with Alzheimer's.Incredible and terrifying is the illustration in images of the darkness in the mind of a confused man: the plans overlap, the rooms change, the characters are or are not what they seem ... everything is unclear ... and in the center of all is always him, the old man with a confused and confusing smile on his lips.I don't think he would have been another better actor for this role. Even the writer / director Florian Zeller didn't think otherwise, offering the script since 2017 to the great actor and refusing to make the film without him (the character's name is Athony because it can only be his) Ffff inspired choice because Hopkins is masterful! Merit that was recognized this year with an Oscar (the actor has another for Silence of the Lambs - 1991) being the oldest actor who received this distinction at 84, dethroning him (if you can say that even though everyone has well-established place in the panoply of great actors as well as in our hearts) Christopher Plummer who was awarded at the age of 82.Olivia Colman (as Anne's daughter) is slightly overshadowed by Hopkins' overwhelming personality (who wouldn't she be ?!) yet she plays a wonderful role.The film also has parts in which music plays an important role, Hopkins being a great lover of classical music and even singing the piano. The area from Bizet's ""Pearl Fishermen"" was chosen for the film at his suggestion, being one of his favorites.I don't think there is much more to say about this film (it ""took my maul"" anyway as they say) and I don't even know if it would be good to recommend it to people who have old or sick parents or to young people who don't he would (still) understand its depth.""The Father"" is such a realistic movie that it's good to put on a list and watch only when you have the necessary mood but ... by no means ignored!"
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,8/10,"Movie is brilliant, it confuses you at first then realize that's what every old man suffering in his old age.. it made me feel very sorry on each strong man has defeated by age.. Man keep his powerful and dignity mixed with losing memory..
Movie also tell us to be patient with our beloved old people and any rude action is not in purpose."
THE FATHER,15 July 2021,10/10,"I just recently lost my grandmother to dementia... I have seen plenty of films depict mental deterioration, but this one is spot on.There were times I uncontrollably wept. This gave me such a haunting perspective on what the last few years of my grandmother's life was like.I will probably never watch this movie again. Because of how accurate it felt.10/10."
THE FATHER,2 May 2021,9/10,"After watching this film, I cannot understand how Nomadland got the Oscar. Some things are just wrong. Hopkins delivers a haunting performance."
THE FATHER,12 September 2021,,"Hopkins is mind blowing!! What an absolutely incredible, heartfelt & gut wrenching performance, beyond outstanding, without doubt the performance of his career & simply one of the finest performances in cinematic history, seriously!Olivia Colman is great too & gives a very nuanced & subtle performance as she always does, the rest of the cast give admirable performances also.Very well written, directed & beautifully shot this is a truly great addition to the world of cinema, thank you to all involved.WARNING!!! The end scene will break you."
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,"I rarely take my time to write reviews on IMDb and this is a clear exception. One of my biggest fears is slowly losing my memory and not being able to recognize the people I love wholeheartedly, and this movie made sure I cried a river of tears throughout the beautiful journey of watching it. Anthony Hopkins is, without a doubt in my mind, a fantastic actor who helps this movie shine. The story is phenomenal and, at one point, I legitimately thought I was watching someone suffering from Alzheimer's.If the movie didn't throw the word ""Anthony"" at me every now and then, I can be certain that I wouldn't even remind myself that that man is Anthony Hopkins.I always see actors and actresses but I also allow myself to establish an emotional connection with their characters.There are very few movies that I have watched where I completely forgot I was watching a movie, and this is one of those movies. I got lost in the movie as Anthony got lost in his mind. In the very end, I didn't see Anthony Hopkins, I saw an old man suffering from a horrible disease. I sincerely hope Hopkins gets an Oscar for the genuine tears he spawned on my eyes.It's a beautiful film and you won't regret watching it!"
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,9/10,"This movie was phenomenal. It's a drama played out like a mystery thriller due to you being in the mind of Anthony Hopkins's namesake character.You can tell this was a play due to the minimal locations throughout but it suits it, the flat almost becomes like a metaphor for his mind, more and more like a labyrinth as the movie goes on.Hopkins and Colman were both incredible, both of them should have won Oscars but Hopkins could have won it ten times over. It is a heartbreakingly accurate portrayal of dementia and worthy of all its accolades."
THE FATHER,3 May 2021,10/10,"Reminded me of my grandmother a lot, and my moms struggle to help her, it hit me right in the heart."
THE FATHER,17 June 2021,8/10,"I found this to be a challenging film to watch as it is filmed in a way to give the viewer an insight into how it could feel to suffer with dementia and it's scary. Hopkins is simply brilliant and I could see just why he won the Oscar.The whole cast is very good, especially Olivia Coleman who gives another standout performance.The director also deserves a mention for how he has structured and shot this movie to really unsettle the viewer and bring you into Anthony's world.An excellent film about a very difficult subject."
THE FATHER,25 March 2021,8/10,This movie make my day complete after so many disappointed movies
THE FATHER,2 September 2021,7/10,"The movie takes you in a journey where you discover how an alzheimer patient lives and feels. There is no better way to describe the struggle of these patients than the one used in the movie.The performance of Anthony Hopkins was exemplary,and he realy lived this role."
THE FATHER,4 May 2021,10/10,I'm speechless this is goning to be on my favorite films.
THE FATHER,19 July 2021,9/10,The perspective from which the story is told is incredibly innovative and illuminating. Decades of life disintegrating while the body goes on. Makes you question what life really means when all is said and done.
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,5/10,"I am astonished at this film's impact and the effusive praise for it and the performances. I had to keep ff-ing rather than abandon it, but it didn't improve. My problem is that I have worked in neuropsychology, and especially with dementia, over many years, and this rendition is lacking lacking lacking. Hopkins didn't impress me nor did the script or anything else. Utterly boring and not, to me, authentic, however, when so many of the general public seem to draw something from it, I can only defer to them. Dementia is a much more exciting and interesting condition than portrayed here."
THE FATHER,1 August 2021,9/10,"Amazing actors, Good story and I could watch it again."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"This movie hurts like a mother*ucker. Amazing performance from Anthony Hopkins. Truly amazed, one of the best movies I have seen in a while..."
THE FATHER,15 August 2021,8/10,This movie is very depressing but the acting is top notch. Gives you an experience which will make you wish to avoid losing your nind.
THE FATHER,5 July 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins's performance is simply amazing, loved the story and the way they present it, the order of scenes and everything is just so well made!Loved it, loved every second of it, a movie that truly deserves 10/10."
THE FATHER,16 May 2021,10/10,Anthony is Shining like always. His wonderful performance make it the best movie of year.
THE FATHER,12 November 2021,10/10,"It's a masterpiece. Sir Anthony Hopkins made his best acting in this film. Seeing this film is a must. Perfect acting, perfect soundtracks, perfect script. Worth more than millions stars rating. Enjoy ;)"
THE FATHER,29 August 2021,9/10,The idea is good but it could be prepared more carefully.
THE FATHER,28 April 2021,10/10,"If you have a relative who went through the same thing you will realise 5 minutes into the movie that this is the best depiction of Dementia you will ever see . This movie will haunt you. It makes you really see the other person's perspective and I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it.Anthony's performance is the best since Silence of the Lambs by far. The modt deserved Oscar ever.Olivia Coleman is also perfect for this role, she plays the suffering daughter so gracefully.Movies like this are the reason why I love cinema and I am grateful."
THE FATHER,27 April 2021,9/10,One of the most phenomenal performances I've ever seen in my whole life. Such a great movie with an incredibly sad and heartbreaking story.
THE FATHER,3 June 2021,9/10,"One of the best films about Alzheimer's and the best movie in 2020 for me because it talks about an important issue and you must sympathize with these people and take care of them, and Anthony Hopkins' performance is global, worthy of the Oscars, the music, the script, the direction, the acting, and everyone is special in this movie, which lives the atmosphere in the movie exactly and puts you in the place of the actors as if you are You have the disease Thank you for this masterpiece."
THE FATHER,11 August 2021,8/10,This movie perfectly shows the perspective of a person who has alzheimer disease. Brilliant acting by Anthony Hopkins and perfectly directed by Florian Zeller. Definitely one of the best movies of 2020.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,Alzheimer's is very difficult for the patient and his family. Magnificent Hopkins!Thanks for the wonderful acting!
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,10/10,"This film makes you live everything the people who suffer from dementia are feeling. It's amazing and in the same time so heartbreaking to be so tormented by your own mind and memories. You feel confused, lost, it makes me appreciate caretakers more, how much humanity is needed for this job, it makes me sad for the families who must see their loved ones slowly fading away and becoming child again. This sad film makes me happy that these profound motion pictures still exist today. Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman deserve all the awards , they are amazing."
THE FATHER,18 June 2021,8/10,"If it's unavoidable for a tree to lose its leaves, all we can do is to be a good gardener as possible as we can.It's the most touchy film I've watched these years, but have to say, it's still a touch story under the white and privileged background... reality can be so much more graphic than the film
However and whatever, it doesn't affect how meaningful and thought-provoking this work is to me.Life is like a circus, we're trying so hard (or at least I'm trying) to perform the perfect balancing act every single day. I think Anne already did a great job. And when I become Anthony one day, I probably also will feel so strengthless. But this is life. Despite how much torture and surprise it holds, it's still life. I respect and appreciate it.Salute to the Father, salute to life."
THE FATHER,22 March 2020,9/10,"How does one respond when they cannot know reality? This is the main question of the Father.The Father is adapted from director Florian Zeller's stage play by the same name. The story centers on Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an aging man who slowly loses his grip on reality due to dementia. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) does her best to care for him, but she too has a life she wants to live-her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell) has asked her to move to Paris with him. Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father, so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother, who raised him, pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch. Anne patiently reminds him that he put it in his hiding place. She goes and finds the watch in his ""secret"" hiding place. At first, we are able to chuckle about the situation, but we soon become just as confused as Anthony. The tone of the movie shifts when Anthony stumbles upon a man in his flat who claims to be married to his daughter. He waits for Anne to return from the store to sort things out, but when she arrives, she is a different woman entirely.The rest of film has confusing moments like this. Once you think you have sorted things out, they are flipped again. I watched this at the premier at Sundance, and during the Q & A after the film, a woman asked if Anne went to Paris with Paul or not. Zeller responded that we don't know that answer, the answer is not what is important. Zeller stated that he wanted us to be as confused as Anthony and give up on trying to sort things out and just feel. And feel we do.Anthony Hopkins performance drove the emotion. His masterful control of minor expressions and vocal nuance intensified the whole film. I would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year. Zeller admitted that he named the character ""Anthony,"" because he wanted Anthony Hopkins to play the part. (The part was literally written for him.) Anthony's emotions swing in the film driven by his loss of memory and disorientation to events. Everyone seems to be on edge, not knowing how Anthony will respond. One moment he is happy, the next he is distressed. This comes out strongly when Anthony meets Laura (Imogen Poots) for the first time. Laura is a young woman who Anne has set up as Anthony's new caregiver. Anthony begins telling Laura how he used to be a tap-dancer. The scene is funny, and Laura laughs throughout. Suddenly, Anthony remarks that Laura reminds him of his other daughter, because of her inane laughter-and the mood has swung.The key question in the audiences mind is ""What is reality?"" Zeller disorients Anthony and the audience by having different actors play the same characters, then switching back. Zeller rearranges the same apartment, so we are unsure where we are-Anthony's apartment or Anne's. Anthony tells different versions of his career, and we even seem to experience events out of order. The only thing we are certain of is that they don't even speak English in Paris!This is not to say that there are multiple realities, but that Anthony cannot access what the true reality is. As the audience, we become like Anthony-confused. We do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married. If she is, which man is her husband? However, this confusion over reality is meant to push us beyond discovering the truth and just feeling the helplessness of someone suffering from dementia. And to this point, it works.But, it takes us beyond this. By the end of the film we are all confused. We cannot access what reality is, and now it is time for us to ask, ""How do we respond?"" The film has its answer, but I'll leave it up to you to feel if you agree. This is one film that has to be watched to appreciate, because it focuses on the feeling of the experience and not the truth of the experience.A couple extra notes:
First, Zeller shared that the classical music that Anthony listens to throughout the film is Hopkins's favorite music. Hopkins always wanted to be in a movie that used this music, and now he got the chance.Second, often movies adapted from stage plays can feel very confined and unnatural to the screen. Events that would naturally lead a character elsewhere seems to falsely confine them to that space, since the play needs to keep them there. However, Zeller does a nice job at expanding the world and making the small space feel new. Most of the film takes place in the apartment, but because of the rearrangement and use of different rooms in the apartment, it feels larger and natural."
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,8/10,"Father is a very good surreal movie right in the service of the script The surreal atmosphere of the film rotates in the direction of the story and is related to the story of the main character of the film and he was able to use this space correctly. And the great play of Anthony Hopkins, who, in my opinion, offers the best creative role after the silence of the lambs. Scene design and cinematography are very well done in the film. In general, the father is a good movie ."
THE FATHER,10 July 2021,10/10,"Dark... dark like staring into an abyss, maddening and heart-rending... terrifying too!Especially since you watch it from the perspective of the person suffering, as he slowly and steadily starts loosing the thread of his reality and as the movie progresses, you become him... You suffer the same dementia, the same confusion and the same muddled reality until you start to doubt yourself... is Anthony the one suffering or is it you yourself?By the time the movie nears its end you feel as if an invisible hand is twisting your gut and something heavy has landed on your heart... something which is going to stay there for days...maybe weeks!It was almost 30 minutes after the curtains that I started crying and shivering uncontrollably... I just couldn't stop the tears... I decided I will never end up like Anthony, I would rather commit suicide than loose my leaves I... that was the kind of terror I felt...!To say something about the acting would be like showing the torch to the Sun itself... Sir Hopkins with his mannerisms and eyes root straight for your heart and stays with you like a spectre... haunting you...Before you watch it, be prepared to get moved... considerably so!"
THE FATHER,2 April 2021,9/10,"I very seldom, actually never, review movies or tv series on web sites but I do feel that this requires some comment. Although this is a very disturbing film, which is brilliantly acted by Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Coleman, it has really opened my eyes to the pain of mental illness of people at an advanced age from both points of view. Not only is the anguish of the family very clear, which is what most movies of this genre focus on, but it also gives a clear view of what the patient is going through. An excellent film."
THE FATHER,23 May 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins... what an actor my goodness!! He's...I can't even explain how great an actor he is. And Olivia was flawless. The entire movie, the sequence, the presentation just amazing!Couldn't be better!He deserved the Oscar.Best performance of him after The Silence of the lambs which also is my absolute favourite!"
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"I stared watching films since I was 10, nearly 2000 movies in the passed 20 years, and i think this is the best performance of an actor I've ever seen so far. Antony Hopkins gives the perfect acting that missed in hollywood for decades. He is the best."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,9/10,"Tight drama, perfect visual, shrill, almost physical pain. It is out of logic, just feel and keep it going."
THE FATHER,31 May 2021,10/10,"I kept remembering my mother asking ""whose house is this?"" whenever we would return from an outing. Bravo."
THE FATHER,3 October 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins take de movie with him. I am speechless, i neyer saw a performance like this."
THE FATHER,19 July 2021,3/10,"Yes, Anthony Hopkins was good, but the film was no good."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,"This film made me cry so much , it's one of the best films that I've seen so far , I highly recommend it ."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,9/10,The Movie is amazingly made where we get to see the world from a different perspective. A perspective of a man suffering from dementia. The movie will seem confusing if u try to find what's right and what's wrong. But the movie is not about finding the answer. You just have to remain in the confusion just to feel like a dementia patient. The movie was an absolute success in order to express the confusing situation of a dementia patient and sir Anthony Hopkins was extraordinary like everytime.
THE FATHER,31 August 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins, what a man. It was a pleasure to see you performing. Seriously i don't have any words to describe my feeling, all the people who are a part of this film are special
Thank you all for this amazing and emotional experience."
THE FATHER,15 June 2021,10/10,I really have no words to describe it but let me tell you something. You'll feel it!
THE FATHER,31 January 2021,6/10,Not near the power of the original stage play. An earnest attempt at a film version but not as compelling as the original.
THE FATHER,8 July 2021,9/10,I Think the love of daughter to her father and the loneliness of father is shown absolutely realistic.
THE FATHER,10 April 2021,,"This is a well done portrait of both sides of the problem. These are difficulties that are hard to handle ... but not impossible ... just heartbreakingly real, heartrending, and relentless.So, if you have older parent(s)... see it with compassion, mercy, and forgiveness in your heart."
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,Hopkins really deserves an Oscar this year! I haven't seen such a good movie for a long time. I think this is his best role since The Silence of the Lambs.
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"Well, I really have nothing to say more than that Anthony Hopkins is being Anthony Hopkins, the performance is on another level, so natural, so so natural and I think this is the best ever a performer can become, to make you feel that it's not acting.I think he's strongly in for the Academy rewards."
THE FATHER,13 March 2021,10/10,"After watching this movie, I had to see the reviews to see if others were as rocked as I was by it. They were. Breath-takingly good movie. I would have rated the movie a 7-8 due to great writing, acting, cast and story, but the last five minutes shot it to a 100 out of 10 due to Hopkins. Gut wrenching and wonderful."
THE FATHER,21 March 2021,1/10,"The father was a ok movie A man refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality the main the main character play by Anthony Hopkins is just like Mario grandpa in the SuperMarioLogan movies that he's in old can't hear doesn't know where he is and has problems The other actors are Olivia Colman as Anne Rufus Sewell as Paul
Imogen Poots as Laura Mark Gatiss as Bill and Olivia Williams as Catherine the film was distributed by the same companies who did
My Little Pony The Movie and Green Book"
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"Was so long time ago since I cry like this watching a movie. Dude, just watch it."
THE FATHER,19 March 2021,10/10,"It's just so sad and also a bit terrifying. My wife works as a nurse in an alzheimer's ward, and she said this is the most realistic depiction of the disease she has ever seen. She also said in her opinion it should be required viewing for anyone that works with alzheimer's or dementia patients. What a movie!"
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,One of the best saddest movies I've seen. Everything about this movie is amazing. Anthony Hopkins deserves to win the Oscar this year.
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,8/10,An unforgettable movie that makes you feel what alzheimer patient feels like.
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,"Oooh my word what am i watching,😭😭 saddest movie i ever watched."
THE FATHER,7 April 2021,10/10,"I'm writing my first review ever, but it deserves. My mom - God bless her soul- suffered dementia and Alzheimer's disease years before she passed away. I remember how all family members suffered while taking care of her. Alot of delusions, hallucinations and paranoia. Should one believe in his senses ? Or in his beloved ones? I realised that time that mental disability is much worse than physical disability. This touching movie is telling the story for the first time from the other side. I think I'll watch again soon I feel like I miss watching it again and again."
THE FATHER,13 April 2021,10/10,Absolutely amazing and unbelievable performance by Antony Hopkins!
THE FATHER,22 April 2021,8/10,"The performances were incredible, the film has a great concept, but it is not a perfect film."
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,8/10,Forgive me for bad english because I come from non-english country. Can't imagine this performed by real 80 years old father. An elderly father struggle with the down-performed of his rust body and brain. His relatives also feels struggle to look after him. This movie is a perfect time-travel show for us who haven't getting old yet. It gives us lesson and chance to value more about time we have now.
THE FATHER,20 April 2021,10/10,"What a dipiction of one of the most mysterious disease of our time and what a misery it surfaced about the haunting situation these patients are bearing with. Exceptional script, direction and out of this world acting by A. Hopkins. Now I know why Robin Williams did that !........:(."
THE FATHER,31 May 2021,9/10,"""The father"" does not talk only about dementia, it talks about life and about growing old. In the final scenes of the movie the door opens completely and human fragility rushes inside your soul and mind. This movie starts quietly and it slowly takes your whole heart as the story makes clearer and as you put the pieces of the puzzle together.Other movies simply described dementia and old age, from an external point of view. This movie instead is seen within the eyes of an old man who is losing touch with reality and who feels more and more dazed and scared and this is an extremely original prospective.The acting is powerful and Anthony Hopkins is simply great."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,10/10,"This could've been the story of my mum. I wept silently through most of it wishing I'd never gone: it was at once deeply insightful and searingly heartwrenching. Anthony Hopkins' performance was seamless. He is a master craftsman of his art. So accurately observed. Every breath, pause, glance, step so precisely delivered. You could almost feel his thoughts and confusion. Would I recommend it?"
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,"If Anthony Hopkins doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, there is something incredibly wrong with their awarding process. You would almost think this could be some mind twisting thriller, but its simply a movie about the deterioration of the human brain with dementia. I think everyone should watch this to gain some perspective on what it's like to age with dementia."
THE FATHER,26 April 2021,10/10,"The movie is so well written that even we get a glimpse of what it is like to live in Anthony's world. I have seen movies where they portray dementia but this one really gives you a real dose of what it feels like just by watching the movie, kind of like what memento felt.My grandmother is suffering from Alzimers and I have always wondered what must be going through her mind. We celebrated her 87th birthday few months ago and last week I visited her, I asked her how old she is, she replied 63. She would go on to tell me about her childhood for the hundredth time but I listened like it was the first because she is always so invested in the story that she literally cries and laughs when explaining her stories. As it was getting dark, she would try to get up from her seat saying that she needs to hurry and cook some meals, as her son will reach soon from work. She'd try to get up and say the same thing..She hasn't entered the kitchen in decades and hasn't seen that son in a decade, he passed away 11 years ago.Do watch this movie, it will hit you like a brick wall if you are just getting about dementia and will knock you out cold if you have a relative with the same condition."
THE FATHER,5 July 2021,10/10,"It was a risk seeing it. My mother died of dementia, and attempted to be her main carer for several years. I empathised with Ann's grief, the constant need for her to be there, and the denial that any help was needed. When Anthony looked out of the window, and watched the boy playing, I saw my mother latterly still looking at children with delight. The confusion, mood swings, paranoia, bitterness and bizarre behaviour was so brilliantly conveyed by 'Anthony'. So real.The obsession with time... How did he manage to convey the emptiness in his eyes? So glad to have seen such an incredible film. It will stay with me, but in a positive way. G."
THE FATHER,29 April 2021,10/10,"I've never cried so hard while watching a movie. Anthony Hopkins has always been my favourite actor, but this movie will leave a lasting impact on me. One of the best movies ever made. Hats off."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,Best film I have ever seen. Absolutely deserved the Oscar for Anthony Hopkins!
THE FATHER,1 May 2021,1/10,"I'am sorry, I have to give this movie little rating, because it has too big. This movie should be rated 6/10, then I wouldn't even bother with this movie. It is boooring! Of course it is confusing when it is from perspective of person who has dementia. Such a bad concept. Man, I want my 97 minutes back! I have a headache."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,10/10,"I am working with people struggle with all kinds of dementia 15 years. Watching this movie was like another hard day at my work. I am glad if someone decided created movie like The Father. I have hope more people will understanding have difficult but wonderful work we provided every day. Is hard for the patient, for staff and for families.Thank You so much. Congratulation to Sir Anthony."
THE FATHER,7 May 2021,9/10,"As someone who had to deal with his grandfather having dementia in his final stages of life, the depiction of Anthony Hopkins felt truly real and moving for me. This movie will help you understand better this disease and what people go through when their mind start to deteriorate.His winning at the Oscars was totally deserved, this was one the greatest performances in his career."
THE FATHER,17 May 2021,10/10,The movie shows you the suffering of Alzheimer's. From the sick perspective.
THE FATHER,23 May 2021,10/10,BEST BEST BEST. Made me cry so hard! Anthony Hopkins is the Best actor of all time.
THE FATHER,14 June 2021,10/10,"Looking at the trailer before I watched the movie, I knew it was going to be good. I just didn't expect it to be that good! Loved every single minute of the movie. Can't wait to watch it again."
THE FATHER,12 June 2021,10/10,"I was drawn to see this film having memory issues of my own, and with an octogenarian parent living with us. It was for me a most uncomfortable experience requiring a stiff drink afterwards to quell a strong sense of foreboding. There were only 4 or 5 couples in the cinema but all were silent through the final credits, remaining sitting as if not knowing what to do next. Highly recommended but not if you are over 80."
THE FATHER,13 June 2021,10/10,"I hesitated watching this. My dad (and I, by extension) have been living THE FATHER for a few years now. Our lives intersected that of Olivia Colman, Anthony Hopkins and Rufus Sewell. The confusion, misplacing of everyday items, immense sadness over the unfairness of the condition, Dad's insistence of events that hadn't occurred, helplessness and depression from the helplessness that was felt- we've lived it! Did I really need to see this in a movie? YES. It was cathartic. It was necessary. How Anthony and Olivia conveyed the emotional turmoil that we had experienced(and continue to) was what I needed more than I realized. I hadn't yet cried out my frustrations and heartbreak- until this evening. Beautiful movie."
THE FATHER,18 June 2021,10/10,"I'd had a particularly bad day visiting my Dad and wasn't really in the mood to go to the cinema let alone see this film. My defences were up before we'd got through the adverts.To start with I thought that this was OK but not brilliant. But the combination of a strong cast and equally strong script soon drew me in.By the time you realise what's going on, you are totally consumed in the nightmare.Some of the dialogue and mannerisms could have been my own dad earlier that same dayThis is a hard watch for anyone who has family with dementia. And as others have said will stay with me for a whileWas it brilliant. Yes. Would I want to see it again....have a feeling I will but not yet."
THE FATHER,17 July 2021,10/10,This will hunt me for a while... Devastating thing that already took so many great people...
THE FATHER,24 July 2021,10/10,I never weeped in my life like this before. Such a very authentic heavy drama. Like seeing the absolutele difficult day to day life from an Alzheimer's patient. Best drama.
THE FATHER,25 July 2021,9/10,"Hopkins is an extraordinary talent. It's great to see him in this complex character. Undoubtedly, this movie is unforgettable for me."
THE FATHER,16 August 2021,1/10,"Just because the acting was good doesn't mean the movie was. It was the most boring thing I've ever endured in my entire life. That includes my 83-year-old mother and my 65-year-old brother watching it with me, we were all falling asleep. I cannot understand how this accumulated so many high ratings."
THE FATHER,18 September 2021,8/10,The film was so well done you could easily forget it was a film and get lost in the personal hell along with Anthony. Truly a Titan in the acting world and he earned that Oscar for his performance.
THE FATHER,31 August 2021,10/10,"All the movie I was just crying!The best movie that I've ever seen, I recommend everyone watching it."
THE FATHER,11 September 2021,8/10,"The Father looks at the subject many families face each day. Heartbreaking to watch at times, but the compassion is there, if you look. Sir Anthony deserves an award for his portrayal of the main subject in this movie!! Enjoyable acting by the entire cast."
THE FATHER,24 September 2021,10/10,"When the Doctor ask Antony when was his birthday? Antony says its 31 December 1937, the exact date which Anthony Hopkins was born.No wonder because the script and line was written for anthony himself."
THE FATHER,26 September 2021,10/10,"Knowing family like this you suddenly see it from a different perspective
Very cleverly you are in their position
A film you will never forget."
THE FATHER,23 October 2021,10/10,"A movie that makes you think of yourself, your parents and your kids at the same time,
And if you were lucky you will remember your grand father...A movie that am afraid to recommend to my parents, as much as i want them to watch the miracle of Anthony Hopkins performance yet am afraid of its affect on their emotions...Its just one of the best movies i ever watched."
THE FATHER,13 November 2021,10/10,"Very emotional, moving, and well made as directed movie played by the Phenomenal actress Anthony Hopkins.No dry eye left in the cinema hall, Wonderful!!!"
THE FATHER,9 April 2021,9/10,"A closely observed and compelling journey into dementia which manipulates time and place in order to express the anxiety of the sufferer(s).The closing scene's beauty is matched by its tragedy, and it left me stunned. Unmissable."
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,10/10,Anthony Hopkins is finished the acts on the big screen by his role in this movie. It is as usual performed by the lonely Anthony made me crying.He must have the Oscar this year.
THE FATHER,18 May 2021,9/10,"It's one of the most impressive movies I've seen. Fading out from life could not be better described. Also, words are not enough to describe Anthony Hopkins' outstanding performance. This movie can also be played as a theater, its single place form and character transitions are very suitable for this."
THE FATHER,2 September 2021,9/10,"I was on my flight to Burbank Airport while watching this. I usually don't watch films like this and did not know what I was getting into.But I was pleasantly surprised I really liked to see the inside of this terrible disease Alzheimers. In a way I think it can prepare you for what might come to some or prepare you to research as much as possible to prevent it.Anthony really played his part so well. The look of confusion on his face and his beats he took, stumbles on words was so true! And the last few minutes really had me in tears.I recommend this highly.Oh I also loved the fact it was just shot at their home and then a small bit at another location for the end."
THE FATHER,15 March 2021,6/10,"As a 77 year-old man, I found this film to be the most depressing, scariest film I've ever seen; rivals 1951's The Thing From Another world, when I ran out of the theatre."
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,9/10,"Really really good.Love the way the film narrates and confuses you, but in a good way."
THE FATHER,11 April 2021,8/10,Inception but not si-fi. Great acting. Looking forward to more Florian Zeller directing.
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,1/10,"I was debating whether to rate this movie 1 or 8. It's certainly really touching and disturbing. Anthony Hopkins is great. But why shoot a movie about a decease? It's kind of like having a movie about a patient with a progressive cancer. Dementia is a decease, so is cancer, and other serious illnesses. What's the idea of dedicating a movie to show the agonizing effects of a decease?"
THE FATHER,2 October 2021,10/10,"This has everything except car chases, zombies and the other ridiculous special effects of modern cinema. This film feels Shakespearean and epic in its profound emotional appeal and comment on the human condition. I was scared, hopeful and sad and very, very confused - in one word, my emotions were running the gamut and I was hooked. At the end I cried like a baby :). And - I love you, Sir Anthony!"
THE FATHER,4 May 2021,10/10,"Incredible performances, it's just a new level of acting not seen before. Leaves you speechless and in tears. Hopkins is a true genius. The cast, music, script, shooting, ... just ... wow."
THE FATHER,30 April 2021,10/10,"The Father will leave you feeling melancholy and hopeful at the same time. Whilst the story is heartbreaking, the love, grief and compassion Olivia Coleman's character radiates through the movie depicts perfectly the real struggles of dealing with dementia. This in combination with an outstanding performance by Anthony Hopkins gives life and depth to an otherwise simple plot line. As an audience the rug is constantly swept from under your feet, Florian Zeller constantly subverts your expectations and brings you into Anthony's world - Simply Brilliant!"
THE FATHER,8 May 2021,7/10,"I had been waiting to watch a 'good', well made movie for quite a while now in this lockdown era. But, most movies which have been releasing lacked something or the other. The Father has had last fulfiled that desire and I recommend everyone to watch it."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,10/10,"I didn't cry for years even in my worst days even in the most tragic moments nothing could make me cry. Anthony Hopkins did, that's it that's my review."
THE FATHER,5 May 2021,10/10,"This one hit me soo hard. What a performance by the Legend Anthony Hopkins. Old age is the last phase of one's life and one cannot but deny that fact that they become little children again. This movie is soo well depicted and thought off and especially shows the puny life of old people in the Western Countries...What class acting and direction. As much as I loved the movie, I doubt I will have the heart to watch it again. Thats how good Hopkins was...Especially the last scenes where he asks for his Mommy..."
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,10/10,"I saw this film and thought about my family's experience and my grandmother. She had Alzheimer's and almost the same story. An aunt took care of her until she passed away. In the movie they didn't capture the full progression, at the end of my grandmother's days she forgot how to move and how to swallow and she was intubated so she could stay alive. I feel like I owe a great debt to my aunt, she gave up her job to stay with my grandmother full time.As for me, I am very sad and emotional after seeing this movie. I moved to another country just before she died, I had a special relationship with her, I was her first grandson and lived with her when I was little, she spoiled me and I was very dear to her. I loved her and I really miss her. The weird thing is that in my mind her funeral was the day I read about her illness, I hugged her and wept, she was so confused and kept asking what was going on my son."
THE FATHER,16 April 2021,10/10,"Compelling and wonderfully acted film, which evokes questions and emotions you won't be able to shake of. Anthony Hopkins is completely outstanding."
THE FATHER,27 May 2021,9/10,"I watched this on the eve of my 60th birthday. Dementia is something that has an increasing presence in day to day life and particularly when you are approaching my age!It was so interesting to see the view from the ""other side"" which really made this film amazing to watch. I shall watch it again because that will increase my understanding of the whole situation."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,10/10,To walk through what they experience is a eye opener.
THE FATHER,20 March 2021,9/10,"And then you get Anthony Hopkins in THE FATHER. This is a devastatingly, heartbreakingly-brilliant performance and a great film. Hopkins' range is incredible. He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It's a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's play). It's a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins' character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist's gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he's one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned. If you've ever been touched by the tragedy of dementia, this film could wreck you."
THE FATHER,15 July 2021,5/10,"Clearly a powerhouse performance from AH, but the film itself felt thin. As a study of dementia, it certainly disorients but it just felt monotone and boring. Where was the plot that is driven by the core story device of dementia."
THE FATHER,23 April 2021,10/10,For Best Movie and the Actor..along with the screenplay! A masterpiece.
THE FATHER,3 February 2021,9/10,"Anthony Hopkins portrays in a fantastic way how life erodes, piece by piece, when dementia takes over an old man's life.
Olivia Coleman, who plays his daughter, shows with greatness how painful and sad it is to see her loved father slowly disappear into the fog.
The film really grabbed me and tore my heart apart."
THE FATHER,22 September 2021,10/10,Anthony Hopkins's performance was stunning. This movie shows you some facts about life and it does it in very touching way.
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,10/10,Do the right thing Academy! There's plenty of other ways to honor Chadwick Boseman. Don't let wokeness prevail over merit and common sense! Sir Anthony Hopkins gave the best performance of the past 40 years in Lead Actor. Do the right thing!!
THE FATHER,7 October 2021,,Stupid Paul is the worst.I've never been so afraid to get old in my life and wind up never leaving my flat but then find out I've never been there.
THE FATHER,23 May 2021,9/10,"Absolute incredible movie and, mainly, an marvelous acting by Anthony Hopkins. A truly Oscar winning performance."
THE FATHER,13 August 2021,10/10,"I'm totally lost for words! There's no words in the world can describe this masterpiece, Anthony Hopkins acting skills in this movie is beyond human capabilities, something never ever seen before.But beware, this movie is an emotional bomb that will leave you devastated and some scenes in this movie will hunt you till the last day of your life, so better don't watch it, and I mean it!"
THE FATHER,16 July 2021,3/10,"Sure Anthony Hopkins does a great acting job here, however the story telling technique felt cheaply manipulative. At the end I felt more angry than appreciative at having been led down this path. I would have been better off watching a documentary about the horrors of progressive dementia."
THE FATHER,9 May 2021,10/10,"An amazing performance,they touch my heart so deep."
THE FATHER,16 May 2021,9/10,"Very sad, but vey beutiful and interesting movie.I recommend it to everyone."
THE FATHER,28 May 2021,10/10,"This film remind me a lot of Providence by Alain Reisnais, with John Gielgud, as an old and lonely writer, and all his fantasms about his family.I would say, and, believe me, it is great compliment, this film could have been directed by Alain Reisnais.A great film !"
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,This movie is so touching I can't control my tears. I miss my father so much I even wish I never miss a single day away from him.
THE FATHER,8 April 2021,10/10,This is the most haunting film I have ever seen. Brilliant performance by Anthony Hopkins 👏 bravo! It made me understand about the disease and how it can affect noy only the person but the family and one's around. It's a must see.
THE FATHER,26 March 2021,10/10,The movie is very wonderful ... even he cried ... my father is the same age as Anthony ... but he does not suffer from dementia except from some forgetfulness ... Thanks to God for that.
THE FATHER,6 April 2021,10/10,"As a young 19-year-old, I have never been as scared of getting old and getting sick with dementia as I was after watching this movie. It's a beautiful and horrifying portrayal of how dementia affects the family and the patient."
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,1/10,"This film will kill you slowly, dull and boring.Don't waste your time, do something fun."
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,9/10,"Simply i thought this movie was amazing. The way it shows the mind of those people who go through this problem, even I who was watching I spent almost the whole movie confused, until in the end I realized the reason for the confusion in the chronology of history. Great performance by Anthony Hopkins."
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,10/10,"The Father is practically a psychological horror movie, depicting the decaying psyche of an old man, battered by dementia. As for movies, The Father is one to never forget."
THE FATHER,31 March 2021,10/10,"Usually, I just enjoy reading reviews . But this time I feel the necessity to give an acknowldgement to what I had already seen.Last year when I saw Joaquin's performance I said that probably there's not gonna be such good acting in the few five or ten years. But I was completely wrong. Normally when I see a movie it occurs to me that it's just acting but in this time I was not able to picture it.This year again I will hold my seat and wait for Sir Hopkins to be awarded The Oscar for the best male performance in leading role. This would be my happiest moment."
THE FATHER,14 April 2021,10/10,Truly sad and also terrifying to watch. Shows the perspective of the person with dementia. Hopkins is such an amazing actor.
THE FATHER,28 March 2021,,Impressive performance .Hard reality.Hope i can always stay sane in this chaotic world.
THE FATHER,17 September 2021,8/10,"That is some really cool movie! And I'm just writing this so I can get some features from IMDB. So, sorry if this is not useful. I promise write something better next time. I'm kind of in a hurry. The movie is really cool though."
THE FATHER,20 May 2021,10/10,"All the scenes Anthony do memories me back for my father how he confius where he is, Always ask what time now.. Ask where he mother and cry, arrogant,sometimes talk with nobody,caring and full of suprise like my father..Now I'm released exactly how very2 difficult on side of my father..make me feel so sad 😭..When I'm See Anthony Make me feel so sad for my father when he life.I'm always ask myself if I do all the best to my father when he life?..But what I can say the movie feel real life for me with my father.Thank you for Anthony hopskin with a very2 good acting.."
THE FATHER,5 June 2021,10/10,This movie had my eyes filled with tears.. My grandpa suffered with the same disease and I've seen all this happening to him as well. Beautifully shown how it feels like to be in their shoes. And it makes me cry even more. Great one.
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,"You can't stop thinking of this after it ends, the performance the music everything is perfect,Anthony Hopkins you're an icon."
THE FATHER,11 May 2021,3/10,"Stupid mistake
When a man reaches the Alzheimer's and ""dementia"" due to his old age!How can He calls his mother, then speaks philosophy! Dementia and hilosophy ,,, strange
The best was for him to only call his mother, which is normal given the age of an old man, such as a child
Maybe the idea has cleared up."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,9/10,"The Silence of The Lambs, Fracture, Hitchcock, and The Elephant Man were all amazing performances by Hopkins but The Father is the only film of these that truly makes you forget your watching a movie. The fear, confusion, frustration, depression, anger, and brief lucidity experienced by dementia sufferers is something many of have seen, but even for those who haven't, his performance is so convincing it throws you into the middle of what a child experiences when their parent is battling the disease. There is nothing like this film. Watch it now."
THE FATHER,10 May 2021,8/10,It had been a long time since a movie has affected me this much.
THE FATHER,12 April 2021,9/10,This movie does a good job of showing the many heartbreaking moments of living with dementia.
THE FATHER,15 March 2021,9/10,Wow. Anthony Hopkins is magnificent aa a man with dementia. Although most films we see deal with it from a family point of view this time we see it from the victims point. Bring your kleenex and keep it handy.
THE FATHER,10 August 2021,10/10,On the point ! Crispy but a slow poison !It takes us into a emotional roller coaster !Laughter ! Confusion ! Bored ! Saddened !Tearfull ! Anger ! Peace.
THE FATHER,4 April 2021,9/10,For Anthony Hopkins performance I can watch this movie 100 times..
THE FATHER,25 April 2021,9/10,Dementia portraid like never before. And a soberb Anthony Hopkins.
THE FATHER,30 March 2021,10/10,"I recommend this movie, without a doubt the best movie I've ever seen in my life, last scene so emotional."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,In contradictory to the man as a father everything else as an actor is Antony Hopkins. It is absolutely an Oscar winning movie!!
THE FATHER,9 June 2021,10/10,"Having both grandfather and grandmother struggle with this horrible thing I found it incredibly insightful and compelling. I found it humours, serious and at times saddening, I would recommend this to anyone."
THE FATHER,6 May 2021,10/10,"I have never seen something like this before. It's a beautifully made movie about Alzheimer, aging and family. Sir Anthony Hopkins deserved the Oscar."
THE FATHER,27 March 2021,10/10,They should show this movie in schools all over. Masterclass acting by A. Hopkins.
THE FATHER,7 August 2021,9/10,"Watching this masterpiece have brought me a whole new experience about old people's life and difficulties, especially those who are suffering from Alzheimer. All the faces and locations have all been mixed up. Time line was not linear or even back and forth."
THE FATHER,22 May 2021,9/10,This film made me feel the pain of Anthony. That is one of the best film I ever seen.
THE FATHER,19 April 2021,10/10,"What a mesmerizing piece by a brilliant actor like Anthony Hopkins. It's film making at it's best. When you think he can't give anymore, he surprises you with world class acting like never seen before.. this is by far the most beautiful piece by this brilliant actor.. with one location and 5 supporting actors and actresses.It will leave you shocked, speechless, full of pain and satisfaction. If this the last Film for Anthony Hopkins.. it's easily the best last dance for any actor that can dream of."
THE FATHER,29 March 2021,10/10,"Anthony Hopkins cannot go further than this performance, a masterpiece."
THE FATHER,21 November 2021,5/10,"OK we all know the actors here are fantastic. That said, what the hell was the point? Dementia is bad? Thanks for that news flash. We get no sense of the arc of the character's lives. No real sense of connection to what is going on beyond a heightened sense of terror that we all might find ourselves in this condition. Also the $20 fee to watch this interminable cinematic root canal feels like a complete scam. Why is this the one movie I had to buy versus rent? What a waste of my life."
THE FATHER,24 April 2021,9/10,"Aging is a sin from some perspective. And when we're so confused and split from inside, it's really hard to say if there is an answer to that."
THE FATHER,17 April 2021,9/10,A brilliant depiction of the end of life. Anyone who sees this movie can relate. Very touching. Excellent acting.
THE FATHER,20 July 2021,9/10,"I'm confused just like the first character....i have no idea about what happened, it's like i am losing my leaves,too.It makes you to live their life and see from their perspective...
p.s: that's a good movie don't miss it."
