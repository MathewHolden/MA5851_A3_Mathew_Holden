GREEN BOOK,10 December 2019,8/10,"My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,7/10,"It's 1962 New York City. ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2019,10/10,"I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film."
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2020,,"Maybe, it is the greatest Christmas movie. For the clear define of the meanings of Nativity. The storytelling and the performances are the basic pillars . But the film has the virtue to have the viewer as part of it. In simple and convincing manner. So, a great film , in all the seanse."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,6/10,"""Green Book"" is an American movie from 2018 and one of the big players this awards season. So it surprises me a bit that with all the attention it racked up, this film ""only"" managed five Oscar nominations. Still, it may still be in second position for the Best Picture win (behind Roma) after its massive success at the Golden Globes. And it has Mahershala Ali pretty much safe winning his second Oscar (who'd have thought five years ago) while also being more than an underdog to add another for its screenplay. The man in charge there when it came to adapting this over 2-hour movie was Peter Farrelly and he is also the director. Among others, Farrelly got help with the script from Nick Vallelonga and if you paid only a bit attention during the movie, then you will recognize immediately the last name. Yep he is Tony Lip's son and it is pretty fitting that not just his father appeared in several mob-related movies that are deemed classics today.Anyway, lets not talk about these now, but about this one here. Who would have guessed that the director of Something about Mary and Dumb & Dumber would come up with a movie like this? Actually, if you take a closer look, it is not a huge surprise because the critical reception here has not been as one-sided as you may guess. The subject sure comes in handy for Hollywood these days with the diversity issue still going strong, probably not as strong as at its peak, but still. Yes sometimes, it may seem a bit shallow honestly and I would not put the film anywhere near my favorites of the year, but there are also many good aspects. First of all, it flew by and for a film considerably over 2 hours, that is always a success. Then there's the acting. Everybody really does a good job here and that includes most of all lead actors Mortensen and Ali. Yes, lead actors. There is no way Mahershala Ali is a supporting player. What a ridiculous idea. No story without him, no journey throughout the States, no messages about racism. The film would not have existed without him just like it would not have existed without Mortensen's character. Actually, this is a pretty poor decision and going strongly against everything the film teaches us by putting the Black character in second row and it is even more disappointing to see the Academy really falling for it, most of all because of the character's background and story, but also because of the massive screen time honestly.Okay, what else was good? Individual scenes. You will recognize them when you see them. One would be when the two recognize immediately how their humor is really different early on. I am talking about the salt joke and the Pittsburgh boobies joke here. One of many fairly funny moments too that are not lacking despite the serious background like everything about the letters. Another would be whom the Black protagonist calls from jail and how Mortensen's character is completely stunned. This is a scene that while it works nicely from the comedy perspective is also fairly crucial drama-wise as Ali explains in the car. Another entertaining scene was the KFC one when we really see the two bonding and joking for the first time. It is also a good scene with a look at perhaps the most intriguing issue of this movie: namely Ali's character being too white for his own and too black for the high society that enjoys his music. He is scared of doing what Black people do. He knows less about Black music than his Italian lower class driver and he eats no food that Blacks usually eat. Instead he drinks a fine wine on his own. To avoid having to play a ballgame with other Blacks, he lies that he has a meeting with someone and leaves. He sure belongs nowhere and this story line is where the film really delivers.And opposing who Ali's character is and isn't, there is Mortensen, who faces a very slightly similar fate with being part of the dominating race, but really just at the bottom end of the food chain beating people up for money and making ends meet. He is a simple guy, but a good guy in fact. Do not mistake the fact of what he throws away early on because it was used by Blacks for him being a racist. It is more the general movement that made him do so, what society was like in the 60s back then and also what his buddies were like and these sure do include a handful racists. Had he been really racist, he would not have accepted the job as a driver. The fact that he refuses to clean his boss' shoes has not anything to do with racism either, just with him not wanting to be humiliated in any way. This also becomes obvious in the luggage packing scene where he won't be anybody's servant or butler, just the driver and man who solves problems his very own way. Now as for the police, they sure don't get away in a likable manner here and the final police officer scene with the one not minding the man's color during Christmas time cannot really save it and feels for the sake of it. But good inclusions nonetheless, even if the scene at the indoor swimming pool was not the best, actually the worst probably. An indicator at homosexuality that I don't mind, but it really did feel rushed in and there are no further elaborations. On the contrary, we find out he was married before, so was this one reason why it failed? It is not too important eventually and should have been left out in my opinion.Of course, another good aspect here is that the film is really linked to actually existing people that did share a lifelong friendship following their journey together as we find out right before the closing credits roll in. Overall, a good and interesting movie with a right now obviously very appealing subject to liberal Hollywood. I think this one's worth watching for the two lead performances alone and the pretty nice chemistry they had and who would have thought Mortensen can pull off Italian this well. I don't think many actors would have been as good and gotten the Oscar nomination here being next to a far showier and baitier character (Ali's), but proves again that Mortensen is probably still the number one actor from Scandinavia (well he's American, but has roots there) in 2020, even if I personally like Mikkelsen at least as much. Drifting away now from this film, so it is time to end this review. I give Green Book the expected thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Not an overly enthusiastic one though."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,6/10,"Green Book is really an updated version of Driving Miss Daisy directed by Peter Farrelly.Based on true events and set in 1962. Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) is a mouthy nightclub bounce from the Bronx. He is out of a job as the nightclub is going through renovations.Tony has been recommended to be a driver and bodyguard to erudite black piano player Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali.)Dr Don is going on a pre Christmas tour of the deep south. Tony will drive him to the venues with the help of the Green Book, a guide book for black travellers. That will tell him the roads a black man can take, the motels a black man can stay in.The relationship between the two men is like the odd couple. Dr Don is fastidious. Tony is a slob and easily gets into fights, he is also a racist at first.Both men bond as they hit the road, experiencing constant discrimination.It is a well acted film with a regal turn from Ali. There is comedy and the film gets a little gloomier as it heads deeper to the south.The racism is anesthetized to make it palatable for modern audiences. In reality a black man being chauffeur driven by a white man in the deep south would had been odd and more dangerous.I did feel the film is a little too glib and superficial. It has an ending which is a little too neat.I doubt for a moment that even today, those backwood roads in the deep south are safe for some black travellers."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,9/10,"In 1962, the Italian-American Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is as family man happily married with children with his beloved wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini). When the night-club Copacabana where he works as a bouncer closes for two months to be refurbished, Tony needs to find a two-month job to support his family. He accepts to become the driver of the classical Afro-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in a tour with two other Caucasian musicians through the racist South of America. He receives a Green Book, a travel guide with references of safe locations to black people and along their journey, they develop friendship and respect for each other.The Oscar winner ""Green Book"" is a great film that discloses the racial segregation in the early 60´s in America. The touching story of friendship and injustice has magnificent performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The screenplay blends drama, music and comedy and is based on a true story. ""Green Book"" is a film that really deserves the Oscar. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Green Book: O Guia"" (""Green Book: The Guide"")"
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,8/10,"Tony Vallelonga aka Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is the bouncer at the Copacabana. When it is shut down for renovations, Tony hustles to feed his family. He is offered a lucrative job to be the driver and gofer for Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) a trained classical pianist. His tour will take him through the racially divided south in 1962. This is a story about an odd couple who both managed to change and find common ground.Based on a true story, although I doubt the initial scene of the baseball game as the film gave the impression it was later in the year. Predictable Hollywood script. The title comes from the title of a travel book used by African-Americans to learn about safe places to eat and stay.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2021,10/10,"Not often these days so I give ten stars to a film, with Green Book however, I had no other choice, this film had me totally captivated.It's a fascinating story, I had no idea that it was based on true events, temporarily losing his job at a club, Tony Lip Vallelonga gets a job driving for Doctor Don Shirley. Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10."
GREEN BOOK,11 May 2019,9/10,"It is difficult to make a movie based on a true story, with characters that existed, that has to walk a fine line when it comes to racism, the history of America and not making them too unlikeable, but also finding the middle, so there is still enough tension between the pair we are about to go on a journey with - and overall the movie succeeded.There are certainly things that did not work or might seem like an omission - Viggos character shows a despise, a darker shade to him at the beginning, that does not really seem to come up later. And then there is the meeting - which is cleverly orchastrated but we never really understand why it continues from there. But not everything needs to be explained. Unless that takes something away from your movie watching experience.Script is tight and the actors are really getting it on good. And there is still enough drama to go around. You will laugh, you may cry a little (or a lot) and overall you will see a great movie. All cynicism aside, this very well made (did not look into how close this is to what actually happened, you may research that on your own, if you like)"
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,9/10,"In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart."
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,6/10,"I saw the trailer for this movie a couple of times before its release, it looked exactly like the sort of thing that would do well during the upcoming Awards Season, and it sounded very interesting after reading more about it, so I looked for to it, from Golden Globe nominated director Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Based on the true story, in New York City, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) works as a bouncer at a nightclub, the place is closed down for renovations, so he seeks new employment. He is invited for an interview with Doctor ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Mahershala Ali), a black pianist who had Tony suggested to him, he is looking for a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Mid-West and Deep South. Based on the strength of his references, Don hires Tony, they embark with plans to return to New York on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for black travellers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve black people. The tour begins in the Midwest before they eventually head further south. Don and Tony initially clash, with Tony uncomfortable being made to act refined, and Don being disgusted with Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, he also becomes increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment the musician receives from event hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. One night, Don's life is threatened by a group of white men in a bar, Tony rescues him and instructs Don he should not go anywhere without him for the rest of the tour. Before leaving, Tony's wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) desired him to write her letters, to let her know what he is up to, and express his feelings for her. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her, while Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that his professional life and achievements are stopping him. Don is caught in a gay encounter with a white man, Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest, which upsets Don, as he feels that he is ""rewarding"" them for their treatment. Later, Don and Tony are arrested after being pulled over by a police officer in an all-white town and Tony punches him after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, rather than using his call to contact his ""lawyer"", Don uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who orders the governor to release them. Tony is amazed by the experience, while Don is humiliated, this leads to an argument between them. Having reached his breaking point, Don tells Tony that his fame prevents him from identifying with people of his race, while his race prevents him from being accepted by white people, and his homosexuality from being accepted by anybody, making him feel truly lonely. The night of his final performance in Birmingham, Alabama, Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the country club venue he is performing at. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play, so Tony takes Don to dinner at a predominantly black blues club, listed in the Green Book, where Don plays on the stage piano and rouses the crowd with his music. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve, Tony gets tired during a snowstorm, so Don takes over driving duty, and they make it in time for Tony's family dinner. Don later returns to Tony's apartment, Tony invites him in, there is a brief silence from everyone, but he is welcomes and thanked by Tony's wife for helping him write his letters. Also starring Don Stark as Jules Podell, Sebastian Maniscalco as Johnny Venere, Dimiter D. Marinov as Oleg and Mike Hatton as George. Mortensen is likeable as the amusing Italian-American rough diamond who slowly has his attitudes changed, but not his manners, but Ali almost steals the show as the talented African-American pianist who struggles during the time of segregation and has standards, together Mortensen and Ali are a wonderful odd-couple on the road. The style of the story is very similar to Driving Miss Daisy, with the chauffeur forming an unlikely friendship with his passenger, the scenes of piano playing and concerts are also likeable, this film really makes you realise the severe nature of the treatment of black people during the 1960s, but it leaves enough room to make you laugh and have well-meaning and touching scenes, it all adds up to a satisfying crowd-pleasing biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Good!"
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. This movie recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Ali won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The lead role is Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, a New York bouncer of Italian descent. His club is closing for the last two months of 1962 and he is recommended as the driver for a black musician, a pianist, who is going on a tour, a series of performances, in various Deep South locations.Mahershala Ali is in the role of Dr. Donald Shirley, who was a real jazz and concert pianist who over his career played in many high-profile venues. In 1962 he has planned this musical trip to hopefully change some perceptions about black musicians. Having a tough bodyguard as a driver will help insure his safety.The title is a reference to a book which is a guide to where blacks can eat or sleep in southern locations, in 1962 the Deep South was mostly still segregated, blacks could not stay or eat and many locations.As the writer, one of Tony Lip's sons, reveals, the story is only regarding that particular trip and he says the input comes from Ali himself some years earlier, and of course his dad. It is a story of how two men from greatly different backgrounds and world views became friends. Ironically both men died in 2013.Good movie."
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,10/10,"This film was inspired by the true story of Tony the Lip Villelonga, An Italian-American bouncer (Mortenson) from the Bronx who gets a job driving a black. highly educated and cultured musician (Ali) through the south in 1962.Really a must-see film for the performances of everyone involved, for a good look at what it was like for blacks in the south, an amazing look at Bronx Italian life, and some great music.The title refers to ""The Negro Motorist Green Book,"" which advised African-Americans traveling where they could eat and stay.The real Tony the Lip, by the way, played Carmine in The Sopranos. And great to see my favorite comedian, Maniscalco, in a movie role as Mrs. Villelonga's brother.Funny, warm, poignant, delightful film with wonderful characters - perfect for the holidays. Don't miss it.The title and subject matter are a reference to ""The Negro Motorist Green Book,"" also known as ""The Negro Travelers' Green Book."" Published from 1936-1966, the guide helped African-American travelers find lodging, restaurants, and other businesses that would serve them. It eventually covered most of North America, plus Bermuda and the Caribbean.Funny, warm, and poignant film with wonderful characters - perfect for the holidays. Don't miss it."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,4/10,"So, let me get up on the soap box here for just a second ::steps up, clears throat::It may be because I have inhaled as much of the non-fiction of James Baldwin the past two years, or that I have simply paid halfway attention to whats going on in this part of this decade, or that I live in the general area that Tony Lips did (the tri-state area in the North-East), but I think Green Book underestimates the racism of the North at the time. It's often been a misconception, usually by white people (and maybe at one time when I was much younger), but just because you live in the North and around liberal areas doesn't mean that things are less racist.Indeed, it's that more subdued racism (what MLK dubbed those ""white moderates"") that make a lot of trouble. From socio-economic segregation of a sort - notice that in the Bronx neighborhood Tony's family and friends live there are no black people, and the ""No Coloreds"" signs are not up but they're just... Not there, and not allowed. Not really, anyway.To the movie's credit, it does touch on the fact that there is this racism that is there with working-class Italians (not that it's any great revelation in American cinema - Do the Right Thing was made decades ago and dealt with Italian caricatures, literally making pizza, being face to face with African American people with much more insight and drama/comedy etc); there is one telling beat where Tony comes home as two black handymen are working on the Lips' family kitchen, and they're given some lemonade in two glasses. When they leave, Lips puts the two glasses in the trash (and later, Linda Cardellini's wife takes them back out). This is good visual storytelling that makes the point clear: once Lips gets tasked with the plot of Green Book, which is to drive the good Doctor (Mahershala Ali) across the mid-west and deep South, there will be problems but not just with those they come across.... But then it's kinda-sorta dropped for a ""feel-good"" movie about race relations.I don't know about you, but in 2018, living in just everything that's going on now (in daily news, a campus in Mississippi got vandalized with numerous nooses hung about for tomorrows Senate vote for example), I'm not sure if that's what we (white people, even more than blacks or other minorities) need to see. All this said, the movie does a good job, at least for the first two thirds, of getting an entertaining buddy story between these two Characters, with a capital ""C.""And to the actors' credit, Ali and Mortensen tap into the cliches of a, well, bouncer at the Coppacabana and classically trained PHD pianist (fluent in multiple languages, which does pay off at a key point by the way, nice writing), and whenever they are on screen I believed the actors in what they had to emote or tried to do. It's even got funny scenes and beats and lines, and while I can count the number of laughs (at least five, at most six), they are genuine laughs. Farrelly knows how to get two guys working together on screen - he's known since Dumb & Dumber - so that part is fine.But then there's that last third in particular when it hunkers down into hammering its message about race relations (if you've seen the trailer, that scene in the rain with ""if I'm not black enough and Im not white enough"" etc is a cringe-tastic as it seems) and the simple attitude that after two months Tony Lips is now way cooler and, more crucially at the end, all the rest of his friends and family there for Christmas Eve are magically okay now with the ::insert Italian slang word for racist epithet here:: coming to dinner. But this is all without any real work outside of a few goopy scenes where the good Doctor helps Tony write letters to Mrs. Lips (sorry I forget his real last name right now) so he must be awesome outside of the brilliant piano playing.The movie does go a ways to make Ali's character flawed too in some basic ways - as a musician on the road he's become a loner, estranged from a brother and divorced - and in one way that I don't think is meant to be seen as a flaw, but comes up as a ""huh"" bit where Tony has to get Doc out of a bind when he is... Caught in a gay moment with another man at the YMCA(?!) Okie dokie! So that also don't be a big deal since hes just Tony's boss and no judgment and we'll just leave his sexuality as something that doesn't get any more screen-time because RACISM needs to get the top shelf over homophobia and that entire grenade which... What was that??As far as the sort of if not feel good then *don't feel bad* kind of movie released by a big studio, it's not as tone deaf and potentially harmful as a Crash; it has more of the feel of a better(ish) thing that Stanley Kramer would have made (down to, if Poitier was around he would be ideal for this part): it doesn't shy from the issues, and on the contrary it tries to show what everybody (even the racists) know, which is segregation-by-law can't be sustainable.But when it comes to depicting more essential details about character, about really digging into Lips past his love for his wife and not being *that* bad because, hey, he turns down offers by the local mobsters for work even when he's down, right(?) it doesn't hold as much water. Should I wholly believe Lips wont throw out again glasses that happened to touch mouths of black working class workers, despite himself being working class, because he got Lessons in Life (and visa-versa he gives the Doctor some ""Street Life"" lessons)? Not sure that I do.Why the six star rating then? When it means to be simply well-acted and more character-driven entertainment, it works - not to mention the greatest product placement for KFC in cinema history - and I enjoyed seeing these two do the absolute best they could with what they had. It's a mild recommendation. But compared to what else you can see from this year - Blindspotting, Blackkklansman, Sorry to Bother You, to an extent The Hate U Give - it's weak tea.Thank you. ::steps off::"
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,9/10,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick. Nice surprise to hear it was mostly shot in Louisiana, where I live, even during a snow scene when it actually snowed in my state during December of '17! My friend and I really liked this one so that's a high recommendation!"
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,,"This film tells the story of two men, who are polar opposites of each other in every single way, going on a trip together.I find the story really incredible. It's touching, funny, disturbing and heartwarming all at the same time. It's a thought provoking film, yet entertaining at the same time."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,10/10,I really enjoyed this film. I've seen it twice now
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2019,8/10,"I really enjoyed this story of racism and double-standards that tugged at the very hypocritical heart of 1960s America. An initially hostile Viggo Mortensen is assigned as guide and bodyguard to the hugely talented Don Shirley as he and his quartet tour the still racially divided US Southern states. Mahershala Ali is formidable as the creative, and somewhat aloof musician, who naively sets off on the enterprise not quite prepared for the reactions he is to get - at times he is viewed as little better than a performing seal and is treated accordingly by his ""hosts"". The score is superb and the writing and photography a delight. Was it the best film, though? I sometimes think that much like with ""Moonlight"" and ""Call Me By Your Name"" the Academy is genuflecting to the fact that Hollywood has been so far behind the curve in reflecting the changes in society, that it now feels compelled to pat itself on the back at every opportunity just for catching up with cinema from the rest of the world. This is certainly a better film than the the other two I just mentioned, but will it still be a topic of conversation in five years...?"
GREEN BOOK,25 January 2019,8/10,"Like the man said you got seven basic plots; you get to plot eight you're back to one with maybe a little backspin. Back in 1987 Alfred Uhry wrote a Pulitzer prize-winning play called Driving Miss Daisy, it was a fine play and, when subsequently adapted for the screen, an equally fine film. Set in Atlanta, Ga, it featured a Black man working as a chauffeur to a White Jewish lady. Green Book features a White Italian-American chauffeuring a Black man through the Deep South. Similar stories, right? Well, maybe. Miss Daisy actually lived in Atlanta while Dr Shirley was merely touring whilst playing a series of one-night concerts. Actually the film is about two disparate individuals, chalk and cheese, initially antagonistic who learn to respect, admire, and bond with each other - now that IS a new plot. This is an exceptionally fine film boasting two exceptional performances and a fine supporting cast. Bring on the dvd."
GREEN BOOK,13 July 2019,8/10,"1962. A bigoted Italian-American bouncer, Tony Lip, gets the job of driving Dr Don Shirley, renowned African-American pianist, on his tour across the mid-West and South. The two could not be more different.I did not have high expectations for this movie. I knew it would be good, but figured it wouldn't cover any new ground. Moreover, it seemed like a reverse Driving Miss Daisy (not that DMD is a bad movie - quite the opposite - but that it had been done before).I needn't have worried. The outcome is fairly predictable, but that doesn't matter: the getting there is original, interesting, engaging, thought-provoking and great.Director Peter Farrelly sets the scene well and paces the movie to perfection. The characters of Tony Lip and Don Shirley are well drawn and developed, making for high engagement levels. You can see their views and characters evolve before your eyes, see the events that shape them and how these influence their future actions. There's also a decent smattering of humour to aid the engagement.Some great social commentary too, especially on racial attitudes of the day and on tolerance in general.Mahershala Ali got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Don Shirley, and well deserved the award. Great work too from Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, resulting in a Best Actor nomination (he ultimately lost out to Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody).The movie itself won the 2019 Best Picture Oscar.Great film."

From its silent movie days, when the unrequited loves of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA elicited many a tear from sensitive theater goers, to Frankenstein's Monster learning that little girls don't always float, to the Creature being hounded out of the cozy confines of that Black Lagoon, the lives of Universal's horror stars are a lot more difficult than those of ""Terry Howard's"" HUSTLE & FLOW street entrepreneurs. And what could be harder than the predicament facing ""Doc"" in GREEN BOOK? An alcoholic gay White Chopin-playing piano prodigy born with a Black body, Doc nevertheless insists upon drunkenly cruising Pale Face-only swimming pools after hours, on the prowl for short-term romantic partners. To ""up"" the horror quotient, Universal depicts Doc's Happy Hunting Grounds in the U.S. Deep South at the height of America's so-called ""Jim Crow"" Era.

Well-produced and acted true-life account of an odd coupling friendship in the form of Bronx-born tough guy Tony Lip (Mortensen, employing the 'dese,dem & dose' school of acting to the nth degree) hired as a driver for cosmopolitan concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (stalwart and pristine Ali) circa 1962 thru an 8 month tour thru the Deep South with the as expected tell-tale signs of the times (racism and classism to boot). Unlikely director Peter Farrelly surprises all in a turn of displaying his dramatic goods (sprinkled with enough humor to keep things even-keeled) with ample help from his two leads parrying and giving good with one another. While the seemingly easy to pigeonhole 'sex-change/role reversal DRIVING MISS DAISY' easily could've been the pitch, the screenplay by Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and Brian Hayes Currie gives enough depth in both characters and a fine arc-piece in the process."
GREEN BOOK,10 April 2019,3/10,"Just.....no.""Green Book"" is the kind of movie my mom likes, and trust me, that's not a compliment. It's for people who are willing to watch a movie about racism as long as the black character who's the victim of it is whiter than any of the white characters. It's for people who want to pat themselves on the back for being open to a ""serious"" movie that doesn't challenge a single belief or make them the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's for people who like music cues that tell them exactly what they're supposed to be feeling at every single moment. It's for people who think the answer to racial problems is for whites and blacks to compromise and find some middle ground where they can agree to overcome their differences, as if black people have any responsibility in the fact that they have been marginalized ever since the very first one set foot on American soil. No one who is the slightest bit tuned in to racial problems in contemporary America could possibly stomach this movie.Personally, I found it to be patronizing and damn near insulting. It consists of scene after scene of our black protagonist getting himself in trouble, only to be saved from the situation by the white guy. By the end, the white guy has taught him how to be more black and embrace his own culture, which in this movie is defined by liking fried chicken, listening to Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, and playing some funky piano. Oh but wait, defenders will say. The white guy learns something too, like how to be less racist and how to write really good love letters to his wife. In fact, the entire guys' racist family learns to not be racist by the end and welcomes the black guy to their Christmas dinner. They're just casually racist, you see, but not racist in ways that really matter. Barf.Seriously, this is the Sesame Street version of racism. In a year that gave us ""BlackkKlansman,"" ""Blindspotting,"" ""The Hate U Give,"" and ""Sorry to Bother You,"" all movies made by minorities about the black experience in America, it's pretty telling of where we are as culture right now that the race movie mainstream America glommed on to was this piece of feel-good hoo-hah. Mainstream America doesn't want to have its beliefs challenged, and it certainly doesn't want to be told it's part of the problem. Instead, it wants a hallmark movie that makes it feel good about itself.One thing saves ""Green Book"" from being an utter waste of time, and that is the performance of Viggo Mortensen.Grade: D"
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,7/10,"... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also
shows how simplistic it really is."
GREEN BOOK,16 November 2018,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. The titular ""Green Book"" (not the official book title) was a travel guide highlighting safe places for African Americans to stay, eat and visit from the 1930's through the mid 1960's. Yes, it was a real publication and yes, there was a real need for it during the Jim Crow era. The book makes for a nice movie title, but this sterling dramedy from director Peter Farrelly focuses more on the budding friendship of two men from vastly different worlds separated by a few city blocks.Mr. Farrelly is one-half of the infamous Farrelly Brothers who have directed such raunchy comedy hits as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (1998) and DUMB AND DUMBER (1994). This is quite the change of pace for him, as it is for co-stars Mahershala Ali (Oscar winner last year for MOONLIGHT) and heavy drama stalwart Viggo Mortensen. We see a crisp blend of the era's harsh racism and the inherent comedy of a buddy road trip featuring a working class NYC Italian-American and an upper crust, well-educated, world class African-American pianist.The film kicks off in 1962 at the Copacabana, a mob-controlled club where Frank Anthony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (a beefed up Mortensen) gives us an up-close look at his bouncer skills. He's quite good at his job. When the club closes for renovation, he takes a job as a chauffeur/bodyguard for Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), who is beginning an 8 week tour as the featured player in a jazz trio through the Midwest and Deep South. Tony Lip is a walking Italian cliché, while Dr Shirley is a regal black man ... in fact, he might view himself as royalty - living alone in a swank apartment above Carnegie Hall. This is a good time to note that Tony Lip's son Nick Vallelonga co-wrote the script, is a producer on the film, and even makes an appearance as a State Trooper.Inspired by the true story of this trip and the lifelong friendship that ensued, we get to know both men as they get to know each other. Tony Lip is a streetwise man who is comfortable with his lot in life, while Dr. Shirley plays his role in society while quietly stewing internally. He flashes his toothy grin to disarm the adoring white audiences, but then sucks down his Cutty Sark in the evening, as he is good enough to perform for them, but not good enough to dine with them (or even use their restroom). There are times the racism gets violent and that's where Tony Lip comes in.Don helps Tony write romantic and intimate letters to his wife Dolores (played by Linda Cardellini), while Tony teaches Don about KFC and Little Richard ... proclaiming ""I'm blacker than you!"" in one of the film's funniest moments. It's an awkward buddy film that in real life developed into a decades-long friendship - one that only ended when both died in 2013. It could be described as a twisted DRIVING MISS DAISY with a dose of THE HELP. It's certainly a crowd-pleaser, even delivering a mushy ending not dissimilar to that of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. Of course we don't mind, because after spending a couple of hours with these two, we are fine with a feel-good ending. The film is showcase for two terrific actors, and for those that don't know, the real Tony Lip appeared in a few projects such as ""The Sopranos"" and DONNIE BRASCO. Expect to see these two actors get some love at Oscar time, and this is one of the few that can be recommended to just about every movie lover."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,The best thing about this movie is the characters in it. Ali portrays a classically trained jazz musician and highlights the dilemma of the highly educated and cultured Black man of his time. Viggo with weight gain and all is amazingly authentic as the good hearted hot tempered Italian American driver. There are some laugh out loud funny parts like the letter writing and fried chicken. The humorous tone and approach of the movie is what sets it apart from other race relation movies. That doesn't mean that it glosses over the discrimination at the heart of the movie. Even if you think you have seen enough of white people behaving badly in the South the incidents portrayed really cause the most righteous indignation in anyone watching. Very illuminating is the difference between the cops in the North and South.This is the best movie of the year.
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,9/10,"A tough, working class Italian New Yawker (Viggo Mortensen) is forced to take a gig driving a refined African-American concert pianist (Mahershala Ali) through the Midwest and Deep South in 1962. Linda Cardellini plays the wife of the Italian.""Green Book"" (2018) was inspired by the real-life story and written by the son of Tony Lip (Mortensen). Like all great dramas, it's compelling from the get-go and the road movie approach provides an entertaining and revelatory string of episodes, not to mention occasionally amusing. While the movie's been accused of reverse racism, it's actually balanced, showing plenty of poor, inarticulate blacks and vice versa. The message is to base your perceptions on the individual rather than ignorant generalizations.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in New York City and Louisiana.GRADE: A"
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,8/10,"Director Peter Farrelly co-wrote with Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga, brother of the main character, this true story adaptation for film. It succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is a reflection on the racism of the 1960s era as a too close comparison for the current status of prejudice. It is a powerful movie that makes its point simply and strongly, largely due to the very fine performances By Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.Briefly, the story takes place in 1962 when Tony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), a tough bouncer at the Copa, is looking for work when his nightclub is closed for renovations. The most promising offer for employment is to be the driver for the African-American classical/jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin the concert tour armed with The Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. They are accompanied in a following car by the other two members of the Don Shirley Trio (Dimiter B. Marinov and Mike Hatton). Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.One reason the film works so well is the use of bipartite examination of the response of each man to the stat us of the other: Don Shirley gains respect for the importance of family milieu (especially the Italian-American version) as Tony learns by direct observation the African American plight in a world of prejudice. Of note, a post-script after the film reveals that in real life, Tony became the maitre'D of the Copa, and Dr. Shirley continued being successful in music. They remained friends for the rest of their lives.Both Ali and Mortensen provide outstanding performances and head a cast that is consistently of high caliber. This is a powerful film with a very important message. Recommended."
GREEN BOOK,19 May 2020,10/10,"People who know me do know that such kind of flicks I normally skip. But Green Book had to many positive reactions not to go watch it and so I did.I did know what it was all about but can I tell you that this one based on a true story got me by my throat.First of all, clocking in over 2 hours it never did bore me one minute. There's not one moment that you can say, what the hell. You only can say and are in disbelieve that this ever could happen. Of course the story is unbelievable but what about the performances. Top notch.The differences between the two main leads, the differences shown between north and south, the differneces between rich and poor, it's all shown. Very strong flick, wow, impressed."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"I get all the nominations for this movie, it's a good movie with class acting from both major characters, Mahershala Ali as Doctor Don Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip. Since it's inspired from a real story it's even better as you feel the mood from the movie even more, that Southern racism that as been indoctrinated since the early age, it's something you'll never get used to, knowing it's not that a long time ago that there were different rules and rights for black and white people. It's disgusting and makes me mad, but this movie is also about dignity, ignorant speculation, dealing with problems in a different way, friendship and much more. Great acting with a solid and emotional story, you can't go wrong with this one."
GREEN BOOK,9 July 2021,8/10,"""Green Book"" is a very good film, set in 1962, billed as a biographical comedy and drama. The film was inspired by true events that year when Don Shirley toured the Deep South accompanied by Frank Vallelonga. Shirley was a black classical pianist and Vallelonga, known as ""Tony Lip,"" was an out of work white bouncer from New York's Copacabana Night Club. In true order of content, this film is first a drama, then biography, and then comedy. It's a film about prejudice, family, racism, class distinction, success, opportunity, and the social constrictions of the period.This was in the time just before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Opposition to the racist laws and policies of the Deep South had increased since the 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott by Rosa Parks. Major civil rights efforts were yet to come. Very little attention has been paid to the segregation practices and beliefs of the Deep South since then. What depictions there have been tend to paint the racial prejudice as being perpetrated mostly by rednecks. But this film shines the spotlight on the wealthy, upper class, and high society of the white South. One can't help but wonder how long segregation in the South otherwise would have lasted, or if it would have survived the Civil War at all. If the upper class whites, professionals, educators, businesses, churches and individuals had shunned racism and decried segregation, it surely couldn't have taken hold or survived so long.This is a good film and a good story. It also shines the light on prejudices within races. In Tony's case, within ethnic groups, although he is seen to initially harbor ill thoughts of blacks. And, in Don's case, inner-racial prejudice is based on status, upbringing, background, and education. But, if humanity isn't reason enough to end and abolish racism, the film shows that other social factors can help do so. In this case it's music - among the blacks and working classes of all color. Yet, the white elites don't even waiver in their prejudice in the face of great talent and art.This is a very good film for any time. It won three Oscars including best picture and best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali who plays Dr. Donald Shirley. The movie and Ali also won the Golden Globes that year.Here are some favorite lines from this film.Tony Lip, spotting a big billboard as they drive south out of Ohio, ""Kentucky fried chicken - in Kentucky! When's that ever gonna happen?""Dr. Donald Shirley, looking over Tony's letter to his wife, ""Dear Dolores - D-E-A-R! This is an animal,"" pointing to Tony's spelling.Tony Lip, ""So, can I put, uh, 'P. S. Kiss the Kids?'"" Dr. Don Shirley, "" A P. S.?"" Tony, ""You know, at the end?"" Dr. Shirley, ""That's like clanging a cowbell at the end of Shostakovich's Seventh."" Tony, ""Right! And that's good?"" Dr. Shirley, ""It's perfect, Tony.""Tony Lip, ""You know, the world's full of lonely people waitin' to make the first move."""
GREEN BOOK,12 July 2021,8/10,"""Green Book"" is set in 1962. It's based on a true story of a fall tour through the Mid-West and Deep South by a classical piano player and his chauffeur and body guard. The pianist is the celebrated black performer, Dr. Donald Shirley. His chauffeur is an Italian American, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga, who worked as a bouncer at the Copacabana until it was closed for renovation.The time is two years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that would once and for all end sanctioned segregation in the U. S. But people across the country - black and white, were becoming more active in the civil rights movement since the 1950s. Rosa Parks sparked the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, on Dec.1, 1955, and the news media began reporting more and more on the civil rights efforts and events taking place. Other people were directly challenging the culture of the Deep South that harbored and fed racism by its forced segregation.Don Shirley was one of those. He was born in Pensacola, Florida, in 1927. His parents were Jamaican immigrants. His mother was a teacher and his father an Episcopal priest. Shirley began playing and studying the piano from age two, and became a celebrated classical and jazz pianist. He had a trio and began taking seasonal tours in the early 1960s. This movie is based on his 1962 tour when he hired Tony Lip to accompany him.As the movie shows, they left the Midwest and the prejudice and segregation worsened the further they went into the Deep South. This film is especially good in the irony it portrays among the upper crust whites of the South. They accepted Shirley for his great talent as a performer, but rejected him as a person. Most often, the media portray a stereotype of the white racists of the South as rednecks. While many in the blue collar workforce were no doubt racially prejudiced, little attention has been given to the ruling class of the white population of the South. People know of the politicians who perpetrated and continued segregation policies. But they couldn't have done so without the concurrence and support of the doctors, lawyers, other professionals, educators, media, churches and business and civic leaders.So, this film shines a light on the dichotomies inherent in the Deep South of the mid-20th century. The film also shows the two main characters, Don and Tony, coming to grips and overcoming their own prejudices. They develop a solid friendship that would last their lifetimes. Some things in the film are fictitious and relatives and friends of Don Shirley took exception with some details and with how his character is portrayed.But Mahershala Ali won the best supporting actor awards for playing Don Shirley. He won the Oscar, the Golden Globe and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts trophies. And, the film won the best picture awards from all three groups. It's good to remember that Hollywood and the entertainment industry don't base their awards on accuracy, factual portrayals or the reality or truth of a story. Rather, it's how good the acting, story, direction and production appeal to those voting. Usually, that is heavily influenced by the quality in handling demanding roles by actors; but sometimes emotional, personal, and societal influences weigh in award voting. And, of course, internal politics of the industry have been suspected to have influenced some choices of the past.From the setting of this movie, it would still be half a year before Martin Luther King Jr. Would capture the nation's soul with his speech, ""I Have a Dream."" That would come on Aug. 28, 1963, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would come the next year, ending the dark period of legal segregation in American history.The movie is billed as a comedy along with biography and drama. The comedy is very light. It is handled tastefully and is very well done. Here are a couple of favorite lines from this film.Tony Lip spots a large billboard as they leave Ohio and drive into Kentucky. ""Kentucky Fried Chicken, in Kentucky,"" he says. ""When's that ever gonna happen?""Tony Lip, ""The World's full of lonely people afraid to make the first move."""
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,,"In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Green Book,"" the producers identified the movie's themes of ""friendship, love, and acceptance."" Those abstractions were complemented by a detailed and insightful portrayal of the Jim Crow laws portrayed in the America of late 1962.To navigate one's way through Jim Crow laws, African-Americans relied on a guide called the Green Book. The author of the book was Victor Hugo Green, who compiled a survival manuel for blacks traveling through the Deep South and seeking lodging and restaurants that would not exclude them from service. The book was carefully crafted as a comprehensive and invaluable resource entitled ""The Negro Motorist Green Book.""As a film, ""Green Book"" hits all the right notes in the situations, character developments, and well-scripted dialogue. So many films fail it attempts to blend comedy and serious drama. This film is a model of unfolding a dramatic narrative with genuine moments of humor that evolve organically from realistically driven characters and situations. One of the most delightful moments was a discussion about music between Dr. Donald Shirley and Tony Lip. The conversation focuses on classical versus contemporary music, and Tony mispronounces the name Chopin as ""Joe Pan."" Dr. Shirley takes it in stride with a priceless, nonchalant reaction.In the bonus track of the DVD, the film was described as the story of ""two people from two very different worlds."" It was made all the more remarkable that the two principal characters bonded almost as brothers. This was made dynamic by the extraordinary performances of Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. As writer-producer Brian Currie observed in the bonus track, ""it all comes down to the good acting.""The final strength of the film was the music with the inimitable piano style of Dr. Shirley. In the bonus track of the DVD, Dr. Shirley was characterized as ""Liberace meets Beethoven,"" which is a good description of the unique musical style. There was subtlety in all facets of this film, and the word ""virtuoso,"" as used to describe Dr. Shirley is appropriate praise for everything about ""Green Book."""
GREEN BOOK,29 January 2019,8/10,"The story of an Italian driving a Black man in the 60s, when both peoples were persecuted by the ""red blooded Americans"", whatever that meant. It seemed a bit off some times, with the elevated black man behaving inexplicably or not knowing or understanding some concepts, but having perfect knowledge of other more complex ones. The completely unbiased Italian-American family was also a bit of a stretch. But the tale is heartwarming and fun, without getting into violence or too much ugliness and the acting is good."
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,7/10,"""The Negro Motorist's Green Book"", which took its name from its publisher, one Victor Hugo Green, was guidebook published between the 1930s and 1960s. Its purpose was to help black travellers find hotels and restaurants that would accept them at a time when many such establishments, especially but not exclusively in the South, operated a colour bar. (It will probably come as a surprise to younger viewers to realise that, as recently as the sixties and seventies, the words ""negro"" and ""coloured"" were still regarded as perfectly respectful ways of referring to black people. Indeed, in some contexts they were regarded as more acceptable than the word ""black"" itself).The film tells the true story of a tour of the Midwest and Deep South undertaken by Don Shirley, an African-American musician, in 1962. Although he was classically trained, there was a widespread feeling at the time that classical music was ""white man's music"" and that the public would not accept a black classical pianist. His recording company therefore signed him as part of a jazz trio. The film is told from the perspective of Shirley's driver Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American New Yorker. Tony takes the job because he is temporarily unemployed from his normal work as a nightclub bouncer while the club is being renovated; the concert promoters anticipate that Don is likely to get into trouble with racist elements in the South and that Tony's skills as a bouncer will enable him to double up as Don's bodyguard.The plot of ""Green Book"" is essentially that of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in reverse; a working-class white man acts as chauffeur to an educated, well-to-do African-American employer. The relationship is initially a difficult one, although the differences between Don and Tony are dealt with in a largely comic way, reminiscent if the differences between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's differences in ""The Odd Couple"". The refined, fastidious Don takes exception to Tony's crude manners and to his standards of honesty, whereas Tony sees Don as a conceited snob. As the tour progresses, however, their relationship becomes a closer one. Tony comes to appreciate Don's skills as a pianist and his literacy, which comes in useful when Don assists Tony with his letters home to his wife Dolores.Things take a darker turn when the tour enters the South. Don innocently wanders into a whites-only bar in Kentucky and has to be rescued by Tony when he is threatened by a group of angry locals. Tony, whose views on race were previously not particularly liberal, begins to change his mind when he sees the depth of hostility and prejudice displayed by many Southern whites towards blacks. Things come to a head when Tony and Don arrive at their final venue, a country club in Birmingham, Alabama and the management, although happy to allow Don to perform for their guests, refuse to let him eat in their whites-only restaurant.The film has been praised- in my view rightly- for its acting, with Mahershala Ali, who plays Don Shirley, winning a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar and Viggo Mortensen (Tony) being nominated for Best Actor. Now I have no problem with the quality of Ali's acting, which was certainly deserving of an award, but the fact that Tony was clearly perceived as the main character suggests there was something odd about the focus of the movie. It suggests that this is a film about racism seen through a white man's eyes, even though black people were the main victims of that racism, and that Don has been relegated to the position of a supporting character in what should have been his own story.And Don's, I think, would have been the more interesting story. He is an affluent, educated black man whose lifestyle in the cultural milieu of New York has isolated him from the great majority of black Americans- he admits that he has little idea of how they live or of the problems they have to cope with- and yet who is not accepted as an equal by many white Americans. A complicating factor is that he is either gay or bisexual, thus making him a member of two different minorities at a time when prejudice against homosexuals was even more deeply rooted in American society than racial prejudice and was shared by both white and black Americans. Don's sexuality, however, is only mentioned in one single scene, when Tony has to bail Don out after he has been found in a compromising position with a white man in a YMCA bathhouse. During the rest of the film it is not referred to at all. By not pursuing Don's story further, I think that the film-makers missed an opportunity to make a deeper statement about racism and other types of prejudice than they actually did.This was, of course, the film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2018. I will wait until I have seen more of the possible contenders before I give my opinion as to which film should have won, but my views about this particular award were summed up for me in the words of the BBC's film critic Mark Kermode.

GREEN BOOK,17 January 2019,7/10,"Based on the lives Don Shirley (A Pianist) and and Tony Vallelonga (A Bouncer), 'Green Book' is a surprisingly pleasant effort by Writer-Director Peter Farrelly, who delivers his most sensitive film to date. Farrelly known for madcap comedies, takes a different route this time, and delivers a road-film, that explores friendship and racism, with heart.'Green Book' Synopsis: A working-class Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen in a showy performance) becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist (Mahershala Ali, mastering in subtlety) on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.'Green Book' works because this is a truly heartening story of diversely different people who formed a bond, despite their differences. And Farrelly, along-with Co-Writers Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son) and Brian Hayes Currie, makes sure the ride is memorable. Though the film does get monotonous at times and also feels about 15-minutes longer than should've been, 'Green Book' is a charming road-film, that is, in equal measure, humorous and serious.Tony and Don's relationship is nicely captured, as it begins from awkwardness to true friendship as the story progresses. The entire ark of its characters is well-done, like Tony's racial attitude towards Don initially and how their friendship forms, to Don realizing the power of being himself, deserves credit. Even the entire backdrop of Racism subjected toward Don, offers some hair-rising moments, that definitely leave you angered. The Writing, though imperfect, is well-aware of the times the story is set in (1960's) and presents a story that appears authentic, rather than frothy and artificial.Farrelly's Direction is competent. It's good to see the otherwise zany director, explore his subtler side here. Sean Porter's Cinematography is excellent. Patrick J. Don Vito's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper.Performance-Wise: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are in fine form, yet again. Viggo, nailing the Italian accent and gulping down food like a true foodie, has a blast playing Tony, and it shows in every frame. Ali, on the other-hand, portrays the subdued Don, with grace and restraint. And the on-screen camaraderie between the two, is infectious. Of the supporting cast, Linda Cardellini as Tony's Wife, is extraordinary.On the whole, 'Green Book' charms. Make time for it."
GREEN BOOK,27 November 2018,10/10,"""Green Book"" is a great and film that really speaks volumes and sends a message of love, caring, and friendship. It proves that thru bonding that prejudice and racism can be challenged and fought against. The film which was well directed by Peter Farrelly(""Dumb and Dumber"") is based on the true story of black classic concert pianist Dr. Shirley(in a super performance from Mahershala Ali) and his travels thru the deep south for concert work during the turbulent times of the 1960's. And shown is the work of his sidekick and go along travel partner and driver Tony Lip(in a well rounded and blended take from Viggo Mortensen) who as an Italian American bouncer learns life and forms the friendship of a lifetime.The film really captures the times of the 1960's well with it's scenes of the automobile types and the food products, diners, and gas stations. Most of all the way it portrays the times and the people of the south is spot on with racism and prejudice. Shown are the moments Dr. Shirley faces of not being served with whites at fine restaurants and his not being treated well at a clothing story. Plus the police treat him and Tony both different as arrest are made of both on their journey trip adventure of human growth and developing friendship.Overall excellent film that should bring up thought and conversation to want to change people's views and outlook on race, class, and life as we still occupy a troubled age. This film sends a message to love and live life thru connection as on one's journey friendship is possible as no matter the color of skin or how different that of a background love defeats prejudice and racism."
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2019,8/10,"American goofball comedy purveyors, one half of the Farrelly brothers goes solo, Peter Farrelly's GREEN BOOK is this year's Oscar hopeful, and could, very possibly pull a DRIVING MISS DAISY win against more high-brow heavyweights, Alfonso Cuarón's ROMA and Yorgos Lanthimos'' THE FAVOURITE, both lead 10 nominations.Story-wise, it is a pertinent reversal of Bruce Beresford's surprising Oscar champ (both are snubbed for nominations for its directors), inspired by the true events in the 60s, NYC bouncer, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen), an Italian family man, is hired by black pianist ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Ali) as his chauffeur to accompany him an eight-week concert tour in the Deep South, during which, the pair has to inure deep-seated racism and commences a heartfelt bonding process that is riddled with laughter and compassion, all to flog the obvious ideology to death (and introducing the obsolete concept of what is a ""green book"") with an unpopular white savior designation.That said, the film itself will hearteningly cruise any skeptical viewer to its finish line, and most of the credit goes to the two leaders, Mortensen, vanishingly disappears from his lean physique and balloons into a typical foodie with a daddy bod, whose tucking-in scenes are so achingly funny, and Farrelly surely splurges on them, with fried chicken being put into great use into elucidating Don's awkward position as a fish out of water among either white or black folks, for his skin color or erudite miens. Mortensen's physical transmogrification welds eloquently with Tony's philistine, rough-diamond characteristics that in spite of being a total cliché, the whole package of Tony Lip resoundingly connects with audience, preponderantly because of Mortensen's brio and commitment.On the other hand, Mahershala Ali has an inherent advantage that lies in Doc's unique otherness, which visually, is pointed up by Farrelly's unsubtle arrangement (that collect gaze from black farmers working in the field just betrays Farrelly's lack of imagination and flourish as a director), but Ali, has become the undivided cynosure ever since Don's grand entrance, and gradually, stories of Don's background emerge and his distinct make-up rounds out through many unsavory encounters with local racists and convos with Tony (who unfortunately shifts more into an onlooker or fixer as their journey continues). Never distracted from being charismatic, Ali affectionately impersonates Don's contradicted feelings, his anal-retentive, prissy inclination and most of all, a beautifully rendered vulnerability, which makes his ambidexterity of piano woodshedding more like the icing on the cake. One might surmise Oscar voters are collectively rueing the day that they have given Ali his Oscar far too soon for MOONLIGHT (2016), yes Oscar No. 2 is his, albeit it is an unequivocal leading role.GREEN BOOK's script makes good with minutiae such as a (presumably stolen) jade stone, Tony's letters to his homebound wife Dolores (Cardellini, shoehorned in the ideal wife part), who is given the most gratifying line to utter when she finally meets Don in the end, and the well-mined twist of whether Tony brings a gun or not.Last but definitely not the least, the movie doesn't shy from implicating Don's closeted identity (at the risk of offending Don's real-life family, though), a telling sign that homosexuality has finally earned a tiny toehold in mainstream production that no longer needs a full feature fixated on it for special treatment, just put it there, as it is in life.Although congenitally mired in the backlash of its inception from Tony's heirs, co-producer-cum-co-writer Nick Vallelonga is Tony's son, but as a film per se, GREEN BOOK is categorically a massive-appealing, cracker-barrel, feel-good gas bestowed with two tours-de-force and slightly burdened by a less luminous journeyman behind the wheel."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,8/10,"Green Book tells the presumably true story of white racist guy hired as the chauffeur for a black musician doing a tour of the deep south. It's predictable, following the well-worn path to racial understanding of similar films, but it's got solid performances and is engaging throughout.There have been various criticisms of this movie. Don Shirley's family says its ridiculous to claim he'd never eaten fried chicken before having it forced on him by a white guy, and that's probably true. But it works as a way to contrast the plebeian white guy with the sophisticated black man, and it's silly to expect any Hollywood movie to not be at least half fiction.(It's hard to know who's telling the truth. Shirley's family has complained a lot, but from what I've read they don't seem to have been that close to him. The movie was written by the chauffeur's son, who says Don Shirley himself approved it, but the guy also echoed Donald Trump's lie that thousands of American Muslims cheered during 9/11, which makes me consider him inherently untrustworthy.)The movie has also been criticized as yet another movie funneling racism through a white lens; this is the chauffeur's story, not Shirley's. But because a movie is part of an unfortunate trend doesn't mean that individual movie isn't good, it just means Hollywood has trouble breaking out of its boxes.The title does, however, bug me. The Green Book was a guide on where to find hotels where black people could stay at a time when many hotels were whites only. It's a good example of what black people had to deal with, it was written for black people by black people, the existence of the book is a condemnation of the white culture that made it necessary, and even though it's a fairly insignificant plot point this is the title they chose. This is a movie about a white guy learning about racism; why make the title something so much a part of a particular black experience? It feels a little like theft.Still, I really enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was super memorable, and it seems like a movie I'll have pretty much forgotten in a year (so maybe I should give it a 7?) yet it's mix of humor and pathos make it a very enjoyable experience."
GREEN BOOK,20 May 2019,7/10,"For my sins I had never heard of black musician Don Shirley before this film dramatisation of his purposeful 1962 tour of the southern states of America with his two accompanying white musicians. To drive him around the land of Jim Crow, Shirley hires a tough, barely literate but mob-connected Italian bouncer Tony Lip, late of New York's Copacabana Club, who is temporarily out of work when the famous night club closes for repairs and so is looking for work in the run-up to Christmas.What follows is a combination road-trip, buddy-buddy, civil rights revisionist feature which if it too often falls into cliche and sentimentalism, nonetheless delivers an upbeat, feel-good movie, as these two polar opposites, one impeccably spoken and dressed, the other guttural and slobbish unsurprisingly rub off on each other changing their perceptions of their own places in society and basically confirming the old truism that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.To be fair, I was almost counting off the stock situations Shirley would blithely walk into on the road, such as an encounter where he seems bemused at the sight of poor black sharecroppers working in the field, the inevitable injurious run-ins with racist Southern citizens in a bar, redneck Southern cops keen to put him down for being ""uppity"" with them and even the in-bred bigoted attitudes at the very night-spot he's been hired to play. Luckily Big Tony is on hand every time to rescue him with a mixture of brawn and bluff so that by the end, the ice-cool Shirley's reserve and distance duly breaks down and the hot-headed Bronx-bruiser has come to admire the bravery and musicianship of his passenger.Sure some of the situations seemed contrived, like the cultured Shirley letting his hair down with an R 'n' B group at a road-side bar or the Capra-corn-type Christmas scene at the end but there were compensatory scenes elsewhere like when Tony mis-remembers the title of one of his new boss's celebrated. albums or when the erudite Shirley helps Tony to write his letters home.I very much enjoyed the acting of the two leads and the authentic settings depicted of early 60's America and even if this story based on true events (at least according to the film's introductory titles) was a little too sugar-coated, I must admit I enjoyed the ride with these two larger than life characters."
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2020,9/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter losing his cool while performing doorman duties at the Copacabana nightclub in 1962, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a tough, working class Italian American, loses his job and becomes desperate to find another one. And so he ends up becoming a chauffeur to Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a piano prodigy, with a cool grasp on culture as well. As they travel to their destination, they are forced to travel through the Southern states, where the talented doctor is subjected to ingrained racism and hostility, that forces him and Tony to reexamine both their lives.In the current racially charged climate we find ourselves living in, while I don't doubt some of the grievances some claim still oppress people of colour (to phrase it correctly!), a lot of the more leftfield stuff certainly feels more debatable. I would certainly wager that in the last fifty/sixty or so years, significant advances have been made, and we've certainly moved on from the sort of bigotry depicted in this very well made drama from director Peter Farrelly, who was previously associated with crude comedies, such as Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber.Essentially, it's an examination of two conflicting personalities, each shaped by their own conditions and lived realities, who together are forced to reveal their own preconceptions of each other. The cultured Shirley tries to impart his eloquence and sensitivity onto the coarse, aggressive Tony, who, astonished at him not knowing who Little Richard is, claims he doesn't even know about 'his own people.' The main driving force, though, is Shirley's simmering resentment at Tony's lack of appreciation of being able to not have to suffer the various indignities he has to suffer throughout the film, even in spite of his ability and grace, as they travel through the south.This is one I've really taken a while to get round to, but I had a feeling it wouldn't disappoint, and it sure didn't, a superb character examination, with a reliably on par performance from Mortensen, and a revelatory support act from Ali, a performer I was totally unacquainted with. ****"
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,9/10,"It's an old misconception that opposites attract each other. Why should they anyway? We welcome personalities that comforts us, reassure us, if they differ from the way we are, I can only imagine the situation where the strong attracts the weak, but you can't make a buddy movie picture with one weak character, you'd be like splitting in half the entertaining value of the film. Fortunately, Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"" is about two characters, with sharply defined personalities, who are only opposite on the cinematic surface, the difference is the silver platter on which the meal is served.But we can't overlook the platter, can we? A Caucasian middle-aged man and a young black man, a colorful Italian-American man with a well-spoken, highly educated and cultured man or if you prefer a street-smart larger-than-life robust-looking average Joe and a misunderstood sissy-looking genius, a family man and a bachelor... finding a common denominator between Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip aka running-gag-first-name Vallelonga and Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley is tougher than spotting Waldo in a bazaar.But for all these superficial differences, the two guys were meant to form a pair, especially when the story of their road-trip and building friendship has 1962 in the backdrop, when we know that the South is part of the itinerary and that it's based on a true story. That's pure Hollywood Oscar-bait stuff, in fact opposite don't attract each other but they certainly attract audiences. So the film is formulaic but the dynamic chemistry between Ali and Mortensen elevates it to an enjoyable, heart-warming feel-good picture worthy of all the applauses at the end despite its 'obvious' significance, the film feels calculated to please but I would lie if I said I didn't like it.And the theater was quite crowded tonight and when it began and I was trying to counterattack any attempt to move me with emotional tricks, I was quickly drawn into the simple straight-forwardness of the story and the fact that (and that's a pattern I noticed in many great friendship stories), no matter how different Doc and Tony are, they strike as nice and decent guys, and on the basis of these characteristics, they attract each other. Tony is so particularly sympathetic that he makes Doc look arrogant by pure contrast, so much that I was questioning the choice of that scene where he put two glasses in the trash bin after his wife (Linda Cardellini) gave them to two Black workers.Yes, that scene was welcomed with a few gasps and many laughs but retrospectively it doesn't quite hold up with the personality of Tony Lip who could be a caricature if Viggo Mortensen wasn't so damn hilarious. The fact that his behavior all through the film belies this character-establishing made me wonder whether it was meant to mislead us of it was an actual flaw in the narrative. Anyway, I liked Tony. We don't know exactly what he used to do for a living: bouncers for night clubs, occasional muscle man, driver for pick-ups or plows, he's obviously a man who can do anything and can't afford to be broke. The set-up to his unemployment is rather confusing, it only allows us to visit his family and neighborhood before it gets quickly and thankfully to to the point, the man's hired as a driver for Doc Shirley during a tour in the South that would end before Christmas Eve.The film might be set in 1962 but we've seen enough movies to anticipate crucial scenes from the the first incident to the Christmas celebration and the introduction of a new friend, yes, it doesn't help if you've seen ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". But let's not kid ourselves, the film that is more likely to be compared to ""Green Book"" is obviously the Best Picture winner of 1989 ""Driving Miss Daisy"" which had moved me so much that I could bet a fortune there would be a scene with the Mississippi Police and even one where urination would be an issue. It's also interesting the way the film switches traditional roles by having the literate Doc teach his driver how to write letters, in ""Miss Daisy"", it was Tandy teaching Freeman. I'm not trying to diminish the film's originality, many scenes play out fairly well because of the atypical aura of Doc and how Tony plays it like Joe Pesci with the appetite of Homer Simpson (his comical timing is perfect) and yet has a somewhat dignified constancy forcing our respect.And that's the film's miracle, it only relies on the acting power of these two giants, they're so good that the plot hardly matters, the two of them make the most predictable, even contrived situations such as a bar brawl, an arrest or a simple conversation a pure delight. And as if the film was aware of that force in the characterization, I had the feeling that it tried to reach some spectacular climax near the end, make some political and social comment and yet halfway through the final act it changed its mind and provided a fun, nice anticlimactic ending, convincing us that the film is meant to feel us good, and we do need sometimes a good feel-good film.A few hours before getting to the theater, I was controlled by three police offers, I was confused by the hostility I could read in one's eyes, why was he acting that way, what was wrong with me? And maybe that's one of the thing with the film, people judged for the way they look, the way they behave and the way it just doesn't seem to fit. It's possible that the best trick of ""Green Brook"" is just when you think it's Tony who'll be taught a lesson, you have another thing coming. The arch is rather obvious when you think about it, but I don't mind the kind of obviousness that would made me feel good at the end."
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,5/10,"'Green Book (2018)' is supposed to be this heart-warming, 'feel-good' type of film but it doesn't really come across that way. You can tell that's its intention, though, and, indeed, it's perhaps the only angle from which the piece is at least somewhat successful. There's an undeniable chemistry between its two leads and their banter provides intermittent entertainment, but I wouldn't say it comes close to being emotionally impactful. Their friendship isn't all that convincing mainly because it develops rather quickly and because neither of them are fully rounded characters. It has some deeper issues, too. Not only is its message incredibly simple, and arguably somewhat retrograde, but it's also impeached in a number of scenes. During these, the flick makes decisions that are questionable at best and incompetent at worst. Of course, there is a rather genuine debate surrounding the validity of crowd-pleasing, consumer-friendly work that tackles serious themes. This piece, however, feels basic in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it goes about doing it. I wouldn't even say it's all that successful at it. Even on face-value, the film feels old-fashioned and oddly paced. Still, I won't disregard its occasional enjoyable moments. It's not awful, by any means. It's just that when you compare it to thematically-similar - and awards-competing - work like 'BlacKkKlansman (2018)', you start to see where it falls short. To be honest, it's not really what we need right now. 5/10"
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2019,9/10,"If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.It's a movie about how two mismatched people, (a chain-smoking, rough speaking Italian-American and an African-American you might even call 'uppity'), who, on a long road trip in the Deep South in the early sixties, bestow on each other the gifts of friendship and humanity. Even if you knew nothing of the 'true' story of the musician Don Shirley and his driver you can predict the outcome from the get-go. Of course, it also helps that it's also very funny despite the seriousness of the material and that leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are so damn good, (Ali's second Oscar in three years looks like it's already in the bag). It is, then, something of a treat and might even convince you to seek out the music of Don Shirley."
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,7/10,"'Green Book' seems to have been designed according to a recipe for winning Academy Awards. The subject is historic but with reverberations in current politics and the approach is in tune with the mood at Hollywood. It addresses one of the painful topics of recent US history, but it does it in a sufficiently careful manner to get a rating that makes it accessible to audiences of almost any age. It has as a hero a musician and includes a lot of (good) music at a time when musical films are again enjoying great success. The cast includes a couple of well known actors who are given the opportunity to play consistent roles. Finally, the film is based on real life heroes and a true story. And yet, despite all these arguments, I do not think the 'Green Book' will be able to gather too many statuettes.The story of the friendship between the high-class musician and the driver he hired for a two-month tour of the Southeast US of the 1960s is unusual. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) was an exceptional musical personality, one of the virtuoso pianists of his generation, but he could not get recognition into the world of classical music because of his Jamaican origin. He played a brand of sophisticated jazz for rich audiences. Yet, the rich musician, accustomed to first class hotels, when in tournaments in the southern states, as a black singer, he was subjected to racial discrimination in the still partially segregated America. Don 'Lip' (Viggo Mortensen), the driver and bodyguard hired to accompany him on the trip is an Italian from the Bronx, not missing a dose of benign racism. A lot seems to separate them, but the differences in race, culture, social classes and personal tastes will be tested and will melt during this road trip together that allows the two to get to know each other and to learn each some lessons from the experience of the other.What I liked. The music. The authenticity of the details. The acting performances of the two lead actors, but also of many of the ones in supporting roles, including the non-professionals. The way in which the realities of the 1960s are brought to screen.What I liked less. The predictability of the script. I was several times in the situation of anticipating a few minutes in advance what was going to happen on screen. The director and co-screenwriter Peter Farrelly went too far to make of 'Green Book' a feel-good film to be enjoyed by the audiences and especially by the jury of the Academy. The result, even if it has the excuse of being inspired by a true story, is conventional and syrupy. I think this movie could have been much better if it did not try that hard to be a crowd-pleaser."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,7/10,"I'm all for crowd pleasing movies. I'm the guy that loves The Intern, Eddie the Eagle, and this year's Instant Family. Green Book falls into a similar category to an extent, but it attempts to be a little more than it may have earned. The crux of Green Book is the bond and chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), and in this vein, it succeeds immensely. It's their back and forth that proves to be a powerful viewing experience in the theater. However, what the film tries to save about race, sexuality, & class feels very surface level and cliched. It works consistently but not to the point that other films have in recent years about similar subject matters. And perhaps it's not trying to be anything more than a crowd pleasing movie about friendships and criticisms like mine won't seem fair, but if it's going to be considered for best picture, then it should be brought up. In the end, it's about how everyone in the world has something to learn from somebody, no matter race, gender, nationality, or sexual preference.7.5/10"
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,,"The film isn't terrible in terms of film craftmanship, but it's just a very problematic one all around."
GREEN BOOK,16 December 2019,8/10,"But it is very good and entertaining. When I read it's about 2 guys going on a concert tour in the South when racism was prevalent, I thought it would be boring. But it wasn't and was very good. It's got some humor like when Tony introduces Shirley to fried chicken. The final when Shirley stands up for himself at the restaurant and won't back down was very good. A really good message behind it. And then he goes to the bar and plays the blues with some other musicians. The acting by both leads was top notch. I see why both were nominated and why Ali won. And considering most films now days are not that good, I think this was a good pick for best picture.FINAL VERDICT: Great story , definitely check it out."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,4/10,"After ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990), ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Crash"" (2004) and, now, ""Green Book,"" I guess Hollywood is just going to continue patting themselves on the back for not being racists because they honor pictures where stupid white protagonists are taught to respect racial others as human beings. As opposed to the infamous failure to nominate a racially more challenging and sophisticated picture such as ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) for Best Picture the year ""Driving Miss Daisy"" won it, this time, they gave Spike Lee an Oscar, too, for ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), a film that I think has its own faults, but, at least, it's not simply a message picture of ""racism is bad, but look how far we've come"" for the dumb and dumber. And, at least, there's some cinematic flair to Lee's film, as opposed to this modest improvement upon a filmed play such as ""Driving Miss Daisy.""In quite a few ways, ""Green Book"" is a modest improvement upon ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in that it largely tells a similar story in a similar way without itself coming off as quite hypocritically racist. It's about the least one should expect after 30 years of cinematic and social changes--or lack thereof. In it, another white person who also faces some prejudices against them (in this case, for being an Italian American; in Miss Daisy's case, for being Jewish), and again from that white person's perspective, travels by car with an African American through the Jim Crow South. (Both movies even privilege their ""home"" turf, as it were, as not as racist as other places. In ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" Atlanta somehow came off as not nearly as segregated as Alabama, and in ""Green Book,"" the two are welcomed home to New York by a friendly police officer in contrast with the backwater cops they meet on the way to Birmingham.) They bond, and through their experiences with their black friend, the white protagonists stop being racist. But, this time, the white person is driving, and the black man sits in the backseat!To be fair, Mahershala Ali's Don Shirley is not entirely, or at least not atrociously as much so, the Magical Negro trope that Morgan Freeman's Hoke is in ""Driving Miss Daisy."" The historically-based character of Shirley has a life outside of helping the white protagonist with their character arc, which the movie addresses, if only almost entirely through the lens of the white protagonist and ultimately how it affects him. In a way, it's a traditional sidelong-glance biopic, where the life of the more interesting figure (Shirley) is seen through the point of view of a more common folk (Viggo Mortensen's Tony), as a surrogate for the spectator, for one assumes because that's how the storytellers see us spectators. Additionally, Shirley is not the white writer's fantasy of a subservient African American that is Hoke. Moreover, Miss Daisy's conversion is rather unconvincing, but ""Green Book"" leaves little doubt that Tony has transformed. Ali and Mortensen are good actors, too, which helps. Clearly, they were dedicated to their characters (most conspicuously by Mortensen gaining 45 pounds for the role).Nevertheless, a movie that's written and directed by and mostly made by white people, through the perspective of a white character, as a surrogate for an intended white audience, to feel good that they, too, have overcome historical racism doesn't really cut it as authentically anti-racist. This comforting, hand-holding seminar from a narrow view of a vast and historical problem, another whitewashed picture about prejudices against racial others won't transform anyone."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,,"Another example in the long list of films that provide an overly simplistic view of race relations in America, Green Book is a sincerely crafted & aptly narrated cross-country ride that's steered by some fresh bantering between its two leads but it is also outdated in its approach, and brings nothing new to the table.Set in the American South during the 1960s, the story follows an Italian-American bouncer who takes the job of driving & bodyguarding an African-American pianist on a musical tour through Southern states. The title refers to the travel guide that was in circulation for safe travel through the country's racial segregation.Directed by Peter Farrelly, the execution is pretty straightforward and though the film adds nothing to the race discussions, the friendship angle is treated with care & compassion and is allowed to develop gradually. The story is told through Tony Lip's viewpoint and is about the change the journey brings in his personality.Both Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali play their roles convincingly, especially the latter whose suave & sophisticated rendering of Don Shirley turns out to be one definite highlight of this film. But it's their clashing attitudes to life & ideals that gives this film its finest moments while their quips retain its playful quality throughout.On an overall scale, Green Book doesn't delve deep into the still prevalent racial situation in America but as a tale of friendship, growth & understanding, it does what it set out to do. A mostly lighthearted story that's driven home by splendid performances from Mortensen & Ali, Green Book is undeniably flawed but most viewers will still come out entertained & satisfied with what it has to offer."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,Green Book is anchored in two wonderful performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. Their characters are complex and nuanced and it's the relationship between these two characters that keeps you engaged. It's also interesting to see Peter Farrelly direct something that isn't as goofy as his previous movies. This story felt unique and was able to address the subject of racism in a way that didn't feel cliched or cartoonish. Is it the best film of 2018? That's debatable. But it's definitely enjoyable.
GREEN BOOK,27 August 2021,8/10,It had an interesting topic.Acting performances were excellent.It was one of the best movies of the year.
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2019,9/10,"Good flow to the story; just the right amount of intrigue building over time. Ali & Mortensen were superb - like a good chocolate, both were salty & sweet. Would have liked to have seen more of the ""Green Book"" localities & those personalities. Ali actually & effectively learned to perform a few piano riffs, but couldn't tell what was his playing & Kris Bowers - fooled me."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,7/10,"Green BookThe hardest part of driving through the southern US is convincing folks the internal combustion engine isn't witchcraft.Sadly, the driver in this drama must also persuade southerners that his black passenger is human.When nightclub bouncer Frank Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is laid off, he takes a job driving around jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he plays throughout the lower states. While the lowbrow Vallelonga and the snobbish Shirley struggle to find common ground, they eventually become friends and learn to navigate the racism embedded in the south.Loosely based on a true story, many liberties were taken to make this interracial buddy movie more palatable to modern day audiences. And while the freedom taken can be called into question, the overall message of tolerance is inarguable, along with the strong performances.And while having a white male driver may curtail racial violence, road rage incidents would double.

GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,10/10,"Though ""Green Book"" has won a library-full of awards, many critics have been lukewarm about its merits. That is because they wish to see it as a commentary on race relations in the U.S. That is like viewing ""My Cousin Vinny"" as a commentary on the American judicial system.The film, based on a true story, is about the dynamics of a relationship between two men from different stations and cultures. Tony (Viggo Mortensen) is a meatball hired to drive Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an erudite black man, on a concert tour that passes through the deep South. Written, in part, by the son of real-life Tony, it is a rewarding story of education and transformation that provides both laughter and tears.The pace of the film is perfect. The viewer feels like a third passenger in the car as it motors from venue to venue, state to state, while a charming battle of wills evolves. And 1962 is created so accurately---through props and locations, wardrobe and music---that you can practically smell the rooms they have staged.This is definitely one of the best films of 2018."
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.Is hardly possible to give a lower rating then 10 for ""Green Book"" (2018). I mean this movie has some amazing acting by two leads, superb directing of the movie, good production values and script that is a bit manipulative but so involving, that at the running time 2 h this movie never dragged for a second. Yet this is a predictable and more of ""movie"" story then reality, this is a good feel movie first of all - like a Disney take on racism.Overall, ""Green Book"" is a superbly involving and excellently paced movie. It will leave you smiling. Great movie all in all."
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2019,10/10,Peter Farrelly's Green Book is the most pleasurable piece of cinema - which is both majestically crafted (Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen kill it) and socially relevant (it's about racism in the US of 1960s) - that I have seen (since the 2011 French drama The Intouchables) so far of everything that came out in 2018 that I have already decided to dedicate the whole of 2019 to singing its praises to every other person I meet who is interested in films.

GREEN BOOK,31 December 2019,9/10,"So sad how racist most of it is, it's ok though I'd say every scene is well done! Viggo Mortensen sure eats a lot which was unexpected. The whole film is well acted and incredibly written; crazy how the director hasn't done something so impressive before it's nice. Peter Farrelly is way better than given credit for."
GREEN BOOK,9 January 2019,,"The ultimate beauty of a bio-pic is that it is a true story. Whether it is deeply touching, violently disturbing or hilariously amusing, the fact that this really happened makes all the difference. ""Green Book"" is one such.The events took place in the era when the Kennedy Brothers tried to fully accomplish what Abraham Lincoln started. That was the time when, strange as it sounds, the use of the word ""black"" to denote an American with African ethnic origin was almost tabooed. The word ""colored"" was used, and not exactly in a complimentary way. ""Green book"" is a Negro travelling companion, detailing accommodations that a black traveler could safely check into, particularly in the deep south. It was, needless to say, useful when a black classical concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) embarked on a performance tour of his trio (with a cello and a double bass, both played by Caucasian musicians) that would take him deep down south. As chauffer and body guard de facto, he hired Italian New Yorker Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a bouncer temporarily unemployed when the club he worked for underwent a major renovation. The movie is essentially in the familiar genre of road movie featuring an ""odd-couple"".Two establishing scenes introduce Tony on two fronts - throwing out trouble-makers from the club and enjoying a family life as a devoted husband and father. When it becomes apparent that winning $50 from a hog-dog eating head-to-head challenge would not be sufficient for the family budget during the four months during which he is unemployed, Tony answers to a reference for an interview.There is an introduction scene to the odd-couple that is a joy to watch. In an elegant upscale waiting room, Tony meets his prospective employer who comes out ""dressed like an African king"", all cool and snobbish. Following up on his enquiries about Tony's resume, Dr. Don Shirley asks ""In what capacity?"" Seeing Tony's look of bewilderment, Don rephrases his question ""What do you do there?"" This deliciously sets the tone of the stereotype-revered odd couple. And, never forget, this is a true story.The interview is not fruitful. Upon understanding that his job description includes being a ""butler"" (laundry handling, shoe shining etc) Tony turns down the offer, although they part civilly. Don, as well, is not prepared to meet the remuneration Tony seeks. However, reflecting on the high recommendation he received, and realizing that he really needs that caliber of a body guard for his tour, Don calls Tony's wonderful wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) to make the offer again. At the farewell scene, after a passionate kiss, Dolores says to her husband ""You better be home for Christmas or not come home at all"". A seasoned audience will right away recognize this leading to the planned closure.A pleasure as it is to watch, this road movie does not have installed for you anything you would not expect. Nor does it have to. It is the natural narrative of the story that is so captivating. Tony and Don do not start with the right foot, so to speak. Every time Tony says something he does not like, Don snaps ""Eyes on the wheel, Tony"". They engage in a philosophical debate on the difference between ""bullxxxx"" and ""lie"". The first bonding comes when Tony is flabbergasted to learn that Don does not like music ""of your people"" (such as Chubby Checker). Such sentiments are only surpassed by learning Don's unbelievable ignorance of the joy of fried chicken. Against Don's vehement protest that he has no ""plate and utensils"" in the backseat, Tony finally succeeds in making the music genius discover the joy of fried chickens. In reciprocation, starting from a session on the park bench outside fast food chain, Dom starts coaching Tony in writing, more specifically, letters to Dolores.On the real business of the trip, we are entertained by short scenes of the Don Shirley Trio's performance at various stops of the tour. While the program is essentially classical there are occasional de tours into popular tunes such as ""Happy Talk"" from the musical ""South Pacific"". The grand finale, insofar as music is concerned, is totally riveting. After walking away from the performance with an institution that reeks bigotry, Don and Tony go to a music bar where the latter is the only white patron. After some prompting, from locals and his pal alike, Don goes to the stage to join the jazz band, delivering a performance that immediately brings to mind ""Treme"", the marvelous TV series that is among the best I have watched.The various unpleasant to outright dangerous experiences Dr. Shirley encounters throughout the tour are of course predictable. A little surprising is the way Tony handles these unpleasant situations. Yes, on some occasions he lets his fist do the talking, but not always. He can be resourceful and tactful as the need arises. This, matched by Don's impeccable dignity, makes the pair so exceptional. The movie ends with a heartwarming sequence, with the closure on the Christmas theme mentioned earlier.Golden Globe results are in: best supporting actor, best screenplay and best picture (comedy or musical) for ""Green Book"". Ali has a bit of an edge because his role, arguably, is closer to a co-lead than a support. But either way, his top-notch performance is beyond dispute. Mortensen could have won too but, cliché as it is, there is a strong field. I like to pay special tribute to Cardellini whose performance makes Dolores (oh no, entirely unlike the namesake in ""Westworld"") so endearing. For those who may not recognize her, she has the role of another endearing wife, Laura Barton in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""."
GREEN BOOK,30 July 2020,8/10,This film really relies on the great performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They give amazing portrayals as their respective characters and their wonderful journey together brings them closer and reconciles their vast differences. The portrayal of racism in America is disheartening and at times a bit extreme but is treated in a nuanced way.
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,9/10,"Green Book (4.5 out of 5 stars).Green Book is a really well done biographical comedy drama film about a true story of a Jamaican classical jazz pianist and his personal driver going on a road trip tour to some of the rough parts of the country during the time of racial segregation. It is a good story. Almost like a road trip buddy comedy. With two opposite people. The jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is a high class Jamaican American and has a condo of many expensive furniture and antiques. The bouncer/driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is an Italian American and struggling to make money to support his family. He is a loud foul mouth, blunt, a chain smoker, and eats a lot. He even put himself in a bet in an eating competition to make some money.The plot follows Tony when he loses his job in a night club cause of renovation. He gets an interview from Dr. Don Shirley. Tony is a bit of a racist. When he sees two African Americans doing some plumbing work in his apartment and his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) serves them a drink. After they set their glasses in the sink. Tony grabs the glasses and throws them out in the trash. When Shirley recruits Tony to be his driver for this music tour. Which would set him away from his family for two months. Tony and Shirley will have a lot to go over about each other. Shirley is proper and mannered. Tony is the complete opposite.It is one of those heartfelt stories. Yes, it does have some difficult scenes to watch during the racial segregation when Don Shirley gets denied to use the whites bathroom or eat in a public restaurant with the rest of the people. Or when he is given a closet of a room to get ready for the concert. Sure, Tony does not take that likely and react poorly by knocking whoever is rude to the guy out. There is some character development with Tony and Don becoming friends throughout the movie and are able to tolerate each other. Don trying fast food restaurants with Tony. It is fun to see Tony and Don react to each other on screen. From being the people who can not stand one or another to being close friends throughout the road trip journey.Viggo Mortensen was great playing Tony. With the gaining weight for the role and an Italian accent. Mahershala Ali was also great playing Don Shirley who is prim and proper with his mannerisms. Linda Cardellini playing Tony's loving wife, who is set more aside on the screen time. Waiting at home and writing to her husband.Overall, Green Book is a really good film. It does have a heartfelt emotional true story about Tony and Don Shirley. It does have some fun humor that will make you laugh and some tough emotional moments. The performances are great."
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2018,10/10,"One of my favorite cinematic experiences is when a film comes absolutely out of nowhere and ends up being incredible. That is pretty much the story of ""Green Book"", a movie that came into the 2018 holiday season with little hype but, when all is said and done, might be the frontrunner for ""best film of the year"" on many personal lists. It sure is on mine, I can tell you that!For a basic plot summary, ""Green Book"" tells the real-life 1962 story of Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a renowned piano player embarking on a tour of the Deep South. His race--African American--might pose some issues, so he hires cocky tough-guy Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) from the Bronx to be his driver. As the two set out on their journey, it at first seems like an Odd Couple type of relationship. But as they experience more of each other's company--as well as the racial injustices of the territory--they come to both rely on and perhaps learn something from the other.This is a movie that really ""sneaks up on you"", so to speak. It starts off relatively straightforward and one could be forgiven for thinking it's maybe even a little slow. But that character development pays off in an enormous way, as by the end you'll be holding back tears (or failing to) after witnessing the bond these men form out on the road and in face of adversity.For a movie like ""Green Book"" to work, the acting has to be spot-on, and it surely is here. You'd never guess this was the same Mortensen that was once the sword-wielding Aragorn in the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. He went all-in for this role, shaping both his voice and body to fit the part. Ali has slowly built up a fantastic career for himself, and there's nothing to stop that process here. The arc of his character provides most of the emotion of the film, and his scenes range from heartbreaking to hilarious.Speaking of ""hilarious"", also consider that this film was directed by Peter Farrelly...yes, he of ""Dumb & Dumber"" fame! While seemingly an odd choice to helm such an emotional project, it proves to be EXACTLY the right decision, as the humor in the film goes a long way towards establishing rapport between the two leads. As deep as the ""emotional stuff"" goes (and it goes deep, to be sure), the comedy is easily just as well-done.I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack yet, which is another integral ""role"" in the film. Whether it be Shirley himself or just the ""on the road"" type tunes, the ""Green Book"" soundtrack is one of the best I've experienced in quite some time. A great mix of jazz, piano, and orchestral sections.As you can see, I think that perhaps the biggest reason why ""Green Book"" gets the full 10-star treatment from me is because it does a little bit of everything, and somewhat remarkably nails all those little areas to produce a masterpiece. The final compliment? The overall message of the film is a great one: that sometimes all it takes for two people to better understand each other (in this case it is black and white, but really it could be anything) is proximity. Had not fate drawn Dr. Shirley and Tony together, they would have spent the rest of their days likely stuck in their own little boxes. As it turned out, however, it took a road trip to cross those bridges and each man to learn a little from the other.Great story, acting, direction, humor, music, and emotion. What more can a movie-goer ask for?"
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,8/10,"One of the least surprising film's you're likely to watch from this year's awards season heavy hitters, as this is a trip we've taken in different variations many times before, Green Book is still an undeniably fun piece of Hollywood entertainment that will leave you with a big smile upon your face once the credits begin to roll.The very definition of a feel good film, with a well-worn but never the less important message, Green Book sees Dumb and Dumber and Something About Mary co-creator Peter Farrelly graduate from low-brow comedy to tell the true-life story of Italian nightclub bouncer Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga and black American pianist Dr. Don Shirley's unlikely friendship, as the two mismatched souls take a cross-country journey to the deep south of America when Vallelonga takes up a job as Shirley's driver and bodyguard on a concert tour in the early 1960's, when racial prejudices still ran rampant.It's one of those stories that's quite clearly been exaggerated and Hollywoodized but it doesn't make Farrelly's film any less entertaining thanks to the experienced filmmakers assured handling of the material, that includes one of recent memories most assuredly witty scripts, with the banter between Viggo Mortensen's uneducated but well-meaning Vallelonga and Marershala Ali's upper-class and serious Shirley producing some brilliantly realised moments of comedic brilliance that also acts as a fine showpiece for these two actors skills.Green Book is arguably one of the lightest and easy to digest movies of Mortensen's career and while there's been some controversy surrounding the portrayal of Shirley after his family members have spoken about the film, Mortensen and Ali make for one of the most enjoyable double acts in some time and when two actors connect so well together and with the material, it goes a long way to elevating whatever movie they're in, which is certainly the case with this road-trip drama.These two certainly help you overcome some slightly cringe-worthy and somewhat eye-rolling moments, like a fried chicken bonding experience or a night-out at local African American bar and make some of the films more poignant moments really stick, as the two begin to become more than just business associates and build an understanding of each other's trials and adversities.With the film becoming such an audience favourite and even a potential Oscar winner, it's to be expected that a fair share of naysayers have made their way out of the wood work to justify why Farrelly's film is undeserving of any awards love but there's a reason why the formula at the heart of Green Book has been utilised so many times before, as when it's done as well as this, you just go along for the ride and enjoy the time spent with these likeable, flawed and realistic characters. It's unlikely that Green Book is a definitive or even 100% accurate portrayal, but it doesn't dilute the core messages, wit and heart on display.Final Say -A feel good movie that's quite simply a joy to watch, there might not be any shake-up of the well-worn road trip/mismatched duo formula but with a razor sharp script and some awards worthy performances, Green Book quickly becomes a charming and loveable trek across 1960's America.4 pieces of Kentucky Fried Chicken out of 5"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,8/10,"The Green Book is a movie that you can hardly believe that it's a biography aka a true story. The bromance between the two men, completely different and yet the only ones that understood each other, was superb. The movie's plot only explored their relationship, because, when it came to the actual story, there wasn't much to be offered. But, in the end, after great performances and heart warming moments, you will be left with a smile on your face."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,8/10,"Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.Great performances from the entire cast, especially Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who were perfectly cast and convincing in their roles. It was also great to see comedian Sebastian Maniscalco in this film as well.Writer, director and producer Peter Farrelly nailed every aspect of this biography.The score, cinematography, sets and visuals were all on point.I'm not a fan of slow paced long films, but this was was close to an exception. I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.Excellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.A well deserved 8/10 from me."
GREEN BOOK,23 May 2019,8/10,"Review:
What a brilliant film! For such a low budget, and no fancy graphics, this highly entertaining film proves that a good story, and excellent acting, is all you need to produce something special. This reverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" type road movie, see's Viggo Mortensen (Tony Lip), playing an Italian bouncer, who is forced to take on a job, to drive a African American pianist to various locations during his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South, while the Copacabana nightclub, were he works, is closed for renovations. The eccentric and highly educated classical pianist, Doctor Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), hires Tony on the strength of his references, even though there were several candidates up for the job. As this movie was set during the early 1960's, it's extremely rare that a white man chauffeur's a black man, so they had there ups and downs throughout there tiresome journey. The fact that this film is based on real characters, made it even more of a joy to watch, and the various obstacles that Tony and Don tackled together, made them become closer as friends, even though Tony had a problem with black people at the beginning of the film. For this day and age, the subject matter was extremely relevant, especially with the American president trying his utmost to divide us. From an entertaining point of view, there is enough content to keep you glued to the big screen, which is rare for a movie in this genre. Throughout there journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, correctly spelling and rephrasing passages, which I found touching and emotional in places. Even after the episode in the YMCA pool, which I thought would change the direction of the film, was brilliant because the director chose not to dwell on the matter. The main element that made this movie unique, has to be the excellent performances from the leading actors. Their chemistry on screen was amazing, like Cruise & Hoffman in Rainman, and the director shot the period well, but it's not the type of movie that you can watch time and time again. In real life, Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley remained friends until they died within months of each other in 2013, so you're actually watching a life-long relationship unfold on screen. In all, I highly recommend this movie to all adult movie-goers because it has something for everyone, and you will be left feeling hope and joy. Great!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Peter Farrelly, who also brought you Dumb and Dumber in 1994, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Me, Myself & Irene, Osmosis Jones, Shallow Hal, Stuck On You, The Perfect Catch, The Heartbreak Kid, Hall Pass, The Three Stooges, which was awful, Movie 43 and Dumb and Dumber To. His change of direction with this film has really paid off because it won the Best Motion Picture of the Year Oscar, along with the Best Original Screenplay and the Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting role for Mahershala Ali. Personally, I thought that Viggo Mortensen deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, but he sadly lost out to Rami Malek for his great performance in Bohemian Rhapsody. For such a highly rated movie, which has won many awards and loved by critics, it still didn't smash the box office like a lot of the weaker movies did, but at least it was recognised by the people in the academy, even though they don't always get it right. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and for a director who has produced more comedic movies than serious drama's, he put together a good script, along with great actors, who brought this true story to the big screen with style.Budget: $23million

GREEN BOOK,7 December 2018,9/10,"Martin Luther King's message that people should be judged not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character came one year too late to reach the folks encountered by black Jamaican jazz pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali, ""Hidden Figures""), in his 1962 concert tour of the segregated Deep South. In Peter Farrelly's (""Dumb and Dumber To"") warm and human comedy/drama Green Book, Shirley undertakes the journey together with Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Moretnsen, ""Captain Fantastic""), a night club bouncer who is known to his Italian mob pals in the Bronx as Tony ""Lip."" While Tony was hired to do the driving, his main job, unacknowledged though it may be, was to provide physical protection for Shirley from any unwanted encounters with the locals south of the Mason-Dixon Line.Inspired by a true story (isn't everything?) and co-written by Nick Vallelonga, the film's title refers to the ""Negro Motorist Green Book,"" a guide used for many years by black travelers looking for hotels and restaurants in the Deep South where they could feel safe from discrimination and physical harm. Needless to say, neither the hotels nor the restaurants have many stars in the latest Michelin guide. We are first introduced to Tony who is working at the legendary Copacabana, a mob-connected New York nightclub known for its ability to attract name entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr. When the Copa closes for renovations, Tony is open to an offer to become a driver for Doctor Shirley whose ostentatious living quarters above Carnegie Hall, to quote former U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, ""staggers the imagination and converts vanity to prayer.""Racism is not foreign to Tony's outlook on life as shown when he throws the glasses used to serve water to black workmen in the garbage. Even though the tour will take him away from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini, ""A Simple Favor"") and his two small children for eight weeks, Tony promises to write often but will need some assistance from his cultured employer. As two Cadillac's make their way along the highway, one containing The Don Shirley Trio's cellist Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov, ""A Picture with Yuki"") and bassist George (Mike Hatton, ""Vigilante Diaries""), and the other the reserved and tightly-wound Shirley in the back seat and the chatty, uninhibited driver in the front.Though the two have little in common, their witty interplay on the road expands Don's horizons as Tony provides samples of Little Richard, Chubby Checker and Aretha Franklin and, after much resistance, introduces him to the gourmet pleasures of Kentucky Fried Chicken (heaving their bones out of the window). Meanwhile, Don offers Tony some assistance with his grammar and teaches him about Orpheus and his demons, neither of which he needs to know to do his job. When they leave Pennsylvania and Ohio and head for Raleigh, Macon, Memphis, Little Rock, Baton Rouge, and Birmingham, however, things are no longer a laughing matter.The pair get their first dose of reality when they hit their first Green Book"" stop, the run-down Carver Courts Motel to which Tony offers the relevant comment that ""it looks like my ass."" While Don maintains his haughty above-the-battle demeanor, it soon becomes obvious that much of his persona hides a gnawing loneliness that becomes more evident as the two make progress on their journey. Encounters with the police and a confrontation with unfriendlies in a bar are just the tip of the iceberg and Don is forced to rely on Tony's considerable skills as a Bronx tough to get him through some physically threatening moments.The irony for Shirley is that he is a much sought-after artist who performs for wealthy white audiences but is prohibited from eating in the same restaurants, using the same bathrooms, or sleeping in the same hotel with those who pay good money to hear him play. Though the film suggests that these abominations are things of the past, we know better. During the performances, however, there is no black and white, no rich and poor, no coons or queers, only the exquisite power of the music which transcends hate and, at least for those few moments, reminds us of our common humanity and the fields of gold we all play in together. They are moments that can help us, as American poet Langston Hughes puts it, ""to shatter this darkness, to smash this night, to break this shadow into a thousand lights of sun, into a thousand whirling dreams of sun!"""
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,5/10,"Most of the reviewers here state how important the message of the movie is. I will play the advocatus diaboli here: I don't care about the message of a movie without entertainment - in the first place by watching a movie I want to be entertained and not educated.Green Book is that kind of movie that you make in our times if you want the applause of today's Hollywood's p.c. crowd (remember Shape of the Water!?), add some known actors and you can grap easy some prices here and there. 2nd choice: make something about saving nature. Creativity!? Daring!? Uniqueness!? None.Anyway, the message of course is one already told many times before (e.g. The Intouchables, Driving Miss Daisy to name some obvious ones), but I admit the actors work well.Well, today's Hollywood crowd seems to be rather some bunch of social workers and educationalists than artists - by the way, I find it really somehow rather comical that those rich guys and gals try to tell me how to live to save nature, considering how many different estates/big houses and other stuff like cars and planes those people got. Just imagine for a moment in what kind of state the Earth would be if all 8 billion people on Earth would live that kind of life-style of those true lovers and preachers of Mother Earth...Back to Green Book: a rather mediocre and rather powerless movie (just compare it with a masterpiece like In the Heat of the Night) with some funny moments and solid acting, but with a story obviously fishing for compliments and applause - and some Oscars."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,8/10,"I'm going to start my review a little differently, addressing many criticisms about the racial issues that are ""glossed over"". Not every film has to be a harrowing depiction of segregation where characters are brutally harmed. Much like in Farrelly's case here, a lighter approach can still produce the same intentions and profound awareness without detracting from the main story itself. That is why I believe Green Book is a resounding success. The racial discrimination is an environmental factor that brings these two opposing personalities closer together, focusing on a story about friendship. Inspired by the true story of Don Shirley, an ingeniously talented pianist, hiring an Italian-American bouncer to be his driver and bodyguard as they tour the deep south. They use ""The Negro Motorist Green Book"" to find hospitality establishments that would accommodate African-American travellers.The beauty of this straight-forward plot is these two differing characters coming together during a heightened discriminatory phase within society. A white tough-talking brash bouncer who was born and raised in the family orientated Bronx borough, who's narrow point of view makes him a casual racist much like the rest of white Americans at the time, journeys with a black wealthy uptight lonely pianist for a couple of months. It is as formulaic as one would expect, and you know exactly how the film will conclude. Yet, the earnest friendship that blossoms between these two individuals, is something that unexpectedly enveloped me in pure joy. Shirley's acute diction and dignifying mannerisms allows Vallelonga to adopt these traits and make him a better human being. He starts to show compassion and understanding for Shirley, not just as a black employer but as a friend. Conversely Vallelonga provides company for Shirley who often succumbs to loneliness, and soon finds that he has found someone who understands him. Vallelonga's innocent naivety is the key that unlocks Shirley's door of solitude. It is a near-perfect depiction of professional companionship, a friendship I never knew I wanted until now.What enables these characters to bloom in the Louisiana sun is a surprisingly well-written screenplay that boasts humour and character development. The barrage of witty humour makes up for the lack of dramatic scenes, and actually allows us to connect with these typically closed individuals. Through their banter we instantly start to identify specific characteristics that make them tick, for example Vallelonga has one heck of an appetite and does not stop talking. Meanwhile Shirley's uptight persona means he often lectures Vallelonga on morally correct life choices and attempting to improve his lexicon. The scene where they share a bucket of Kentucky fried chicken is a perfect illustration of two characters breaking each other down and forming a bond. The added attention to Vallelonga's hearty family (wait, was that Velma from 'Scooby-Doo'!?) makes that last scene even more palpable, leaving a profound emotion of pure happiness. However, none of the above could come to fruition if it wasn't for Mortensen and Ali's performances. They were outstanding. Ali in particular gave so much to his character without resorting to melodrama. Subtle touches, like sitting cross legged, asserted Shirley's mannerisms. Mortensen really came into his own here also, and felt a real natural chemistry between himself and Ali. Farrelly's direction, although nothing outstanding, was decent at ensuring the light-hearted tone was consistent throughout.Many have remarked that this is essentially 'Driving Miss Daisy' but with the races switched for its characters, which is a fair comment and a valid reason as to why it is a formulaic story. And sure some additional drama could've been included to, not necessarily enhance the awareness of racial issues, but the initial conflict between these two opposing characters. Still, it's a delicate film about understanding. Two individuals from opposite backgrounds (both in wealth and race) forming a beautiful friendship on the basis of mutual respect for one another. Plenty of smiles, laughs and general entertainment to be had. So sit back, relax and enjoy the long comfortable drive."
GREEN BOOK,21 August 2019,10/10,"A perfect 10 for 10 ratingViggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali were destined to play the characters of the tough and gruff Italian night club bouncer Tony Lip, and the sophisticated African American classic pianist Dr. Donald Shirley respectively. Some road trip movies can drag on and on and leave their audiences minds' wandering as the constant babbling by the main characters over incidentals drags on. But this was not the case with this ""road trip"" film which in my humble opinion was deserving of the five (5) Academy Award nominations that this film received, and definitely deserving of the three (3) wins for Best Picture, Best Supporting actor (Mahershala Ali), and best original screenplay.Mrs. Shullivan and I did see Bohemian Rhapsody and I believe that Viggo Mortensen was robbed of the best actor award over Rami Malek's ho hum performance as Freddy Mercury. Maybe Bohemian Rhapsody should have won for best make up and hairstyling. Malek's fake portruding front teeth were over empha""sized"" and over exaggerated, and maybe the voters were paying more attention to the visuals rather than the content of the performances because Viggo nailed his performance as the tough Bronx chauffeur who loved food as much as he loved talking (thus the monogram Tony Lip) and living life.Green Book refers to today's version of an on line travel log, but back in the 1960's the real Green Book identified which Hotels/Motels would accept African Americans in the deep south for an over night stay and where they could eat their meals. The picture reflects the disparity between whites and blacks in the 1960's and we see how Tony Lip gradually becomes close friends with his black, gay, and sophisticated boss, Dr. Donald Shirley. There are some really sensitive yet touching and emotional scenes that are surely to become film classics. No spoilers, you need to watch the film and suck in all the great acting, music, and cinematography on your own.Mrs. Shullivan and I agreed that this film was definitely worthy of the Best Picture award and I hope to see this duo of Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali star in future films together as their portrayals were so natural that they fit together like the right and left shoes even with each foot having some different characteristics and flaws, they walked and talked as if they were one and the same.We were not bored at all through this road trip film and the only sad part was when the film was prompted with that subtle but effective ""THE END"". Fortunately I bought a copy so Mrs. Shullivan and I can watch it again and again.A perfect 10 for 10 rating"
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,"This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal."
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,8/10,"Green Book is a movie outside of its time: an adult, Christmas centric, character-driven drama with as much naturalist humor as compelling humanity. Yet despite the trailer's maudlin tone and the familiar racial themes, it's more than just a bad Driving Miss Daisy knockoff. Sure, it dabbles in some of the worst parts of ""let's-make-white-Americans-feel-okay-about-their-own-racist-past"" storytelling like the white savior and the magical black man clichés, but it just as often finds time to upend and reverse those very things. Instead of forced and frustrating sentimentality, it's a charming and lovely true story that doesn't sacrifice honest humanity for easy emotions.
The unlikely real friendship of roughneck Italian driver Tony Lip (Mortensen) and acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) is refreshingly rare, a biopic that isn't already widely known. It's an episodic roadtrip film that axles itself around the theme of love breaking down stereotypes. The two central performances are the best of what we expect from an Oscar-season tearjerker: big and hammy, but fully engaging and undeniably committed. Ali is solidly stoic, uniquely positioned (""Oh, so knowing who Little Richard is makes you more black than I am?!""), and highly impressive behind the piano; while Mortensen is phenomenally brash, insecure, and downright funny (""'Virtuoso'...it's Italian...means he's, uh...really good."") in a physically unrecognizable turn.
Now, I don't want to pretend this is some sort of big force of cinematic brilliance. The writing is often on-the-nose and the direction regularly pushes its messaging with a heavy hand. Still, it never hurts to be reminded of the stupidity of ignorance. Green Book does just that; perfectly moving, engagingly funny, and maybe the best Christmas movie since Elf."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,8/10,"We have no shortage of challenging/feel-good educational films about the Civil Rights era and Jim Crow South. That puts ""Green Book"" in the position to prove its salt, and while it doesn't necessary exceed the accomplishments of the prestige films of its ilk, it does enough to belong in the conversation among this frequented sub-genre's best thanks to a couple of outstanding lead performances.The title refers to a guidebook published in the decades leading up to and during the Civil Rights era that listed lodging and other businesses friendly to African-Americans in a time when travelers might not know what to expect while traveling the country. In the instance of this story, it's a helpful resource to Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), the hired driver and bodyguard of renowned classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) who embarks on a concert tour of the South. Although incredible educated, talented and acclaimed, Shirley is nevertheless a black man, and the framework of segregation (maddeningly) applies.Shirley is strangely not the main character of ""Green Book"" - Tony is - but this makes sense given that the story was co-written by Nick Vallelonga, Tony's son. We consequently experience the story through the eyes of this classically Italian-American nightclub bouncer from the Bronx, eyes that are of course a bit prejudiced and short-sighted, but clearly capable of seeing the truth.The producers could've found any number of actors capable of playing a working-class Italian with a penchant for competitive eating, so the casting of Mortensen is both conflicting, because Mortensen isn't the slightest bit Italian, and brilliant. Seeing him take on a transformative role with a blue-collar comedic bent is a big part of the film's entertainment value. He's not always hilarious, but he's fun to watch and he can of course hit all the dramatic notes.Humor is, of course, the specialty of director Peter Farrelly, who with his brother Bobby is best known for ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something about Mary"" and other low-brow comedies popular in the '90s and 2000s. Farrelly proves he's capable of more than gags with this effort, but there's a fair share of scenes whose purpose is solely laughs and that tactic proves hit and miss. In general, the weaving of lighter scenes depicting an unlikely friendship and the dramatic moments brought to bear by the cultural and historical context develops into a fairly obvious pattern.Again, acting comes to the rescue. Don Shirley is already a distinctive character for a film of this kind given his wealth, education, taste and social status. Ali brings additional nuance to the role that highlights the unique difficulties of a man who doesn't even identify with or fit in with most other black people economically and socially yet faces discrimination from white people all the same. Ali shows us that loneliness while also conveying Shirley's courage and conviction.These performances bolster a film that otherwise fits squarely in the mainstream mold of Civil Rights comedy/dramas. ""Green Book"" could easily be downplayed for never veering too far from the path of these inspirational Hollywood movies, but Mortensen and Ali insure the film's dimension and complexity enough that the cheesy uplift feels earned.~Steven CThanks for reading!

GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,7/10,"The good: this movie has got a charm about it that is undeniably very enjoyable and upbeat, which I quite enjoyed watching. It has a soft outlook on racism without any harsh images of violence, therefore it is suited to be watched by young children as well. Great acting performance by Viggo Mortenson, who really stole the show as an Italian-American bouncer, who first used to hate black people, but learns to like them pretty quickly, when his new boss is black and pays him extraordinary well.The bad: I must admit I almost fell asleep midway this movie, because the story was purposely made to be so incredibly politically correct, that I got bored beyond belief. The african-american musician is constantly victorious and superior from the very start. The Italian bouncer is portrayed as being completely stupid and racist and ofcourse he will stay stupid, but he overcomes his racism, when his boss pays him extraoridinary well. Both very one dimensional portraits, which become quite boring after a while.Certainly nothing worthy of a best picture oscar, nor of best supporting actor, but it ofcourse DID win both oscars anyway, because this movie offended nobody and was therefore the perfect example of politically correct thinking, which is what Hollywood really loves, because confirming what everybody else is thinking, (or ought to be thinking), is good for the box office and good for the public image, but it will never produce an intelligent, true to life story about racism. This is a white audiences movie about racism, made FOR white people and made BY white people. Very enjoyable and feelgood nonetheless, but a bit bland and sleep evoking at times."
GREEN BOOK,31 July 2019,6/10,"Green Book, the Best Picture Academy Award Winner of 2018, is the story of Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) and Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). The latter being a celebrated African-American pianist and the former being the man hired to drive him around Southern USA. In the 60s, when racial separation was still very much enforced in those states.It is a good movie. A bit of a slow one, with a clear, easy to understand structure. But it's very much an actor's film, with most of the heavy lifting resting on its two main leads. Luckily, both of them are powerhouse actors, easily able to sell the complex emotions, frustrations and joys required to sell you, the viewer, this emerging friendship. Both were also nominated for an Academy Award for their performances, with Ali winning for Best Supporting Actor. Earned, I'd say.I call it an actor's film, but it's not like all the other aspects of a film were in any way lackluster. It's a well-shot, well-paced film with good dialogues, good music and good locations. Not a flashy movie by any means, but the craft is definitely there.All that being said, I don't think this was the best film of 2018. It's a good film, but quite honestly I found myself thinking that I had already seen many movies just like it as I walked out of the theatre. It's a feel-good movie about two people finding common ground despite their differences. With a healthy dose of race being thrown in. Does this lessen the movie's value? No, no at all. But I'd like to expect something extra from a Best Picture winner.Still, the movie is good, don't get me wrong. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of its genre."
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,8/10,"This 2018 drama stars Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali and Linda Cardellini based on a true story. This takes place in the early 60's where we meet Italian-American bouncer and family man, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen) who gets a temporary job as a driver for African-American pianist, Don Shirley (Ali). While traveling through the South for Shirley's concert tour, they not only face racial tension/injustice from others, but befriend each other. Cardellini (Legally Blonde) plays Tony's wife, Dolores. This is a great film with dramatic and humorous moments, Both,
Mortensen & Ali give terrific performances and are great together.
I recommend this."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,5/10,"""Green Book"" (2018 release; 130 min.) is ""inspired by true events"" we are reminded. As the movie opens, it is ""New York City 1962"" and Tony works as a bouncer in the Copacabana club. When club closes for renovations, he needs another job. One day he gets a call: a doctor needs a driver. The given address turns out to be Carnegie Hall, and the ""doctor"" is in fact acclaimed pianist Dr. Don Shirley. After some back and forth, Shirley hires Tony, and off they go... At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you will just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie directed by Peter Farrelly, who along with his brother, has brought us ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", among many others. Here he goes a very different direction, namely on the one hand another take on ""The Odd Couple"", and on the other hand the racial tensions in the deep south in the early 60s. As to the odd couple Tony and Shirley, it provides for some comic relief (much of the theater crowd roared approvingly). As to the racial tensions, they are as predictable as they are mind blowing that this went on just 60 years ago. But truth be told, if you want to see a movie about those issues, there are far better movies than this one. Viggo Mortensen tries way too hard to be a convincing Italian-American from the Bronx, and that is true as well of the family gatherings early in the movie, you can practically hear the director yelling ""..and ACTION"". Mahershala Ali (as Shirley) fares somewhat better. Kudos for the production sets (I never tire of the cars from that era).""Green Book"" expanded wide this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was, much to my surprise, packed to the rafters (mostly seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"", I readily suggest that you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2018,8/10,"A fair number of film critics have argued that Peter Farrelly's Green Book, his new dramedy set in the early civil rights era of the 60s, is designed to make its chiefly white audience, ""feel better about racism."" Such a specious argument has it that the film promulgates the false notion that the racial tensions of today can be ignored (or even denied) primarily by white liberals by watching this optimistic tale of bonding between a gay black musician and Italian salt of the earth bouncer.
Some of these critics go further when they insist that the deck is stacked in favor of the protagonist Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), the gruff driver whom Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) hires to ensure that his concert tour of the deep South goes smoothly. Tony does so much more for Dr. Shirley, that some critics maintain that primary screenwriter Nick Vallelonga (Tony's real-life son) has turned his father into a ""white savior.""
Nothing actually can be further from the truth. Tony benefits from Dr. Shirley's influence just as much as Dr. Shirley from his. Their relationship is symbiotic. Both represent a fish out of water-Tony is exposed to Dr. Shirley's rarefied, world of culture while the sophisticated musician is forced by Tony to become more spontaneous, dealing with all the attendant street characters that challenge his ordered vision of the world.
What rankles many of these critics is that Dr. Shirley doesn't conform to their stereotyped image of what a black man should be. He's the opposite of ""street culture,"" having grown up in a white world and trained as a classical musician. What's more he's gay and looks down on other blacks whom he regards as uncultured and uncouth. Indeed his decision to travel through the deep south as a goodwill ambassador marks this unusual man as courageous as he's forced to endure constant humiliation by a coterie of racists at every turn.
It's Dr. Shirley who forces Tony to re-evaluate his deep-set beliefs about race. When we first meet Tony, he looks down on black people so much that he places two drinking glasses in the garbage after he spies the two African-American plumbers at his house, drinking out of them. Tony eventually comes to realize that his employer doesn't fit his stereotyped view of blacks; how can it be that Dr. Shirley never eats fried chicken?
The comic scene where Tony persuades Dr. Shirley to eat the chicken is the beginning of Tony's reevaluation of his racism. Meanwhile, Dr. Shirley must effect an attitude re-adjustment of his own, eating the chicken with his fingers, manners which he initially regards as beneath him.
Other critics also feel that the screenwriters are much harder on Dr. Shirley than Tony. Where Dr. Shirley plays Cyrano, teaching Tony better manners on how to write proper love letters to his wife, Dr. Shirley is depicted with much more self-destructive traits-he has one too many drinks and finds himself surrounded by racists at a bar, finally rescued by Tony in the nick of time.
Both Tony and Dr. Shirley are social outcasts however; both have trouble controlling their temper and in this respect they're very similar. Tony ends up punching a police officer in the face over an ethnic insult and Dr. Shirley has to be stopped by Tony from attacking the maître d who won't allow him to eat dinner with whites.
Perhaps the greatest scene in the film is when Tony and Dr. Shirley stop their car on the way to North Carolina and spy a group of black sharecroppers toiling away in the fields. This is where they both realize they have much more in common than the sharecroppers, who live a life of virtual indentured servitude.
At that moment Tony and Dr. Shirley can appreciate their freedom. It's a moment of epiphany for all characters concerned-the expression of wonderment on the faces of the sharecroppers whom have never seen an independent, ""free"" black man before; Dr. Shirley's realization of the true nature of the oppression of his people and Tony's appreciation of Dr. Shirley's sensitivity toward other blacks, whom perhaps in the past he would never have payed attention to.
The liberation of both Tony and Dr. Shirley is illustrated in the denouement. Dr. Shirley is able to ""let loose,"" playing blues music at an African-American bar and Tony admonishes his relatives for speaking poorly of black people at the dinner table.
Ali shows his versatility as Dr. Shirley, playing the upper crust musician (in contrast to his street tough role in Moonlight) and Viggo Mortensen (gaining about 40 lbs. for the role), shows off his acting chops as the gruff Italian. Kudos also to director Peter Farrelly, usually known for low light comedies, but in this case venturing forward into much more rewarding territory.
Green Book is nothing more than a feel-good story about race relations based on a true story. For those who can't stomach such a note of optimism in the face of a disappointing historical legacy, shame on them!"
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,8/10,"'Green Book' is a film that had it not been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards I would probably never have gotten around to seeing. And yet I'm so glad that it was nominated because otherwise I would never have gotten to experience such a great film. This is based off a true story and clearly glamoured up to make a worthy movie out of a simple concept. The chemistry between the two main actors is simply phenomenal and makes this film what it is.Consequently both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Both are fully deserving. Both are almost unrecognisable at times because they lose themselves in their characters so deeply. I have a hard time imagining Mortensen winning, only because the field is so incredibly strong this year. He keeps churning out brilliantly performances every year though and he will get the Oscar he deserves one day. Ali on the other hand I can very much see winning. He had a tremendous amount of screen time for a ""Supporting Actor"". Combine that with the fact that he was genuinely brilliant and I think you could almost call him a lock.The film ticks all the boxes for an Oscar movie but I can't see it getting the win for Best Picture, simply because it failed to deliver the knock-out blow. It's consistently charming, genuinely funny, has a beautiful message about acceptance and pushing boundaries, is well acted, well directed and expertly written - and yet I still couldn't help feeling it was missing something. It never had that killer blow moment that knocked me off my feet. I wanted more from the ending (and yes I know it was based on a true story which limits their ability). This is a brilliant movie that just couldn't quite put the cherry on top."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,9/10,"Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Lip who gets a job driving around a concert pianist named Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, around the Deep South. Despite Shirley's money and prestige audience (or more likely because of it) there were only certain places in the Deep South were a man of color can eat and sleep and apparently they had a ""tour guide"" for this called the Green book (Hence the name of the movie). You learn something new everyday.For the most part this movie was not about the Greenbook but the friendship that these two men developed while traveling through the Deep South. Obviously, the subject comes up as Tony Lip learns first hand what black men had to go through and on the other side Tony Lip became the friend Dr. Shirley really needed, in a strange reversal of Driving Miss Daisy.Though I can't help but to be moved by how good of a job this movie did showing how common and acceptable racism...""once"" was, and the loneliness Dr. Shirley felt in his battle to stop it (Being that his music wasn't exactly being played by black folk of the period), it's not that compelling of a story but Mortensen and Ali show why they are such good actors and the chemistry between both actors is working well.So well it becomes beautiful and you can't help but to be touched."
GREEN BOOK,1 September 2021,10/10,"Green Book (2018) is a movie my wife and I watched on Prime shortly after it was released to that streaming service. The storyline follows a New York City Italian that is rough around the edges that has been hired to drive a black pianist as he tours the south in the 1960s. Their very different demeanors, lifestyles and skill sets are a shock to each other but they do their best to learn from each other and meet in the middle so they can both be successful with their responsibilities. This movie is directed by Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) and stars Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage) and Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain). The storyline for this is very intricate and brilliantly written. The subplots on the Italian, the world renowned pianist and how those individuals were perceived through various interactions in the south were fascinating and well presented. The dialogue was well written and the cast delivers fantastic performances. The end is rewarding and this is one of those films you never want to end. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,9/10,"Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are perfectly cast as a pair of people from other worlds. Mortensen is Tony the lip, a bouncer/driver who works the Copacabana in 1962 when the club is closed for renovations. He is hired by pianist Don Shirley (Ali) and it is off to the road for a concert tour. The north is is no problem but the south becomes a nightmare of racism for both men. The story is a beautiful one of discovery for the pair. The script is funny and tragic and Farrelly does a great directing job of the two stars. This is my pick for best picture at the Oscars and Mortensen for best actor. Please see this great film"
GREEN BOOK,20 November 2019,8/10,"A tough Italian-American from the streets of the Bronx takes on the job of chauffeuring a talented African-American pianist from the lofts of Carnegie Hall through the Deep South in the early 1960s. While pat and predictable at times, the film tells an engaging story about the growing friendship between the disparate leads. Viggo Mortenson is excellent as 'Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga' (a real-life character straight out of a Scorsese screenplay) although at first the character comes off as a bit stereotypical, but I found Mahershala Ali's 'anti-stereotypical' urbane, polyglot classical pianist Don Shirley somewhat of a caricature at times. I liked the film more than I expected to and while I understand why there was some controversy about its somewhat fairy-tale depiction of understanding and reconciliation, the excellent acting and core story of a growing bond between two men make the film well worth watching."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2020,1/10,"I guess that this made it to the Academy Awards for saying something that has been said a thousand times before. But because it was made in 2018 and everyone below 30 and everyone in Hollywood pretends that cinema didn't exist until 2016 it had high praise.The acting is not bad, but for a movie set in the South, it could have used to actually show some of the beauty of the region they were driving through. Independent films have done a better job than this.But, because of the message, because of the statement we have heard a thousand times before, I guess you are supposed to love this and treat it like it's new.It's not, the 70s and 80s had a lot of movies like this and they carried over into the 90s."
GREEN BOOK,16 January 2019,7/10,"""Green Book"" is a sure fire crowd pleaser, but you probably knew that already.We've all seen this before: two people from totally different worlds meet, clash at first, learn to like each other, and realise they're not that different after all. That's the lesson for us cretins in the audience: it doesn't matter what colour we are or where we're from or blah blah de blah blah. It's a lesson that used to be exclusively sold to preteen kids, but in the world of the new millennium, this stuff is considered acceptable to preach to adults and nobody gets offended at the condescension.But how bad is it, really? Not bad at all, of course. It's the performances: two of the finest actors in the movies up there on screen, and most of the action in the dialogue. There were times when I forgot how trite it was, but the movie had a way of reminding me."
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2019,,"In the early 1960s, voracious, uncouth Italian-American bouncer and family man Tony Vallelonga is employed at the Copacabana nightclub in the Bronx. In need of employment while the club is under renovation, he reluctantly takes a job to work for Dr. Don Shirley, a cultured, genteel black man and musician in need of a driver while he embarks on a concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Of course the obvious question is: can this unmistakable odd couple co-exist long enough to get the job done? Inspired by a true story this delivers many expected and familiar themes like racism, dignity, and friendship, and while the comparisons with Driving Miss Daisy are simply unavoidable, it features some snazzy musical numbers, a good central theme, and is highlighted by the performances of Mortensen and Ali who play so well off one another. ***"
GREEN BOOK,20 July 2019,8/10,"8/10 - despite the controversy, this was a captivating drama that included a beautiful performance from Mahershala Ali"
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,8/10,"I saw ""Green Book"", starring Viggo Mortensen-Eastern Promises, the Lord of the Rings movies; Mahershala Ali-Luke Cage_tv, House of Cards_tv; Linda Cardellini-Hunter Killer, Avengers:Age of Ultron and Sebastian Maniscalco-Tag, The House.
This is based on a true story of an unlikely friendship between an Italian_American bouncer and an African_American classical pianist in the 1960's. Viggo plays the bouncer that is between jobs and is hired for 2 months to drive Mahershala, the pianist, on his first concert tour of the deep south. I say unlikely friendship because Viggo is an uncultured racist that uses his fists to settle matters and Mahershala is a sophisticated professional with a doctorate that does not believe in violence. Viggo does have principles that he lives by and he does need the money, so it is interesting to see their views and relationship grow into a friendship. Linda is Viggo's wife and Sebastian is one of Viggo's relatives, neither one of which thinks Viggo will last the whole trip. For those unfamiliar with the era, there were lots of racist ideas about places African_Americans could eat, sleep, buy things, etc. Of course, this would be a problem on the tour with Mahershala-he could perform music for white audiences but could not use the restroom in the same building. The name of the movie-Green Book-refers to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book', which was an actual guide to lodgings, restaurants and businesses that would service African_Americans. It was published from 1936-1966. During the end credits, the actual people are shown and you are told what happened to them after the events of the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language-including racial epithets-smoking and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,8/10,"A refined, classically trained black pianist recruits a blunt, tough-guy NYC Italian to serve double duty as both chauffeur and protection during an upcoming tour of the still-segregated south. Cruising along the back roads and highways in a curvy blue Cadillac DeVille, the pair quickly dispenses with the pleasantries to share a few essential truths, each giving as much as they take. They rankle and irritate, an odd couple on wheels against the backdrop of a volatile social change, but through several close shaves and heated arguments, they develop a mutual admiration despite their fundamental differences.Mostly a two-man show, Green Book thrives on the performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who enrich twin roles that could have otherwise fallen into broad generalizations. The life and depth they bring to both individuals, and to their complicated friendship, make for more than just a standard morality play. It's also an impressively restrained turn for director Peter Farrelly, better known for his work with brother Bobby in a series of zany '90s comedies. He lets the tone set itself, resisting the urge to bludgeon us with the message, and sprinkles in a few solid laughs when the moment calls for it. A well-made and effective, if overly safe, best picture winner."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,10/10,"This film has been gaining a ton of buzz especially with Oscar season coming around so I had to see Green Book and this is one of my favourite films over the last few years. The Premise of the film is set in the 1960's and sees and Italian - American Man become a driver for a Black Piano Player as he travels the deep south of America. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead in this film, he is totally brilliant in this film, This smooth talking guy is so fun to watch with that everyday charm about him that makes him totally relatable to us the audience as he tries to help this rich man. He will definitley be a frontrunner for the Oscar which is great to see as I haven't seen Mortensen in that much recently. Mahershala Ali is absolutley brilliant in thsi film, his character arc in this film is truly important to watch, seeing these two guys learning from each other is truly fascinating to watch. He gives a really powerful performance that in my opinion will give him the Oscar this year. The rest of the supporting cast all fit their roles very well and immerse you into the story that you are watching. The story sees these two very different people go on an emotional journey of deiscovery dealing with some heavy issues and build a truly great story. It is a bit predictable but I believe that actually worked for this film. The script is actually pretty hilarious with a lot of funny moments that really worked for this film. But when the drama is needed it delivers some truly amazing moments in this film. The style is great, I wasn't bored once in this film and I loved seeing the different parts of America and how they react to this situation. Overall this is a film you must see to appreciate and is definitley going to be up there for my best movies of the year."
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,10/10,"Let me state up front that this film's treatment of race, unfortunately, conforms to some of the more harmful cultural myths. There is the white savoir trope present, abet softened both by Tony being changed by Doc and Doc getting 100% of the credit for the resolution of a subplot. There is humor derived from stereotypes and caricatures. I imagine several scenes might be more grating than funny depending on your view point. In particular a certain scene with fried chicken is going to act like a Rorschach test for the audience. The troublesome nature of the material is important to acknowledge. Ultimately, through, given the light touch of the direction, the screenplay's nuance I think this story is about as un-troublesome as a film with this plot can be. These myths are harmful because they are so common. There is no reason to single out a single token of them, especially when the material is handled so deftly.A lot of this is because of the large choices in the screenplay and direction. This is an odd couple comedy that is touches upon race. It is not a movie about race that has an odd couple in it. The script and direction know that and are structured with that in mind. Tony and Doc are polar opposites in several ways-race, class, education level, tastes etc.-and there is a ton of very touching and funny interaction that are mined because of that. Yes one can quibble here and there about the social import but the film is deeply entertaining deeply charming. There is something very earnest here that works. You accept the warts related to social structures because of that.Ali and Mortenson make this film. They are perfectly matched and both given great performances, filled with humor, humanity, and nuance. Ali is saddled with a very difficult character and the Doc's struggles are really felt. Mortensen gives his best performance ever here and Tony is a great comedic character. He is basically unrecognizable in the role and I still can't believe Strider and Tony are played by the same guy. Just masterful acting.This is a good film. Don't hold cinemas' sins against it."
GREEN BOOK,15 September 2019,7/10,"Classical pianist Ali hires street wise tough guy Mortensen to drive him to all his concerts in the south of the USA where racism is rife and trouble somewhat inevitable.Whilst the racist incidents are laid on thick and fast, there is no getting around the gentle pleasure of these 2 actors bouncing off and learning from each other as the road trip progresses. Both give great performances and there is much to laugh and cry about in this film. That all said the notion of it winning the best picture Oscar is absurd."
GREEN BOOK,29 June 2019,9/10,"(Flash Review)This story portrayed a strange juxtaposition for the 1960s, especially while travelling in the south. A 'colored' man, Don Shirley, is being chauffeured by a 'white' man, Tony Vallelonga, of Italian decent. Even deeper than that is how Don is much more sophisticated and proper than the more casual and brusque Tony. Don hired Tony to drive him to a series of musical gigs. Through the journey they slowly learn to respect each other as well as expand their social views while dealing with the racism of the time in the South, thus both characters have meaningful story arcs. The production quality is rich with a great color pallet which complement the meaty dialog which is told through a straight-forward story. Quality."
GREEN BOOK,4 April 2019,10/10,"I've been truly disappointed in the Oscars over the past few years. It seems that movies winning the biggest prizes have always disappointed me, not being movies that I thought were worthwhile but instead movies that were politically correct. This took away the luster that the Oscars had possessed for decades of being movies that were the cream of the crop, the best movies made in any given year. So imagine my surprise to find that this year they chose the right movie when choosing GREEN BOOK as best picture.The story, based on real life, follows Frank ""Tony the Lip"" Vallenlonga (Vigo Mortenson) a Brooklyn man striving to make a living to support his family in 1962. Currently Frank works as a bouncer at the Copacabana but the club is shutting down for a few weeks and he's in need of work. A friend tells him he heard about a potential job driving a doctor around for a few weeks. With nothing to lose he gets the address and goes to check out the job.But the doctor is no physician. Instead he is Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a doctor of music and acclaimed classical piano maestro. What he is looking for is someone to drive him on an 8 week concert tour of the Midwest and deep South, someone who can handle himself if the need arises while on tour. At first unsure if they are compatible or not with Frank being basically an uneducated thug and Shirley being a cultured musician, they agree to terms and Frank is on board. Before taking off the record company provides him half of his fee as well as the Green Book, a book listing hotels and places to eat that will accept blacks.The trip doesn't begin well with Shirley finding Frank to be uncouth and intolerable to his refined ways. For Frank it's just a job and he's willing to put up with the attitude he gets from Shirley along the way. With each passing mile we learn more about each man though. In Frank's case while his background has led him to think less of blacks he still has an appreciation for many of them. This is shown as they drive and he plays popular music by Chubby Checker and Little Richard which Shirley seems to not know or perhaps not care for.The stops along the way aren't bad at first but there is still a different treatment to be found for Shirley than there is for the other two white members of his trio and Frank. Frank is stunned at one hotel which the Green Book lists as a wonderful place but turns out to be closer to a low level motel. But it isn't just the places that display the prejudice found in the locations but the prejudice that both men possess as well.Thrilled when they are in Kentucky to find a Kentucky Fried Chicken joint Frank stops and buys a bucket but Shirley refuses to eat saying eating with his hands just isn't right. Frank threatens to toss a piece in the back seat with him and eventually Shirley takes a piece and begins eating. He's had no experience with fried chicken which Frank can't believe because ""his people"" all love fried chicken and collard greens. Shirley takes offense to this and after a short argument Frank realizes maybe he doesn't know what being black is all about after all. But Shirley has his own set of prejudices as well. His snobbish ways get to Frank and the two go back and forth as they're on the road. And as the trip progresses they both come to learn about one another.When the pair begin to move through the South is when bigger issues come to play. As they have traveled Frank has come to appreciate the skill and genius that Shirley displays while performing. He also begins to notice that the people that Shirley performs for might appreciate his skill but not the man. He is refused restrooms, dressing rooms and eventually even a meal in the main restaurant. Where Frank can't understand why he would be treated this way, Shirley knows where it stems from. But can these two men get past all of that?The movie works on so many levels and never becomes dull. I test a movie on my remote: do I want to fast forward or not? I never felt the need to hold the remote the entire picture. The script is amazing (and an Oscar winner too), the direction is perfect and the acting by both men in the leads is amazing to watch (Ali also won an Oscar for supporting actor).Perhaps best of all is that we have a movie discussing the history of race relations in this country as they were in the sixties but we don't have that excess amount of violence or required Klan rally to sit through. While these things occurred the story isn't about those things but about how two men can conquer the so called norms of the time and become friends. It shows that such things are indeed possible. That's a story that needs to be told in today's world."
GREEN BOOK,18 July 2021,10/10,"I've never ever seen a concept of a white man working for a black man in the times when racism was common. Usually, it's done in the way that a black man works for a white man, but the opposite is a complete game-changer for me.The characters are extremely well developed. Usually, in films with character development the characters become from evil to saint, but in Green Book, they were never evil in the first place, just flawed and by the end of the film they do not become perfect like in other films either, but here they become better people but not fully perfect. Also in this film, they slowly learn from each other while they are completely different people with completely different cultures but with time they find a shared bond. For example, there is one scene, where they eat chicken and find out that they are not so different after all, I think it's an incredibly deep and subtle showcase of cultures.Then there's also tons of stuff about racism that I can relate to a lot personally, many scenes felt as if straight taken from my life. The ending of this film is one of the most heartwarming things I've ever seen.Just like Crash (2004), it's a movie about racism, but it's not the main message that makes it a masterpiece."
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2019,9/10,A journey that changes one's view of racism and friendship. Nice screenplay. Had some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a long time. Smart and funny comedy. Brilliant.
GREEN BOOK,17 December 2018,8/10,"A immensely likeable true story of a couple of New Yorkers, one, an Italian from the Bronx hired as a driver to a black man from Manhattan, a piano prodigy, on a Southern bound tour w/his band. Played by Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali respectively, this offbeat duo generate credible warmth & understanding as we see 2 opposites deal w/an ever changing world. Coming from Peter Farrelly, one half of the writing/directing duo behind many gross out hits, this down to Earth 'reel but true' account of this mismatched pair hits the right note of historical perspective & measured levity in a story that could've gone badly if presented incorrectly. Luckily the performances of the leads garner much good will making the obvious tough scenes of racial prejudice go down w/the right amount of distance & recognition."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,9/10,"Masterpiece. My second favorite film of 2018. I want it to win Best Picture. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are perfect together, I mean their chemistry is amazing. I heard people called this movie racist but I don't think it really is, it is 60's. I really liked the car. Viggo should make more movies I absolutely love him. Mahershala is becoming on of the best black actors working today especially in True detective in which he is amazing. Go see this movie before Oscars."
GREEN BOOK,23 September 2020,4/10,"So, coming to this one late I have to say it makes me hate the Academy a little more. The fact that this won THE Oscar is nothing but pandering in an effort to make the Oscars seem less racist. Racial equality is tremendously important but by glorifying tripe like this nothing is actually accomplished.This is extra disappointing because our two leads give really great performances. You really feel Ali's passion and conflict as well as Mortensen's growth. The story is so dull though and it's been done, and done better. An unlikely pair are thrown together and through their journey they learn to see from the other's perspective. Yeah, that's great and all but throw something in there to spice it up and in the process be a little less obvious about things.This is all made worse when you realize a central part of this movie involves Mortensen's character teaching Ali's how to be black. ""Come on, you people love this stuff"" should not be such a frequently visited topic. Is this sort of thing that shows that the academy saw a piece about racial cooperation and jumped on it without bothering to actually pay attention to what they're watching. I mean, thank god Ali really becomes part of Mortensen's family in the end.This is a frustrating movie. It didn't deserve the big award because it's not a great movie but it does have very strong performances. I want to recommend it for the leading pair but this really has some skewed messages on things. It's worth the watch if your curious and can find it streaming. Just prepare to be underwhelmed."
GREEN BOOK,26 October 2021,8/10,"A very different part for Viggo to play and he does it really well. It's just a shame he's such a gross character for the most part. I do think that he deserved an Oscar for this very unusual performance on his part. I also thought that Mahershala Ali did a great job and deserved his Oscar, but I wouldn't have called him a supporting Actor as the film is actually, essentially all about his character.It seems like both Tony and Dr Don had something to learn, which I would guess is kind of the whole point of the film and I like that balance and the way that racism is almost confronted from both sides. I'm not sure I would like to share a car ride with either of them though. I couldn't cope with Tony's mess or Don's moral high-ground.It is a good story and I'm glad that I've seen it. It shows the trials that both black and white face from both points of view without going over the top. Its not all the gang violence, drugs and constant swearing of 'Boyz In The Hood' and 'Moonlight' or 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' It's delivered in a much better way that makes it enjoyable, easy to watch and still gets the message across.Good direction and filming, with what seems to be authenticity.785.85/1000."
GREEN BOOK,25 July 2019,7/10,"This is a decent movie. It is not a great movie. There were half a dozen films I can think of off the top of my head that were made this year that were better. Is it worth watching? Sure. It has some decent acting, some fun moments, and a good heart. But does it deserve to go down in history as the best movie made in 2018? No. I'm predicting now that this film will forever be labeled as one of the weird upsets that inevitably happen in the Academy's history. Was this the worst outcome for Best Picture this year? No, they could've given it to ""Black Panther""."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,7/10,Some parts didn't ring true and appeared gimmicky such as the gemstone and the interaction between Dr. Shirley and Nick. I thought Virgo Mortensen deserved a lot of credit for his acting..
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book is an incredible comedy drama that tackles weighty and relevant themes. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen both give incredible performances with amazing chemistry. Its excellently paced, constantly engaging throughout. It's beautifully filmed and Peter Farrelly's direction is great. It also has genuine emotional moments, both heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measure. Its also really funny throughout."
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,9/10,"Tony the Lip as they call him over being brutally honest and having a big appetite and is street smart former war vet who is also a bouncer Italian American who has to wait two months for his job at a nightclub closes down for renovations.

GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,,"This movie told a story when America and the American whites were so deeply biased to the black Americans. With this movie, some deep wounds would have been healed, some injustice when treating we human beings would be justified. It also showed how two extremely different kinds of people, with different growing up backgrounds, well educated or not, through a long journey, both gradually open up and tried to accommodate each other and finally completely merged as a one great American that should be, although came a bit late.This movie also felt like an educational road trip, both characters were at first so stereotyped biased by their own cultural and ethnic backgrounds, the ways how they each grew up, a complete different kind of day-and-night races, but through endeavor from each side, they have both transformed into a better person, not just relying on each other, but also educated each other, and proved that racial differences was the least thing to be bothered. Loyalty and friendship through the long road trip gradually grew organically.The guy who threw two water glasses just used by two black plumbers in the very beginning, then transformed into a person who'd sacrifice anything to protect the person whose race he used to dislike even hated so much, it was told by the storyline so naturally and subtly, simply allowing us, the viewers, to understand our own morality and emotions with deeper insight, a soul search and recognition to we human beings, and completely change us like those two characters in the movie; more open-minded with a well balanced conservatism and liberalism.A great road trip story was told here."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,9/10,"Text: GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An above-standard road movie that enthralls with its powerful message and offers two of the best performances of the year.JIM'S REVIEW: Road movies are nothing new. They usually follow a predictable formula with two mismatched people who begin as distant strangers and end as the best of friends. But getting there is the challenge. Past Oscar-winning best picture favorites like It Happened One Night (1934), Rainman (1988), and Driving Miss Daisy (1989) have successfully elevated this genre due to strong acting and a script that brings these character studies to life. Now we can now add another title to this illustrious group...Peter Farrelly's immensely satisfying Green Book.Green Book takes that narrative structure of these celebrated films, although it owes a great deal to the latter. Let's call it Driving Dr. Shirley, especially due to its primary subject being race relations as its two characters meet and travel down south in 1962. But just as that film had two great performances (by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman), this film can also boast about two sensational performances and a literate screenplay that deals with racism head-on.Based on a true story, the film takes these two vastly different personalities on a journey to self-discovery. The simplistic plot revolves around driving a gifted musician into Jim Crow territory to perform concerts for his upper class patrons who can accept his talent but not his race. Taking the maestro to his musical destinations is a bigoted lout named Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga from the Bronx. The obvious set-up is a battle of class vs. crass. Dr. Shirley is uptight, snobbish, and a sophisticated prig; Tony is loud, brutish, and a redneck. This odd couple are destined to debate and argue their one-sidedness as they journey on.Helping them cross the Mason-Dixon Line safely is a little green book, a Negro Motorist CliffNotes guide to safe lodgings and restaurants in the Confederate South. Of course, there will be a series of run-ins from local haters which will bring together Tony and the Doc, as he is nicknamed by Mr. Bada Bing. That is a given. But the treatment to these intolerances is handled very astutely by Mr. Farrelly. He captures the 60's era well and allows his two actors to inhabit their roles. Kudos to the detailed production design by Tim Galvin too.The powerful screenplay by Brian Currie, Nick Vallelonga, and the director is quite effective in its underplaying of events. It depicts the violence and overt racism on display very clearly. My only problem with the film is the continual stereotyping of Italian-Americans. This film, like many others, does proliferate that pre-conceived notion with its cliched roster of thick accents, shady gangster types, and food-gorging personalities.However, what makes this film so very special are the two stand-out lead performances. Mahershala Ali is wonderful in the less showier role as Don Shirley. He shrewdly tampers down the anger, frustration, and righteous indignation of a man ""not black enough, or white enough, to fit into any world"". Mr. Ali plays the role hiding the rage simmering within him. It's a revelation to see his acting range. Viggo Mortensen is terrific as his bodyguard and chauffeur. He plays this strutting bull as a foolish oaf and yet somehow makes Tony endearing. The actor imbues his character with a sense of humanity, avoiding all the pitfalls in this cliche-ridden role. Both deserve many accolades this award season. Also making a strong impression in a smaller role is Linda Cardellini as Tony's loving wife, Dolores.Green Book cast a mirror on racism, exposing our past mistakes and reminding us that things really have not changed in over a century. Sad."
GREEN BOOK,21 January 2019,6/10,"My Rating : 6/10Good film. Leaves the viewer happy and satisfied, 'Green Book' cleverly goes about its business tackling important socially-conscious issues (with an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history) with ample humour and nobility.Open up your heart to this funny and immersive road movie about an unlikely-friendship."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is multi-layered, funny, and deeply moving. A movie about social class and racism, told in a unique, fresh way. This is a truly amazing movie."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,7/10,"Viggo Mortensen definitely gives a fine performance in this movie as Tony Vallelonga, a man who shares the racial prejudices of his Italian-American world but then learns to overcome them during the eight weeks that he drives gay Black piano player Don Shirley through the 1960s American South. It's a great role - as it should be, since the script was written by the real-life character's son, Nick Vallelonga. Granted, it's hard to imagine that a man who came from that much prejudice so easily overcomes homophobia - he's even willing to spend the night in the same bedroom with Shirley - but the script was clearly written to make Tony Vallelonga look good.Granted, it's a little hard to accept Mortensen physically at times, since the original Vallelonga ate astounding quantities of food - and was a very big guy as a result - but I guess there was no point in putting him in a fat suit.My problem with the movie, which I enjoyed, is that the script did not do a very good job of developing Don Shirley's character. Anyone who has seen *Midnight* knows that Mahershala Ali, the actor who plays him here, could have handled a complex character, but he isn't given a lot to work with. It's a shame, because it would have made for a more interesting movie.The whole movie is really the relationship between these two characters. The rest is all fine, but peripheral."
GREEN BOOK,21 November 2018,10/10,"Sometimes being alone means not being accepted. A fact that some have attempted to convey in the art of cinema, but only a few reach the precision and emotional strength of Green Book which shows not only the complex and dark social issues of the 1960s but also demonstrates the power and emotion of feeling truly alone.This movie contains a massively wide range of emotions. At times, the story is driven by love, romance and family. At other times, the characters live in racism, homophobia and segregation as it directly addresses and shows the darkness of the 60s in the United States. Yet still, the viewer will be surprised by the amount of humor and wonderfully vibrant moments that are portrayed. They will make you laugh in all the right places, without interrupting truly emotional moments.Taking place in the 1960s, Green Book follows the highly famous and incredibly successful pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who takes great risks as an African American man touring through the highly racial deep south. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) accompanies Shirley going from his driver to savior to eventually, his close friend. As the tour progresses, the audience goes through many parts of the south where not only racism was prevalent against African Americans and Italians, but also acknowledge the severe homophobia that existed so terribly in the 1960s.Perhaps one of the most lovable aspects of this movie can be attributed to the story itself. Every person in the film has a major character arc in which they become completely reshaped and remolded by the end. The entire cast performs with Oscar-worthy emotional portrayals of their characters. Mahershala once again delivers absolutely heart-wrenching scenes as the audience becomes acquainted with the lonesome and depressed life Don Shirley lives in, despite being unarguably talented and highly intelligent. The complexities in the set design, costume design, and overall tone of the entire world never run out of depth as the entire film feels as if it truly belongs in the 1960s, despite being shot nearly half a century later. Director Peter Farrelly may be seasoned in humoristic comedies, but makes sure his background stays separate for this film. With his lead, the audience experiences bitter reality and, with the help of cinematographer Sean Porter, view a vivid and colorful picture of United States in the 1960s, from up north in New York all the way to down south in Alabama.Cinema about musicians would be blasphemy without an impressive soundtrack to follow suit. From music considered modern and pop for that era, to classical pieces hundreds of years old, Green Book promises a highly wide and diverse soundtrack that highlights itself as one of the greatest this year. Furthermore, the music tells the story as it begins with 1960s music, but slowly goes more and more towards classical and orchestral as the story unfolds and the viewer learns more about the conflicts of pianist Don Shirley. Furthermore, despite being over two hours long, the film keeps you captivated for the entire runtime and leaves you satisfied with a natural and beautiful ending.Instead of a favorite scene, I would like to talk about several sequences present in the film. Since they're on tour, of course, Shirley and his fellow musicians in his trio are shown playing music. Yet, this varies in emotion, strength and passion as real-life events impact Don Shirley's craft just as the events impact his actual character. The power of his work never dwindles and always leaves you in awe. During the performance scenes, every aspect of the film shines with absolutely masterful cinematographic compositions that seem to isolate the musicians and truly captures the raw emotions such powerful music creates.Despite the beauty and power that hold true throughout this film, it does have things to concern parents. As previously stated, the film embraces the bitter and blunt reality of the 1960s, from homophobia to racism. This makes it most appropriate for ages 14 to 18, as well as adults. I absolutely give the film 5 out of 5 stars for its powerful portrayal of an inspirational journey that promotes courage, activism and always doing what's right in the world.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,8/10,"Green Book is a captivating film that contains the right amount depth, story and humour. It is then delivered well by outstanding performances. A beautiful story is told here. It is one of unique friendship in tough and unsettling times. Two different people from different worlds collide and form a bond. The beauty of a film is it doesn't try too hard to sell its message it effortlessly delivers it, you just have to join the Doctor and Tony for the ride. Every few years a few great films are produced and Green Book is one of them.This journey and film started with the two both agreeing it was important to do every tour. At the last tour they are able to walk away from it when they realise the tour and contract was not so important anymore.8.5/10"
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2018,10/10,"From one of the directors of such gross out comedies like There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber, and Me Myself and Irene comes a dramedy worthy of awards talk called Green Book. The title of the movie is from a green book that the main characters use during the racial era of the 1960s as they go on a road trip from the northeast to the deep south. I won't spoil anything for you, but it's worth the 2+ hours in the theater. See it with friends and family and enjoy it!!!"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,"This is not a ""Christmas""movie but it does take place during the holidays. In this film two people who think they are opposites in reality have more in common than they have differences.In this film Dr Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.This film does so many unexpected things and does them so well that you want to stand up and cheer. This is the best film I have seen in the past few years. Go see it!"
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,9/10,"This movie is great on so many levels: the acting is superb (Mahershala Ali, Viggo Mortensen and Linda Cardelini completely win your heart); the writing is well crafted (balancing tension and wit); the period is faithfully represented; and the characters are full and believable. I went to this movie expecting it to be good, because of the talent involved, and I was thoroughly entertained. I give this movie a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama based on a real friendship}"
GREEN BOOK,20 August 2019,3/10,"Directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardinelli, Joe Cortese, Dimiter D. Marinov, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tom Virtue, Brian Stepanek, Iqbal Theba, P.J. Byrne, Maggie Nixon. (PG-13)Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen), loving husband and father, wise-guy-adjacent tough guy, and casual racist, is selected to drive acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) on an eight-week road trip through the Deep South; no need for the audience to bring the rose-colored shades since all cameras used to shoot this picture apparently had that filter on preset. Old-fashioned to the point of insult, the majority of the running time is spent in the company of both men, who ""learn"" from each other and ""bond"" as a result (at least they both know how to eat fried chicken by the end), although their camaraderie rarely exceeds the level of a second-rate buddy movie. It's a trial to watch good actors like Mortensen and Ali try to breathe life into one of the hokiest and most obvious screenplays for a major motion picture in several years; granted, it doesn't help that Mortensen chooses to play it too broad (the crass Italian-American stereotyping feels pulled less from reality than from sketch comedy). Ali fares a little better, but his tightly-wound but injured stoicism does not profit from the producers' decision to rarely let Shirley be onscreen without Vallelonga, depriving us of critical reactions and emotions that aren't surface-deep and observed through another character's eyes. (There's even a brief episode where it's revealed that Shirley is gay, but Vallelonga barely seems interested and the movie never brings it up again.) Focusing almost entirely on the white character wouldn't have been so problematic if Vallelonga actually showed growth and regret and changed for the better, but he's pretty much the same person he was at the beginning, just willing to accept this specific black man as slightly-more-friend-than-employer. Designed and packaged as crowd-pleasing fare, and the con seemed to work when it nabbed a Best Picture Oscar, but this is little more than a clumsy reversal of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" another inexplicable populist victor that feels a little embarrassing in retrospect.32/100"
GREEN BOOK,15 November 2020,9/10,This movie really gave you the intachables vibe it is sooooo good man I wish this movie had more rating than this
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,8/10,Indeed. An Italian-American working in a nightclub in the sixties of last century accepts the job of driver of an African-American pianist during a tour the latter is going to do in the Deep South. Their very diferent cultures and minds soon lead to situations of deep disagreement. Nevertheless as the tour goes on they begin to be closer to each other and they end up not only undertanding and respecting each other but also becoming respectful friends. This is speciallly patent when durig the tour the negro pianist is a target of racial discrmination and even of physical aggression and always gets help from his driver. A movie that shows excellently how was the American society at that time particularly in the Deep South and how the relationship between those two so different men develops itself.
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,8/10,"'Green Book' definitely plays to the strengths of its two magnificent leads Viggo Mortensen, who plays Tony Lip (a chauffeur who loves his family), and Mahershala Ali, who plays iconic pianist Don Shirley. The film is told majorly from the perspective of Tony, who at the beginning of the film is going through a troubled time after the club he works for, is closed under unforeseen circumstances. This is when he ends up taking a chauffeur-cum-bodyguard job for Shirley who's taking a tour of the South. The pianist makes his entry a good 15-20 minutes in, and by then, we already have an idea what kind of a person Tony is, and what his stand against people from other backgrounds is.The film builds the relationship between Shirley and Tony one scene at a time, and it does so, at an unhurried pace. Tony realizes how big of a talent Shirley really is, yet he observes Shirley subjecting himself to a tonne of atrocities coming his way by his contractors simply because he is a Jamaican-American. That being said, the film does make us ha-ha a fair bit as well when it's not busy trying to create a 'moment'. The scene where Tony introduces Shirley to Kentucky Fried Chicken is a laugh-riot!Shirley is safe in the hands of Mahershala Ali whose realistic shades make the character truly magnetic. Mortensen seems to have had a blast playing Tony and it shows. For a movie that has a legendary pianist at its core, the music (by Kris Bowers, additionally a recording by Shirley himself was used; Robert Plant also played a key role in recommending the kind of upbeat music that keeps the film musically rich) is pretty convincing. Ali does his bit to make us feel the effort put in by Shirley during each of his contractual performances.Linda Cardellini (who plays Tony's wife Dolores) and the rest of the cast provide ample support. Even if one feels that it employs the 'white savior' trope to an extent, the film, on a larger scale, is about how the Tony and Shirley play off each other during their casual conversations and the wonderfully brewing friendship between the two. The title, a reference to the motoring guide for the colored in the Southern part of the States from those trying times, is a subtle shade in itself. The motel-halts made by Tony and Shirley during their journey act as the playground for pivotal incidents that lead to strengthening the bond and levels of compassion between the trash-talking driver and the want-no-trouble pianist.Green Book makes you guffaw, shed a tear, and feel good at the end of it all - certainly worth the viewing! It will surely win you over with its earnest storytelling, outstanding performances, and the unconventional chemistry between its leads. Knowing when to be funny and serious, the film touches upon a number of concepts that require open discussion in the modern era. Peter Farrelly, known so far as the co-creator of several slapstick comedies (with his brother Bobby), strikes gold in his first solo directorial."
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,10/10,"Wow, this movie had just about everything you could want, incredible story, brilliant acting, amazing cinematography and authentic sets dragging us back to the post war years.The story ran at two levels, the first being the clash of two worlds and the coming together in mutual respect, and dare I say it love, and enduring friendship. The second was allegorical, with Tony Lip representing the American consciousness of the time, fixed, opinionated, racist, white and masculine. Don Shirley represented a whole collection of threats to these societal attitudes and by undertaking a concert tour in the ""deep south"", consciously anticipated trouble. It was clear that Don in his own quiet way was doing his bit for the civil rights movement.Both leads were breathtaking in their attention to their craft, Mr Mortensen depth of characterisation was masterful, we all new Tony, we had all met a Tony and we all respected Tony who new his place and inadequacies but was not frightened of facing his demons. Mr Ali used micro gestures and method to convey a talented, fragile loner who we all just wanted to hug.If I had two Oscars to hand out I would give one to Mr Mortensen and one to Mr Ali.I would draw attention to one scene that was so powerful we writhed in our seats and some weak souls cried openly, not me! When Don Shirley said ""I'm not white enough, I'm not black enough, I'm not man enough, who am I!This is a must see, I can see why the movie was called Green Book, but really Mr Shirley's Driver would have been better."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2020,10/10,"This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well."
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2019,7/10,I like the main actor here. I forget his name. The racism really shines through in this movie. I don't think the connection between the two men were strong enough. I wanted to see both men a little more tough. Their experiences and situations in life required them to be strong and rough. The film was weak in depicting that. Still it was a great effort7 stars
GREEN BOOK,20 July 2021,7/10,"""Green book"" is about a black classical pianist going on tour in the South of the USA at the beginning of the sixties. The title is derived from a travel guide that contained the adresses that welcomed coloured people in the South of the USA at that time.The film evidently has much in common with ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989, Bruce Beresford), and I don't mean the fact that both films won an Oscar. In both films there grows a friendship between white- and black people, one being a chauffeur, the other his employer. The difference is however that in ""Green book"" it is the employer who is black and the chauffeur that is white.Despite the winning of the Oscar, I didn't see the film when it was released. I had my doubts and these doubrs where feed mainly by the name of the director. With films as ""Dumb and dumber"" (1994) and ""Dumb and dumber To"" (2014) Peter Farrelly had not exactly the name of producing sophisticated movies.In the beginning of the film Farrelly confirms his reputation for the caricature. I am referreing to the following:Tony Lipp (the white driver played by Viggo Mortensen) shows himself to be a fierce racist when he throws away two glasses from which black plumbers had drunk a glass of water at his house.The addiction of Tony to junk food is a visual running gag throughout the film, but not very subtle either.The homosexuality of Dr Donald Shirley (the classical pianist and employer of Tony Lip, played by Mahershala Ali) is so obvisous that I don't consider revealing his coming out as a spoiler.This caricatural beginning leaves however a lot of space for growing towards each other in the rest of the film, and both actors grab this space. Especially Ali grows more convincing during the film. At the end the spectator understand the pain that it causes to be a star on stage and a nobody (that is not allowed into a fancy restaurant) off stage. Even on stage racism is not totally absent because the music of some composers is reserved for white pianists only.Of course the film has a happy end, but by that time the film for me had regained a lot of goodwill. All in all a good film against normal measures, but on the weak side for an Oscar winner. After all, noblesse oblige."
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,6/10,"""Hollywood"" is often used as a pejorative when describing films. In Spanish they say ""americanada"" to mean just about the same thing. Hollywood as an insult usually means predictable, over-saccharin, and always with a happy, feel-good ending. Green Book is guilty as charged. The funny thing about ""Hollywood"" movies, they are quite often very entertaining. Once again guilty as charged.I will defend ""Hollywood"" to my Spanish friends by simply reminding them that most European movies are dreadfully boring, poorly directed (my biggest complaint), and they could use a little ""Hollywood.""Viggo Mortensen was less than totally convincing as the New York Italian tough guy. The movie held nothing in the way of surprises. I like the fact that it didn't try to rewrite America's shameful history of racism but it at least gave us a glimpse of hope on a snowy Christmas Eve on a rural back road. We can do better as a nation. We have to do better.Green Book is shy of being a good film, but my standards have been lowered considerably because of the torrent of crap I've watched this past year."
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,7/10,"Based on a true story, this drama retells of how Italian-American bouncer-turned-driver Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga and African-American pianist virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley became friends during a 1960's concert tour of the Deep South. The plot may be relatively simple but the road trip these two embarked on couldn't have been more difficult. A turbulent time for African-Americans (when isn't it?) - particularly down south - Dr. Shirley faced constant racism in his pursuit to spread the splendour of his music. Written by a trio including Nick Vallelonga, the screenplay has some issues. Operating in the well-worn 'odd-couple' subgenre (it's essentially a flipped Driving Miss Daisy), it relies heavily on cliché to progress their relationship along. Dr. Shirley is the hard-nosed, cultured artist who at first is dismayed by Tony's uncouth behaviour, however, after bonding over racist cops, pub beat-downs and eating fried chicken (that Tony introduces to Dr. Shirley), their vast differences become the glue to their friendship. Yet the familiarity of the plot beats and character developments is largely surpassed by two powerhouse performances that elevate proceedings beyond the midday-movie script. Mahershala Ali imbues Dr. Shirley with layers of hidden guilt and regret, not least over his ostensible distance from the black community, whilst his stiff upper lip veneer subtly wavers through a plethora of emotional tribulations. As the other half of the duo, Viggo Mortensen's no-frills wiseass is also a complicated beast; his desire to do the right thing and be a more well-rounded person constantly battles with his overt masculinity and lack of formal education. Showered with awards nominations and wins already, Green Book overcomes its narrative shortfalls through commanding, complex portrayals by Ali and Mortensen."
GREEN BOOK,28 April 2019,7/10,"""Green Book"" tells the story of a talented musician of color who needs a driver for a tour to the South of America. When he is confronted with a rather direct Italian with some mafia contacts, a tour begins in which they both learn a lot about racism and themselves.The movie has a very touching and inspiring story. There were some controversies regarding the authenticity of that story and it should be stated that it is not sure to which extent the film is based on true events. The producers have an eye for comedy elements and tend to use them quite often, which is good for the entertainment value of the production but sometimes prevents a more sinister look on the underlying questions and problems. As it is, the movie is a good one and an enrichment but it isn't, in my eyes, absolutely outstanding.All in all this is surely worth a watch and raises some questions for the audience to think about. I would have preferred an approach that is less focussed on entertainment but that choice sure has its upsides."
GREEN BOOK,8 October 2020,9/10,"""Green Book"" is a great film about frendship because of 4 facts:1. The film is based on a real story: In 1962 Dr.Donald Sirley, a classical pianist needs a chauffeur for a travel through the center and the south of the united states and Tony Vallelonga called Tony Lip will be his chauffeur.2. It's a beautiful story of trhe friendship between two very different men: Tony Lip, an uneducated man, bouncer of a nightclub of New York, an Italian American and Doc. Donald Shirley, an African American man, very good classical pianist, who has played in very famous places, who has been with very important persons, but also is a very solitary man !!3. ""Green book"" is a great road movie: Tnoy and Doc begin a large travel through the states: in nthis large they will know each other better and they will appreciate each other better.4. Were are in 1962 and the African Americans are still victim of the racial discrimination: the title of the film is very clear: African American can only stay in hotel for coloured people, in the Deep South or in the Bible Belt as some people say they can't eat in a restaurant or they can't buy a suit in a shop for white people.Finally it's a film about gratitude: When Tony safes the Doc Don Shirley in a bar or later in a Y.M.C.A. the doc shows his gratitude for this saving,then Tony fights with a police officer, both go to jail and Doc manages to freee them ,Tony shows his gratitude for this help.
And we have this final scene in the apartement of Tony at Christmas, Doc Don Shirley arrives, immediately the wife of Tony recognizes him , gives him a great hug and thans him for helping her husband so beautiful love letters.
I enjoyed very much the performances of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortsensen !!"
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2019,,"Ali and Viggo Mortensen, bring to screen a chemistry that is poignant and rousing. Yet, for a film that underscores the ability of American racism to permeate the length and breadth of public consciousness, Green Book gives an inexplicable viewpoint of racism. Much of the movie's commentary on racism is designed in the past tense and even the condemnation comes with a straightforward solution. As if implying, that racism is one of those problems that once existed and is now eradicated. Even Tony's bigotry, is shrouded in layers of sympathy - the kind displayed by well-meaning, but eventually racist, friends and family. It's this superficial self-congratulatory cliched tone threatening to undo the bonding of the odd-couple pairing for much of the film's two-hour runtime. Overall a great adaptation of a true story."
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,,"GREEN BOOK. In General ReleaseThe trailers promise a sort of Goombah Driving Miss Daisy. For once, the previews aren't lying. With the races reversed, Peter Farrelly's movie, based on a true tale, tells the story of an Italian restaurant bouncer Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who gets a gig driving black Piano Virtuoso Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour of the deep south. In 1962. A time and place where a little tough guy bouncing may come in handy. Shirley leads a musical trio, with two other (white) musicians.GREEN BOOK is genial enough, and, broadly, entertaining. There are a number of feel-good moments and a few that lead to cheers. But, for every successful bit, there are an equal number of groaners - and Kris Bowers' backing score is one long groaner, with every single emotional highlight signaled, underlined and highlighted in musical yellow markers. Fortunately, most of the music we hear is of Dr. Shirley's trio and Tony's fave car tunes including Little Richard, Chubby Checker, Aretha Franklin etc. (incredulously, Dr. Shirley claims to have never heard them prior!).Mortensen and Ali are fine actors, but, aren't given a shot at much beyond sit-com style hokum. Mortensen comes off at times like he's auditioning for an off-off-Broadway production of Goodfellas. Ali is a bit more effective, but, the script and Farrelly's lite Direction limit him. GREEN BOOK is so genial and it's heart in the right place that it's a difficult movie to outright dislike (although one really does regret that the movie doesn't take the time to fully explain the meaning of the title). Still, it's a movie that would have fit alongside DRIVING MISS DAISY in 1989, but, haven't we moved past it by now?"
GREEN BOOK,28 March 2020,7/10,"Based on a true story in the US deep south during the 60s, 'Green Book' is an enjoyable and moving film about an unlikely friendship between a black jazz musician and his white bodyguard and driver. It's a nice story and the film does a good job at balancing the humour and drama so that it feels neither too light or heavy.'Green Book' is well-written and looks great. The two main characters, Tony and Don, are brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali respectively. They work well together and share great chemistry, with some very funny moments and individual scenes.If I had one criticism, 'Green Book' does feel quite cliché and somewhat forced in getting its message across. Of course, race relations were always going to be a big part of this film as it is set in a time in American history when racism was rife, but I do often feel films like this try too hard to make a statement rather than simply tell the story."
GREEN BOOK,14 November 2020,8/10,"For some weird reason I didn't hear about this movie until a friend recently recommended it and I'm glad she did. Very well written, directed, and acted, it's even better when you know it's a true story and one of the protagonists helped writing it. Many critics seem upset the film doesn't go far enough in its criticism of systemic racism but that is not necessarily the point of the movie. There are a lot of other movies that choose this path; this one however chooses to focus on the story of 2 men on an unlikely road to friendship, and it does a wonderful job at that. Highly recommended!"
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2021,5/10,"This is better than Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). Magical, emotional, deep, simple, moral. It takes into consideration races, differences, stereotypes, discrimination... High level of characters and relationship. Bit action. Bit funny, romantic, poetic. Good landscape. Reminds me bit of police brutality, fights, etc. Some compared to Bohemian Rhapsody, there are more twists, less talk, more different things and action, also nice playing music. But still talk, time length, and boredom dominate. Was there more action, such as appearance of that national guard or gun, this would be much more interesting. Magical end, bit reminds me of Wakefield (2016), and this looks like somebody's subjective deep story of relationship. Also moral."
GREEN BOOK,10 November 2019,7/10,"People were sniffy about this, but i have to say i really enjoyed it.The film can be simplistic, but also very delicate. The sugarcoating is to the max, but it doesn't matter. Ali and Mortensen make a tremendously engaging, odd couple. Both giving nuanced and well-observed performances, that enabled me to survive the sentimentality."
GREEN BOOK,6 April 2019,9/10,"Based on a true story: In 1962, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) lives in an Italian neighbourhood in the Bronx and works as a nightclub bouncer. During a period of temporary unemployment, he signs on to work for renowned classical/jazz pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as a chauffeur as Shirley travels from his Manhattan home to locations in the US mid-west and Deep South for an arranged concert tour. As Shirley is African-American and the Deep South had segregation laws at the time, great difficulties are faced and the two men bond.The initial clashes between these two opposites is funny, moving, and genuine. The differences in advantage also make for an interesting dynamic. Tony has the advantage of race which is not only magnified while in the southern states; it also shows in his foolish assumptions he has about Don and black people in general. Don has the advantage of status, culture, and education which he often uses to criticize Tony in ways that make Don easily seem like an annoying teacher.The two lead performances are brilliant especially during a confrontation scene that takes place during a rainy night. Mortensen is raw and rough but with a human edge that shifts during an experience that is radically new to him. And Ali is exceptional in one of the best characterizations in many years.As Don, Ali begins by being truly irritating with his snobbishness and class prejudice. As the film progresses, the viewer at least begins to understand Don and even sympathize with him as his complexities are gradually exposed. And by the end, Don is not just likeable; he's downright loveable.In ""Moonlight"" (2016), Ali showed depth and subtlety in a role that was unfortunately too short. In ""Green Book"", his talents are on full display in an expanded role that shows his best. Again, his depth of subtlety comes through particularly in a scene when Don is vulnerable as he thinks he might lose Tony as his driver.Director Peter Farrelly, also a co-writer, shows a subtle touch especially in a scene that silently show southern blacks reacting to the presence of a fellow African-American who seems to have reached heights that may have thought impossible.A shocking scene that takes place at a YMCA building is one that could have been expanded but the secrecy behind it is actually appropriate given the time period.With so much going for it, ""Green Book"" carries the torch right to the end with a superb conclusion that is emotional but with the restraint that matches Don's character so well. It allows the tears to get close to the surface but without exiting the ducts. And Tony's wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) eases the the tension with a hilarious line - one of many in this great film. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Screenplay by Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, and Brian Hayes Currie2) Acting by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,8/10,"Seen must talked movie 'The Green Book'. Thinking that it would be a good movie. And to my wonder it is indeed a good movie. Based on a true story which is very simple not any twists or a single unbelievable situation. It is a saga of black and white human's friendship which grows from bottom to high sky. They give and takes interchange their native qualities. First part of the movie is not so impressive but when end is coming over then we realise the value of what we are seeing on the screen. Ending is very fascinating where 'Doc' comes Tony's house and meets them especially with Tony's wife.
As me this is the most emotional scene of the movie and other word it is highlight of the movie. Acting from Viggo Mortensen ( Tony ), Mahershala Ali ( Dr. Shirley) and Linda Cardellini ( Dolores ) are brilliant performance. Atmosphere of 18th century is created very well. Last credit gives you photo of real personalities of this story definitely will connect to the movie after ending too. Must watch for a different simple movie apart from routine Hollywood action or horror or science fictions.
It is filling like a chill shower of water pouring on you in high summer day."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,9/10,"It gives me great pleasure to add another glowing review amongst my many disappointments.My last was for Roma, which I gave 10 stars. I only gave this 9 although immediately after I gave it A10. I guess the only slight misgiving I had was the obvious manipulation of audience, including mine, emotions. Whilst you are swept up in it, enjoy it but afterwards I felt manipulated. Very different from the subtle approach of Roma, which was as emotional but was almost an aside. This is all about getting us emotional.That said, I said it was a glowing review. What everyone else said. 😁Great script, Viggo amazing, great score (read stirring), great cinematography, etc, etc.Oscar worthy."
GREEN BOOK,25 October 2020,10/10,"Note: The following is more of a critical essay than a film review.Rhetoric among some of the film criticism community is that there are too many ""white/bigot redemption"" tales in film in which a white character learns the ""error of his bigoted ways"". I remember one such critic complaining that we've got to stop convincing ourselves that another ""Driving Miss Daisy"" film will improve race relations. I am not persuaded that's exactly what these films are about or what they intended to accomplish. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was written by the nephew of the Daisy character and he just decided to explore the relationship between his aunt and her chauffeur in a play. If critics read into it that there was a specific moral agenda behind the story, maybe they're reading things into them that were not originally envisioned.I think at its core ""Green Book"" (unlike ""Driving Miss Daisy"") is about the mistreatment of a virtuoso musician among admirers because of race and ethnicity. The fact that he's cultured, well-mannered and a brilliant pianist are irrelevant. He is in subtle ways neglected and even abused by the Southern whites. Over and over again, his White Southern ""hosts"" have the opportunity to make an exception since he is the star performer. And over again, the Southern Whites never take exception. He's an African-American and therefore deserving of second-class treatment despite they admire his artistic ability.The relationship growth between the two opposites is certainly part of the story but for me it plays second banana to the overall story. Yes, other films are also about relationship growth that didn't overtly propagate to have larger moral implications. I am not sure for example that ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" was meant for viewers to lose all their prejudices about homosexuality and transgendered individuals. If viewers come away with an underlying moral message so much the better. However, I think it's unfair to the filmmakers and actors to be criticized for a film that may imply a moral statement but then be disparaged because it doesn't live up to it. I really don't think the main idea in ""Green Book"" is about how Tony Lip, the pianist's driver and body guard, becomes less prejudice as it is about how Don Shirley is mistreated in the South.At the forefront, ""Green Book"" focuses on a relationship triangle, the third part of the triangle doesn't emerge until about half-way through the film. The three parties involved include: a refined classical pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who happens to be African-American, an uncultured and uneducated bouncer from the Bronx, Frank ""Tony Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen), who happens to be Italian-American, and the former's Southern White American admirers. If it were not based on a true story maybe the premise would be harder to swallow. However, the film is based on two real people who entered the deep American South in 1962, Shirley on a concert tour, and Tony his driver/body guard employed by the former to provide damage control.If anything, the film is more about the hypocrisy and indictment of the pre-Civil Rights Act American South. I found the interactions between Shirley and his Southern White ""fans"" more jarring and more the ""point"" (if there is one) than supposedly how Tony Lip ""grows"" out of his prejudices. I am not sure that the film indicates that Tony's character ever ""transcends"" his own prejudices, because we never see him interact on a deep level with any other African-American characters. No question, the friendship between Shirley and Tony does grow, but sort of unexpectedly. However, we see over and over again the injustice of Shirley's treatment at the hands of not only his White ""hosts"" but even law enforcement.What is more apparent is that even though at the beginning of the film Tony reveals anti-African-American sentiment, he has a code. We first see him as a bouncer at a night club and he finagles his way to receive a large tip from a wealthy Italian. From the outset, we learn Tony breaks the rules to gain advantages. Later, those ""rule-breaking"" methods become crucial when Tony needs to get Dr. Shirley out of seeming impossible predicaments in the US South, particularly at the hands of racists. After agreeing to escort Dr. Shirley on the tour, we notice he doesn't waver from his commitment. This doesn't seem out of character at all. Yes, he is a brute and thug, but he also maintains his code of conduct, probably learned from the Bronx. You are always loyal to your employers, and there's even some implication that he does so prior to his commitment to Dr. Shirley.On the other side of the coin is Dr. Shirley, cultured and well-educated pianist. He has fans of his music performance in the Deep South. What is the most telling is how badly his Southern American admirers treat him, and I think that is more at the core of the film's underlying premise than anything else. As the characters journey deeper into the South, their confrontations with White Racism become more pronounced, which is why to compare this film to ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is not only ridiculous but rather unfair. Even though Shirley is introduced at the concerts by his Southern White hosts to his admirers, allowing him to dine with the Whites is unthinkable. Probably true to the era, they don't see anything wrong with it. Often Shirley and Tony are told ""it's just the way things are down here"" as if that rationalizes to satisfaction the Southern Whites' tendency to mistreat other people.Yes the two films are about a black and white driving in a car. Spike Lee lamented he always loses at the Academy Awards to films about a black and white in a car! While the repertoire of film literature is replete with many stories of relationship-growth, the main thrust here is about how an admired man is still mistreated because of his race and ethnicity. If you want to read into it that it's more about the redemption of Tony Lip. be my guest. But I think if that's what you come away with, I think they've missed the greater implications of the story."
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2019,9/10,From the writing to the acting everything was superb!They got everything correct in the period from the clothes to the cars and the music oh the music was diving.The Italian eating scenes has me rolling.Great movie. Not to be missed.
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2021,9/10,"Beautiful story where a somewhat racist Italian appreciates an African-American gifted at the piano. Very educational for all. It's a hilarious movie too, even more than comedies."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,6/10,"Is this the 2018 Oscar deserving movie?
How? It's not much more than a big cliché made movie!The music tells us when we are supposed to feel things. The stereotypes start and end where generally they do in these type of ""feel good movies"", with the mandatory redemptive scenes for both parties, because ""of course we know"" are always ""both parties fault"", just to make sure nobody gets too offended.Everything is calculated, cold. No decision artistic. Everything ""acceptable"" but forgettable.
Anyways. The movie is good, because it looks great, the pace is great, the music and dialogue fun and the actors good.
But still, the movie and story is so simplistic and forgettable, that is a shame this gets to be ""best of the year""."
GREEN BOOK,18 November 2018,8/10,"Well its hard to ignore that this looked like Driving Miss Daisy with the races of the characters reversed. It was also hard to ignore that Peter Farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films. While Green Book does have a ton of humor it was definitely a step in a different direction and a true story to adapt at that. I'm amazed at how much I liked this film. Every minute of this film is thoroughly enjoyable and it touches on every emotion.The film is about a loud mouth Italian American named Tony Lip who gets a job driving and being protection for a jazz pianist named Don Shirley. Initially, it is seen that the two come from different worlds and are at odds with each other but as time goes on and the two realize how different race relations are in the south, they begin to bond and become closer than they expected they would. Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in the title roles.The film has a lot of laugh out loud moments. Especially through the eccentric nature of both leads. Whether its Tony's hard headed but uncultured nature or Don's particularities , the chemistry between the two is really off the charts. The film touches on many important concepts that still reverberate today, mainly in race relations and acceptance of sexuality. Farrelly and the real life son of Tony Lip do such a fine job writing a film that knows when to be funny and when to be serious.I think the performances from both leads is also fantastic. We are about done with the year and I don't really care what other people say this should be getting nominations is a few categories at the Academy Awards. Was really surprised at how good this film was, as the trailers don't really show off the true excellence that this film was capable of. Urge everyone to go see it, about as good as a buddy road film will be.8/10"
GREEN BOOK,13 July 2019,10/10,"This is a great movie with some magnificent directing; it has some of 2018's best acting, writing and soundtrack. It's well cast, using big names like Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali that does a fantastic job at playing their real life counterparts. The dialogue between the characters are witty and you see the chemistry between everyone, mostly with the two main actors. The world building is just incredible with its sets, music, props and cars. You can so easily immerse into this biography period piece. The comedy is so clever written, beatifully executed by the actors. The funny writing cracked me up almost everytime.The acting is one of the highlights from Viggo Mortensen, a real talented actor that doesn't let down, ultimately bringing in one of his best performances. Mahershala Ali does the more drama heavy things as his role is much more personal, more important as the character grows in every scene and he portrays the character with perfection. It isn't his best acting performance but it's a memorable one! I'm going to end the review regarding the story, it's a story about two men on a journey in the controversy and sick racism in the 60's. We see them bond and become great friends whilst hearing some superb music, but the best part about the movie is their big road trip and it'll probably be a hit for a lot of people."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,10/10,"In 1962, in the middle of the night, in the pouring rain, in the Deep South Mahershala Ali's concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley in tears tells his driver Tony, played by Viggo Mortensen, ""So if I'm not Black enough! If I'm not White enough! If I'm not Man enough! So tell me what am I?"" Tony listens in resound silence. That resonates even in 2018. This is the lyrical power of Writer and Director Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"".The screenplay by Nick Vellelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Farrelly is based on the true story of the friendship of Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Vellelonga, who couldn't be more different or more unlikely. The wondrous screenplay authentically looks at the impact of prejudice with heart and a surprising sense of humor. On Tony and Don's road trip on their concert tour, Don delicately fingers his Kentucky Fried Chicken drumstick in the backseat, while Tony drives. Don has never eaten fried chicken before. Don admits it's actually quite good. I laughed so hard.Tony agrees to chauffer and ""bodyguard"" Don on his concert tour in the Deep South for 8 weeks, returning home to his understanding wife Dolores, plays by kind beautiful Linda Cardellini, by Christmas. Viggo's Tony was the bouncer, ""public relations"" man at the Copacabana Club in New York City shutdown because of a mob ""misunderstanding"". Tony is blue collar Italian American with street smarts: way wiser than he occurs. The Father of two boys, he's all heart.
Tony also pays attention. Viggo's distinct humanity is in being so present.Back in the 1960's the Green Book was the listing of all the approved Lodgings for Blacks. At times Tony and Don were not allowed to share the same hotels. On the one instance they do Tony looks out from his hotel room balcony. He spies solitary Don, alone sipping his glass of whiskey. There's more to Don's story than divorce and his estranged brother. Mahershala embodies a regal self-absorbed suffering in Don, who along with being the accomplished pianist holds two PhDs and a law degree. He is also very alone. Is his loneliness self-imposed or thwarted self-expression?Here Director Peter unconceals eloquent acceptance in the narrative. Don gratefully thanks Tony for saving him from himself. Tony compassionately says, ""I know it's complicated."" Later Don asks to see the letters Tony writes home to Dolores. They're horrendous. Consequently, Don dictates to Tony what to write, ""Dear Dolores...""Viggo and Mahershala amaze in their authentic love and soulful respect for each other. Mahershala is the brilliant straight man when comedy summons. He displays powerful awareness on the stark narrative turns. Viggo is masterful understatement. His Tony has his prejudice as we all do, yet through his eyes we see his compassion and deep regard for the man that Don is.Viggo's visage as Tony acknowledges the miraculous talents of artist Don. Don and his musical trio play for White privileged folk, who seemingly feign tolerance. Soon Tony discerns the pretense as mere tokenism, cloaked racism. So why does Don hold his tongue, graciously thanking his hosts, who only see him as Negro?Don's band mate Oleg, played by silently strong Dimiter D. Marinov, tells Tony, ""... Because it takes courage to change people's hearts."" Amen. Maybe we can't change what's in other people's hearts. What we can to do is have compassion in our own hearts. That's a place to start.That's the profound brotherhood of Tony and Don's journey. ""Green Book"" may be the very best movie of the year. At least it's my very favorite."
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,10/10,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that has the right balance of themes and execution to make it into an instant classic. When I first saw trailers for Green Book (2018), I initially thought it was just going to be an inverse of Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Instead, what I got was so much more than that. Green Book tackles the difficult task of presenting a harsh mirror on our past, with a knowing wink that some of these challenges are still present today. It is more subtle than BlacKkKlansman (2018), but the message still gets across in a heartwarming and wholesome way.What makes Green Book so engaging is the simplicity that it approaches such a nuanced and complex approach to the topic of racism. The irony that rich white people in the south would hold Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in such high regard as a musician but treat him as less-than-human the second he is not performing for them is stunning and appalling. The strength of the story certainly comes with the repartee between Shirley and his Italian driver, Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), in a way that shows all people can change for the better, even if it's in small steps.I have to commend the excellent music in this film, merely as a side-note to the fantastic screenplay. So many moments were laugh-out-loud funny or tears-to-your-eyes touching due to their ability to tie together moments that appeared earlier in the movie. Sure, some may call this film predictable or cliché, but it works in a way that's so engaging that you can't help but lose yourself in its narrative. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography that brings the story to life is top notch as well-utilizing shallow depth of field to masterful effect.An instant classic that everyone should see at least once, I give Green Book 5.0 stars out of 5."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2018,10/10,"Remember the Farrelly brothers? Yeah, that's a name I haven't heard in a little while. They were previously remembered to making a lot of farce comedies like Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and The Three Stooges. That makes it even more fascinating that one of them, Peter Farrelly is now directing a ""dramedy"" about race relations and friendship. The jarring shift in tone relates to the fact that the pair had been having trouble finding that same comedic fire from before. Movies like Hall Pass, The Three Stooges and Dumb and Dumber To were not hit movies with critics or at the box office. It makes sense that at least one of them would want to try something different.The good news is that even with a different kind of movie, it's still possible for a filmmaker to follow similar themes. In the case of Peter Farrelly, the main character is still a blue-collar man who goes on a journey. I think that's why he and his brother's movies before used to appeal to a mainstream audience; it was easier to relate to someone who was on a similar class level. So let's see what happens in Green Book, again a Farrelly production.In the early sixties, rough bouncer Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (played by Viggo Mortensen) is out of work when the nightclub he works at is closed for renovations. His experience leads him to be interviewed by a ""Doctor Don Shirley"". What Tony discovers is that Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali) is a musician who needs a driver to escort him for a concert tour in the Deep South. Though there is clear difference in class and race, Tony is hired based on his recommendation and that he would be a needed help within the segregated area.During the car ride, it's made clear that the two come from different worlds. Tony is unrefined, a slob and is proud of his rough Italian heritage while Don is classy, well educated and is proud of his classical training. Over time, Tony is impressed with Don's piano playing comparing him to Liberace and Don see's the humanity within Tony. The further they go south, the more Tony understands the unfair nature of segregation and Don is forced to see just how different his world is compared to African-Americans in the poorer areas. Though the two become friends, Tony is not only concerned he won't be home for his family on Christmas Eve, but that perhaps he'd been unfair in the past.I guess it shouldn't matter where Green Book came from; it may be one of my favorite movies of 2018. A lot of people might see it as that because it's addressing this issue. Truth to be told, that's not what this movies does well in. In fact, I see this movie as a class separation story that works thanks to its script and actors. The best movie I can connect this to is Driving Miss Daisy. That movie also addressed race relations in the Deep South, but was a story about friendship first. Green Book is also like that.The biggest difference is that along with two men, the plot has to two stuck in the car as they go to each town. Thankfully, the script allows for fun moments without seemingly too comedic. It's likely how the dialogue would have gone down with me if I was thrown into this situation. It's more natural then a lot of stories that probably would have skipped to the race relations' stuff.The winning combination is the two leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They both had challenging roles as they could have fallen into the stereotype trap. But thanks to a good script, both actors embrace their personas and make each of their characters more human by making them both susceptible to each others suggestions. This isn't a story where everything is changed, but that's also the idea. Its about tolerance rather then acceptance. Both are clear about each others differences, but still find ways to become friends. It's never boring and even leads into jokes that I found funnier then a lot of regular comedies. It's just a nice film overall.I'll give this ten pianos out of ten. I still have more award movies to watch, but I can see this playing over well during the holiday season. This is a kind of movie that isn't made too often, but need more of. Just movies that feel like pleasant conversations you'd have with any friend. This is a definite recommendation."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,10/10,"I love it when filmmakers who are usually classified, or tend to stick within one genre, or type of film only and then they eventually break that cycle and area of familiarity and do something radically different. In recent years I have cited examples such as Adam McKay who got away from his Will Ferrell films to do The Big Short, and not only was it the best reviewed film of his career, but it also won him a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. Something that most likely would not have happened if he had just stuck to his usual fare of manic if not sometimes annoying comedies. Also please take Todd Phillips who is also known for often raunchy teen oriented comedies such as The Hangover trilogy and others that pretty much fall into the same category. He branched out and tried a mix between comedy and drama in War Dogs, and whilst the film got mixed reviews generally, I would personally say that it was the best accomplishment of his career and further reaching out for new goals, he was also the producer of this year's version of A Star is Born which has been a big hit with audiences, critics and at the box office. Some say that it still has a very good chance to nab several Oscars, possibly even Best Picture. Now in this case with Green Book, we have writer/director Peter Farrelly who is again known for mostly doing gross out, or raunchy and immature comedies such as the Dumb and Dumber films and various others. I have liked some of his and his brother Bobby's work in the past, especially something like There's Something About Mary, but more often than not, their particular brand of humour was often far different than my own personal taste. This time around, Peter takes a true story and helps write the screenplay and directs, but here he chooses a film that has just as much if not more laughs than the films he would normally do, but also at the same time he gives the film a timely message of friendship and acceptance and I think anyone who is not deeply moved by the film on some level probably saw a different film than I did. It is full of rich humour and some of the best work from dependable actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The film is all the more timely because as we all know the problem with racism in our world is still running rampant and how refreshing it is to see two men from completely different backgrounds and are more or less worlds apart from one another and how they form a bond and connection that will lead to a lasting friendship and a road trip across the Southern United States that I doubt either man would ever forget. Viggo's character is a bouncer in several nightclubs in the Bronx area of New York. He has a large appetite, uses coarse language on a regular basis and is a little rough around the edges and tends to have a habit of either winning people over with his schemes and dubious personality, or at the same time completely offending, or turning people off as in the case of Mahershala Ali's character. Ali's character is a concert pianist with many degrees and doctorates and is very well spoken and educated. He couldn't be more different than Viggo's character if he tried. And there is also the cultural differences such as Viggo's Italian background and Ali's character being of African American descent. This looks like it would be the worst possible match in history and yet Viggo drives Ali's character across the United States for about two months to get him to his various different concert performances. The two will occasionally bicker with more often than not, Ali's character being completely exasperated and often offended and turned off by Viggo's character's more street type talk and peronality. However, as time goes by the two do form a common bond with one another and actually start to become friends. As well as on several occasions while in the deep Southern states that Viggo will come to Ali's rescue and one humourous instance where Ali uses a powerful ally to bail them out of a tough spot. This is a film about putting any and all prejudices aside and seeing goodness within your fellow man and learning to appreciate that. This road trip truly shapes these two characters in marvellous ways and we see that deep down under a rough exterior that Viggo's character has a huge heart and that Ali deep down is dealing with loneliness and his own trials and tribulations, but is further helped by Viggo's friendship and way, or should I say lack of way with words and handling people. This is an absolutely wonderful film that made me laugh more than any other film this year and at the same time it warmed my heart and moved me and helped me to appreciate the racist attitudes of the 60's when the film takes place and again show how we still need to further move ahead as a society. The performances by the two leads are I think the two best male performances I have seen this year and the characters are so wonderfully vibrant and full of emotions, personality and life all thanks to a meticulously researched and well scripted story for our actors and characters.
A film of this type of quality does not come along too often, so I suggest you see it while you can and do not be surprised to see various Oscar nominations and even potential wins. One of the best films of this year."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book tells the true story of Tony Lip(Viggo Mortensen) an Italian-American bouncer/chauffeur, who Dr. Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali) an African-American pianist hires, when he tours several venues in the deep south of America, during the 1960s.Green Book is a brilliant movie. Director Peter Farrelly has given us a film, that effortlessly blends both comedic & dramatic elements. There are scenes where you will be guffawing & there are also scenes that are emotional & leave you teary-eyed. The gorgeous locales have been captured beautifully by cinematographer, Sean Porter. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding as Tony Lip. The physical transformation that Mortensen went through to embody his character, is commendable. Mahershala Ali is spectacular as Dr. Don Shirley. Ali's nuanced yet powerful performance, deserves all the awards coming his way. The effortless chemistry between Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali, is what makes this film flawless. Linda Cardellini is fantastic as Dolores. The supporting cast is superb. Green Book is a must watch. Go, be entertained & moved."
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,9/10,"When the dust is settled on 2018, you can be rest assured that GREEN BOOK will be listed as one of my top films of the year.Yes, it's that good.""Based on a true story"", GREEN BOOK stars Viggo Mortenson (Aragon in the LOTR films) as ""Tony Lip"" a bouncer at the Copacabana in the early 1960's who is tapped by African American concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) to be his driver/escort/security on a tour of a very prejudicial Southern part of the United States in the early 1960's. Both Tony and Dr. Don look down their noses at the other one, but during the course of this film, the two develop mutual respect and a friendship that lasted until the both passed away in 2013.That is, in essence, the entire plot of this film. But it is not the destination, but rather, the journey that is the core of this film - and what a journey it is.We, the audience, probably spend 70% of the film in a car with the 2 stars of this film, so they better be interesting to look at and listen to (for nothing much else happens) and both characters - and both actors- are up to the task.Ali won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brief turn in Barry Jenkins MOONLIGHT - and he is even better here as Dr. Don Shirley, an elitist virtuoso piano player, with strong pride and hidden secrets of his own. Ali brings a humanity and vulnerability to this character that acts as a softening of the hard shell of this character that allows us, the audience, a glimpse into this character's heart. This person could easily have been a one-note caricature, but in Ali's hands, it is much, much more.The biggest surprise to me is two-time Oscar Nominee Mortenson as ""Tony Lip"". While the character starts as a typical early 1960's Italian-mob type, Mortenson brings humor, humanity and (yes) heart to a matter-of-fact character and continues to evolve the rough edges of Tony as Tony, himself, develops throughout the course of the film. I have always ""liked but not loved"" Mortenson, but, I LOVE HIM in this film and will be rooting for him come Oscars time.The other big surprise of this film is the strong, subtle and human way that Director Peter Farrelly brings events to the screen. Prior to this, Farrelly (along with his brother Bobby) Directed such over-the-top comedies as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and KINGPIN, so I was a bit concerned that the Direction would be over-the-top. But...it wasn't...and I wouldn't be surprised if Farelly's name is called when Oscar nominations are announced.I was charmed and moved by these characters - and this story - and was glad to spend 2 hours with them.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,10/10,"It did not only NOT suck but ruled! I haven't seen something this inspirational, something so well written, so well acted, the whole project was something of legends! This is a must see for everyone, learn something Dang! But artistically speaking, yes this is upper tier work; lets see what happens come trophy time, but my money is on this wonderful affair! This was spectacular! Mr. Ali is definitely going places!"
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,5/10,"I was hoping for a quality film but I found the film underwhelming. The acting performances were mediocre. Tony Lip character was portrayed as a generic sicilian goombah wiseguy. Dr. Donald Shirley was portrayed as a stuck up, arrogant douche with contempt for ordinary people. I couldn't find neither one of these characters interesting or likeable. They should have worked a little bit harder developing Dr. Shirley's character without the aloof attitude. Dolores was the only likeable character played by the lovely Linda Cardellini. I wish she had more screen time. The terribly italian pronounced spoken lines made me cringe. They really should have hired some native speakers for Tony's family.I am not sure why this film is rated so high. Its a 5 out of 10 at best."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,5/10,"It always seems a bit pointless trying to compare and rate films against each other. Quite sure there will be a heated debate going on about whether Green Book deserved to win the Best Film Oscar. According to the group of people voting for the Oscars this was the best film and they have just as much right for that opinion as anyone else. It wasn't my favourite, but hey ho.Green Book tells the unlikely friendship that is built between Tony Lip and Dr Don Shirley. Tony is a bouncer looking for temporary work. Dr Shirley is a black concert pianist about to go on a early 60's tour of the deep south and therefore in need of protection. The movie reminded me very much of Planes, Trains and Automobiles with one key difference. Somehow PTA seemed much more realistic at showing the tensions and empathy between the leads. Personally I didn't find Green Book that realistic at showing the friction and joy between Tony and Don. Being from the UK not familiar with the story and it was only quite late in the movie it suddenly dawned on me that it was a true story.Was it the best film of 2018? Yes ... according to the academy!"
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,9/10,"This story has been done to death with movies such as ""The Help"" and ""Race"" but what pulls it through are the Characters and the sense of humor employed. Viggo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali and Linda Cardellini are great in this movie. Their chemistry is believable and it's great to see how they play off eachother. They're the yin and yang to eachother in both background, mannerisms and class. Viggo plays a working class italian-american bouncer named Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga who reluctantly agrees to chauffeur a classical pianist named Dr. Don Shirley on his tour in the south during the 60's to make some side money. Along the way they both deal with injustices around the country and in the process begin to see eye to eye and develop a mutual respect for eachother.While successful, Shirley's also a victim of his own fame as his marriage failed due to his lifestyle and the isolation he feels from by both sides of society and his driver Tony doesn't care what people think about him and as such comes off as a sloppy thug to others. While they have biases of eachother they slowly began to lesson after sharing experiences of prejudice themselves. Probably a good example is when they get arrested by 2 racist cops after getting pulled over for driving past a sundown town which leads to Viggo punching one of the cops for insulting him.As they soldier on, Viggo writes daily to his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and with the help of Shirley his penmanship improves and leaves his wife touched. The reason I gave this movie 9/10 stars is because like I said earlier this story's been done before and while they're usually good the story's basically the same: The black character needs a white person to help them get by. However, the acting is what pulls it through and makes it a great movie. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself."
GREEN BOOK,29 May 2020,10/10,I'm not saying a word about this film other than to tell you to watch it!
GREEN BOOK,7 December 2019,9/10,"Viggo Mortensen was the best acting performance i have seen this year, better than Rami Malek performance and a better directed movie. Mahershala Ali and viggo mortensen just seemed to work so well and this film is more than just a Driving Miss Daisy remake."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,10/10,"REVIEW - GREEN BOOKBased on a true story of a road trip with a difference.A white racist bouncer is hired to protect and drive a black concert pianist around the US.All sounds ok so far but as its 1962 the deep south is still racist.This film wonderfully explores the growing friendship and respect that these 2 men share whilst driving from performance to performance.The racism experienced made me actually cringe, how these people just accepted their racism as being the norm.Wonderfully acted, wonderful story and enough humour to actually make me laugh out loud.What would you do if you didn't fit in with your own black community and also were not accepted by the white community?Thoroughly enjoyed this excellent film from start to finish.Rating 10 out of 10"
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,"When Viggo Mortensen in the role of heavy-set hustler Tony Vallelonga acts as driver and minder for highly-gifted if somewhat effete pianist Dr Don Shirley (here played to a tee by the ever-dependable but ever-better Mahershala Ali), the gorgeous, gigantic blue Cadillac with its radio and all still manages to overheat once and get a flat one other time, and its wipers don't work too well. Likewise, the gorgeous American landscape in this ""road movie"" set in 1962 is tilled by black farmworkers not looking a whole lot different from their slave ancestors a century before. And then there is the titular ""Green Book"" (of clubs, hotels, garages, barbers' shops, beauty parlours, etc.) that in its oh-so-tasteful and user-friendly way provides handy hints to Americans of colour - needless to say the (real-life) book calls them ""N**ro Motorists"" - how to get the most of their tourism in the southern states ... without there being any tensions.Just three of the ways (there are many more) in which Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"" follows what are almost companion movies like ""Hidden Figures"" and ""The Butler"" (or indeed even ""The Shape of Water"") in exploring that now-exotic world of an all-powerful 1960s America with its ostensibly slick, wealthy, consumer-friendly lifestyle hosting within it a tumour of nastiness that is as malign (and HUGE) as it is absurd.Don Shirley is inded gifted, and applauded wherever he goes, yet he has to use a different toilet and stay in different motels (just as the ""computers"" in ""Hidden Figures"" were trusted with sustaining America's cutting edge space-effort for NASA, while also having to use a separate kettle from their white - and at times professionally inferior - colleagues).So there is anger and disdain for that world in this film, even as its beauty and elegance are put on full show. But - wonderfully - it is neither in-your-face or overdone; but is rather evinced (mostly) far more effectively in mini-scenes and dialogues more or less erudite and often warm and witty between the two key characters.How on Earth anyone could have foreseen the slim, bright-eyed Mortensen being made over into a somewhat overweight, and not-too-bright (though at times canny) middle-aged Italian-American is beyond me. This is the antithesis of Aragorn (or indeed of John Halder in the great play-turned film ""Good"").But it's just SUPERB anyway...Of course, this story is interesting (and portrayed spellbindingly) in part because Tony is less wealthy, less clever, less pretty-much-everything than Don, but because the latter keeps being brought low by the world around him (and occasionally by his own pretty-understandable lapses of various kinds), the characters equalise ... and hit it off better and better in an amazing way that history records as a true event. (At this point, care might be taken, as I know already that some criticise the presentation of this story for being not as true-to-life as it might be. Fair comment, but this film is a wonderful work of art anyway).At one point, the above effect is made clear in a heated ""race to the bottom"" dialogue between the two that Shirley wins with a statement to the effect that he is not black enough or white enough or man enough to be anybody at all...It's as somehow beautiful as it is devasating and heartfelt.Given that this is also (almost too good to be true in being) a ""driving home for Christmas"" story, there is a slightly implausible but also wonderful ending that speaks volumes in its mini-attempt at Jewish-Italian-Black reconciliation, but the sour aftertaste (the same one as with ""Hidden Figures"") is the real-life awareness that reconciliatory steps of this kind were too few and far between, and have perhaps continued to be so.Yet the overall effect of the film remains a warm one, if one of undulled core message, and that is a great trick for Farrelly and the two remarkably good key actors to pull off. All credit to them."
GREEN BOOK,23 December 2018,10/10,"The ""Green Book"" was a handbook (now, thankfully, out of print) for those of colour travelling in the southern states of the US , who want to stay in or dine at places they will be welcomed rather than abused. It is of course 1962 and Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General has racial equality strongly in his firing line.The ever-flexible (and here, after piling a lot of weight on, almost unrecognisable) Viggo Mortensen plays Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga - a racist Italian-American living in The Bronx and working as a bouncer at ""The Copacabana"" club. Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali plays Dr Don Shirley - a black virtuoso pianist of high acclaim. How this odd couple meet and interact on a journey from Pitsburg to Birmingham is the heart of the film.I'm actually loathe to say ANY more about the plot of this film. I saw this at a UK Cineworld ""Secret Screening"" and so went into the film completely blind about the content: which was just BRILLIANT! For this, for me, is as near a perfect road-movie as I am likely to see this or any other decade. To say it is a feelgood Christmas classic to approach ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is not - I think - putting it too strongly.The film has apparently had Oscar buzz since winning the Toronto Film Festival's ""People's Choice"" award, and the chemistry that builds up between Ali and Mortensen is just fantastic. While I'm a fan of Mortensen (""Captain Fantastic"" was a minor classic), it is Ali's performance as the gentle and mannered Shirley which impresses most, and would be my pick for the Oscar nomination if I had to choose between them.Also truly impressive is ER's Linda Cardllini as Tony's wife Dolores: her reactions to ""Tony's"" letters home are just exquisite. I wonder whether a Supporting Actress nomination might be deserved here also.The screenplay by Brian Hayes Currie, Peter Farrelly and Nick Vallelonga (Tony's son.... yes, this is based on a true story), sizzles with fantastic one-liners and wordplay. It breathes life into the 1962 setting by not shying away from using what, today, are highly offensive racial slurs: these might offend some, but they are essential for a film that lampoons racist behaviour so wonderfully.Above all, it's a film with genuine heart. A story that lifts the spirit and paints onto the screen in technicolour glory the struggle (albeit you feel a rather sanitised one) that lifted America out of the dark ages in terms of equality.It is perhaps this degree of ""Oscar baitedness"" - (if that's not a word then it is now) - that might be its biggest weakness in garnering support among the voters at Oscar time. It is though perhaps worth bearing in mind that it was ""Driving Miss Daisy"" - an odd-couple inter-racial chauffeur-based movie - that won the Best Film Oscar for 1989!This is a film of subtlety and nuance that makes it all the more surprising that the director is Peter Farrelly. Yes, he of the Farrelly brothers of such crass, unsubtle and hilarious films like ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" and such crass, unsubtle and totally awful films like ""Me, Myself and Irene"" and ""Dumb and Dumber To""! It's like asking Mr Bean to direct a performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House! Yet, here it just plain works. The comedy injected into the film (and there are a number of times I laughed out loud) is perfectly balanced with the story.What I wanted to say here was: ""Go see this film. No, REALLY. It will leave you with a warm Christmas glow in your heart to last you through the holidays. Well, it should - it did me."" However, although the States already had this for Thanksgiving, it looks as if the UK general release of this film is not set to happen until the 1st of February next year. Which is a great shame and a missed opportunity. (It's as if they made a Christmas film like ""Die Hard"" and then released it in July! #sarcasm #yesiknowtheydid).Seldom have two hours flown by with such joy at the cinema. At this late stage in the year, my ""Films of the Year"" draft list is going to need another shake up!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web and on Facebook. Thanks)."
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2020,5/10,A short an interesting biopic that tells a story of overcoming race and friendship.Green Book starts off as a pseudo-NYC Italian story that moves on to be a roadside adventure through the Deep South. The movie attempts to be warm and lovely but is stale throughout. Expect no surprises or plot twists. The film is full of cliches and storylines that you'll see coming.It's a feel-good high-budget movie that you will forget.2.5/5. Maybe a 3/5. Found it a bit too slow and dull for my tastes.
GREEN BOOK,1 December 2018,10/10,"Usually, when a film is made and has very little depth in terms of storytelling, it would be forgotten about, but if you have a unique take on a specific story and the point of the movie is to keep it simple and explore only one facet of history. Personally, I prefer when stories are a little more fleshed out, but I also believe this simple story in Green Book is one of the best films of 2018. This is a movie that cares about its characters first and foremost and we don't see many of those films hitting the big screen very often, so this was a pleasant surprise. Although there's not much meat to the story (which may bore some viewers), I found Green Book to be a fantastic piece of filmmaking.Fired from the downtown club and forced to take any job he can in order to support his family, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) decides to take on the role of driving pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) across the South, as he and his band perform for audiences. With the inclusion of the fact that Don is an African-American man in the 1960s and Tony being an Italian-American, many racial occurrences arise for these two. Being an unlikely pairing for that particular decade, these characters needed to be like-able and completely fleshed out in order for this film to work and those two aspects were absolutely astoundingly well-done in my opinion. This also stems from a particularly great turn by director Peter Farrelly.Although his earlier work on films like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary are very commendable outings, his recent comedies haven't exactly struck gold. Having his last few films being Dumb and Dumber To, Hall Pass, and The Heartbreak Kid, I was very worried about him taking on a more dramatic film. After watching this film, I felt ridiculous even thinking that, because not only has he shown maturity as a director this time around, but also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a more meaningful premise. If he sticks with this style of filmmaking, I can definitely see his name in the public eye more often in the coming years. The way he handles his performers here was truly something special.As I said, it truly is the character arcs that carry this film and without amazing performances, this movie would've been forgotten. Mortensen and Ali both give their all in these roles and it shows. There wasn't a single moment where I found myself scratching my head or not believing a decision they made or line of dialogue they spoke. In the vein of films like Driving Miss Daisy or even Before Sunrise, the conversations are the reason this film doesn't feel slow. There's hardly a single exciting scene and the movie clocks in at nearly 140 minutes. That's when you know the dialogue has been written very well by the trio in Nick Vallelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Peter Farrelly.In the end, I can't see everyone loving this film, due to the slow pace it has, but it's a breezy crowd-pleaser nonetheless. This movie has been generating major awards consideration and I think it deserves every bit of it and then some. I loved my experience watching this movie and I can't wait to revisit it and take this journey with these characters again. Funny, sad, and heartwarming, Green Book easily earns the title of being one of the best feel-good movies in recent memory (at least to me). I loved this movie and I can't recommend it enough."
GREEN BOOK,6 April 2019,7/10,"This was a good film and on an EMOTIONAL LEVEL I did enjoy it. The performances were amazing yet I loved Mortensen's one better (hard to believe he's Danish).The big problem about it though is that it tries to be too safe and kid-friendly. At times it really feels like it was written as a cristmas miracle story for kids to enjoy.It kind of wants be a serious story about the morale and the people of the time, but everyone besides the main duo are too cartoonish to be beliveable. It kind of brings up the issues of racial segregation but it's afraid to show real racist white people and the negatives from the other side. It shows hard working African Americans on the field to give contrast to the Doc (and to show later that he doesn't feel like he belongs to anyone, even his own people) but it falls into some sort of social justice commentary, when the whole point of capitalism was to give equal opportunities, so if the Doc was educated, worked hard and was paid well it doesn't mean he has to feel guilty before those hardworking farmers. The YMCA reveal scene was kind of made to show why Frank is called ""Tonly Lip"" but the set up was so unnecessary forced I can't really tell why they went for it in the first place. The ending was cartoonish and family friendly, which is ok, but it really goes on big stretches with some stuff, like the Doc wishing a Merry Christmas to his butler Amit, who's clearly far from being a christian, I mean... You see? It's clearly trying to hard not to offend anyone.I loved that movie, mostly for the duo, the dialogue and overall chemistry between them, great stuff. But the social commentary, the simplification, the idea behind making this a ""based on a true story"" movie... If they were real people - show us what they were, if not - make this a separate story ""inspired"" by real events.I just wish it was so much more grounded, I'd enjoy it much more."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,"My Review-This is the best film of the year as far as I'm concerned and deserves the 5 Academy Award nominations it' nominated for,in fact I'll go as far as to say it should win all five, if I had a vote Green Book would win Best Film, Best Actor,Best Supporting Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay.Why? Because It's the most touching and revealing story of two human beings ,poles apart in every way who experience through the challenging experiences of racial prejudice and more importantly their own personal perceptions and prejudices of each other in the America of the mid 1960's ,two very different halves of a nation that is still divided in 2019.I couldn't help comparing this movie to the great film of 1989 ,Bruce Beresford 'S classic Driving Miss Daisy ,except in Green Room their driving in reverse gear with Viggo Mortensen in role of Tony Lip ,a tough Italian rough diamond who's racial ignorance is truly shown early in the movie when he returns home to his lovely wife Dolores,played beautifully by Linda Cardellini to find 2 coloured plumbers in his home.
Out of sheer economic desperation after being laid off from his job he applies and accepts a position as driver for Dr Don Shirley,a classical and high brow jazz pianist impeccably played by Marhershala Ali,and they set off on a concert tour of America's Deep South ,where the title of the movie is revealed and says it all.Tony's employer and passenger is Don Shirley a elegant,cultured ,talented and incredibly wealthy Afro American concert pianist who is lonely and isolated from the reality of racial prejudice in New York society,totally opposite to Tony ,who has a loving family ,uneducated,can barely write a letter to his wife and comes out with every racial stereotype comment not through hate but just plain ignorance.The journey the two men embark on has a destination more than just the red neck bigoted towns they arrive in ,when they return home they both have arrived at the most important destination, a better knowledge of themselves and their humanity and a better grasp of the defects
of character that have held them both back all their lives,it bought a tear to my eye and that's why it should win the 5 Academy Awards its nominated for, it's a rare and splendid movie."
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,8/10,"The best work of Peter Farrelly's career as a solo project after 24 years of sharing the director chair with his brother. And a reminder that Viggo Mortensen has never won an Oscar.
I mean... how on earth you people say that Green Book is a feel-good movie?! This is so dark and infuriating!Seriously though, despite its heavy themes, this movie is, surprisingly, supremely delightful to watch. Partly, thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, whose equally phenomenal performances prove that they are two of the most talented actors working today. But largely, thanks to Peter Farrelly's nifty direction. Not only has he shown maturity as a director, but Farrelly also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a dramatic movie, and hence more earnest tone and more serious subject matter, way more serious! If he sticks with this refreshing style of filmmaking, and collaborate with excellent screenwriters, such as the writers of the screenplay of this movie, I bet that he will be one of the most popular directors in the coming years. The way he handles his performers, or shots a comedic scene here were really out of the ordinary.The relatively deliberate pace couldn't have been more challenging for Peter Farrelly to stick with a particular tone, and find balance for this movie, but besides his palpable capability of doing so, the script, which he also co-wrote, offered sincere and genuine smart dialogues, and extremely likable reasonably fleshed-out characters, made this task way much more easier. Let alone the astonishing performances from the entire cast.The screenplay is what to blame, however, for these two points I took away from my rating for this movie.First, there is an action Mortensen's character, Tony Lip, take at the beginning of the movie that didn't add anything to the movie. This action also had some consequences that took some time. Adding insult to injury, this action, along with its consequences, was nothing but a cheap trick to make the viewers make a wrong judgment about the character.Secondly, there was an abrupt change of mind made by the same character that, however understandable it might be, I still found it hard to swallow.Thirdly, and most importantly, the illogically symmetric pattern of the storytelling; the plot keeps moving forward in a very unrealistic by making every phase in the movie seemingly predictable. It's safe to say that a movie with a fairly familiar themes like this one can easily suffer from such problem.That said, Green Book is undoubtedly one of the most 2018 movies that I've enjoyed watching. Peter Farrelly miraculously managed to make a movie that tackles such sore themes, a breezy crowd-pleaser.(8/10)"
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,10/10,"First, how could you possibly go wrong with the co-stars Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali; the latter, star of the 2017 Oscars best movie, Monlight, a tv series and tv movie star in his own right, the former also twice nominated for best actor, Oscars, the same year Moonlight won the best picture and again for his leading role in the 2007 movie 'Eastern Promises'. Well... I don't think you can.Now as you may have read, the film is based on a true story. What you probably didn't know is whose story; it's that of Tony Vallelonga, father of the movie's writer Nick Vallelonga. You'll learn more about that in the final credits, and don't miss the photos, the ones I'm sure Nick treasures. If you watch it at home, pause to read the explanations below the photos. By the way, Nick Vallelonga has 50 movie credits, so it's not as if he just came out of the woodwork to tell his dad's story.For a biography/comedy/DRAMA, and right before Christmas, this was perfect timing. Not only does the movie end with a family Christmas dinner, the mention of making it back on time for that day is a big part of the road trip movie. The ending, though, somewhat predictable, felt great; if you can pull off a no big surprise ending with this much feel good effect, there has to be something special about it. There is.Many little details all along the movie are both a sign that all parties involved cared to do a good job and a mark of good writing (Brian Hayes Currie and director Peter Farrelli collaborated on, for Nick Vallelonga's script); they did and it was. Viggo and Mahershala delivered excellent performances, and as it's the job of good actors, they made their characters believable. Their scenes together were akin to the chemistry we experienced with Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1990 Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Actor in a leading role, to mention just a few of the Oscars won). Since I've already crossed the spoiler line earlier, I'll just add the very last words spoken in 'Green Book', by the lovable and good looking Linda Cardellini, as a 'tell' of just how perfect the movie was: ""Thank you for helping' him with the letters."" If you haven't seen the movie, it will mean little to you, granted; however, if you have seen it, you know what I mean by perfect.It's a road trip movie but not the comedy road trip movie you'd expect. It's one of those character development motion picture, the kind us movie lovers crave. And, another spoiler, it promotes moral values, like courage, yes courage, to name one. Oh how thrilled Viggo and Mahershala must have been when they were sent the script for their respective parts and read it for the first time.Do I recommend you see it? Don't go by my word, check out IMDb, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes ratings and take it for granted they can't all be wrong."
GREEN BOOK,25 May 2019,9/10,"Interesting film and character study. Did the film deserve best picture? Probably not, but we all know the Oscars don't get these films correct. Strong acting and filmmaking create a film you should watch. Relevant and still topical."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2019,10/10,"Just seen this in the cinema and This 2 hour and 10 mins it's wonderful from director Peter farrel who knew the best he could do a film like this Wow this film is the underdog for the Oscars, with powerful moving stories from the road in the 1960 deep south as the doctor of music puts manners on his driver Viggo Mortensen is working as a bouncer in the 1930 in new York he is Italian tough guy who bounces people out as we see his family he needs a bit
he is from the Bronx but when his job as bouncer is on hold due to cocacbana closes he is in need of work so he offered to get a doctor Shirley from New York to the deep south Shirley wants everyone to hear his music but this is hard times as well as racial segregation in areas so a guide book is what is need but what ensues is comical because this two people are worlds apart Tony doesn't know when to shut up or send letter and Shirley is in need of real people to listen to the stories not of rich educated people their is humour and the fixer learns his manners on the way to changing his personal married life . change has definitely coming and this film has a powerful tale of power and warmth in these trouble times this film works very well as they go from state to state as cultural clashes with comedy and both leads to a fine job of milking their difference for the movie."
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,9/10,"Road trip drama with some humour based on a 1960's true story.Tony Lip is an Italian-American 'wise-guy', who's struggling to provide for his family. There's an important scene at the beginning which demonstrates his racism. He gets an interview to be a driver, but also a driver who could deal with any problems.Dr. Don Shirley is a black very well educated, very well-mannered, world class classical musician. He's living in isolation on the top floor of Carnegie Hall, he needs driving safely to a series of scheduled concerts in the very prejudice Deep South.During the numerous journeys they refer to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book,' also known as 'The Negro Traveller's Green Book.' This was a guide for African-American travellers, which listed lodging, restaurants, and other businesses that would serve them. They begin to bond over an incident involving two racist cops, a pub beating, a homosexual scene and even something simple like eating fried chicken in Kentucky.Don is a brilliant pianist, admired by white audiences, although otherwise he's still just another black man who cannot eat in 'white' restaurants or use the same 'white' bathrooms or try on a suit.They learn more about each-other and also some deeper things about themselves. Don shows Tony how to live with self-control and dignity, Tony teaching Don how to open up and relax.In conclusion this is a highly recommended instant classic about two unlikely people who find a connection and respect for each other."
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2020,8/10,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Green Book"" (R - 2018 - DVD)Genre: Drama/Biopic

Come for the cast...stay for the music...end with a great story. This one comes highly recommended!!"
GREEN BOOK,23 August 2020,8/10,"It is fair to say that rom-com is not my genre. This particular rom-com is an interracial bromance buddy flick, along the lines of another movie I watched recently and did not like. Because of that experience, I was wary about Green Book and can say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than the famous French language interracial bromance buddy flick, The Intolerables, which I found to be frankly racist (see my review here at imdb for more on that). Before watching Green Book, I had no idea that it had won the Best Picture Oscar, but I have to admit that, for a rom-com, this is pretty good. Great story, feel-good ending which is not fake. Intelligent, interesting characters. All in all, worth watching. The musical angle adds a lot, too."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Living in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!With the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.However, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.Nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.Ali doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.Technically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.Finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.Green Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ..."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,8/10,"Ignoring the controversy surrounding this picture, this is a film that has a fantastic script, which is bolstered by its two leading men. Particular applaudits should go to Ali who continues to shine."
GREEN BOOK,1 June 2019,10/10,I'm getting sick just watching this hot dog content with toppings.Tony attacks his job with a certain exuberance.The Coke is going a little too far :)Time for some real trouble soon.Were the hell does he put it all?! He is in remarkable shape for how he eats.
GREEN BOOK,29 February 2020,7/10,"Is it the most progressive of movies? NoDid it deserve to win Best Picture? I don't think so.Is it a good movie? I do think so.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are great together. They're performances really elevate the material.It's a very likeable movie. The ending is a little corny (the movie itself can be a little corny to be honest) and the film is a little repetitive at times, but overall I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I finally watched it."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,8/10,"A very good feel good film that tackles a familiar territory. But its a good film about friendship, a very unlikely friendship and the way this friendship is developing. The magic lies in the performances and especially the chemistry between the two leads.
Viggo Mortensen is fantastic. There is no other word to describe his performance. I know he got a lot of backlash lately, mostly due to some comments he did. Anyway, his performance is undoubtedly fantastic. I mean look how versatile that actor is... this was Aragon! A very unlikely character he marvelously brought to life and delivered one of the absolute top performances of the year. Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali also did some magic with his role. Especially in the scenes when ""Doc"" lost his facade and showed his true emotions and struggle. Excellent work as well. The rest of the cast is servable but nothing too outstanding. The screenplay is surely very good. Peter Farrelly's direction better than with most of his comedic gigs. The film is entertaining and has an important story to tell. I am not sure if it is 100% accurate or not but as a film it entertained, moved and emotionally challenged me."
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,9/10,"The stage curtains open ...It is easy to see why ""Green Book"" won three awards at the Academy including Best Picture for the year 2018 - and it had some stiff competition too. It is a heartwarming human story with excellent performances, a good script and tight direction.When the Copacabana shuts down for 2 months due to renovations, its employees are forced to find other employment during that time. Among them is one of the Nightclub's bouncers, ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga. He is offered two different jobs - he can either do ""things"" for the mob, or he can chauffeur an African American pianist named Don Shirley (or as Tony calls him, ""Doc""), through the deep south in safety and to his gigs on time. For $125/week plus expenses, he accepts the driving job.It is the story of how both men overcome their own prejudices, fears and learn to respect each other and become life long friends. The acting was outstanding with Mahershala Ali winning the award for Best Supporting Actor in his role as ""Doc"" Shirley. The movie pulls you in almost immediately and keeps you engaged and entertained for its entirety. When the movie ends, you don't want it to.I loved ""Green Book"". It is a high recommend from me. Do I think it deserved to win Best Picture? Sure, I do. Then again, there were two or three others I also felt deserved to win it. But, yeah ... I felt like I was watching an award winning movie with an award winning performance. I would certainly watch this film again."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.In 1962, New York bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.I rate it a solid 9/10"
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,9/10,This is a film about an Italian from the Bronx who becomes a driver / bodyguard for an elite but difficult black musician as he goes on a national tour in the south. Both men confront their inner demons and ghosts as their journey deeper into the south brings them closer together. Less about 1961 and more about how liberals and conservatives see one another in the post 2016 era. The story is very Hollywood but the acting is fantastic. Viggo is completely unrecognizable as the driver. Worth it if you like good screenplay structure.
GREEN BOOK,22 December 2018,9/10,"Green Book isn't terribly subtle in its message, but boy is it effective. Two strong leading performances anchor the central relationship that makes this film so compelling. This film is all about understanding the situations and circumstances that others deal with. One can never truly understand another's experiences and Green Book acknowledges that, but you can try and ultimately you can have respect for each other. Watching the journey of both characters learning this is why this film is such a crowd-pleaser and one of the best films of the year."
GREEN BOOK,22 August 2021,10/10,"What makes this a great movie is the way that it tells the story of how racist's ideas and even hearts can change. It shows the absurdity of the attitudes all too common and that sadly still exist among many, especially in the deep south of the USA. That musicians could not eat or sleep in the very hotels that they were performing in shames America.Viggo Mortensen is Oscar worthy as the all American street tough Italian Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga, who has his mind and heart changed by his new black boss, classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley, also played brilliantly by Ali Mahershala.The movie managed to show just about every emotion and another plus is the great music backing this excellent film."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2020,7/10,"I'm not intentionally watching films that show America in a bad light I promise. Sure it starts all fun and games, with gangsters, punch-ups and nightclubs, give it a few minutes though and we cut to the chase, racism. There's much more going on here than just black and white. Throw in cultural differences, class clashes, homophobia, it's a melting pot of issues. Sometimes played for laughs with the racism matter of fact, sometimes not, with blood drawn. Prejudices take many forms. The balm that eases tensions, teaches respect... music. As Viggo Mortensen's character says ""It's a complicated world"", but watching him and Mahershala Ali, learn from each other as they travel the deep south really is pretty wonderful. As the (true) story progresses, you could be forgiven for thinking it's getting a little softer, twee, less edgy, but really it's just hopeful. In a country that still has race issues, it needs all the hope it can get."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,9/10,"This movie gives no apologies for being schmaltzy. And I love it for that. It's classical storytelling ala ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in reverse. And color change.
Mahershala Ali is brilliant as piano prodigy Don Shirley, who needs someone to drive him on a tour through the deep South. Enter jamoke Tony Lipp. A newly unemployed bouncer whose brawn is worst than his bite played by Viggo Mortensen. Let's be honest, NOTHING is unexpected her if you've watched brotherly love movies from the past 30 years, or road movies for that matter like say...""Rain Man"" the resolution is exactly what you think. But...so what? It's beautiful and touching and gets you in the right spot. And I love director Peter Farrelly for it. The problem with today's movies is that it believes being mean and criticizing ALL bigots means they have to be bumbling morons. Whilst true, there are also bigots with families who have good hearts or similar ignorance. That is the dynamics of depth. Obviously, the stakes aren't necessarily Civil Rights. It touches on it, but never pushes you into eye roll territory. Though presently criticized as softening the racism with humor, what is telling is that they paint Shirley's character as the world intelligent educated gifted Black man with talent and Viggo as coming to terms with others who are MUCH more bigoted as he. This illustrates the divide of class as much as race.
The tone is of joy and friendship and understanding. And though I think it's too simple to say it's begging for peace in a tumultuous era in America (it really isn't) it still is a fun road movie. More laughs than anything. Well crafted story of grown men finding ways to grow up."
GREEN BOOK,13 April 2021,5/10,"After Green Book's Best Picture win at the 2019 Oscars and all the love it's been getting, I was curious to see what was so good about it. Unfortunately, I was let down by this film.Green Book follows Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer that becomes a driver for Dr. Don Shirley, an African American pianist in the 1960s.After viewing the film, I was boggled as to how and why this film won Best Picture. Out of all the Best Picture winners I've seen so far, Green Book has to be the worst one yet. There are many issues I take with the film but I'll start with what I liked. The best part of this film are the two main performances. Mahershala Ali does a fantastic job despite how limited the scope of his character. He did what he could with the material he got and I think he was truly great. Viggo Mortensen really stole the show for me. He deserved his Oscar nomination and played the role of an Italian well. He even reminded me of the Italians we see in Scorsese films. Both actors played off each other well and had a great bond between them. In the technical department, Green Book also succeeds. It's well shot and looks great overall.The problem with Green Book lies in the story and the treatment of its subject. The film plays it so safe in regards to its subject matter. Racism has been shown in many films over the years but Peter Farrelly and the rest of the writers attempt nothing new with it. It's very standard in its portrayal and incredibly unsubtle to the point where I would just roll my eyes at some scenes. The score was very manipulative by telling you how to feel during a scene. If a sad scene was taking place then sad music would play over it. The story got especially predictable after it kept on repeating the same sequence of events over and over again. The film essentially repeats the same events but in different locations which gets dull very quickly. For a film about racism, Mahershala Ali's character was so poorly developed. He felt more like a plot device to move the story and its message along rather than an actual character which was disappointing.Green Book is simply a basic Oscar bait film in my eyes and the more I think about it, the worse it gets. It's another white saviour film that has nothing new to say and because of that it's quite bland and forgettable. It's sad that an overly sappy and cheesy film like this wins Best Picture when films like BlacKkKlansman and Blindspotting come out the same year and have much more to say. If you've seen Green Book and liked it then I'm glad you enjoyed the experience but I would not personally watch it again or recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,9/10,"Green Book is about the friendship between Tony Lip and Don Shirley. The movie is taken so beautifully. Viggo Mortensen and Mehershala Ali did an excellent job and I hope the latter will win his second oscar. Green book makes us feel good all the time. Watching this movie felt so good and an unique experience. Overall, Green Book is a must watch beautifully directed film. Hats off to Peter Farrelly."
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,10/10,Fantastic performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. So much to talk about in this film. I'm hoping it receives the award attention it definitely deserves. You can see my full movie review at Movie Review Mom (dot) com.
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2019,6/10,"I have few big complaints about Green Book, but just an hour after watching it little of it stayed in my mind. It's a dramedy focused on the relationship between a working class white guy and a black pianist in the 1960s. Mortensen and Ali are both excellent in their roles, with Mortensen bringing some depth to an exaggeratedly written character and Ali bringing a balance of professionalism and emotion. Their relationship certainly has its share of humor, and it is fun to be along for the ride as they banter. I didn't think the racial elements of their relationships and identities were well explored, with the exception of Ali's monologue about how he doesn't fit in with any community. Mortensen was overtly racist early on, and there's no real explanation for why he's quickly so willing to work for a black high class man and put those prejudices aside. The differences in viewpoints and nuance were largely brushed aside in favor of a broader, optimistic arc where both of them are just good friends who save the other from racial/class problems when they need it. The ending does a good job of bringing full circle the themes of courage and integrity, but they still feel quite surface level and manufactured for easy, light satisfaction. The humor is fine and adds to the movie but isn't essential to it. It's a movie that's easy to sit back and go along with, but a hard one to think deeply about and come away with new elements to ponder. It's a crowd pleaser, but felt all to predictable and pandery to be memorable."
GREEN BOOK,31 May 2019,6/10,"This was ok but it was also rather predictable. It ticked a lot of cheesy, stereotypical boxes. It's like there was a checklist to go through where everything had to be ticked off to complete the film. Racist cop, tick. White racist becomes best friend, tick etc. It's not to say it's a bad film, it's just not a great film. A quick internet search turns up information that says a lot of what's in the film isn't actually true anyway. It's worth reading the article ""How 'Green Book' And The Hollywood Machine Swallowed Donald Shirley Whole"" for more on this. 6/10 does it for me."
GREEN BOOK,14 November 2021,8/10,"A very interesting film, especially as it is based on reality.A largely unrecognisable cast, which really helps sometimes in getting involved with the story and there were some star performances all around.Difficult to watch at times and I was always expecting some really violent moments, which thankfully didn't transpire.Terrible to think the the Green Book actually existed."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,9/10,"Based on real people. driving on tour in the SOUTH, 1960s. BLACK pianist.
2 GREAT actors, real, moving. well written script, director.
I loved it.
the story was as expected. BUT WELL DONE. show the face of Racism, segregation. Kindness and integrity."
GREEN BOOK,18 August 2019,7/10,"A sad reflection of the 1960 s US race situation but well acted and entertaining and a story that does draw you in. Based on a true story which, as so often, is more poinent than fiction."

GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,8/10,"Green Book is based on the true story friendship of Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga. The former was a highly regarded black musician, praised for his virtuosity, and the latter a struggling family man trying to keep food on his family's table. They were an unlikely pair, and yet over the course of a two month tour of the deep south, they forged a friendship that lasted fifty years until their deaths within months of each other. It's not exactly a headline-making story, but it's one ripe for telling to warm the cockles.Half buddy comedy, half racial drama, the meat of the film is watching these two character interact as they travel from city to city. As far as narrative pacing goes, this is probably where my only criticism lies. It's two hours of traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - and so on and so forth. While each interaction is different, and each character is fleshed out more as their kinship develops, it still somehow comes off as a little repetitive once you reach the end of the second act. Thankfully the interactions are so good, either from the drama they invoke, or from the subtle comedy, that it chugs along quite pleasantly regardless.Mahershala Ali plays Shirley with a delicate finesse that instantly places him beyond the realms of racial stereotypes. As he later shouts through tears later on in the film - in possibly one of the film's most powerful moments - he's not black enough to be black, but not white enough to be white. He lives a life simultaneously praised and downtrodden on by white people. They want him to come and entertain them, but won't let him use their toilets, or eat in their restaurant. On the stage he earns every ounce of praise, shedding his skin colour entirely, but once he comes off he's just another black man. But not even the black community will accept him. In the most poignant of scenes that displays this, the car overheats and Tony gets out to cool it off and top up the water. Shirley gets out in front of a field being plowed by a group of black people - staged somewhat reminiscent of slavery - dressed to the nines in his expensive suit. The looks he gets rightly makes him feel uncomfortable. Ultimately his unwelcomed existence leads to heaps of loneliness.But for me the film was all on Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga (or Tony Lip as he's affectionately called). While Shirley finds a friend at the end, and a sense of belonging, Tony finds more as his previous worldview is almost entirely shattered by spending real time with a black man for the first time in his life. At the beginning, he bins two glasses used by black plumbers, while the rest of his family sit there minding the place suspiciously, giving off a racist atmosphere. In truth, Tony starts out as a not particularly likeable guy, and yet you can't help but get behind his charm. He's manipulative, brash, violent, and lacks manners, but he's also entertaining, charming, and loving to his wife and family. As the film goes on, as the friendship develops between him and Shirley, and as he becomes a little less racist as the runtime goes on, he becomes an altogether softer character who's learned lessons of dignity along the way.Of course from some perspectives one intrinsic problem with the film is how Tony is hailed as a white saviour, and on that point I can't really disagree. Shirley would've been useless without Tony standing up for him (apart from in one instance where this gets them both locked up in jail, and Shirley has to get them out with a particularly important phonecall). Yet at the same time I can't help but feel this is more down to the nature of the two character's personalities rather than their skin colour. Tony is hired as a driver and bodyguard because he's a big guy who can take a punch, and displays a rare loyalty to his charge. Of course he's going to be the saviour, that's what he was employed to do. Shirley on the other hand is a softer pedigree of person. He values personal hygiene far higher than most, he's pampered by his butler, he lives a secluded life by himself without any real knowledge of how the world around him works. He's the type of character, black or not, that needs someone to stand up for him in difficult situations.Finally on the note of historical accuracy; who cares? This isn't a documentary. I swear I see this about every true story adaptation, but it's a movie for entertainment, that bends the truth in order to get it's point across, and create moments of drama or humour that will enthral it's audience. It's not a blow-by-blow account of Shirley and Tony's roadtrip during those two months. It may not even be entirely truthful to the characters of the real men, but as a movie it just works. It makes you happy, it makes you sad, and ties it's characters and themes together creating one cohesive story.Green Book was definitely a very enjoyable movie. It was far funnier than I ever expected, and that was something pleasantly surprising. Every interaction between Shirley and Tony feels natural, and the chemistry shared between Mortensen and Ali is fantastic to watch. Whether they're butting heads ideologically or comedically, or coming around to the other's viewpoints, you can't help but root for both of them and the budding friendship. I give Green Book a solid 8/10. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if it won Best Picture."
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,9/10,"Based on a True story this film is a very beautiful thought provoking look and battle of predjjustices held not only of a persons skin colour but of their own identity .
Superbly acted a story that will provoke many emotions ending in a heart warming finish and feel good factor Loved this film as much as I loved the 2 main actors."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2018,8/10,"Green Book Review:Green Book is inspired by the true friendship of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a working class Italian-American bouncer and Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American pianist, as Tony Lip drives Dr. Shirley on his venue tour in the 1960s in the southern states. This is the movie, other than A Star is Born, that has been getting the biggest Oscar buzz this season. It seemed like an interesting plot and looked really good. I've given out 4 A+ scores this year, one being for the miniseries Sharp Objects, and I'm happy to say Green Book joins that group. I loved every minute of this movie! The story by Peter Farrelly was so good. Definitely will get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, though I do think Roma will end up winning it. The dialogue worked. The pacing was good. There was just so much emotion put into this. As the tour gets deeper into the South, Dr. Shirley experiences more racism and you just had no words to describe all of the emotion and feelings put into those scenes. The performances by the two actors are the best of all year. Viggo Mortensen will win Best Actor. His portrayal of Tony Lip was amazing. His best performance yet. He was a lovable character. And it's a character that has flaws and it's acknowledged throughout and Viggo knew how to do that. Mahershala Ali will for sure win his second Oscar, first for playing Juan in Moonlight, playing Dr. Shirley. This is his best role to date. There were scenes that made me laugh and some bringing tears. This is a lock for Best Supporting Actor. I loved Linda Cardellini as Delores but I don't think she'll be recognized for her role. Peter Farrelly's direction was great. He has made some horrendous films in the past, one being Movie 43, but he did very well and could get a nomination for Best Director, probably won't win however. The score by Kris Bowers was very good. It was a mix of classical music that Dr. Shirley played and 60s jazz. I think he'll get a nomination for Best Original Score. Not too many scores have been released for upcoming films so it's hard to tell what he's up against though there are a few from earlier this year that could get nominated. The cinematography was good but not good enough for the nomination. In all honesty, so far this is the film that I think will win Best Picture at the Oscars 2019 (I will put my top 10 Best Picture Predictions below). It had so much to say and I think it's a film everyone should see. It's relevant and I will say my favorite Christmas movie to date. I was disappointed to see that it didn't make too much at the box office yet, only making 14.0 million and only #10 at the the top box office for its second week into its release. It was promoted at theaters but not many theaters got it. I had to go all the way to Appleton to see it and it was in a small theater that was packed. I was happy to see how many people went to see it. Overall you should see the movie when you get the chance. I don't think you could hate it.My Grade: A+My Oscar 2019 Best Picture Predictions so far (they're pretty close to the Gold Derby Predictions):1. Green Book

GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,8/10,"Director Peter Farrelly succeeds in making his first serious drama. It's not perfect but it is captivating and entertaining. Viggo Mortensen, always an under-rated actor, is wonderful as chauffeur Tony ""the Lip"" Vallelonga, who is from working class Bronx stock, and who has an amazing ability to deal with trouble as a night club bouncer. And as the very posh black concert pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali is also great, in portraying an emotionally repressed artist, who during his tour of the Deep South comes somewhat down to earth. Both men have their eyes opened and have something to teach the other. Some of the characters' darker sides, such as Tony's resorting to violence, and his mafia ties, are shown, and not glossed over, which is refreshing. There are one or two scenes that were a bit preachy, but overall it was a nicely shot and edited, and lovingly made film."
GREEN BOOK,14 November 2020,9/10,"Green Book oozes beauty, charm, class, and humour in telling the story of the budding friendship between Dr Don Shirley and Tony Lip. The transformation of both characters through the film is so heart warming to watch, and so well portrayed by Viggo and Mahershala. The chemistry between the two of them was electric, and so satisfying to watch. Both men were exceptional, and I'm so glad that one of them at least got a much deserved Academy Award.The character of Tony was the most interesting of the two, as throughout the film he is forced to come face to face with his prejudices and flaws. Dr Don Shirley also forgoes such a cathartic transformation, resulting in such a feel good and emotional experience for the viewer.The film shows us the best and (more often than not) the worst of humanity as we navigate the deep south of America, scarred by the country's violent past. Green Book tackles the devastating effects of racism, which were so heart breaking and maddening to watch, in a very poignant, intelligent and powerful way. Despite this, the film is so full of heart and hope. The core story is one of growth, of learning, of understanding, and that message is the ultimate takeaway from the film for me.It's a truly emotional experience that will have you in tears for sure, whether that's out of rage, or at the films more empowering moments.The script was absolutely fantastic. So sharp and meaningful. The direction slick, the score complimenting every story beat so well.A must watch which will leave you speechless."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,9/10,"Great movie! I loved the two lead actors, the music, and the story! I really can't think of a thing wrong with it! Definitely one to watch, and re-watch, in the years to come!p.s. - this is the first ""Best Movie"" Academy Award winner I've seen in 9 years! (since 2010 - ""The Hurt Locker""). And I totally agree!!!"
GREEN BOOK,30 June 2021,8/10,"I understand some got disappointed because they thought other movies were better, but saying that 'Green Book' does not 'deserve' Oscar was way to harsh. All the nominees are well deserved to win the award.This film deals with prejudice of all kinds, not just limited to the race but widened to economic status, ethnicity, last name, and even how one speaks. It raises many personal questions applicable to myself because it broadens the subjects. It's natural for people to judge and evaluate others they interact with, but out of all the factors that compose who they are, which criteria becomes prejudice, injustice, and illegality?The movie approaches 'discrimination' very differently from others. It's not black vs. White; rather, it's Don Shirley vs. World. The film delivers that the race issue is the problem of the whole structure and the society, but how someone deals with it can be individual. It portrays injustice and all-pervading discriminatory culture in the South so explicitly, but Shirley's reaction and solution are calmer, more complex, and more internal. He believes that playing his roles in the society the best he can gradually changes the world. Some people can argue that he does not stand up for what's right more vocally and strongly, but his way of overcoming discrimination is his individual choice. The police who stops the car for car repair is also an individual prejudged and situated in wrong system but making the right choice.Farrelly uses the space design very smart. The film maintains the horizontal image. The car is wide; the road is straight; and the bench and the bar are flat. Images signify that two protagonists stand on the same ground level. No difference in height, no superiority and inferiority based on outer appearances, accents, or academic background. I like the spatial placement in the scene where Shirley drinks at the balcony. He is separated from two colleagues and Tony as well right at the middle as if he does not belong anywhere. The height of his apartment is just right to display his loneliness, above the ground, the crowd, and the people, but not high enough to rule the world."
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,8/10,"One of the most cliché-filled movies of 2018 is also one of the most endearing. Loaded with road film tropes and framed as a 'journey of two unmatched souls', Green Book (2018)is a male-centric essay on 1960s American racism that resonates today.Rough-neck Italian bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work at the same time that Black-American virtuoso pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) wants to hire a driver for a deep South tour. Tony's reputation precedes him, and Dr Shirley knows that the trip will encounter the sort of problems that a man like Tony can handle. Their first meeting is a parody of cultural difference: the haughty high-brow coloured man in a flowing African robe seated on a throne, meets an uncouth, uneducated, and racist Italian whose belligerence promises safety.On-screen text provides city and state milestones for the trip, and the deeper south they drive, the more racial hostility they find. Along the way, Tony's lack of culture slowly responds to the sensitive aesthetic of the acclaimed pianist, while Dr Shirley's arrogance is softened by Tony's connection with what matters to ordinary people (like fried chicken and the music of Little Richard). The Green Book in the film's title actually existed and listed safe accommodation for Black American travellers. They are modest rooms compared with those the Carnegie Hall performer wants, but they are sanctuaries from racial vilification. At other times, the predictable scenarios of humiliation include being honoured for his playing while not being allowed to eat with white people or use their toilets.
The narrative arc is tied to the tour and remains low on dramatic tension or plot twists. This is not an action-rich film, rather it's a two-hander character study that unfolds incrementally through the insightful banter between polar opposite personalities. Tony's regular letters to his wife become a recurring motif of mutual support; they start out with monosyllabic banalities and progress into lyrical prose, coached by the literate musician. They begin to care for each other and, when the tour is over, both are unsurprisingly better people for the experience.The entire weight of this film rests on an intelligently humorous script and sensitive delivery by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. With authenticity and emotional nuance, they have synergy that is rare between males from opposites worlds. The meta-message in Green Booklies in the sad necessity that films like this still need to be made to highlight America's tensions with coloured and culturally different people. The echoes are deafening, with films like BlacKkKlansman(2018)and If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) joining the chorus. Green Booksays more about today than the era it depicts."
GREEN BOOK,17 October 2021,6/10,"You'd think we'd learn, wouldn't you? Men are not the heroes of stories about misogyny, nor are white people the heroes of stories about racism in 1960's Amercia. And yet, just when we thought Driving Miss Daisy was out of the system, here's Green Book winning an inexplicable Best Picture Oscar in 2019. I'd put this off for a long time, but this time the Random Film Generator gave me no choice, and I really tried to keep an open mind. But this is a clod-hoppingly cloying, naive, sometimes downright insulting racism drama that's elevated by two quite brilliant performances from Mahershala Ali (no coincidence that his Oscar was for Supporting Role rather than Leading ...) and Viggo Mortensen. They are in a different film altogether, one with grace notes, subtleties and intelligence that they must have mined from somewhere other than screenplay or direction. Recognition for the likes of Moonlight and Parasite in recent years don't make up for the elevation of this very ordinary film to heights and publicity it doesn't deserve (central performances aside), but they suggest that there may be some forward steps being taken. Sometimes. Meanwhile, if you must watch this, do so for the acting."
GREEN BOOK,26 April 2020,7/10,"Green book is a delightful watch. It's modest, honest and both the lead actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali aced their roles. It's a beautiful story of friendship, compassion and dignity. Peter Farrelly has crafted this movie very brilliantly.And cinematography was excellent. Loved this cinema."
GREEN BOOK,8 May 2020,8/10,"""Green Book"" does a fine job of depicting the rampant disrespect that people of color were shown in the US during 1960's. Main problem is, as politically corrected movie, ""Green Book"" tries very hard and wants not to offend sacrificing the complexity of one of societies great ills in favor of script clarity. On the other hand, the film's effectiveness is especially due to the talents of the two stars - M. Ali and V. Mortensen, veteran actors who just do not ever give an inferior performance. At the end, it is a heartwarming and enough entertaining movie that shines a light on (a difficult part of) American history without patronizing. A real crowd pleaser.Rating: 8-"
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,7/10,"The film's attempts to address racial issues are flimsy, formulaic, and awkward, but when it focuses on the positively hilarious and often heartwarming odd couple dynamic of the crass but warm blue-collar Tony and the classy yet aloof Dr. Shirley, it succeeds (see the chicken-eating, letter-writing), though considering Tony's relatively flat arc, the latter should've been the lead (see his speech on identity in the rain and hints of a troubled backstory that receive no further treatment)."
GREEN BOOK,22 September 2019,10/10,"Green Book'Green Book' is a truly captivating story of a blossoming friendship between two men from very different worlds that over the course of the movie realise they have more in common than they initially believed.Dr Don Shirley played by the brilliant Mahershala Ali is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx.
In need of a driver to help him get from gig to gig so Shirley can fulfil his contract he realises he needs someone to protect and guide him through the racial prejudices he meets along the way.
Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Vallelonga or known as 'Tony Lip' to his friends.
Mortensen gives a spellbinding performance here which is often hilarious.
This movie isn't a full blown comedy but Tony's approach to life is often comical.
His sometimes crass and blunt outlook clashes with the soft spoken subtly of Dr Shirley's persona.
Ali is equally good and
the chemistry between the two lead actors is what really drives this road trip movie.
Each other's character rubs off on one another creating a strong bond as the film progresses.
'Green Book' completely surprised me and by a third way into this film I was giving it 10/10.This is perhaps one of Hollywood's greatest onscreen friendships and by the time credits are about to roll I didn't want to say goodbye to these two engaging characters and their exploits.
Often heartwarming but equally heartbreaking as Shirley struggles to fit in.
Set in a time of extreme racial prejudice. Dr Shirley didn't fit in with his own people and wasn't truly excepted by the rich white people that paid to hear him play.
A scene in a restaurant was upsetting and disappointing.
It saddens the audience to think that not so long back we had very primitive and racist views.
To such an extent where people of different colour could not dine in the same room.
The Green Book featured in the movie is actually a small publication that informed of establishments where people of colour could stay whilst in the Deep South.'The Green Book' boasts a wonderful soundtrack and is masterfully directed by Peter Farrelly.
There's strong support too
making this movie one of the celluloid highlights of my year.
I urge you to watch this film.
Even if like me this isn't your go to genre.
I was mesmerised by this fantastic film, enjoying every second of it.
One that I can't praise highly enough."
GREEN BOOK,22 June 2021,6/10,"It is set in 1962 and is ""inspired by"" the story of an African American classical/jazz pianist and his Italian chauffeur during a tour mostly through the Deep South. The title comes from the title of a guidebook used by African Americans in that era who needed to travel in the south and know in what motels and restaurants they would be welcomed to sleep and eat.Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a bouncer at the Copacabana in New York City who needs a couple months of work elsewhere. He applies for a position as a driver and trouble-shooter for Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a musician who would be taking his trio on tour mostly in the southern states. Tony is unlearned in classical music, gruff and profane in his manner, and racist in his orientation. Don Shirley is highly educated, polished in speech, self-controlled, and alienated from his family.As one would expect in this kind of ""buddy"" movie, the two men have troubles relating initially, share some traumatic experiences, and develop increasing respect for each other. Tony learns that Chopin is not ""Joe Pan,"" and Don helps Tony polish up his letters home to his wife, Dolores (Linda Cardellini). Tony gets Don out of several threatening situations in the south, and Don gets them out of jail on one occasion by calling his ""lawyer,"" who happens to be Robert Kennedy.The movie is a feel-good movie for white liberals."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,,"The ride is surprisingly smooth and enjoyable, with an underlying comedic tone on a serious subject. The two leads are incredible. They do not play their roles, but actually are their roles. Mortensen should win the Oscar Best Actor, and Ali should win the Oscar Best Supporting Actor. They are both among the best actors of the country."
GREEN BOOK,21 May 2020,9/10,"You know what this story is about, and you know what this journey will go through. You understand that it does not touch anything too deep, but it also shows a lot of straightforwardness. You understand that identity is something that everyone cannot avoid, and how rare it is to understand each other. You will naturally like these characters that are not quite like real people, and you will laugh with the funny or not really funny clips. Maybe it's just using laughter as the first reaction to defuse or hide other feelings. You know that the relationship between the story and the green paper that the title says is not that big, and you probably didn't expect you to like this movie."
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2020,9/10,Such a great throwback movie. Timeless by embracing the past and reminding us what it was like to laugh at things that are now deemed inappropriate.
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,10/10,Green Book is a must see movie. Every second of this movie is a magical little piece of a unbelievable true story. The acting is on point. Green Book will definitely win Golden Globes and Academy Awards it is one of the best movies ever.
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,7/10,"""Greenbook"", a film that calls attention to the acting and direction, but it sins in the script, the new long one of the experienced director Peter Farrelly arrives with an inexplicable force for the ossuary 2019. Telling the story of a racist Italian driver that arranges a job of a renowned black musician. The drama of the film is inspired by facts and is good, but the solutions of script are weak and end up leaving the average film. Script options, how to expose Tony's racism is silly, has no depth and meaning, is made solely and exclusively to cause empty aversion to the viewer, and opt for a line of script that follows in every movie, we have the discussion, the problem, the resolution and the moral lesson, such a set of events are repeated throughout the film without any news, which ends up leaving the work extremely predictable beyond its last scene, which I like for the good feeling that it cause, but it diverges from the movie message, which is good, but poorly executed.
But not everything is hurt. Viggo Mortessen is very cool in his character, a raw Italian, the actor seems to have fun in making a mega canastrão character, and that suits him a lot, you perfectly buy the character. And Mahershala there is great again, bringing us a dubious and confused character with his ideas, a deep character with troublesome feelings and veiled veils in a layer of coldness, and Ali's performance restrains this to perfection.
Another cool point is Peter's focused direction, with great set compositions, a bluish photograph and good use of the cameras, the director drives his film well, nothing exceptional and the only technical mistakes are associated with script mistakes. ""Green book"" does not enchant, but it is a legal film, mainly on account of its protagonists."
GREEN BOOK,26 August 2020,7/10,It is a good movie and that it. It shows like many other how and what African-American people had to suffer in the past. Great actors with a really good performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.
GREEN BOOK,6 May 2020,8/10,"The score and soundtrack is amazing and Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give great performances, worth awards. See it if you can, it's a solid film."
GREEN BOOK,29 June 2020,6/10,"For a movie that is supposed to be based on a true story, it is told incredibly one-sided. The white guy's son being one of the writers probably plays a big part in this. We watch the entire movie from the white guy's perspective and forced to put ourselves in his shoes into thinking ""I had no choice but to be mildly racist due to the era I lived in"". I personally think there was a chance to tell this story from this intellectual and extraordinary black guy's perspective which have been a more interesting and honest movie.Two great actors delivering for their respective characters to make a feel good road trip movie about an ""unlikely"" friendship."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2020,10/10,"Set in the 1960s, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) an Italian-American bouncer is hired to be the driver for Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) an African-American musician who is going on tour through the American Deep South. What entails is a deeply complex and honest study of the relationship between these two characters and that is the absolute heart and soul of the film. The two central performances are outstandingly good; Mortensen continues to impress and creates a very comic yet grounded in reality character in Tony here; a family man who is proud to provide, loves them very dearly, just above as much as he loves food! He really packed on the pounds for this one; good for him! He was insanely funny at various points throughout the film as well as being a reliable source of comfort for Dr Shirley in the confrontational scenes. His wife Dolores is played fantastically by Linda Cardellini! Ali is really amazing in the role of Shirley too; a very well spoken and dignified man who just asks for a very simple thing from fellow human beings; respect. He is the emotional undercurrent of the film and helps to bring that emotion out through Tony also. Of course this is set during a time of extreme prejudice and bigotry which creates the more tough to watch and infuriating scenes in the film; all of Shirley's loneliness and pain is caused by people mistreating him just for the colour of his skin. It's unbelievable to even imagine that these grim events occurred in human history and it is highlighted here and exposed for the true crime it really was. Unfortunately, we still see this sort of behaviour today even if it's in milder forms and we can only hope for a time when any discrimination just goes away. It's a film that knows to take its subject matter seriously as it should be but also manages to be comedic aswell as the interaction between Tony and Shirley for the most part is very funny while managing to be profoundly moving. I could talk for longer but in summary! I think it's a masterpiece"
GREEN BOOK,10 June 2020,10/10,"Had anyone claimed prior to 2018 that Peter Farrelly - director of Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Shallow Hal and other amusing but crass low-brow comedies - would one day directed a movie that would win the Academy Award for Best Picture, it seems unlikely that he or she would have been believed. Nevertheless, this proved to be the case with Green Book, a fictionalised biographical comedy drama charting the unlikely friendship between musician Dr Don Shirley and his driver Tony Lip.
The story follows Shirley and Tony Lip (real name Frank Anthony Vallelonga) as the former hires the latter to drive him around on an eight-week tour of the Deep South. Set in 1962, the plot sees Shirley encountering an entirely unsurprising amount of racism, as he is allowed and paid to perform for white audiences but not allowed to use their toilets. Tony thus acts not only as driver but occasional bodyguard, both physically and verbally defending Shirley from the prejudice and persecution he encounters along the way. But whilst racial issues are an important part of the film, it is as much as anything a buddy movie about a growing friendship between an ill-matched pair, the refined and highly educated intellectual snob Shirley and uncouth, foul-mouthed slob Tony Lip. The film's comic moments (and there are many) derive from the friction between their pair caused by their very different outlooks on many aspects of life, including - frequently - food.
The relationship between Shirley and Tony Lip is the very heart of the film. The success of this is partly a result of the screenplay (written by Farrelly, Tony Lip's son Nick Vellelonga, and Brian Hayes Currie) and partly a result of the acting. Mahershala Ali gives a stunning performance as Dr Don Shirley, making him incredibly charismatic, educated and dignified, a sharp contrast to the uneducated, rough and ready Tony Lip. Viggo Mortenson - who gained weight for the role - is just as well cast and the pair gives entirely naturalistic performances throughout. How true to life the characters and the events of the film are has been the subject of much scrutiny, but within the context of the movie they are perfectly convincing. There are many nice touches: the scene in which Don gets arrested during a gay encounter and Tony gets him released, later shrugging off the incident by saying that he knows from working in New York clubs that it is ""a complicated world"" is nicely understated. Some commentators have argued that the difficulties of being a black gay man in the nineteen sixties should have been explored, but Shirley reportedly never discussed his sexuality and it isn't the point of the film. The very fact that it doesn't matter to Tony is the point.
In spite of the humour, there is also drama aplenty, with real anger in the casual racism of scenes such as Don being forbidden from using the same toilet as the white men at the venue he plays at, and not being allowed to try on a suit in a shop. It's impossible to watch such scenes without feeling disgusted, both at the racist attitudes and the casual way in which they are prevalent in the places that the protagonists visit. The script addresses the question of why Don exposes himself to such bigotry, and having put up with a great deal on the grounds that he wants to change hearts, he finally takes a stand on the last night of the tour, refusing to play at the establishment unless its manager lets him eat in the restaurant.
Having spent most of his career directing what can most politely (but somewhat inaccurately) be described as screwball comedies, Farrelly shows remarkable taste and restraint here, with crisp, understated direction that showcases the acting and lets the characters speak for themselves. Sean Porter's cinematography makes an asset out of the location filming, reflecting Tony's appreciation of the scenery he finds himself driving through, whilst Kris Bowers' soundtrack is supplemented by tracks from the era, which works really well. Green Book has attracted controversy for its depiction of race, with some arguing that it perpetuates a ""white saviour"" stereotype; this is a matter that I suspect will be the subject of continued debate, but as a touching portrait of an unlikely friendship between two very different men, the film works extremely well."
GREEN BOOK,8 September 2019,10/10,"Without a doubt, Green Book deserved Best Picture of 2019. Everything about Green Book is perfect, and I have no complaints about the movie. The film just gives out a positive vibe, through beginning to end; even during the darker times in the movie, because the darkest moments of the movie is when both characters evolve into better human beings.We follow Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley tour around the south of America. We learn how it was a struggle for black men in the south during the early 60s. The plot is simple, and it always stays on its tracks. None of the scenes felt too short or too long, creating a consistent pace. Every scene in Green Book was about character development, and how both Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley slowly start respecting each other.The cinematography was hands down amazing, and I think Green Book should have at least won an Oscar nomination for best cinematography. The film had a very colorful look to it, teal being a very prominent color. The atmosphere Green Book created had such a warm feel, which made the movie so much more pleasant to watch.Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both great actors, and they give solid performances. In my opinion, the acting was not ground breaking, but it's still on a A+ level. I'm more impressed with the supporting cast than Vigo Mortensen, as they give more ""Italian"" performance than VigoEverything about Green Book fell right in place like a jigsaw puzzle. The film had such a unique mood to it, which was created perfectly by the cinematography and atmosphere. Very few movies can compete with Green book when it comes to character development. Green Book is by far the best movie of 2018, if not the best movie in the past five years."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2019,8/10,Set in 60s I think but hey decent movie funny and sad in a way too.
GREEN BOOK,7 September 2020,,"The movie tries hard at being sentimental and warming, but for me, it lacks brains and anything profound. It's too sweet for me."
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2020,9/10,"The most basic ability of the ""Green Book"" is to show a fun journey between two people, and it is meaningful.Tony (Vigo Mortensen) is street wise. Over the years, he has been crawling on the ground floor. He is like a cowboy under the sun and dusk. He is good at weaving Xiao En Xiao Hui Xiao Xiao into a shabby but durable rope, and set it out, always getting some benefits back. In his case, there is no way out. Even if there is no job, the weight of the 26 hot dogs will at least be enough for him to collect 50 dollars.On the contrary, Tang (Mahshara Ali), as a well-established musician, does not touch the spring water with his fingers, and the ornate residence on the top of the theater, plus a high throne, is enough to exaggerate his identity and glory. Such a person is self-denying and elegant. If he wants to eat, he must lay a napkin of good quality.Such two people who couldn't beat each other in life were tied together for two months because of the employment relationship they needed each other.Everyone looks down on each other. How much Don looked down on Tony casually, how much Tony looked down on Don's contortion. However, Tang's cultivation will not let him show over-excited emotions, and Tony's profession makes him do his job.""Green Book"" is very playful, causing frequent friction between drivers and employers. It is not the confrontation between the needle point and Mai Mang, but the provocation, helplessness, curiosity, and tolerance mixed with each other, transforming each other's ""offense"" into a highly infectious understanding and acceptance.Tony, who was by nature, thought that he couldn't smoke in the car and had to be standardized, but he saw Tang's performance the first night, and the expression of appreciation and even pride appeared unconsciously. Don respected the fried chicken, but Tony couldn't help but draw a chicken leg out of the KFC's family bucket to him, leaving him helpless, but also enjoying an ""unhygienic"" happiness.Countless clips that can make people smile, the Green Book becomes more and more like that warm spring, with snow and snow."
GREEN BOOK,14 August 2021,5/10,"This movie starts out a bit boring, but the more the journey goes on, the more attached you get to the characters. Surely it has its heartwarming moments, but it plays way too safe and ends up being kind of shallow and simplistic despite the themes it tries to analyze. There have been so many movies about the matter, and you need a more profound or at least interesting approach in 2018 to make it worth it. Still a pleasant movie but can't understand why it got so many awards."
GREEN BOOK,3 October 2020,1/10,"Pretty images. Smooth camera. Smooth music. All decoration on a typical hollywood sad & angry movie. All characters sit numb, complaining, and when they're not doing that they're making something up to be angry about and no one is trying to de-escalate because then there's no action at all in the movie, so now is it not only sad & angry, it's cowardly."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,10/10,"Once again my heart is broken at watching how normalized racism and segregation were just half a century ago in this country, how normal it was for white people to use racial slurs and treat black people like inferiors. I mean, the word ""racism"" itself probably didn't even exist at the time. But the story of Tony Lip and Don Shirley's growing friendship brought me great comfort and I'm really grateful there were such good people, however few, among all the herds of bigots."
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,10/10,"4 January 2019
Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Green Book. I thought it was a strange title for a film then I realised as the film progressed that the Green Book was a thing, and as I sat captivated throughout this entire film I found that it never ceases to amaze and sadden me how humans treat fellow humans based on colour alone. This is a story inspired by the true friendship that developed between Tony Lip, a working-class American Italian from New York and Dr Don Shirley, a black pianist who employs Tony to be his driver for a tour of the Deep South where racial prejudice is right at the forefront of their whole existence. This film was exquisite, a tale of two men who are as far apart as can possibly be, one street smart, rough and ready, the other a highly educated and cultured person. They began as boss and employee and slowly formed a true and lasting friendship. Viggo Mortensen played Tony Lip and delivered a quite amazing performance. He combined the brash Italian character, with someone who had strong family values and a deep sense of good about him, even though he took the job just for the money he developed as a character as the film went along. Mahershala Ali, who played Dr Shirley was elegant and dignified throughout. This is a film I would happily watch again and again."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,,"Green book...Nominated and winning this that and the other...'must be something I should see. So on this very Monday, midday, we went to Hoyts Sydney having a gift card for Hoyts and Green Book not showing near our place in these particular cinemas. Then I read it was a comedy? This did not sound as good as I thought it may be, feeling more interested in a racial conflict I understood it was... We got our tickets and in due time entered a little cinema. Little but so well furnished with spacious and reclining chairs! Our ticket also mentioned 'coarse language'; something not rating high on my wife's taste, how would she cope with this? After some 20 minutes of the 'usual' (allowing for some shut-eye on my part) the movie finally started.
I really hadn't read much about it at all, so did not expect to see a mismatched pair embarking in an unforgettable journey. I was so glad not to have any real idea about it. Yes racial difference it had, but it had also indifference of race and it was so wonderful. Why oh why were they only a handful of people watching with us? Yes it was a Monday and day time; still I would have expected more people.
Both main characters were so likeable in their own make up. You grew with them through the story and fell for them. Although they underwent some changes they remained themselves till the end. I have never heard or seen these actors before, so it was another bonus for me. It was not ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" or ""Intouchable"", but a charming yet thought provoking epic. If you were a little more curious than I am you would have to know it is about a white Italian American Bouncer in need of a job that is channelled to drive for a black 'gentleman' concert pianist who despite his talent and reputation is not immune to racism as we found about it during his epic tour about various ""united states"".
Both actors are so pleasing and I would not want you to fear about the coarse language, I did not resent or even remember hearing it. There were a couple of appropriate violent moments but quite obliterated by the good nature and familial portraying.
As for the comedy...There were a few very funny episodes.
This shows that it is still possible to deal efficiently with gritty topics without indulging in over used vulgarity and profane language.
And it was nice to leave the theatre rewarded with a contented feeling, again from me no rating since I don't believe in rating."
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2020,4/10,"It's a bad mix of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". Nothing you haven't seen before. Boring, naive, one-dimensional characters. Also, there's the annoying omnipresent PC, that is arguably the only feature of this movie. The black man is a gay also, because nowadays you gotta go with the most possible number of minorities."
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2020,8/10,"I watched this movie during Christmas two years ago (2018).It was so great because it brings about a topic that should always be talked about and revolutionized forward.Set in the Deep South in 1962, the personal connection that the two men form is a special one. At times you think they are pushing each other's limits, but it always comes from a good intentioned place of care and transparency.This film is more than just a film. It is uplifting and shows what relationships between anyone can be like.Great storyline. Great filmmaking. Thank you for this gem."
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2019,10/10,"Green Book is a crowd-pleaure and Oscar winner not because it deals with racial tensions in the segregated American recent past, but because it deals with two very human and humane characters who form an unlikely friendship in the midst of a lifechanging and life-affirming road trip. A hallmark of a great film and journey is that the audience or at least myself was left wanting more and deeply care for these characters based on real life people and events. I would have happily hopped on their next road trip to continue to share the intimate details of their endearing bond.The screenplay lead by real life Nick Vallelonga is absolutely absorbing and drips with laugh out loud humour and characterization from the two leads and also some of the supporting cast. Mortenson plays the role of his life and has all the maneurism, talk and conflicted emotions of his flawed and interesting character. Ali assures a stoic and unsympathetic complex personality who excels, perseveres and has is own proclivities. He won the supporting actor Oscar for this while Mortenson was nominated for best lead but was in tough company with Cooper and Malek who won. The screenplay also won best original and deservedly so. Editing was also nominated and the story could not have been really told in a much better way dramatically while hitting all the humour and emotional marks.In the end, although racism, classim, homophobia and other strong and important social subjects are dealt with extremely well, the strength of Green Book lies in its capacity to allow us to discover an average man and his family while changing his preconceived ideas and giving contrasts and thought to an accomplished and inspiring musical genius. Genuinely rewarding cinema and highly recommended."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,9/10,"Its hard to say why but this is just a great film. The story line could not be simpler, based on a true story, its about a white man drives a black man across the American south in the early 60's. There isn't a lot more to it apart from that, and yet it is captivating. Its about 2 hours long but it felt like 10 minutes.Thankfully the film does not try to ram home any particular message, it shows all sides of a very different time and it works wonderfully.The acting and character development is just about perfect, they have you totally bought into them very quickly and nothing feels like its exaggerated at any point. There are some really good laughs, some tears and a lots of admiration.This film deserves all the awards it gets."
GREEN BOOK,16 May 2020,8/10,"What makes people lonely,Because I was afraid to take the first step."
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,10/10,"Set in the 1960s, Tony (Viggo Mortensen) works a bouncer for a local club. When the club closes its doors for a couple of months due to the club requiring renovations, Tony seeks other employment until he can return to work. He soon accepts a job as a driver for Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a pianist who will be going on tour, visiting many venues and locations.As the two travel, they have many conversations, encountering many situations and issues along the way. They also soon find out they can help one other personally as well as professionally. This film is based on a true story of a unlikely friendship.Needless to say, when our two leading actors are on screen the film is incredibly alive and enjoyable. The chemistry these two have on screen is believable and their relationship feels completely real, giving the audience the feeling that you too are on this road trip. At selected moments, the two leads are also really humorous to watch in the way they interact with each other and question each other's logic.The actors also deliver performances that are different to their previous work. For example, Viggo Mortensen put on weight for this role and delivers a great Italian- American accent. It's basic elements like these that make you forget he was ever a King protecting Hobbits with a ring.Without giving too much of the plot away, the story is basic and focuses mostly on the friendship and chemistry of our leads. Despite this, the film can be rather dramatic to watch at key moments. As the two go from town to town, it's unfortunate to witness how people react to both Tony and Dr Don, in particular when it comes to the topic of racism. Needless the say the film touches on this topic rather positively as by end of the film there is a great message for all which I really loved.With incredible acting done by both performers, the film's audio and visual also can't be faulted. I personally enjoyed the film's soundtrack (yes, lots of jazz). I noticed all the shots and camera movements were clear and smooth. Other elements such as set design were also really enjoyable to see on the big screen. My biggest surprise was to discover that Green Book was directed by Peter Farrelly who is best known for directing crude and rude films such as Dumb and Dumber, Hall Pass, Three Stooges and Shallow Hal etc. This alone completely surprised me given the director's past experience. It's a completely massive change in film style unlike anything I have seen.Overall, Green Book is a fantastic film and I personally enjoyed this film more than I expected I would. With fantastic acting, audio visual and a positive message to share, I have spent a long time trying to figure out what I personally didn't like about the film and my answer is... I have nothing. No complaints, not one. Green Book is an unforgettable masterpiece and simply a must see. Finesse!10/10

GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,10/10,"After the big win in Oscar, I got to watch this movie! WOW~ did not disappoint me at all! Absolutely deserve all the awards. The supporting actor, Mahershala Ali, is fantastic!! He was totally immersed into his character. I totally could feel his struggle & pain in his life in the movie. Also, I love all the scenes when he played piano!! For someone who didn't know how to play piano in real life to portray his character so successfully. I was so convinced that he was a real musician. Two thumbs up for this movie!"
GREEN BOOK,16 May 2021,8/10,"At the centre of this movie is another sad reminder of the ugly prejudice that once was and unfortunately still persists to this day, presented in little snippets that are all appropriately enraging. The mood is lightened by the colourful performances of the two lead characters, who's witty banter underscores more subtle race issues. It's not the first movie to explore these themes, and it's presentation is light and palatable, aiming for a feel good Hollywood resolution, but that doesn't make it's message any less important."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,5/10,Disappointed with Oscar winners this year. Again this movie is not my cup of tea. A bit boring. Highway film? Maybe i am not accustomed to this genre. In my place there is no highway film. My place is too small.
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,9/10,"The Green Book, for me, was one of those films where as I was watching it and after I watched it, I thought to myself 'It was okay.' But after a day or two went by the film really hit me good, and I thought to myself then 'no actually this was a really great film.'
Green Book is a film which really hits you after you watch it. From the images, to the sadness, and anger, to the camaraderie, peace and acceptance. And most of all to the friendship and love during the rough times it was taking place, what a beautiful message the film promotes to all of us. Superbly acted from top to bottom, well written, and well directed as Peter Farrelly steps out of his comfort zone of zany comedy, and makes a warm hearted, comedy-drama (for you Kingpin fans, the road trips in the Green Book will feel kind of nostalgic).
A powerful statement and a film which will put a big smile on your face. In my opinion, some of the best films are the ones which hit you in the heart days after you see it. And Green Book is just that. You will definitely love this film!"
GREEN BOOK,13 May 2019,8/10,"When I first found out about this film I was hyped, mainly because of the pairing of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. I mean, they are both such fantastic actors and come from very different filmic backgrounds so I was definitely interested. Also what caught my attention was Peter Farrelly's shift towards a drama picture. The fact that it involved a character being a classical pianist was a plus. It seemed like a recipe for a perfect film, yet it lacked some ingredients. I actually liked the fact that the racism came from a different place, it had different shades to it. Most of Dr. Don Shirley's audience were of upper class, people with refined tastes such as opera, art and classical music. So naturally, they highly respected him but nevertheless discriminated him because of the colour of his skin. That subtle treatment was done to a great extent in my opinion, rather than
showing merciless violence. Because it reminds us that racism can come in different, more fine-drawn ways that are still quite offensive because of its subtlety, and sometimes non-direct fashion. A lot of people feel that racism was treated quite lightly, to which I believe it was necessary to succesfully capture different nuances of the situation I stated earlier, regarding Dr. Shirley's profession and his target audience.Viggo and Mahershala give exceptional performances for two very different characters; they depicted Tony and Don's relationship quite well, it was a joy watching pure talent in the screen. Does it have a feel-good tone to it? Yes, this is a story about how two characters were able to look Don Shirley for what he truly is, a wonderful, gifted, highly intelligent human being; no matter the colour of his skin or his sexual orientation; let's not forget this happened in America's darkest decade, that is why their relationship takes a higher meaning.I deeply enjoyed this film, it was greatly written, beautifully acted and well directed. It's enough for me."
GREEN BOOK,28 September 2020,6/10,"Best picture winner green book is a nice movie. I feel nice is the best to describe it, the family dynamic is nice, the story isn't great but it's nice. There is no heart in this production. It was only made to win oscars, and it worked.The performances were pretty good and I think Viggo Mortensen was the best, but it's still nothing special. There is nothing special about green book whatsoever. Every scene is basically the same, they follow the exact same beats, they're shot the same way, they're edited the same way, It got really boring. My favourite part was the KFC ad, it was so blatant it was funny.Another huge problem is that nothing feels authentic. Everything felt a like set and the characters were cartoonish.I like the themes. Racism is bad. Heavy handed themes, a great performance and decent music is all green book has going for it. It's not even bad, but I wish it was. Green book just confirms what you already know, it's not challenging in the slightest. In the end it's just a predictable, repetitive, conventional, soulless movie."
GREEN BOOK,19 June 2021,3/10,"8.2!! Do NOT fall for this rating. I have never seen so many cliches and overacted/overdramatized scenes crammed into a movie in my life. It has the slick and polished production, but that can't overcome the steady stream of nonsense this movie dribbles forth. Sadly, these are the types of movies Viggo always seems to stumble upon, and honestly I don't think he possesses the talent to tackle anything of real substance. This movie had very strong subject matter but the handling and production was 2nd rate at best. The best thing here is the music and the cars of that era. Skip it. There's way better movies on racial tensions out there that aren't a laughable mess. Mississippi Burning. A Time To Kill. Avoid this stinker."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2020,8/10,"Every acting performances is great in this movie, the relation between the two mains character who learn more about each other is complex and fun to watch, i recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,1 December 2018,9/10,"Let's be honest: the trailer for this film made it look like a typical, Oscar-baiting, end of the year awards contender, and in a way it is. We can't deny it - the Oscars love their films about racists turning from their prejudiced ways, and about people struggling through the atrocities of racism and bigotry, and this trailer just looked like more of the same; it's hard to get excited about a film when it looks like it was put together by a bunch of studio executives whose only thoughts were, ""How can we win the Oscar this year?"" But if there's one man I have faith in, one man who is a light in a dim, dark world, it's Viggo Mortensen, so I held out hope because if there's one thing Mr. Mortensen doesn't do, it's star in bad movies. And you know what? ""Green Book"" is most certainly not a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty darn excellent.Look, is this movie Oscar bait? Yes. But is it well-done Oscar bait? Oh yes, it is. Immediately this movie is entertaining, right from the beginning. It's never overly melodramatic, nor too serious, like ""Crash,"" the so-called king of Oscar bait. Instead, while it is still maddening to watch people be casually and unflinchingly racist, ""Green Book"" has an overall softer, more lighthearted, and humorous tone throughout. And this very fun and entertaining tone was a much needed change of pace from other Oscar bait films, which tend to emotionally manipulate audiences by tugging at their heartstrings, using emotion, instead of quality, to trick their audiences into thinking they just saw a good movie. ""Green Book"" is straight-up entertaining from beginning to end, and has more than its fair share of laugh out loud moments.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali also had amazing, standout chemistry. I mean, watching these two guys drive around, become friends, crack jokes, and stand up for each other? I loved it. The movie could've been 4 hours long of them driving around and I would've loved every second because watching these two men interact is some of the most fun time I've had at the movies. Viggo Mortensen is amazing in practically everything he's ever been in, and ""Green Book"" is no exception. He plays a character with such a strong personality that when he's on screen, you really can't take your eyes off of him. And Mahershala Ali, too, plays a character with a unique personality, just a very different one. And regardless, seeing both characters change, and change each other, for the better was riveting and highly entertaining viewing; they played off of each other so well, and you really feel like you become friends with them as you're watching them go on their cross-country journey.Obviously, this isn't a perfect film. The direction does feel a little stagnant; yes, the acting is phenomenal, but the film feels very glossy and glazed over, just a little too ""high-definition,"" for lack of a better word. Also, there are a few moments that do feel a little on the nose (look for the scene with people working in a field), but overall I found this movie to be an incredibly fun and entertaining time at the theatre. The acting is really, really good, the story is endlessly entertaining thanks to the marvelous chemistry between the two lead characters, and the message is undoubtedly important. If you want to have a good time at the movies this holiday season, you don't have to look much further than ""Green Book."""
GREEN BOOK,25 October 2020,10/10,"A great story about an unusual friendship in the 1960s. The greatest strength of this film is the great story that is told through two characters who cannot be more different than they are, but still complement each other perfectly. The two main actors have done an amazing job, especially the great Viggo Mortensen. The way their relationship progresses from the first meeting, where they immediately saw that they could not be different and through a journey where they learn a lot about the other, but also about themselves until the end of the film, I think they succeeded in all intent to present us an unusual duo at a strange time, and to provoke our emotions. I liked the film very much and the more I think about it, the more I realize I can't find any flaw in it. I can understand that someone won't like a movie because of a sensitive topic like racism, but I haven't even personally experienced the film solely through that prism. I think the theme is more geared towards people's relationship to each other, regardless of skin color and place of origin because it doesn't determine what kind of people we are as we can't choose or influence it. However, what kind of people we will be, it is determined exclusively by ourselves through our behavior towards others, our actions and our relationships with people. We influence that very much. Although there are some awkward and unfair scenes due to the theme, at times I got the impression of a feel good film, although I'm not sure that the director (Peter Farrelly is known exclusively for many comedies) aimed at that, but also some scenes made me laugh, and that he certainly wanted to. Considering that it was done according to real people and real friendship, I think that it gained extra weight. I don't know if this will become a classic in a few years, but I was delighted with the film and it was given the maximum rating."
GREEN BOOK,16 May 2020,10/10,"This film is one of the best I watched last time. Firstly, the plot is perfect, for the first view ot seems very simple: road-movie in 60s in USA, but it has deeper meaning. It shown social problems of this times, and that problems touched different people despite of their skin colour. The story makes me laugh, be angry, be serious and cry. Secondly, duet of main characters is the brilliant of film. I think Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali played their best roles for nowadays. They played two very different people from different parts of society but they understand each other during the film.
So, it's one the best film of last decade and it really deserved Oscar."
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2020,9/10,"This is a fine movie about what makes for friendship across cultures. At the beginning, the gruff 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga played by Viggo Mortensen seems too down with it and streetwise to meaningfully bond with the exalting Doctor Don Shirley as stirringly represented by Mahershala Ali. However, through the course of the narrative, their characters prove to have complementary angles that eventually add up to the 180 degrees needed for a stable friendship.The truth is people like Doctor Don Shirley are much more familiar to me than characters like John Shaft and Priest Youngblood. Black Folks can seem like everyday people until you sit down and talk to them and gradually find they are revealed as highly accomplished, and, more often than not, formally or informally expert in some field or another. I knew this fellow named Amos, an older gentleman I worked with when I was transporting cars around the lot at Hertz Rent-A-Car. Anyone could tell him about a major or minor problem they were having with their car, and you would swear you were listening to Sherlock Holmes, the way he could deduce from signs and symptoms what was wrong with your automobile, or less charitably, a professor at a Community College giving a lecture on Automotive Mechanics.We would hear about what happened to the John Shaft and Priest Youngblood types in anecdotes. Usually, how they had been thrown in the river or died in some kind of shootout. But the Don Shirleys of the world I more easily found myself crossing paths with in some way or another. There were the magnetic and charismatic individuals like Reverend Spahn, who would come to our house and wax rhapsodic about Gandhi, and the sense of liberation he discovered and experienced devoting himself to the service of others. There were other folks like the Reverend Tommy Butler, who wrote and directed the Pulitzer Prize caliber musical SELMA, with followers and devotees comparing him to Duke Ellington, not withstanding that he was also a third degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. So running into every day people who, when you scratched the surface, were highly accomplished in one way or another, was more commonplace within the Black Community than you might imagine.Doctor Don Shirley, you could say, represents the apex of his ilk. A man who, evidently, spoke several languages and was the proud possessor of several academic degrees, while being feted around the world as a great classical and jazz pianist. He still finds himself, whether he realizes it or not, in need of serious security and the muscle of an Italian American bouncer, notwithstanding his true status as a member of intellectual and artistic royalty. He will also be depending on a guide book compiled by Victor Hugo Green as he makes his way through the Midwest and the racism of the Deep South with his concert tour.There are surprises galore as the two men evolve past their own prejudices against each other and use their wits and good will to navigate through the chauvinism of their times. The director Peter Farrelly, with a penetrating sociological and psychological insight that hits more often than it misses, drives along with this unlikely pair through the cold and the snow home to the rousing musical score of Kris Bowers. Seems we are just in time for dinner, not far from the street sign that reads LIFETIME FRIENDSHIP.I would also like to thank a beloved friend for recommending this movie to me and bringing me here as well."
GREEN BOOK,7 September 2019,8/10,"Being a fellow Italian, whenever anything with a lot of heritage is made it catches my attention. From the start of the movie I fell in love with the characters, the story is something I've never seen before. I highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch it."
GREEN BOOK,22 December 2019,10/10,"Great acting , great sentiment and lots of laughs
You will enjoy this one"
GREEN BOOK,26 January 2019,10/10,"I forgot when was the last time I went out of the cinema and didn't feel even a bit disappointed. This movie is a living classic and I'm sure I will rewatch it many many times.
Green book is a simple yet touching story of two different people who have to work together, for different reasons as well: one needs the money, the other needs the services only the first can provide almost flawlessly. Eventually the need to help each other becomes a habit and from there on in transforms into something much more valuable than both people could have expected: a friendship.
Viggo Mortensen is the heart of this movie, he made me laugh, he made me think of myself lots of times too. Mahershala Ali's performance was solid and thought-out; both characters are well-written and you can feel their chemistry from the very first scene of their meeting. I would also like to single out the amazing soundtrack of this masterpiece and wonderful screenplay.
We have a lot of prejudices in our lives about all kinds of people, some we learned from experience, some were rooted deep inside us since day one but all of them can fade in a moment when you learn the person next to you is not a walking and talking stereotype you painted him to be - he is more complex than that; all the people are, we are just too lazy to think out of the box once in a while. ""Green book"" is just about the perfect reason to do it more frequently."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,9/10,"I haven't seen a film like Green Book in quite some time. A film that doesn't have long-winded exposition followed by a dramatic resolution, but that is still satisfying the entire way through. I liken it to Forrest Gump in the sense that the captivation does not come from a place of waiting to see what comes next, but rather, it comes from being in that moment with the characters. Viggo Mortensen's performance was astonishing as a firmly rooted New Yorker. It certainly helped that Director Peter Farrelly pulled me into the 60s about thirty seconds into the opening scene. Green Book is a character driven film in which the characters are complex enough to remove certain aspects of predictability that we expect from most films. This was one of the best I have seen from 2018 and I recommend anyone give it a try."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,10/10,"This is based upon true eventsIn 1962 in New York, due to the Copa Cabana closing for renovations, club Bouncer, Tony Lip (Mortensen) needs a job and takes one driving Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) a snobbish person, but also a genius pianist to concerts in the deep south.Tony is given the Green Book which is called The Negro Motorist Green Book, which tells Blacks traveling in the south the safe places to eat and rest.This is a movie that we will see attitudes and prejudices change and it won't be easy for both Tony and Dr. Shirley. We will see Dr. Shirley try to cultivate Tony as best he can and that is an uphill battle, but Tony rolls with the punches. It's not at all quite obvious, but changes are happening within Dr. Shirley, too.It is definitely the script banter that wins in here. It is honest and often very funny. At one point Tony tells Dr Shirley that he, Tony, is more black than he is because he (Dr. Shirley) knows nothing of the current black music, has never eaten fried chicken and really doesn't know how the blacks live and he sits on his throne looking down on everyone. And to be sure, Dr. Shirley has a good rebuttal for all this.Notable: Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife.We also see troubles along the way and most times Tony handles all. One time Dr. Shirley gets them out of trouble and he admits to calling someone in Washington DC and that person called Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States to help and he did.The banter between Tony and Dr. Shirley is pure gold and this keeps us engaged and hoping for the best.Near the end I kept hoping that the family dinner at Tony's would encounter one more knock on their door. You'll see what I mean.This movie is definitely a MUST SEE. You won't be disappointed.Stay tuned before the credits run for pictures of the real Tony and Dr. Shirley and statements of how Tony and Dr. Shirley ended up. (10/10)Violence: No.

GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,9/10,"I've seen a lot of humanity kind of movie, but this one was different. god it was so fun and beautiful at the same time. i was going to gave it 8 actually but they can maintain the comedy till the last part of the movie, how can i gave it 8 hhahasome scene shot are even suprise me, man there become a remarkable in just a second of time.the way that this movie make the two main character fill each other step by step was amazing, it make 2 hour movie seem really fast. at the end of the day this is one of the movie who gave you all of warmness. you named it, family, love,friendship. it's all here."
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,9/10,The acting truly is great in this movie! Mahershala Ali is one of the best actors of our generation. Viggo is also quite wonderful in this movie. What a great friendship these two had.
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,9/10,"Loved the movie. The performances are outstanding shout out to Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the dudes are amazing. The story is powerful, and talks about a very tough issue (similar to BlacKkKlansman, but in a ""subtle"" way), but it's done with such careful, and in a gradative pace.The way their relationship is build throughout the movie is great. I love the way they kind of make a parallel between the characters, and how Viggo's is ""blacker"" than Ali's (explicit saying that at one point). Talking about that scene in specific, this might be my favorite scene in a movie all year. The build up for it is perfect, and man, Ali's performance is phenomenal, he truly delivered it. You feel for the character, you realize that he has no one in his life, he is curse to never be 100% a part of any social group he might find on society, and outcast. What a scene.The only issue I had with the movie, is just about one plot point. In the beginning we see a scene where Tony throws to cups in the trash can, because to black man drank water on it. So you think ""ok, the dude is pretty racist"", but this is not exactly an issue throughout the movie. Actually, 20 minutes after, he is playing games with some black guys outside the first club Don performed on. The only scene when this kind of gets between them, is briefly in the scene when he comes back to the car to get his wallet and goes to pee. But overall, he's pretty ok with Don since the beginning. Anyways, doesn't exactly makes the movie bad, and it something you forgot halfway throughout it, but still, it something I believe is a inconsistency into the script.Overall, I loved Green Book, is a strong and incredibly well made movie, who deserves his Oscar nomination. I highly recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,7/10,"Green Book tackles the difficult and seldom approached issue of racism in America, something still contentious today; however, the script allows both a serious message whilst not muddling the issue with a message too heavy for the nature of the film.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are Oscar-worthy, both turning in performances accurately and with subtle nuances giving an added depth. Artistry and costume design is brilliant, along with the depiction of New York at the beginning and end of the film.Overall, Green Book is a pure film with good intentions - the music backs the excellent casting and well-thought script to create a complete piece, worthy of watching."
GREEN BOOK,30 April 2020,8/10,"The great thing about this movie is that the script is solid, and it is very outstanding in characterization and details. This journey south all the way will not allow Dr. Don Shirley to prove his status in the hearts of white people. He is lonely and no one can help him unless he reconciles with himself to complete a self about himself. Redemption. It does not deliberately teach anything, but everyone can see the encounters of certain groups in different times, not just blacks and whites. The theme of this movie is as the finishing line in the film says, because genius is not enough, only courage can change people's hearts, and this is a movie about courage and change. Although it 's a very routine road movie, it 's very warm."
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,9/10,"This film blew me completely away, this doesn't happen often but this film was a true joy to watch from start to finish. To be honest I had not heard of this film, I hadn't even seen a trailer for it before I saw it, so went in completely unaware of the story. Wow wow wow almost a perfect film, its just spectacular.Firstly lets start with the story as the first positive, there are many positives in this film. The story is of Mahershala Ali's character ""Don Shirley"", who is a pianist, going on a road trip through America with Viggo Mortensen's character of ""Tony Lip"" as his driver. So the premise itself is pretty straight forward, however this film is set in 1960's America and the two of them are travelling towards the deep south. This brings a number of huge challenges or problems that could arise due to the obvious fact that one man is black and the other is white.
Now this film could definitely have been an extremely dark and depressing film showing the racism in America at that time all throughout its run time. In a way it does that but its achieved in the simplest of ways either through a simple conversation or action. The hints can be subtle at times and front-centre at other times. The reason that dark subject matter works in this film is because it is balanced with some great humour that runs throughout the film. Neither one aspect of the film overshadows the other, the film is not to dark nor its it too lighthearted about sed subject matter. Just perfect screenplay for this film.There some tense scenes in the film whether that be not allowing ""Don Shirley"" to use the inside toilet but an outside one or when they try to buy a suit , he is not allowed. There just a couple of examples but the film definitely can take a serious stance when it needs to and it handles extremely well.I don't think I've laughed more in a film in 2018 because the humour is clever and some small little jokes can go on for long time. Majority of it is between the two main characters and predominately ""Tony Lips"" ignorance to black people and to America at that time. One line he says is that he wouldn't be offended if someone said all Italian's are the same.......or something on those lines. Due to that his ignorance means he doesn't see why claiming all black people are the same is any different. However he does get offended when he is compared to some of the ""Southern white men"" in the film. Some of the best humour has to be when it either involves ""Tony Lip"" writing letters to his wife, who knows the truth about them, or the gun and rock he either does or doesn't have on him. Just brilliant dialogue for this actors to read.Best part about the story and film for me is the fact that both men learn from one another and try to be better people. Most of it is Ali's character trying to help Mortensen's character understand the ignorance of his ways. It is achieved in a brilliant way, through friendship.Now onto the last two positives, they are Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Both of those men bring there A-game to this film. I'd have to say that I think Viggo is slightly better that Ali but thats probably due to the fact that his character has more to do and his a likeable idiot. Therefore most of the humour is due to Mortensen's character but that doesn't take away from ALi' performance in anyway, both of them elevate each other. Mortensen , Best Acting Oscar????Overall this film is 90% out of 100 or 9 out of 10, just go and see this film trust me you will not be disappointed, this is such a joyful film to watch in a strange way because of its subject matter. However that is exactly what the film does, it turns darkness into joy and ignorance into awareness.PS: The fact this was based on real events is all the better, the film has really good ending!"
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,10/10,"The topic matter was not my cup of tea but I like both the actors and wanted to see what all the oscar talk was about...I was Not dissapointed....The acting is impeccable, heartfelt and believable ....Fantastic chemistry here...There is a learning of each man of the other and both horizons are expanded in the end...this is a movie that touches sensitive topic matter in a way that still will leave you at the end with a good feeling...very good movie that deserved to be a runner up in the oscars, but bohemian rhapsody deserved to take the main win as this was good but it was even better."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,9/10,"It was funnier than I was anticipating! I was a little worried there would be too much violence (like the first couple scenes) but it definitely improved and exceeded my expectations! The set, props, and production were perfectly and appropriately constructed. I believe this could win best picture this year! The leading actors' performances are amazing and I really enjoyed seeing Sebastian Maniscalco in the cast too!"
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2020,9/10,"Gripping, true to the tone, great cast, acting and performances...really an Oscar Movie 👌🏾. There was a point I nearly teared up. Movie is Soo good with lessons to be learnt and at the end of the day, it's all about the FAMILY!"
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,6/10,"If I were to sum this film up it would be funny, charming, pretty and unoriginal. Every stereotype about African Americans in the 1960s is reversed and removed from the black character and placed on the white character. It's a rehash of a dark part of American history, shown via the adventure of two people on the opposite ends of the social spectrum.What really disappointed me however was the acting by Viggo Mortensen. His New York City accent was borderline terrible. I'm from NYC and I am Italian American. It was unnatural. People do not force their accents like that here. His performance reminded me of Travolta's accent in Saturday Night Fever. Way over the top and forced.Gripes aside, the two main characters have decent chemistry and their growing bond over the course of the film feels genuine and felt. The cinematography and set designs were spectacular as well. It's not the most dramatic film though. I can't give Green Book more than a 6/10. Worth a watch but very forgettable."
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,9/10,"People complain that this film has the ""white saviour"" narrative. But I didn't see it like that at all. It was about two polar opposites with different worldviews, with people treating them differently. And yet somehow, they find a way to connect with and ultimately help one another.The two performances are absolutely brilliant. Mortensen is incredibly funny and witty while Ali showcases extreme depth as a lonely, sophisticated piano player.The film is respectful to the time period, not shying away from the racism of its time, and yet still manages to maintain a certain level of comfort. Not sure if it deserved to win Best Picture, but it is certainly worthy of its acclaim."
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2020,8/10,This film was done very well. I found it very touching. The characters were very round and the Dialogue was great between the two main characters. Really well done film all around.
GREEN BOOK,29 October 2019,9/10,"I didn't see that coming but this movie hits a nerve in such a simple way... A different way, a way through friendship. Its a portrait of new friendship, racism, adventure, beautiful places and the start of a new era. This duo has an amazing chemistry and their performance is really great. It deserves its recognition."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,8/10,"Glad I viewed this before it won 'Best Picture', and the cynics skewed my perception of this film as they felt another film was more deserving of the award. I don't put much stock in the Oscars and I for one enjoyed the film based on true events."
GREEN BOOK,13 December 2018,9/10,"So I saw Green Book at the theater. Of course I was excited to see the movie based upon the incredible cast. I'm always hesitant around Oscar season because it seems there is normally at least one film that gets far more praise than it deserves. I'm happy to say Green Book was certainly not that film. It all around was a great film that covers a wide variety of complex issues while providing a crowd-pleasing experience for all.The premise of the movie follows the true story of the talented and stoic musician Doc Shirley and his talkative blue-collar driver/ bodyguard Tony Lip as they go on a music tour of the Deep South. Both men are presented to be polar opposites and hold false perceptions towards each other. Of course along the way the two men realize the perceived differences between them are not so wide and a budding friendship blooms. The film covers a wide variety of topics related to social class, cultural norms, segregation, racism, substance abuse, and sexuality. The film manages to fit all these topics nicely into a well rounded and entertaining buddy comedy drama that will leave you smiling.Of course the film also acts as a backdrop to demonstrate the historical setting of the Jim Crow South and race relations as a whole from that era. There are number of times throughout the film where they illustrate the harsh realities of discrimination and prejudice faced against black individuals due to racism. Of course the film also takes it's social commentary a step further by looking at class differences that exist between individuals and just how those also create different life chances and cultural norms.The film did capture a lot of the racial and ethnic tension felt from that era. Racism did not exist only in the south and the film illustrated that racial prejudice exists along many cultural avenues. The film asks questions about an individual's identity and just how much race plays into a person's concept of self. The film also demonstrates the harsh realities of stereotyping and just how all these cultural ideas are harmful particularly in regard to race.Of course what makes this movie really special is its acting. Mahershala Ali sure knows how to pick a role. He brought such a complexity to the character. You really felt for his struggle and pain as he dealt with issues regarding racism and his own identity. His range as an actor allowed him to convincingly play the role of a complex and compelling character.Viggo Mortensen was outstanding as expected. He has a way of transforming himself directly into the character. Not only did he put on quite a bit of weight for the role but he perfectly captured the mannerisms and colloquial manners of speech aswell. A less-talented actor could not have played the role and transformed the character into a likeable protagonist. I would not be surprised at all if both get nominated for Oscars for their performance. The movie it is worth watching entirely for their performances alone.Directing wise there was nothing wrong with the film. The film was very dialogue-driven, but again the performances by the actor's made the film quite entertaining. Despite its length I didn't see any issue with pacing and I really didn't have any issues with unnecessary plot points. The score of the film was also quite impressive.Now as far as negatives of the film there were a few points that could have been improved upon. Viggo Mortensen's character starts the film off with a display of his racial bias, but it never really goes anywhere. The film wants us to like its main character a little bit too much so we don't see the darker side of his prejudice. The film also had an opportunity to make more of a statement regarding the Jim Crow South. While it did have a number of examples of institutional and cultural discrimination, it only really scratched the surface of the racial tension of that era. Ultimately the film wanted to play more into the light-hearted comedy drama angle than a serious commentary on racial prejudice.I thoroughly enjoyed Green Book. It was easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2018. The film had an interesting and compelling story that was grounded in incredible acting and solid directing. There are multiple moments throughout the film that will leave you laughing and cheering at the buddy morality tale about friendship and compassion. The film did lose a few points for playing it safe in regard to racial tensions, but that just wasn't the movie it was trying to make. It's hard to fault a film when it wasn't trying to make a gritty serious drama. A 9.25 out of 10."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2020,9/10,The acting in this movie was so wonderful.. It wasn't the story necessarily but the chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen was wonderful to watch. I felt myself really drawn into this movie..
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2020,8/10,Feel good and glosses over deeper topics usually for more light hearted moments. Exploring those deeper topics would give the film a lot more payoff. Well acted. Script and screenplay are executed well. Good pace. Solid direction.
GREEN BOOK,21 October 2020,10/10,"This movie is just so so so good. Great cinematography, acting, music."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,10/10,"Without a shadow of doubt there is no more deserving film for best picture than this one .The story is equally as important now as it was when it was set in the early 1960s . I have said many times that films based on real events make the best films .This is a story of ignorance and one man's attempt to rise above the hate and violence - like a Ghandi type character his strength came not from the fist but from his conviction that he was right .It was a story of an unlikely friendship where two worlds collided and the master servant relationship was juxtaposed.If you like drama with humour , with laughter and with tears this is the film for you .Brilliant 10/10"

GREEN BOOK,22 May 2020,9/10,"What a beautifully directed and produced film celebrating the culmination of two races and backgrounds in a time when it was unthinkable. It's exceptional people like these that we have to thank for a (largely) pro-anti-cultural community now. People who fought back against the ignorance society had created based on a persons skin colour. Odd to imagine what that world was like and although a minority will always continue to push their ignorance forwards, the majority of society nowadays know better thank god. God bless both their souls. Very good watch and very entertaining. One of the best films I've watched in a while."
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,7/10,"Up against racially charged cinematic explosions at the Oscars, ""The Green Book"" took home the grand prize, and made Spike Lee attempt to flee the premises. The polarizing win makes for healthy debate and curiosity seekers should check this film out.This role reversal, buddy-buddy shtick flows mighty thick, but it actually happened. A good natured Italian thug is hired to drive a prim and proper black musician on a tour of the South. In 1962. Yup. A big-hearted, big-stomached Viggo Mortensen stumbles perfectly through his inevitable transformation from racist simpleton to enlightened simpleton, while Mahershala Ali's hard shell eventually softens enough to join in the Merry Christmassy ending.The cookie cutter script is baked just right, but anyone hoping for an edgier take on America's race relations best look elsewhere. Where ""The Green Book"" shines is in the background details - the sets, the cars, the hotels, Little Richard on the radio. This is 1962 America.It may not have been the game changer folks craved to see groping golden statuettes on Oscar's night, but Mortensen and Ali made it come to life, and that's why the ""The Green Book"" succeeds."
GREEN BOOK,17 May 2019,9/10,"Farrelly steps outside his normal films somewhat to helm one of the finest comedy dramas in recent memory. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. The entire cast delivers the goods. In particular Ali and Mortensen are superb. Their portrayals of the characters and their friendship are so convincing, they emit a real life feeling. Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Dr. Don Shirley who is an African American prodigy pianist. By his own choice Shirley decides to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South during 1962. Knowing he will need protection, Shirley hires Tony Lip whose reputation as a fast talking, tough bouncer proceeds himself. Lip is an Italian American who resides in the Bronx and is currently unemployed due to renovations at the Copacabana. So as fate has it, the two men from completely different sides of the proverbial spectrum start a unique road trip. Despite their differences in culture and ethnicity, which is revealed through their constant banter and time spent alone together, the men form a special bond. This all occurs while the two men face danger and racism during an era of segregation. The plot is clever, crisp, insightful, thought provoking, heartwrenching, heartwarming and has a wonderful ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. Lip's quote, ""Don't worry 'bout it. I been working nightclubs in New York City my whole life. I know it's a complicated world."" rings true today. That is what adds to making this an eventual timeless and classic work of art, which is symbolic of the friendship that was formed."
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2019,8/10,This is a great film about a bouncer called Tony Lip played brilliantly by Viggo Mortensen he gets hired by a black pianist called Don Shirley played by Mahershali Ali. Tony Lip is an Italian American who sticks to his own people but he needs this job. The job is to drive Don around on a road tour down to the deep south for concerts. It is set in 1962 based on a true story where race relations was it its height. The characters at first don't get on very well they have tackle the racial issues in the south. But they really grow a relationship with each other to try and get over prejudices. Ali is a magnificent actor he proved it when he won the Oscar for Moonlight in 2016 and he proves it again here. Viggo is also brilliant and his perfectly cast for this role. The film was written by Tony Lip's son and you can see the affection the screenplay has for these two real life characters. The film has some very funny moments but also some very difficult moments to watch. I really enjoyed this film and think it has a great chance at the Oscars
GREEN BOOK,4 June 2020,9/10,"POSITIVES:1) The two central performances from Mortensen and Ali are both incredible
2) There is a fantastic duality between the two central characters. Tony is very animalistic, yet he is treat with sophistication because he is white. Meanwhile, Don is very sophisticated, yet he is treat like an animal because he is black
3) The scenes of Don playing the piano are shot in a way where you can actually see him play the piano. That is very rare in films
4) The film focuses on the relationship between Tony and Don and that relationship is great
5) Sometimes the film doesn't get enough credit for its exploration of race and racial issuesNEGATIVES:1) The only real negative is that sometimes the film has too much sheen. For example, there is rarely a scene in the film that does not feature a 60s song or a swelling score in the background. Over a 130 minute runtime, this can get a bit repetitive"
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2019,8/10,"Every year we watch a new movie about racism. Normal, we have to get bored of this. But I'm still surprised. People don't use the same toilet, only 50 years ago."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2020,7/10,Great period detail and two great actors make this film well worth a two hour investment of your time. Vigo Mortensen is barely recognisable and on top form as the tough Italian American transporting Mahershala Ali's world class musician across the Deep South in 1962
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,9/10,"It's a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensen's great performances. I am not sure if deserved a nomination for Best Film but it's two actors undoubtedly deserved it. The magic of screen chemistry is once again showcased as Ali and Mortensen bring out the best in each other and their respective characters. It is a film with a solid script and a must see this year. It has a warm, congenially progressive vibe and a wonderfully street line of humor. It is both a joyous and sorrowful film, capturing the sense of an unlikely friendship, and the sadness from watching the effects of deeply ingrained racism. ""Green Book"" has a message that perhaps seems obvious, but is necessary taking into account the time in which we live. nikisreviews.gr"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,9/10,"Now and again amongst the comic book franchises, the re- hashed horror and total CGI comes an interesting story that's truly entertaining. I don't know if it's just a blip in studio output but they have recently released some good films with different stories. The whole cast were excellent, the editing / pacing well done, all helped by a script that had a bit of everything. Furthermore it's not a PC preachy type, it just retells a story for viewers to consider. Very good, watch when you can."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2020,9/10,A must watch for everyone. starts off good and then it just great!! fantastic performance from viggo. when you first see/meet him you think just another thug but no much more heart than that. watch it.
GREEN BOOK,23 August 2021,8/10,"Excellent performances from Viggo Mortensen and particularly Mahershala Ali. Both full of character.A very cultured black musician tours the Deep South in 1960's with his working class Italian American driver and bodyguard, dealing with the discrimination and getting to know each other along the way.Very heart-warming story told in an immersive way. Very good movie."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,9/10,"The basic storyline for this movie, a very personal look at the state of race relations in America in 1962, is all set up for penetrating drama, but one thing I didn't expect going in to the the theater last night is how funny it is. It's an Odd Couple buddy movie, and the script gives lots of chances for driver/bouncer/jack-of-all-trades Tony (played by Viggo Mortensen) to bounce off pianist virtuoso Don (Mahershala Ali) as they gradually come to understand each other's very different worlds during a two-month road trip.Ali plays a rather restrained role this time out as a famed classically trained pianist who has learned to keep his temper and maintain his dignity in the face of constant, daily insults, slights, and (at times) physically dangerous attacks simply because he's black. On concert tours we see that he keeps to himself, drinks pretty heavily at night, and is flat-out lonely. But this movie really belongs to Mortensen, who has to be the best actor around never (yet) to win an Oscar. As he has done with all of his movie roles, he completely and utterly vanishes into his character, down to the smallest gesture, details of accent, and even weight gain (to match Tony's habit of constantly eating mediocre food accompanied by chain smoking). He's an actor's actor, and I sure hope his work gets recognized this time out.The script has a pretty big cast overall, because Tony and Don meet a lot of other people on their extended tour (in addition to very entertaining occasional cuts back to Tony's extended Italo-American family in the Bronx as Tony's wife (Linda Cardeliini) reads out his letters from the road). They're all excellent. Go see this movie, you won't regret it."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,10/10,"With a start a little bit slow, the movie begins when the two characters starting your journey for the shows, and all racists moments start, it's really sad know that it was real and still it is, it's touching the way of the character handle with this, your personality is incredible, and know that is a biography turn more interesting. I like all the journey of the two characters, how they learn from each other, had moments that do you think about and you cry, a really beautiful movie. l just loved so much know this story."
GREEN BOOK,26 January 2019,7/10,"There is much to enjoy in the first half of GREEN BOOK, solidly anchored in the performances of the two leads, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, in a competent direction, good script, excellent photography, and excellent recreation of the 1960s.Sadly, the second half becomes increasingly moralistic and schmaltzy, and Ali's performance increasingly manneristic. GREEN BOOK also boasts a happy ending, which is bound to help its box office but which struck me as downright dishonest in light of what was actually happening in the US at the time.Mortensen's performance is the only consistent quality item in the film."
GREEN BOOK,26 May 2019,10/10,"We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,8/10,"Out of all the 2018 Oscar nominees, this was one I was looking forward to the most and I'm happy that it lived up to the hype. This wasn't your typical racial film, it was so much more. The chemistry between Ali and Mortenson is tremendous and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
GREEN BOOK,2 September 2020,10/10,"What a heartwarming movie! Throughout the film's runtime, I had a smile on my face. The quality of the smile changed from goofy to warm, but the smile almost never faded, barring a few scenes.
It's a lovely road movie with two opposite characters thrown into the mix. I must confess that I didn't have very high hopes for the movie. Somehow, the premise didn't feel all that fresh to me. Thankfully, the movie was developed and conceptualized quite well.
Mahershala Ali is phenomenal with his nuanced & sensitive portrayal of a great virtuoso & a sophisticated man of refined tastes. Viggo Mortensen inhabited his role so completely that it's difficult to believe that he's not an Italian!
The dialogue is superb. Here's a great one:
""Dear Dolores, sometimes you remind me of a house. A house with beautiful lights on it, where everyone is happy inside.""
A warm movie full of great laughs!"
GREEN BOOK,30 November 2018,7/10,"Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give stellar performances in this true story about a NYC club employee and bodyguard who is hired by a classical pianist from Carnegie Hall to drive him through his performance tour across the South in the early 1960s, during which they develop a solid bond, despite their considerable educational and socioeconomic differences.I would call this film decent, light entertainment. It definitely offers a glimpse into how impressive Mortensen's range is an actor. The same actor who gave compelling performances in films like ""A Dangerous Method"" and ""Captain Fantastic"" is thoroughly riveting to watch here as he disappears into the role of ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga and Ali is impressive as Don Shirley, a Jamaican-American musician who became well-known in his era.This film doesn't break too much ground, in all honesty. It's good diverting cinema but as a film released during Oscar season, it's fairly run-of-the-mill with no real surprises. But I do give Peter Farrelly a lot of credit for stepping out of his usual repertoire and giving us a different genre to look at within his filmography. Recommended."
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2020,9/10,"This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like."
GREEN BOOK,20 December 2020,8/10,"This film starts out somewhat slow but really shines when it develops its characters so well and introduces you to such a interesting duo and story. The white chauffeur is mafia esk, rough and almost pigish with food. Whilst the black famous pianist is extremely posh and professional which makes for a hilarious and fun Rollercoaster of a relationship. The story is sad but wholesome as its set in a time of huge segregation and racism but the chauffeur sticks up for him along the way. Overall a very sweet film with great acting, story and characterization. If your into your emotional films this is definitely one to watch!"
GREEN BOOK,22 November 2018,9/10,Green Book is about a black piano player who is going to the western part of the U.S.A. He needs a driver and a person to protect him. He finds a person and they both go through many challenges to make all the concerts.Green Book was a great movie. The writing was outstanding. It was funny in some scenes and series in others. The comedy was just so funny at times. It wasn't any dumb comedy it was all clever. The depiction on racism was really well done in this movie. It gave you the idea on how hard it was for colors back then. Also how hard the police was. Some scenes in this movie were great. One scene when they were in a restaurant towards the end was beautiful and powerful. The acting was astonishing to watch. They both portrayed there parts really well. The times when they played the piano was great. It showed how cool it is to be on a stage.Green Book was a great movie. I would recommend to go see it.
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,8/10,"This film revolves around the social hierarchy of the 1960s, where we follow protagonist Dr. Shirley played by Mahershala Ali. Viggo Mortensen is his personal driver for his piano tour down south.There is a very well-made screenplay, complemented brilliantly by the excellent performances by Ali and Mortensen. I believe that Mortensen nailed it particularly as the bouncer type, and I would have loved to see him win the academy award for best actor in a leading role rather than seeing Ali win again for supporting.I must say that the script is very PC but it is still a great buddy film that I can highly recommended - a life-affirming film with a great message."
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2020,9/10,"Its about changing the world. How we are biased to people by color. How we assume something and make their image accordingly which makes things complex. The problems and issues we have in the society in a broader way. You have to be the change to see the change. We can get along with the person we think we couldnt by interacting and learning about them. The life in itself over the two months. How we grow when we spend time with virtuos people. The company we keep polishes us to be better people. Money and throne is nothing compared to love and family.
Be the change.!"
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,10/10,"How brilliant I see it yesterday at cinema. Wonderful and funny . Two different people,but if they stuck together it could be a perfect match. One from another can learn something. Power of the friendship and the best picture, they play so realistic. Highly recommend to see at cinema"
GREEN BOOK,14 June 2019,8/10,"The two male leads were excellent, both really brought the characters to life and both had strong interesting traits. It is often funny but it also brings us examples of man's inhumanity to man. Viggo Mortensens' character had quite an appetite - reminiscent of Joey in friends. I can well relate to folk who enjoy their food."
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2020,10/10,"... I use to judge a film is my expression at the end of it. If it is a BIG, FAT, HAPPY smile, the film was great!
Respect to everyone involved in the making of this film.
Thank you!"
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,10/10,"Based on a true story of a piano virtuoso's concert tour of the deep south in the 60' America, Green Book presents an inspiring story of individuals who manage to soar above the racial tension and ugliness of the time. It has great cinematography, amazing performances by the two leads, especially Viggo Mortensen, a rocking 50's and early 60's soundtrack and a griping story making it a must watch of 2018."
GREEN BOOK,5 June 2019,10/10,"Simply love the interacting between Tony and Shirley. Don't feel bored throughout the scene, interesting dialogue that make u smile.
Its happened at a time where it show unfair treatment to coloured group at US. Its a simple story but consist of humanity, anger, jokes and love at the same time."
GREEN BOOK,29 May 2019,10/10,"I have had this movie for sometime and I had felt reluctant to watch it seeing that it was just gonna be all talk and little drama or action. But I decided to watch it and ooooh my goodness, best thing that ever happened to cinema. Green Book is an amazing movie. The script was so well done, I don't know if it's because it takes most of it's scenes from a true story or cause the writers knew what they were about. Both actors, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen did exceptionally well. And I have to give it up for Viggo. I haven't really seen him do any mega project since the Lord of the Rings, so watching him play this Italian ruffian was a delight and an eye opener. The entire movie was well done. The directing impeccable. I loved the pace, the cinematography, the highs and lows and man, there couldn't have been a better ending to this great friendship. It surely deserves all the awards it decieved thus far. Great job to the team."
GREEN BOOK,30 April 2020,8/10,The most impressive segment is the scene where their car broke down on the southern country road and they looked at the black slaves working in the field. There was no sound but there was a loud noise.
GREEN BOOK,14 June 2021,10/10,"This movie has so much to teach about music, history, family, race, love, hate...The chemistry between Ali and Mortesen is real and the juxtaposition of there's characters is sharp... poignant.I love everything about it."

0 StarsThis film is really good, and grabs your attention in places you thought it might not quickly. The story is beautiful, but at points I wish there was a little more clarity. I love the Italian vibe throughout and no matter how you put it, Italians can always make something funny. Even though Doc seems very well read and literate, he still almost seems dumb and oblivious, I just wish he has a tiny bit more street smarts/common sense. Great movie over all!"
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2019,9/10,"Based on a true story, this film was emotional and heartfelt. It made you feel happy and yet sad, it made you laugh one moment and hold back tears in the next. This film was beautifully made and it really makes you think about racism and how awful things were for black people back in the day. It almost makes you feel ashamed as a white person, but then you look at the two protagonists and see that actually even in those days it was possible for true friendships to be had between white and black people. It is a brilliant film and you'd be stupid to miss it."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,6/10,"If you don't care about history and you like superficial characters, there is a very good story here. The ending is lovely. The bond that is built between these two men is very well executed.However, I'm not fond of revisionist history. Mahershala Ali was too arrogant and not realistic. I MUCH prefer the real Donald Shirley. Why ""Hollywoodise"" him? By contrast, Mortenson was far more believable as Tony Lip.The problem for me is that if we keep on lying about the past, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes. You can still make an interesting story without putting Mr Shirley on a pedestal. It made me laugh when the movie preached about being polite and not being able to look past skin colour. That scene summed up Hollywood perfectly. This was the ""Oscar"" token movie of 2018.This movie is far better than the Thurgood Marshall movie recently released, however, that's a very low bar to set.Is this worth watching? If you don't mind unrealistic characters, then this is your movie. It's got a good message and some good heart. It's just not realistic."
GREEN BOOK,23 July 2019,10/10,"This Emotional and very enjoyable journey you are taken on, between the relationship of an Italian American and African American at the time of harsh segregation In the deep south. Played impeccably by Marheshala ali as the eccentric pianist extraordinaire(don Shirley) and Vigo morgentson as his Italian big hearted driver(tony lip)whilst watching thier relationship become a thing of magic from the rough to the heartwamring and too add it's based in a true story..A solid 10/10 and the best film I've seen in many years."
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2019,9/10,"To my conservative friends: be open-minded like Tony Lip and you'll live a happier life. Stay open to change i.e. be progressive for your own good. Times they are a changin.Imagine your great-grandad who was born in 1870 has traveled through time to lets say today's New York. I'm sure if he was a conservative that he would not be able to take in all the advancement we made in our lives (e.g. less religion, legal drugs, open relationships, woman's rights, reproductive rights, same sex marriage, etc...). However if he was an open-minded progressive, he would love it and adapt very well!"
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2020,9/10,"This is a fantastic movie. Mahershala Ali, and Viggo Mortenson are perfectly cast, as the rather aloof pianist Dr Don Shirley, and the street wise Tony Lipp. Two characters from vastly different backgrounds, and divided in an age where skin colour and sexual orientation were far more taboo than today.As Dr Shirley goes on a tour performing in the deep south with Tony driving him, they both develop an appreciation for each other's worlds, eventually becoming friends with their worlds becoming one. The story is all the more remarkable because it is a true story, essentially showing that its not skin colour or social background that defines us, but how display our own integrity.The costume and set design is fantastic, with wonderful music too. The direction and cinematography was incredible, without being too over the top, just subtly brilliant at all times. The dialogue is sharp, and has a perfect amount of humour thrown in.All in all, well worth watching!!"
GREEN BOOK,21 March 2019,5/10,"Just like how Crash (not Cronenberg's version) poignantly and blithely reminded us that being a racist can have unforeseen negative consequences with respect to our ever-intertwining lives, theoretically more so now that globalism is at a fever pace, so, too, does Green Book help us understand that despite our different backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and indeed even skin color, life is not fair and if we can change just one person's attitude, then also behavior, by ingesting two-hour flicks, it's almost certainly a win-win situation.Viggo Mortensen eventually slides into his role as rough-tough-with-a-heart-of-gold, who inexplicably frowns down on olive pimento cheese sandwiches after eating a bucket of fried chicken, but let's not try to poke holes in the plot because it solves racism, homophobia, and class struggle by the finish, like a neatly wrapped Christmas gift, waiting for us to open it with gratitude and majesty.Mahershala Ali does his best to not invoke imagery of Miss Daisy, but I think we all know how that turned out (he won an Oscar for not invoking imagery of Miss Daisy (or Arthur, for what it's worth)). Yet in retrospect, one cannot help but imagine Sylvester Stallone in Mortensen's place, or even Ralph Macchio, neither of whom would have had to affect themselves with a New York Italian accent."
GREEN BOOK,20 June 2019,10/10,"This movie is pretty fantastic. I was surprised by the amount of humor in it, I was expecting more of a serious drama considering the subject matter, but boy, am I glad that they went with this route. Both of the main performances are fantastic, I especially think Viggo Mortensen was truly amazing in this movie and to take this part at this stage in his career, I think is amazing. I really got to the point where I forgot that I was watching Viggo Mortensen, because he's so good in the role that he completely becomes this working class italian bouncer, he's really really outstanding here. The movie has a great message, of course, but it's not like hitting you over the head with it, I think it comes pretty natural. The only downside I see here is that it's kind of predictable what's gonna happen from the start, you know these two are gonna end up getting along, no matter what. But I don't think that takes away too much from the film, because I had a blast with it and was not expecting to laugh so many times out loud, the writing is hilarious in this film."
GREEN BOOK,10 September 2021,8/10,"This film was a fun watch. To see some of the issues surrounding rasicm that plagued our world's past really was gut wrenching. The plethora of emotions I felt dealing with the great injustice in our world. But in that backdrop, the beautiful friendship formed became even more significant, making every moment ever so precious."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,10/10,"The movie Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly (director of 2 of my favorite fun movies there's something about Mary & Dumb and Dumber) is excellent. Writer Nick Vallelonga wrote about his father Tony Lip acted by Virgo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic , Perfect Murder, History of Violence) and his African American pianist boss Dr Donald Shirley , acted by Mahershala Ali (from Moonlight). When Tony's wife Dolores acted by Linda Cardellini (a simple favor, Mad men) is told by Tony that his job offer is from a colored man, Dolores reacts very well in a manner only a wife who understands and knows her husband well does. Dolores enjoys all love letters written by Tony while he is away driving Doc from one southern state to another to keep up with concert schedule. The screenplay is terrific. Excellent acting. Love and respect among all characters is very touching. Tony and Doc , both very true to their basic nature, are awe inspiring. Great story. Excellent Direction. Superb editing. Definitely Oscar worthy. Virgo Mortensen is perfect . Linda Cardellini is great in supporting role. Great movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 April 2020,9/10,"Racism, homosexuality, two sensitive topics, through the small object of the Green Paper, can already imagine the hardships of the discriminated people, and then see those who think they are above, the film has been more than half successful. The funny footage of the doctor and the driver getting along with each other makes the movie less depressing. The whole feeling is that it wants you to feel the silence into your perception, but not so depressed. A warm film full of conflicts, but the rhythm of the whole film is just right. One black and one white, elegant and vulgar, two people who are incompatible with each other from opposition to mutual support, complete self-salvation. The world is cruel, but the first step is no longer to face with loneliness, you will find that the scenery along the way is really beautiful."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2020,9/10,"Tony and Don give each other courage and redeem each other. The soundtrack editing and tempo of the movie are so great that even if the second half seems to be banal and impractical, it cannot cover the laughter and tears in the story. The film is really brilliant in the actor's modeling and details, both in script writing and in the performance of the actors. In contrast, Tang is slightly weaker, perhaps because his emotions are dark lines, or it may be that he is too closely connected with politics."
GREEN BOOK,21 December 2019,10/10,"Can't say anything other than, ""must-see."" But, I will. If you want to compare and come to some conclusion that some things have changed in the last 50 years regarding race relations, there are some parts of this story will help you with this issue."
GREEN BOOK,6 July 2019,8/10,"Really enjoyed this film. Unfortunately it portrays everyone in the south as mouth-breathing racists and most people in the north as accepting and willing to grow, which is a lie but that is okay. I am from Chicago. I guarantee that I experienced racism in my city. However, I did experience racism more overtly in the deep south to the point of a coward spitting tobacco on my car when I was in a store. I was in the military at the time protecting this country, which speaks volumes.In my view, this film also fails to portray how the average African American would have likely viewed the lead with more disdain as an ""Uncle Tom."" They touch on this aspect very briefly during a scene involving a game of horseshoes. Other than that it appears that he is embraced and admired by other African Americans versus shunned for his mannerism and success. That said, no film will ever satisfy everyone 100 percent. Overall, I give the writers, actors, and directors a huge ""thumbs up"" for this film. Bravo! However, considering the character of the driver and his associates, I sometimes wonder if Italians get tired of seeing themselves portrayed as mobsters and hustlers.I applaud this film. It is a fresh, must needed reminder of reality. Too many people today seem to think this centuries old issue doesn't impact our lives anymore.I personally hold no grudge against anyone simply because of their ethnicity. I don't care what ""color"" you are. If your heart is in the right place that is all that matters. Although there are still many cowardly racists in this country, there are far more people of all ethnicities who oppose their ignorance.This film struck a good balance in broaching a very serious and emotional issue without being divisive. It shows the growth of some of the characters along the way.Last thought. This film included a scene for the sake of pushing a lifestyle agenda that I could have done without. I am simply tired of Hollywood injecting their personal views in virtually every film today. Even so-called news networks are nothing more than political propaganda machines. It would be nice if the industry would keep their personal viewpoints out of their business just like I do when I go to work each day."
GREEN BOOK,7 July 2019,,"This movie probably could have been made more interesting, but it does have a few interesting ideas.Firstly, it shows that in life you can endure a lot if you have people that you can trust and rely on.
Also, it shows an interesting idealistic secondary character (black guy), who also works hard to make the best impression of the people he represents and is prepared to endure a lot because of that.
Another thought that I have is how lonely the black guy was. Not great, not terrible, but it seems you can endure being quite lonely for a long time, even though he wasn't feeling great.This movie does have quite a few emotional moments and it was good.I was happy to see that Aragorn actor made another famous movie after so many years."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,9/10,"I gave this movie brilliance 10! Why? Go and see. That is all I can say.Oh, and yes! THANK GOD society managed to get out of that idiocracy that segregation was. Shake a hand of an honest man, eat, drink and laug with an honest man, for there is no color less or more, all there is to a man, it is in his soul!"
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,10/10,This movie is gem.first of all great acting by two leads and a well story. Was impressed by Peter Farrelly serious direction on this.it deals with lots of stuffs from 60s in Deep South don't have any more goods words .this movies was just perfect
GREEN BOOK,4 November 2019,2/10,Who try to present americans in a negative light. Seems like Hollywood is full of Russian agents. Many anti-american movies.
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2020,10/10,"The script is solid, the details are abundant, and the performance is in place. It has the meaning of ""Driving for Miss Daisy"" and ""Unreachable"", but because of the interchange of the protagonist roles, it exudes stronger fun in specific times and regions."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,9/10,"Very, very well done movie. I subtracted a star for the YMCA scene which I have no idea why someone thought they needed to include it. It didn't fit and there was no lead-up or follow-up. All it did was nosedive the pace. Luckily, the movie recovered. Go see it, I'll guarantee you like it or I'll refund your money."
GREEN BOOK,9 February 2020,8/10,"Great acting, great script with important social commentary. What else can you ask for in an Oscar winning film? Oh yeah it's never dull and quite funny at times. Great film."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2021,9/10,"This moving story through the 60's is so lighthearted and makes you feel good. The acting is great, the writing is great and even the comedy is great! It tells a story of two completely opposite people that teach each other important life lessons, one dose t fit in and the other does too well. Every conversation in the movie is filled with storytelling and is just important as the next line, you never get bored even when they are simply driving around in a car. The two characters develop instantly as they meet and it is a amazing to watch them travel America and tackle their problems together. The most unlikely of friends create a beautiful movie.9/10"
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,6/10,"There's some enjoyment to be had while watching 'Green Book', but everything from the story to the cinematography feels very early 2000s, and it's ultimately quite shallow in its messages. It focuses more on the core friendship than anything else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Mortensen and Ali have great chemistry which really gives the film its entertainment value. Unfortunately, though, it takes a long while for the main conceit to really get going and this first portion of the flick is almost devoid of any real entertainment value. Luckily though, once things get on the road it becomes a fairly entertaining time and moves along briskly - although the skit-based comedy that makes up for most it (which, again, feels outdated in a picture like this) becomes quite tiresome. Overall, it's sufficiently entertaining throughout - thanks largely to Mortensen and Ali - and moves briskly enough. It's let down by its outdated filmmaking and narrative conceit, though, and by its lack of depth, too. 6/10"
GREEN BOOK,22 July 2020,5/10,"A movie about racism and prejudice that Centers a white perspective in every instance. It's a feel good story with little substance. Sometimes it is absolutely cringe worthy if you know anything about Shirley. I suspect people like it because it reinforces the notions they have about racism already, rather than challenging them."
GREEN BOOK,11 November 2019,7/10,"Story of a black musician and a white bodyguard, ""Green book"", through the archaic system of trip and adventures during it, is based on the opposition between this two characters that discover to like each other beyond the differences of status and skin that society stresses. The particularitg is in the fact that the white man is of asocial condition less higher than the black man's one, that's instead a rich and famous pianist. This strange condition, for 60s racist USA, brings the protagonist to a tragedy of not being part of a defined group: he is richer than other black men but always different, for the skin, from ""real"" white people; so his dramatic situation is to be outside of all of categories. Through ironical and light expedients, the movie condemns racism but also understand complexity of psychological lifes behind conventional social divisions, and, even if for wasn't the best movie of that year to win the Oscar, it is appreciable and original."
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2021,9/10,"This is what I call the heartwarming story. Being real also affects. Flow, editing, director, acting, I found them all successful. The snowy parts were very nice. Seeing the ignorance in the movie overwhelmed me. Doesn't it look like American History X?"
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2018,8/10,"Green Book has two main and real characters. Movie successfully tells us characters' nature and evolution process. This couple has a great chemistry. Green Book promises you a friendship story, a journey film, 60s country mood, a musical, an intense main idea on racism, a backplan story about differences of a rich and a poor man, sincere and laughing dialogues, some sequences which is gonna make you smile and make you upset... Those are positive parts about movie. Of course I have something bad to say about it, even though it is short. Story repeats itself few times. We see similar sequences in a short while. Also I would prefer watch more about Dr. Don Shirley's family and his brother. That storyline mires down."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2020,10/10,This is one we all need to watch. I enjoyed every minute and was even moved a few times. The last 30 minutes of the movie are absolutely stupendous and I just loved the way the movie ended.
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,"""Green Book"" is a movie that tells viewers about the friendship of pianist Don Shirley, and his Italian-American driver. Ali and Viggo Mortensen have given outstanding, memorable performances in their respective roles.The direction is excellent. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it teaches viewers a lot of good lessons without preaching. The director uses natural moments and incidents to convey the themes that this movie wants to present to its viewers."
GREEN BOOK,2 June 2019,9/10,"A male bodyguard is hired to tour a black pianist through the United States during one of its most exclusive and darkest times. With this basic idea begins the movie, developing in an excellent way as time goes by.The emotion provoked by this film is simply pure and gratifying; every second is taken advantage of by the excellent script and the fantastic performances of the two protagonists, having an incredible chemistry on the screen and representing a quite full and real friendly relationship. Based on a real story, manages to complement the realistic aspects of the story and in turn add the theatrical touch that makes it extremely enjoyable and emotional, with strong messages on different aspects and a development of characters quite clear, this added to the excellent relationship between the two actors gives us a trip quite emotional between two people who despite their great differences, come together under the most important similarities.Definitely deserves all its awards, each part is memorable and has an excellent direction that makes us understand and understand each character, a journey through a hard time but with strong characters that regardless of the danger go ahead.Excellent in a few words, it shows us a journey through a dark and ignorant United States, during an era in which inequality prevailed, this is the story of those small characters who gave their big grains of sand to change that aspect towards a more positive one, leaving us with a beautiful idea of hope and change at the end of the film."
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2020,8/10,"That was very nice movie, full of great dialogs about music, about love & about life. I love the whole story and the of curse nice performance by two main characters and by the way you should give credit to the director too.
one of the many great dialogs of the movie is ""you never win with violence, tony. you only win when you maintain your dignity, dignity always prevails""."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,I have to say this is the best movie I have seen in a very long time Great performances from the two lead actors.
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,8/10,"Slow burning drama about friendship , true story too i would recommend this film ....! 7.5/10"
GREEN BOOK,11 July 2021,9/10,"An instant Classic with Top Notch performance from Mortensen and Ali superbly directed with the Music ever present, the contrasting forces during segregation in the 50's.I'm officially a Fried Chicken Lover since watching this Film...
A Must-See!"
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2019,9/10,"Green Book tells the story of a trip where an Italian-American nightclub ""bouncer"" (Viggo Mortensen) ends up driving a prestigious, and importantly black, piano player (Mahershala Ali) around the US in the mid 1960s, namely through several shows in the deep US south still very much socially dividedIf this movie was only about segregation in the South, it probably would not add as much given how frequently this topic has been depicted in moviesBut thankfully it is much more than thatIt is about feeling accepted by your keen, it is about how success can be lonely and also about embracing the best of people who are different from you.And it does this brilliantly by showing a constant debate between these two man and the different setbacks and distinct perspectives with which them face them.As added bonus, the soundtrack is great and not by one second do you doubt the actor is playing those piano keys, even if they are actually supplied by the movie's soundtrack coordinator.Viggo Mortensen's performance is absolutely sublime, especially if it is not your first time watching one of his movies, and a real candidate for the Best Actor. Of course Mahershala Ali does not disappoint either, but I see some traits there from his role in House of CardsIn any case a great movie with an engaging plot, heat-warming and still very emotionally charged and with lots to be shocked about in regards to a black man's statue in the 1960s (which continues to be absolutely mindboggling when you realize this was 50+ years ago only)."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,5/10,"""He's sick. He got poison in his system,"" the black man explains to his Machiavellian host, as being the reason for the white man's anemic condition. Cullen(Sidney Poitier) and ""Joker""(Tony Curtis), once warring fugitives on the run, to both men's surprise, are still chained to each other, even after the woman, an unconditional racist(Cara Williams), unshackles their wrists. It matters to both of them, if the other one lives or dies. John's concern for Cullen is beyond the woman's comprehension.""What did I do wrong? the single mother asks, when John finds out that the directions she gave Cullen is a death trap. Nothing but bogs and quicksand; nothing to be concerned about, because a black man is nothing. ""Why do you get so excited about that 'Negro' for?"" she screams. It's the late-fifties. The incident involving those three civil rights workers who went missing in Neshoba County was still a little ways off. For now, it's Mississippi simmering. But what was the audience thinking; these average everyday people from an era who internalized institutional racism like breathing? This mutual respect, this male bonding of disparates, welded together by altruistic materials, to a large degree, must have estranged them. Even to the most progressive-minded moviegoer, down deep inside, there existed a latent feeling of repulsion, a self-awareness they would never own up to having. These proto-liberals may have loved jazz, Jackie Robinson, and the idea of civil rights, but when put to the test, in life, or being a voyeur in the dark observing an imitation of life, they recoiled at the idea of a white man choosing friendship(WITH A ""NEGRO""!) over romance(WITH A WOMAN!). Before the sea change in 1964, the year that gave black people the right to vote, the spectacle of a black man in a white woman's house, chained, and then, shockingly unchained, was new to film language. The grandparents sitting in these movie palaces, lest not we forget, saw D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" as small children. They remember Gus pursuing Flora on the mountain. Gus was up to no good; he had only one thing on his mind. It was rhetoric. It was propaganda. It worked. They remember Flora jumping off the mountain. They blamed Gus for the suicide. Cullen, in their estimation, should sleep outside, not on the couch. But they know, however, that mother and son have no choice; they don't begrudge the woman's need to compromise. The small family is counting on ""Joker"" to get them out of this one-horse town. The boy's mother listens to Cullen. John needs a bed. It must be something he ate. Their last meal, frog, roasted over an open fire, is the likely culprit for his indisposed condition. Made in 1958, Stanley Kramer's ""The Defiant Ones"" should be one for the time capsule. But, alas, ""time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', into the future.""The white chauffeur just bought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He presumes that all black folks love the sizzling and popping sounds a broiler makes in an oil vat. On a nondescript Kentucky two-lane road, in ""Green Book"", Tony Vallelonga(Viggo Mortensen) passes a drumstick over the car seat headrest to his employer, the classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali). He practically waves the drumstick in Don's face. Stop. Rewind. Mull over this for a second. Who is the boss here: the Copacabana ball-busting bouncer with the hair-trigger temper, or the refined musician adored by the cognoscenti who live in the rarefied world of ""haute couture"" circles. Tony should ask first. After all, the two just met. It wasn't so long ago that the Italian-American working stiff, a husband and father of small boys, removed two empty glasses from their kitchen sink because the lips of black men, plumbers who fixed their leaky pipes, drank his wife's freshly squeezed lemonade. He places them gently in the rubbish can. This illiberal action is the predictable repercussions from living in an insular world. Tony's extended family, under the pretense of watching a baseball game, keeps a watchful eye over Dolores(Linda Cardellini) and her unwanted guests. The audience can infer that if Tony was the person of the house, the help would have found themselves drinking from a water hose. Tony, at this juncture, is an honest-to-goodness, unrepentant bigot. But ""Green Book"" treats his antipathetic views toward the ""other"" with a light touch. Played for laughs, Tony refuses to put Don's luggage into the trunk. There is a standoff between this Italian chauffeur and an Indian manservant. Finally, Amit(Iqbal Theba), flabbergasted at such hubris, in a gracious display of humility, relents and does the job. Ha-ha, right? Later, on wheels, Tony needs a roadside bathroom break, somewhere, in woods. The hired man leaves, but then on second thought, returns and grabs his wallet off the dashboard. Don should be outraged and offended, and yet, he gives his driver a bewildered look, when a look of anger and resentment would have been the right emotional visage.Somewhere along that long drive through the deeply segregated south, ""Green Book"" needed a scene in which Tony opens up about his issues with people of color, a man-to-man talk. The bouncer and the musician, of course, would become lifelong pals, but the film portrays the bond as a foregone conclusion, and skips the growing pains that led up to their mutual respect for each other. ""I've never had fried chicken in my life,"" Don says with dignity barely intact. He should be aghast now, not later on at the plantation house, by this racially-charged slight, but because ""Green Book"" is calibrated to be a feel-good movie, the pianist reacts in a genteel manner, which would seem at odds with an employer being taunted by his paid employee, a subordinate. The car should be ordered to stop, but the car keeps moving, because the filmmaker keeps moving without breaks, without looking at the rear-view mirror. When Don asks for ""plates and utensils"", then complains about how this tactile approach to eating fried chicken will sully his hands and stain the blanket on his lap with grease, the musician's persnickety mannerisms has the accidental effect of being an alternative minstrel show. Don Shirley dons whiteface. Later, the ugly stereotype gets reintroduced, in which the honored guest at a formal dinner, is served the aforementioned bird by his host, a patron of the arts. Needless to say, the music lovers who join Don at the fancy table, coos in approval. Finally, here is racism, without the kid gloves, without training wheels.But it's too little, too late. The intended shock that we're supposed to feel never registers in full. The horror of the moment has been destigmatized, because such categorical pigeonholing that dictates the preferences and abhorrences of lower men as deemed by the gatekeepers, played as comedy the first time around. When all the brown flesh is torn away from the drumstick, Don asks, ""What do we do about the bones?"" The presumptuous chauffeur takes his skeleton breast and flings it out the car window. The piano virtuoso does so, likewise. He can learn so much from Tony.""BlacKkKlansman"" ends with an epilogue, a blowtorch of a coda that sets fire to the William Shakespeare quote: ""What's past is prologue."" Unlike ""Green Book"", Spike Lee knows the story of love and hate isn't over. It's the story of Kermit and Pepe. Two sides, watching ""The Defiant Ones"" for the first time, sees the frog that best suits their ideology. Will one side notice that John is the one that gets sick? ""Green Book"" means well. It's not a bad film; it's just the wrong film for our times.The road trip isn't over."
GREEN BOOK,25 May 2019,8/10,"I liked Green Book a lot, it is clearly well made and I had a good time watching it. But I felt I've watched this before because it has far too many similarities with ""The Untouchables"", a French film from 2011 that I loved. It is simply the same story but in a different context: two men from opposites worlds that meet each other because of working motivations, that become friends enriching themselves and growing through the film. Also the alternation between the humor and some touching moment is very similar between the two movies. The fact that ""The Untouchables"" was so surprising and great at the time is a clue that even this ""younger cousin"" will be that for the ones who will watch it for the first time. But if you watched both you will probably feel like ""I've already seen it"" at the end of it."
GREEN BOOK,4 January 2019,6/10,"I mean, I could watch Viggo Mortensen for a day without getting bored but something was missing in this film. Viggo plays Tony an Italian American bouncer who goes on to work for an acclaimed singer who is African American. Initially he shows prejudice towards them but as he accepts to be the driver of Maharshala Ali (Don Shirley) he understands the evil of Jim Crow in the southern states. While the plot may be generic and Oscar bait, the performances makes it worthy enough for a watch. Viggo Mortensen nails the Italian American accent perfectly and continues to be the most consistent performer out there. While this film doesn't offer something you haven't seen and relies on cliche, it ends up being heart warming enough to impress us."
GREEN BOOK,5 July 2019,10/10,"Finally choosing to watch this film, I expected the typical race-baiting Hollywood genre. It is not. It is a story of an exceptional talent and a metamorphosis in attitude of the character portrayed by Viggio Mortenson.
Very well done and well worth the time to watch. I feel emotionally enriched from having viewed it."
GREEN BOOK,14 November 2020,9/10,"Enough has been said about this movie I guess.See it, when you have the chance, it is truly perfect.Nowadays, people might learn from this one."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"Surprise Viggo Mortensen greatly reprise his role great acting since Aragorn slightly change his peer of Italian Tony and Moonlight Mahershali Ali win Oscar twice. Ok though at the end show credits without cast which buzzed me off. Story is pretty predictable and great acting. It is very story and showing more racism and white in Deep South. To be fair, this film won Best Picture upset and frustrated many fans believe Black Panther and Roma should have won. The records of Academy get Worst Best Picture. It casually win since Driving Miss Daisy. The point of society may treat not right and life cruelty. The friendship develop fire forge understanding bigotry of white and black in 1960s. The problem is racial slur N word upset African viewers which Viggo role of Tony Noble bigotry use but Mortensen doesn't want or like say because he wary of word. I understand he doesn't so did Ali had to accept the Best Picture due to Era of Trump. Movie bug viewer which show life unfair to Don. Director wrote the script that is not good quality dialogues to read. Great racism Deep South but still upset many critics love Roma and Star is Born and Black Panther. Casts have to accept the award without any chance or choice."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,10/10,"I absolutely loved ""Green Book"". Both main actors' performances were brilliant and truly captured the magic of this real life friendship. With all the negativity going on in the world, this is a nice feel good film to watch and remember that not everyone is so bad. The movie is not preachy at all, important messages are delivered in a simple yet powerful way. It has a lot of funny moments too which is always good. This one was definitely one of my favorites from 2018 and I highly recommend it !"
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2019,9/10,"Can I begin to imagine how unlikely this buddy, growth, friendship, road trip and most remarkable of personal journeys could have occurred at a time in 60's America? It seems imposseebull ... but that it actually happened is wondrous and magical. It doesn't hurt that the two lead actors are impressively good. Hope and beauty on every curve."
GREEN BOOK,5 April 2019,8/10,I really have nothing but praise for the Green Book.The acting is top notch. Mortenson and Ali nailed all the nuances of their characters. The development of their friendship is at the heart of this movie and without their efforts this movie couldn't be this great.The transitions of scenes are also perfect. Every scene moves the plot forward and feels genuine. Keeping momentum is very difficult. I think why it worked is that they kept the storytelling simple but not too simple to the point of boredom. And also not too ambitious to the point you'll lose interest because it gets convoluted.The scenery was beautiful. The 1960s is visually stunning to see and also compounded to the surreal feel when underneath that beauty lies the ugliness of racism.To me it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,9/10,"This movie takes us on a ride as we explore two decent, fractured people explore their own humanity through the other's eyes. Such character driven films need strong actors to carry it . Both men worked so well opposite each other. Very moving film. Hopefully, Oscar noms for writing, directing, acting. One of the best of 2018"
GREEN BOOK,21 November 2018,10/10,Based on the trailer I thought this movie might be an annoying preachy movie. I'm happy to say it wasn't. It was a film of a great friendship in which both characters in the friendship are flawed in their own ways and both make each other better. And serve a valuable purpose for one another.The film has great humor for both of the leads. It also has moments of great poignance. The pacing seemed fine. The story gives the viewer a few surprises. It has moments of poignance. The acting is stellar. The script is well written. It is well shot. Nothing seems to be trying to reinvent the wheel. And the films seems to serve to remind the viewer that a film doesn't need to do anything like that in order to be great. I highly recommend it. I wouldn't mind seeing it again soon myself. It's one of the better movies I've seen this year. And probably was made for about 5 million dollars. It's a reminder that you don't have to break the bank in order to make something great.
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,10/10,"I honestly don't understand why so many critics don't like this film as much as the audience. Green Book has a great artistic story, a good script, great acting, it has some great humor, some great drama and poigniance. It's well directed. It has both characters learn from one another and need one another despite often not being able to stand one another. It doesn't show such developments in a preachy kind of way. It doesn't seem to present any silly inconceivable blunders. I felt it was well worth spending 2 hours watching in a theater, and I found it one of the best films I've seen this year. If not the very best.The rest of my review is for the purpose of responding to stupid reviews of people who find a way to hate this movie because of what it isn't as opposed to what it is.Does Green Book have everything perfectly documented about life as a black person in Ali's character, or life as a white person for Mortenseon's character? No. Does it perfectly encapsulate every person's time and experience traveling and living in the south or the north of America at that time and in those places? No. Does it property portray all friendships of white and black people? No. Does the film perfectly show how the police treat people in every instance in the north and in the south? No. Does it feature sad people living their sad lives and learning nothing to effectively encapsulate how terrible and hopelessly serious some issues can be? No. Does the movie strike me as having a groundbreaking quality that puts it as the first or definitively best at doing whatever new ambitious thing it's trying to do? NoFrom my standpoint, these kinds of shortcoming could be said about every single good movie. Even if a movie is groundbreaking, it isn't an excellent film because it was groundbreaking or record shattering. Green Book's purpose is to show the experience of two specific characters along with their friends and family as the main two characters get to know each other. The story as it is told is believable, entertaining, interesting and likeable. And that is exactly what it was trying to be and, in my opinion, that angel serves the film very well. I don't know how perfectly the film was at showing exactly what really happened. But If anyone expects to be able to take a film based on true events as the perfect infallible account, they are the with the issue as opposed to the film.As for what the film didn't cover: If you want all the facts or potential ramifications or heartbreaks of other people in this time going about their lives, you're better off reading some books, looking up some facts, or watching some documentaries about the topics. Nothing can tell every avenue of every conceivable story with perfect detail and accuracy. And a 2 hour movie is far from the ideal way of even try such a task.Movies like Green Book are meant to exist as entertaining peices of art. And that is exactly what I thought Green Book was, and what made it good. I highly recommend this film is that's the sort of thing you like."
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,1/10,"This is one of the blandest and most simplistic depictions of racism I've ever seen in a movie since 2006's trash film Crash.The only part of this movie that passes as okay is some of the acting. But even then I never bought Viggo Mortensen or Mashallah Ali's characters. They tried with what they had, but they had poor direction.There's a distinct lack of grit and cursing in this film about traveling through the south with a black man and that really bugged me.Also for some reason this film is shot like a comedy while tackling a very serious subject, it's a very odd clash... oh my god the worst thing about this movie (besides the simplified story/cartoonishly simplistic view of racism) is the ""comedy"". I never laughed once at any of the jokes, but I did laugh at Viggo's hilariously stereotypical Italian accent, It's like watching Mario audition for Glory.Also the musical score.for the film is pretty bad and bland, it's mostly violin music played to ""enhance emotion"" moments. It all feels so manipulative.Anyhoo, I feel old white people will like this movie, but younger audiences will see through this phoney film and be mostly bored."
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2020,10/10,Excellent movie - showing the life black people had (and have). When you are a genius black your own people dislike you ..
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2020,10/10,I watched it today what I can say it's amazing made me to feel mixed emotions laughed sometimes and get sad sometimes and this movie was the best movie ever made for showing rasim actions in United States.
GREEN BOOK,21 May 2021,8/10,"Technical-wise, this film wasn't very outstanding. But it stands out because of the characters. The portrayal of roles and the plot added a lot of texture, and the use of music was intelligently used to put sense of adventure and conflict to the story."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,"First of all, the acting in this done by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen was amazing. Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn't afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it's dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don't feel it. Really even though I don't say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would've cut but not that many. In the end, this is a film that I think everybody should check out at least once. Whether just to learn about this interesting story about two friends who defied the odds or just a movie to watch."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2021,9/10,"Look. I'm no bleeding heart liberal. I'm a WASP who feels sometimes things today can trend over the top. But when I reflect on what blacks had to go through on the 50s and 60s (and prior), it tears me up. Brian's Song is one of my few 10-rated movies, and Green Book came very very close.This is a guy's movie for sensitive guys. lt ripped my eyeballs to shreds. I didn't start crying until about 15 minutes in and I never stopped. Great true story, great performances, extremely touching."
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2020,8/10,"A common racial problem movie, often tells the struggle of the bottom black people. In ""Green Book"", this kind of problem is shown as the self-knowledge and pursuit of people."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2020,9/10,"Two men of vastly different skin color, class, personality and sexual orientation, who met through music and became lifelong friends through road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough, but also need to be brave, tear down the wall in the heart to come to the point. The movie is like a green pebble, throwing itself into American society and creating a light and beautiful ripple. Although there is a deliberate sense of warmth, but I am willing to pay the bill ~!"
GREEN BOOK,27 December 2020,8/10,"I shortlisted this film, after a tip from a good friend of mine, who said
"" You Need To See It ""A quick glimpse at some User Reviews made up my mind and so I decided to set up my evening around it.Excellent in so many ways."
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,8/10,"The movie is really fantastic with Viggo and Mahershala giving a very simple excellent performance with me loving Viggo more. The story is superb along with the screenplay of the characters which was very terrific with some awesome quotes that can go on forever.
The best thing I like about the story that it didn't have to be R rated to show racism and give us much violence to describe it. It only showed this with absolutely no loud voice or profanity or anything more than
looks and very simple situation, for me the whole movie is excellent in it's impossible simple way of telling the story with the simple performances that lacked the presence of better music that would have made the scenes a lot more better. Also the whole Green Book matter in the film wasn't clear for me even when it was opened and couldn't understand it's presence that much more than that it's because it's the movie's title!. Also hopped that it didn't get to the sexuality and that kinda stuff which sometimes is not necessary in the movies especially this one and only to attract some audiences which I am totally against. Viggo's character will be me favorite for a long while and for me he was even better than Rami's performance at Bohemian Rhapsody. Mahershala deserve the Oscar that he will win for that strong expressions and emotions although he and Viggo had some entertaining master acting scenes comedy and drama.
In the end, one of all time favorite films and don't miss a chance to see that film 8.5/10"

GREEN BOOK,19 April 2019,10/10,"So nice to see a movie nowadays that does not feature special effects, car crashes, the F word, no blood, guts and sexual scenes and with decent people for the most part. A real ""feel good"" type of movie you rarely see. Just like the old days, the 40's-50's that is. Let's have more films like these and less Marvel and junk like that. Great acting and story line is all that is needed. Need MORE!!!!"
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2019,9/10,"I normally feel that academy award winners are bloated, and sometimes even crappy. But this move was fantastic. This genre of movie is not one I usually enjoy, and honestly was not looking forward to watching it... that is why it took so long. But I loved it, it was thought provoking, and showed all the prejudice without going over the top, shock, or disgust. It was tasteful, entertaining, and heart felt. just a fantastic movie. The acting was out of this world, it was weird seeing Viggo Mortensen so heavy, but wow. :)"
GREEN BOOK,27 November 2018,8/10,"Confession: when the film introduced us to Dr. Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali), I thought that he was disgustingly pretentious and garish. He had exotic furnishings and clothes, and he sat on... a throne. I didn't know if the film was trying to present us to him as a self-actualized and respectable person. Although Viggo Mortensen's Tony character was ignorant, he seemed much more likeable to me than Shirley.I was extremely pleased as the film progressed to confirm to myself that they were willing to expose some of Shirley's pretentious tendencies as character flaws. Although his character arc wasn't as extreme as Tony's arc, this film's director Peter Farrelly and the multiple screenwriters who constructed it did a fine job of illustrating profound growth in each man. One of the saddest and most meaningful moments that I've ever seen in a film is when Tony returned to a massive, loving Italian family, and Shirley returned to his empty, sanitary, lonely apartment. Whereas he was a pariah in the deep south, he was now also a solitary figure in his own home. I'm unashamed to admit that I bawled. So my opinion of him did a complete 180. Mission accomplished, film.If it has flaws, I believe that it made Tony seem a bit too oafish, and he was condescended to by various people a bit too much. I enjoyed the hilarious, ironic
moments when he doesn't even seem to realize what he is saying-- i.e.: when speaking about Robert Kennedy: ""what else does he have to do?"" What else does the Attorney General of the United States do aside from bailing out lesser-known musicians from jail? But I thought that they leaned on it a bit too much. Also, if you're really familiar with film making (a curse, to be sure) some of this material might feel a bit too ""safe"" and paint-by-numbers.However, it's twenty times better than last year's ""Best Picture"" winner (""The Shape of Water"") even the vast majority of last year's Best Picture nominees."
GREEN BOOK,30 November 2018,9/10,"Two of the world's finest actors take on, what on the surface seems straightforword, but eventually becomes complex issues facing men in the early 1960s. One character, a virtuoso pianist of African American descent, is doing his part to dismantle the race barriers which identified much of our society then, and even today, while also managing other facets of his personal identity. Now, place him in a small space (a gorgeous teal 1962 Caddilac Sedan d'Ville) for a long time with an unsophisticated bouncer/brawler/man-of-the-streets from New York, and watch the humanity ooze. The filmaker did not grovel to us, the audience, with simplicity-of-character; each main character brings to light the true complexities of the experiences that each of us endure and manage in this ever complex world, and honored those unique attributes in ways that make you, as the film viewer, feel hnored for the unique and complex person that you are, and I am, and each of us are. It proffered the humbling truth about slipping into ""simple thought"" and geralizing about any individual or group of individuals is a disservice to our own dignity. A nice flip of the name-calling, tolerance of unconstructive behavior toward others, racism, sexism, and other judgements thast are used by the more powerful to subvert the less powerful. Each character demonstrated that whether one is of the most educated and priveledged class, or of the most street-wise and unsophisticated class, personal dignity and respect are mandatory for a successful life...and sometimes valuable perspective and insight comes from the least likely of sources; we need each other."
GREEN BOOK,10 April 2019,8/10,"The Academy Award winning film doesn't do anything extraordinary; only, it takes the usual, ordinary stuff and does it extra beautiful.Despite the catchy synopsis of a black music-virtuoso being driven by a white Italian bouncer, the film in its core is all about ""friendship"".It depicts the real-life story of Dr. Donald Sherley, a celebrated pianist of Afro-American descent who is on a tour to the south of USA back in '60s when aggressive reservations about Black people were still prevalent. As he hires an Italian driver-bouncer named Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga, little did they know that its shall bring their internal-struggles forth - minimally depicted by the selection of hotels in a certain ""Green Book"", where only Black people are allowed to stay in order to avoid ""aggravation"" from the Whites, along with the discriminatory alienation of ones existence by creed, colour, ethnicity.However, that all arrives with an intermittent tenderness - of human bonding over wording out letters to one's wife, eating chicken-wings in a moving car no matter how unsanitary it seems, appreciating inherent talents of playing music or just playing with people, laughing-out loud, and then driving those long distances only in each other's company talking about what-not, and then appreciating how human it is to just be so.I, for once, was left smiling at the thought of just ending up with family and friends around as I had the time of my life enjoying two people covering miles while scaling distances within their heart; not to mention in ours as well.
Safe to say that it's a mark of a good film to make you feel so. So, watch to believe it or just be happy to have read about it, here."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,9/10,Best film of the awards season so far. The central performances by Mortensen and Ali are exquisite and the movie itself is a delight; a bittersweet mix of odd couple comedy and racial drama.
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,"Even I haven't seen it I had my predictions just by watching trailers. However, today after seeing it I can say it is fabulous. Also, the weights of both roles(of Mortensen and Ali) are equal and should measure in the same category. They are great in showing us two men from a different environments, the way of life, education, family, not only different by the color of skin, and who taking by the certain circumstances accepted each other the way they are."
GREEN BOOK,11 August 2020,8/10,"A terrific movie that is both thought provoking & entertaining at the same time. It's a great story well told with characters we grow to love. The acting partnership between Ali & Viggo is so innocently encapsulating, and the directing was spot on"
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2019,6/10,"I'm very disappointed in the critcs this award season, i guess on the one hand, i shouldn't be shocked a true story about a black man and his white bodyguard is making critical waves, but even so, i don't get it. as far as a comedy goes, it was one notch above 'crazy rich asians' (which wasn't funny AT ALL) and this had minor laughs. i don't usually agree with critics but this was getting so many audience raves, i thought i'd like it. from the moment they showed mortenson's character to be racist, i knew where this was going. i also never bought into the 'white savior' trope but this film was a prime example. just an unmemorable film."
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2019,9/10,"A wonderful movie, emotional, funny, not boring, full of intense moments and realistic situations of art, racism, friendship.
Both the protagonists are well interpreted, as it is for the other components of the band and the driver's wife. It's a touching picture of the american society, rich and poor, white and black, through a trip along the south of the United States, to bring music but also courage, revolution, acceptation of the different.
I really liked it, it is definitely a movie that has something to say."

GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,10/10,"Two men from vastly different backgrounds come together as a pianist needs a driver for a tour of the south in the 60's. Constantly at differences and constantly learning from each other - they ended up good friends in real life.
A really good cast portraying complicated people and presenting the south of the 60's ( not belying the fact that some of this remains).
A good film of the story of two men - and not seen in any movies. I really enjoyed it. M. Ali so deserved the Golden Globe award for best supporting actor. Loved the growth of both men."
GREEN BOOK,6 October 2020,8/10,"I loved Green Book and found it educational about race issues and very entertaining! It shocked me to think as late as the 60's there were such backward racial attitudes. But, after googling the facts about the movie, found a lot to be inaccurate which was disappointing! They could have created an accurate story which would have been just as entertaining."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2019,10/10,"Great movies like this one are hard to come by. So it is a gift when they do.

GREEN BOOK,9 April 2019,8/10,"Damn those critics! I had my expectations of this film sullied by the critics who had described Green Book as ""this time the racist is in the front"" - a nod to Driving Miss Daisy. By this I had expectations that Viggo Mortensen's character Tony would be repulsive. This never manifests as barring a scene early on in the family home, he comes across as a wily, streetwise bloke. For the 1960's Tony 'The Lip' is incredibly open minded.The film itself is poorly written, on more than one occasion I exclaimed ""that character would not do that"" or ""this wouldn't happen"". I was also confused as to why the Dr actually wanted to venture into the deep south of America only to suddenly feel a fit of personal aversion on the last.I also strongly feel that the director failed to get true pathos from either lead especially when they demonstrated the had it in them in a couple of scenes: when the car stops next to the field workers and when it stops in the rain.It is a good film but the discerning purveyor of decent cinema will not enjoy the shoehorning in of identity politics to gain American kudos."
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2021,9/10,"Stylish film which portrays the changing, contradictory relationship between an Italian working-class immigrant and an African-American elitist.
The roles are reversed as Tony has a hardened working-class, socially tough outlook on life, even although he is racist. Dr Shirley is cocooned within his privileged, classical musical position although he harbours deeply held principled views as the victim of racial abuse.
The film is set in the sixties and the question is, how different are things now?"
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,8/10,"If you like the John Hughes penned ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and/or similar movies, you'll like Green Book. It's a Holiday buddy movie with a strong social and racial undercurrent. It's held together by a great script by writers Brian Hayes Currie, Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, good direction by Peter Farrelly, and terrific performances from Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen (Linda Cardellini was also really good as, you guessed it, the wife). It's not the least bit saccharine or heavy handed. It's just a really enjoyable, and sometimes funny movie that you'll walk out of the theater feeling great about having seen. And yes, you can totally take the family.And to address the main criticism of Green Book, that it focuses too much attention on Mortensen's character, well, that's unfair. It's a two-hander, a buddy road movie, so both guys get full character arcs and depth. Most importantly, Mahershala Ali's character isn't just a passenger in the story. He's the main protagonist. He has goals, needs, and makes decisions. And race is central to everything.To repeat, Green Book is a lovely film and low-key the best Holiday movie of the year. I highly recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,10 April 2020,7/10,"Four flat and steady film, exquisite routine, all the way can think of the popular plot, basically no big ups and downs, mainly see the actors, Ming know is the routine of repeated trials, you will be moved, perhaps this is one of the great places in Hollywood."
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2019,8/10,"So good, I've seen it twice & will go again & take my grandchild, grandparents & all the family.
A refreshing change to have a film so well made that you can watch with the whole family especially with this adult subject matter. It's old school film making. Deserves awards galore.
Mahershala Ali was in the worst film I've ever seen, to the point it makes my blood boil but he has been forgiven for that with this 8/10"
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,"This has to be the next movie in my library, it just cheered me to no end to see them overcome all the obstacles in such an entertaining way.
Being Italian and watching the family was like being sent back in time to a simpler era where I am sad to admit was also very brutish in social awareness of the south and it's rural roughness. I grew up in Central New Jersey in the 60's and I can tell you for a fact that racism was still practiced that far north. As a child I remember traveling just 20 miles south of where we lived and everyone spoke with a deep southern drawl.
I am glad social awareness is spreading in the right way and Green Book reminded me about my life in the south pre-MTV I call it. Brutish to northerners and people of color.
I believe what I saw, I believed how they acted in the movie was superb and Viggo should have won an Oscar for his performance as well as the ever talented gorgeous Linda Cardellini!
Thank you for a very heartwarming 2 hours which seemed to pass by in mere minutes."
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2019,9/10,"It was supposed to be sad, yet it made me laugh most of the time. Ineffable story, it touched my sensation sometimes, although I knew it's different from the reality.The most unforgettable plot is when the pianist saw the black slave farming laboriously under the heat, Dr. Shirley was well dressed and sat inside the car while his white driver needed to check the car motor. That contrast was so strong; The white driver and the black farmers, they all doing the labor work regardless color. Meanwhile, Dr.Shirley and those farmers are all black, but their status are totally different. This part aroused audiences sensation for purpose. Not in favor, but strong contrast indeed, it's a good trick to leave impressions.The movie also got me down every time when the pianist suffered unequal treatments. A top educated pianist with two honorary doctorates couldn't win him any respect in South. The movie named Green Book, it's a travel guide, only its listed businesses would accept African American customers. Dr.Shirley was refused to many place under the segregation, even a bathroom - to handle a man's basic needs. The host of the house would still turned his request down, the irony is they claimed themselves the most educated and powerful in the area. They appreciated Dr. Shirley's skill, but didn't respect him as an equal person. Dr. Shirley endures all these unequal treatments. He still put out a big smile, act courteous and speak mannerly to his white audiences. This suffer is silent but I seem to hear the heartbreaking from his soul. A silent torture of a man's pride, again and again, but a brave soul always born with endless courage.Despite this, the rhythm of the movie is not depressing at all, it's bittersweet and heartwarming. The journey is funny with the Foodaholic driver, Tony lip's character image is hilarious. Dr. Shirley and Tony became friend, and their understanding of each other is more than just two cultures or any stereotypes. Their friendship is beautiful and rich in layers. However in real life, the pianist's family claimed Dr. Shirley never be friend with Tony, the movie was edited by Tony's son. Whatsoever, the script provoked thoughts, But when you walk out the theater, you would still memorize it as being short and sweet."
GREEN BOOK,14 September 2019,9/10,You can see how great and sad humanity are from this movie. There are discriminations from white people to a black man in perspective from a white guy. He faced a lot of misery and horrible discriminations. He turned to understand how horrible white people did and what he used to do. This is human movie. You should totally watch it!!!
GREEN BOOK,25 April 2019,9/10,"Love this type of movie, make you open your heart more. Everyone was born equal, guess capitalism makes us compare and compete with neighbours and try to be the best, but this doesn't make you happy. Happiness is about love and harmony."
GREEN BOOK,8 May 2020,9/10,"With two incredible performances, its storytelling and the kind feel; this movie makes you drop happy tears. Best picture went to the right place for me."
GREEN BOOK,18 October 2019,8/10,"That would've been a better title. Sure a green book is in the movie, but it isn't the focus. Other than that, this is a very beautiful movie. We all know Viggo Mortensen as Strider/Aragorn, but he's very good in this. And of course Mahershala Ali crushes it as Don Shirley. He was awesome! We also have Linda Cardellini as Tony's wife who does a very good job. We get a lot of good chemistry between Tony and Don, a lot of nice music, and a really sweet story. It's also quite accurate to the real life story. That's always a plus."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2020,10/10,"What a wonderful film.Set during the 1960's in the deep south of the United States, surrounded by racial prejudice, Dr. Donald Shirley (a black man) and Tony Lip (a tough no nonsense doesn't give a care kinda guy) embark on concert tour:
Based on real events in the deep south of the United States in the 1960's. This is a wonderful story of human development and bond between two very different people.The acting is superb from all, especially from Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen who won the Best Actor Oscar and Mahershala Ali who won the Best Supporting Actor OscarThe film has it all intrigue, foreboding, feel good and a wonderful sense of being there to support those in need.The Green Book is rightly deserving of the following Oscars:
Best PictureBest Supporting ActorBest Original ScreenplayBest ActorBest Film EditingA wonderful film and highly recommended."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2021,9/10,"There's this guy at work who praised this movie for days. Days! He told and spoiled the plot every where even to people they said they're not interested. He didn't say things to me directly because I made it clear I don't want him near me at all times but the sound, it just rides the wall and reaches my ears. God... For this reason I didn't want to watch this movie but then I watched this horrible movie called, ""I care a lot""? That blasphemy made me so unpleasant that oddly it gave me strength and willingness to endure this movie that gives me very negative image.
I am glad that I watched this movie. This was a very mature, pleasant movie. Just the right enough of drama and all."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,10/10,"I was completely blown away by this movie for i did not see this coming. It was like being blind sided as your driving down the road in a torrential rain storm. The chemistry between Viggo and Ali on screen is impeccable and they will touch your heart and make you feel as if you've known them for years. No matter your race, creed or color, everyone needs to see this movie... Perhaps it will change the way you feel about the human race as a whole, hopefully in a positive way."
GREEN BOOK,26 June 2019,9/10,"This is how a movie it's done!
The story may be very simple, (sometimes) slow and without big twists but it is so well filmed you cannot be untouched.
The care for details is so phenomenal that it is practically impossible for the viewer to not experience the sixties.
And here is Vigo ... one of the best actors in in the film industry... he, who adds another memorable character to his portfolio."
GREEN BOOK,5 April 2019,7/10,"The only reason I don't rate this movie higher is only because it had 4-5 beautiful places to end having made its point yet stayed real to the 50's ... stayed real to the reality of today. We know both characters evolve. That's not giving anything away. And they do it brilliantly. They're are breakthroughs near the end that suffice for an appropriate ending but instead of knowing when to end it, got Disney-like. That didn't ruin anything. I loved the message and the movie. But someone might have left the mystery of a country on its slow journey to decency. That would have maintained the lump in my throat. It was still worth seeing."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,10/10,"This is about as good as it gets for drama- particularly about this period in American history. I so rarely give 10/10 ratings on here; many people give them out like candy just because they like a movie, even when it's not an amazing film. Green Book is an amazing film. It's nominated for Best Picture at the time of this review, and though I think the Academy Awards is a wank, this film deserves to win Best Picture, and it could win it any year, regardless of its competition. Powerful, convincing performances by the cast; amazing storytelling; and deep, resonant moments that cannot easily be forgotten after the credits roll. This film and the events it is based on can be lessons for any generation."
GREEN BOOK,26 April 2020,8/10,"Two men of vastly different skin color, class, personality and sexual orientation, who met through music and became lifelong friends through road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough, but also need to be brave, tear down the wall in the heart to come to the point. The film is like a small green stone, thrown into the black and white of American society, inspired by the light and beautiful water. Although there is a deliberate sense of warmth, but I am willing to pay the bill ~!"
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,4/10,"Ernest but flat. Inter-racial friendships have been a topic in American films for over 50 years. The emotions between the two main characters here came across as forced and inauthentic. Why choose the Danish-American Viggo Mortensen to play an Italian-American from the Bronx? His portrait was an amateurish embarrassment. Almost grotesque, but supposed to get laughs. And Ali's character, Don Shirley, does things down South that would most likely get him killed---I doubt the incidents in the movie truthfully matched the real-life happenings. It looked like a movie about Americans that was made by Canadians. Full of false notes, with no real flavor.
This movie wasn't even a crowd-pleaser where I saw it (NYC). Don't expect Tony to beat-up every racist we see, Buford Pusser style. Just lame confrontations that didn't satisfy or really address the racial problems in a believable way. So here's one lone knock on a movie that got a mystifying amount of good reviews."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2020,8/10,"It is a fun story in my sight.A gay black man and a straight caucasian man,we cannot imagine what would happen around them.How much Don doesn't look down on Tony casually, how much Tony looks down on Don's tweaking.The Green Book is playfully causing friction between driver and employer.In the end, not only did the relationship between the protagonists change, Tony's relatives who once looked down on black people also welcomed Don at the Christmas party."
GREEN BOOK,22 April 2020,9/10,"Its relatively cliched setting and its numerous displays of racial issues have left many wondering why the film won three oscars. After watching the film, I has to say that this smooth and comfortable narrative method, natural and sincere social issues, actors and actresses to the heart of the interpretation, three oscars, deserved. And behind the award, it contains the emotions and humanity that touched countless people."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,10/10,"Amazing film!
In my opinion the best film of the year.
I can't wait to watch it again."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2020,8/10,"The most impressive clip is the scene in which their car breaks down on a country road in the south and looks at the slaves working in the fields, silent but loud."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,10/10,"""Green book"" reveals an amazing example of human transformation via the power of love and the power of art. In this story we see how art changes the heart. This movie brilliantly represents how personal responsibility affects business and family relationships. Writing, filming and acting are inspirational masterpieces."
GREEN BOOK,7 July 2020,8/10,"'Green Book' is a film full of feelings and emotions. We start from the classic and widely used base already from a very different couple from which an unexpected friendship arises. In this case, between an African-American pianist and his Italian driver. The atmosphere generated by this relationship results in a film full of sentimentality and extremely funny situations. That is the strongest point of this tape.
However, just as it does the humorous part perfectly, the dramatic part is pretty weak. His representation of racism at that time is weak and very softened, with situations that do not fully frame the segregation that African Americans were forced to live. And when it tries to be dramatic, it exaggerates it, including situations to force the viewer's feeling.
However, outside of that it is a complete film, with a direct narrative and good performances. It tells the story without more or less, it does not risk anything, but it does not lose anything either, making it a film that can certainly please anyone, this being its greatest achievement in what it is offering."
GREEN BOOK,29 August 2019,8/10,"While the movie offers two great performances from actors undeniably in their prime, it still manages to adhere to every Oscar bait drama trope in the book.
That said, the movie admittedly is very enjoyable and well edited, but any experienced viewer should be able to accurately predict the complete plotline as soon as the first 10 minutes are over. So although this still is recommended viewing, I'd rather rewatch ""The Intouchables"".
P.s.
Undoubtedly not the best movie of the year and further proof that the Oscars just award mediocre dramas."
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,8/10,"Didn't fancy this movie after viewing the trailer as it looked boring.
Well I've never been so wrong about a movie this film was well made,funny,heart warming, with a great cast.Highly recommended and an Oscar winner too."
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,10/10,"Emotional, thought provoking, well acted, and should win best film of 2018 Oscar.
For young people-a little history lesson... Yet sadly, maybe it hasn't changed that much in the U.S.....the two leads are incredible--supporting cast brilliant. DO NOT MISS!!!"
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,10/10,"This movie deserves to win Oscars for every nomination. It has a great message, extraordinary screenwriting and even better acting from the two leads. Peter Farelley is a genius himself. The perfect mix of comedy and drama, but it feels so natural thanks to the amazing chemistry of Viggo and Ali. There is not one scene which feels unnecessary or even exaggerated. It is like stepping back in time to 1962 with emphasis on what is really important in life: family, dignity and being true to oneself. There are many movies which try to convey such messages, but none so seamlessly. As important as these messages are, this movie gets a 10/10 because the journey of the two lead characters can be appreciated even more, many thanks to the script, directing and of course the acting. Best movie of the year in my opinion."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,10/10,"Frank Anthony Vallelonga, Sr (Viggo Mortensen) is the husband of Dolores (Linda Cardelina) and the father of two sons, Nick and Frank, Jr. This man is a bouncer at nightclubs and goes under the nickname of Tony Lip because of his ability to BS. Tony lives in New York with his family in the early 1960s. He is Italian and talks like a sailor and also speaks Italian. The club Tony is a bouncer for closes down for repair and Tony needs a job. A human being with amazing gastric ability like Tony can only earn so much money from hot dog eating contests!
Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is the polar opposite of Tony. He is not a medical doctor and has doctorates in music and psychology instead. He is also a gifted African-American pianist from the age of 3 and beyond. Dr. Shirley is well-breed, polite and intelligent. Tony is offered a job from Dr. Shirley to act as the man's chauffeur and body guard. He has to drive him through the prejudiced south to gigs. They use the titular Green Book as a guide to motels both men can stay at.
Two men who are poles apart become very good friends in this wonderful biopic! Tony introduces Don to the music of other black musicians like Little Richard and Aretha Franklin. He also shows him how good KFC is. On the other hand, Don teaches Tony how to write lovely letters to his wife and how to be well mannered.
Tony's son wanted to tell everyone about this unlikely friendship and this is a loving portrayal of his late father who was born in 1930 and died in 2013. Dr. Shirley was three years older than Tony and by a strange coincidence, died in the same year. I recommend this movie highly!"
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,9/10,"Best movie of the year and I've seen in awhile. Not much to find wrong as it had drama, comedy and morality all in one. Didn't remember main actor (Viggo) from previous movies but he was decent; supporting actor Ali continues to impress and show his range as an actor. Could have given it a 10 but since they kept the graphic racist actions that probably occurred to a PG-13 level, I chose to give a 9. PG-13 hopefully makes it a fan favorite for years to come because there is much to learn from this story."
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2019,10/10,"The film, from which at first did not expect delight. The film, behind the ease of irony which hides a deep meaning. A film that you watch without stopping, although this is far from a blockbuster that you have been waiting for for years. It's all about Peter Farinelli's Green Book.The plot tells of a journey through the southern states of a talented black pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his bouncer driver, hired solely for this tour (Viggo Mortenessen). Minor at first sight and a little bydlovaty hero Mortensen during this uncomplicated journey becomes for an esthete pianist a true friend, support and even a treasure of useful knowledge about life and society, and he draws from the boss useful skills in aesthetics, love of art and good parenting.
The plot is very simple, the film looks incredibly easy. Dialogues are written ironically, absolutely not boring, but at the same time they remain filled with meaning for the viewer. The relationship between the characters is the main motive of the film. And how could so different people in all respects be able to become each other friends for life in a few weeks?It should be noted that the leitmotif of 'racism', which at that time was still extremely common in America, especially in the south, was incredibly subtly written. All these hotels are for 'colored', individual cafes, pools and even latrines .. the nuances of that time in the film are shown perfectly, and so that you yourself feel ashamed that this existed. I literally wanted to stand up and give the characters in the face in several scenes.Surprisingly, the director Peter Farinelli had previously shot mostly comedies (and mostly with his brother), and this is his first film in the comedy drama genre. From my point of view, he handled it perfectly and I would love to see what else he would film later, although I can't say before that I set him apart as an interesting director. Perhaps it was the fact that the film was made only by Peter Farenelli very strongly contributed to the 'nobility' of the picture in terms of humor.The funny fact is that one of the screenwriters of the film is Nick Vallelonga, his father was the prototype of the main character Frank (Tony Chatterun) Vallelonga. The script was written on the basis of dictation records made by Nick Vallelonga. Later on these records, Viggo Mortensen learns to speak Italian, because his hero is Italian.The film was shot in the spirit of the 60s, beautiful cars of that time are very well shown, the art of the costume, the receptions in the large houses of the rich public (some 'Gone with the Wind' is immediately remembered)This film is simple, kind, sincere. Without any strain, without life horrors, you know, where someone dies, someone is killed or someone is in prison. The atmosphere of the film is ""soft"" and light. You literally find yourself in this time, with terrific cars of all colors of the rainbow, men in flawless day costumes of all colors, gentlemen with whiskey at the bar in hotels listening to the brilliant pianist.The Green Book is not a picture of slavery, racism and humiliation, although it touches on these topics. The Green Book is a film about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual support between people. The film is about the fact that it is very difficult to change the ingrained thinking of society alone, even if you are brilliant and famous.By viewing required."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2019,10/10,"This is not a movie this is time travel to history. I enjoyed every moment of it.
Great work Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali and all the gang.
Tip: although Christmas take part some minutes only it's in my top list of Christmas recommendations for sure."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,6/10,"This movie is a buddy comedy with some serious circumstances thrown in it. It has the typical story where two people from wildly different backgrounds are forced to be together and eventually overcome their differences to become lifelong friends. We've seen it so many times before that we know what is going to happen when we see the movie poster. In that sense, it is nothing new and nothing special. What I think puts this film a step above the rest is the acting. Specifically, Viggo Mortensen. I think he does a very nice job of playing the cliche endearing scumbag. He's funny but competent and that does a lot for the movie. Mahershala Ali also does a decent job but I don't think it's anything special. He does well with the limited range that the script allows. Since the film is centered almost entirely around them, it is entertaining and able to keep your attention. However, not all of the acting was good. The more the Italian family was in the film, the worse it got. It's just so uncomfortable watching such a cliche loud Italian family. Other transgressions that I think the film commits include Mortensen's character having contradictory views on race and the frequent contrived teaching points. These types of things are expected in this kind of movie but that doesn't make them any less diminishing. Overall, it is a decent film that almost overcomes it's genre."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2021,8/10,"As a commentary on the race situation in early 1960s America, its well done but not original, groundbreaking or particularly worthy. As a buddy movie, with characters seemingly from opposite side of every trait going it excels and although this is partly down to the writing, it is the superb performances from both leads that really elevate this beyond the average."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,9/10,"If I could sum it in one word it will be : Fabulous.
Seen a lot of movies showing the Black and White divide. Most of them were overdramatic. But this one is subtle, peaceful and a pleasure to watch.
We have the white guy who takes no non-sense and the black guy, the pianist, who endures everything with grace. And in the end we see the white guy mellow down and the pianist rebel and both enjoying the change.
A very well made movie with no preaching or over dramatism.
This ones a winner."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2020,10/10,What a treasure it was to of watched something I normally wouldn't of even thought to of.. You know it doesn't hurt to try a different side of yourself. Opening up to being more open. And looking at things a little deeper. Feeling feelings is what life is about. Sharing experiences with people you normally wouldn't. I found myself smiling so many times during this movie. And even tearing up. The acting was superb! I recommend 'The Green Book'- 10/10
GREEN BOOK,12 September 2019,9/10,"From Peter Farrelly, director of such classic fare as Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary and Shallow Hal comes a fantastic and surprising little film about friendship, acceptance and resistance in the face of rampant racism.
Viggo Mortensen plays Tony 'the Lip', a small time bouncer who is hired to drive Doctor Don Shirley, a piano virtuoso on his concert tour of the Deep South. The year is 1962, segregation is in full swing and racism is everywhere, including in New York.
This is a warm, moving story about two men who form a strong friendship that overcame both of their prejudices and helped each man become a better person. It's based on a great true story, well acted and well directed, earning its many nominations and awards and the controversy surrounding the film is worth overlooking. It's not a perfect film, there are questions over its 'white gaze' on Jim Crow racism, over the true story and more but as a piece of genuine heartwarming entertainment it's fantastic and is definitely worth your time."
GREEN BOOK,25 December 2020,9/10,"At first glance this movie reminded me of the French movie: ""The Intouchables"". A solid movie through and through and I highly recommend you go see if if you haven't already. Although the undertone of this one is a little darker. It perferctly displays how humanity has evolved since the 60's, and they somehow made it work with a PG-13 rating. Viggo Mortensen gave a stunning performance as the loud-mouth Italian American and Mahershala Ali as the cultured and well mannared African American ( For which he won the oscar ). I am a little insulted that Viggo wasn't nominated in any categories but hey... The chemistry between the two main characters was awesome! Goes to show that opposites does attract.Humanity has come a long way since those days but there is still something to be learned here."
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,"This production was perfect.
Perfectly written. Perfectly produced. Perfectly presented.
And get this.....the entire family can watch it together!
Oh! I almost forgot, it has a plot and a great ending!
Real big screen entertainment!
See it with someone you care about.
You'll love it!"
GREEN BOOK,30 November 2018,8/10,"'Green Book' barrels past some initial hokeyness to take us on a poignant journey through the deep south ... and into the heart of America's persistent deficiency in overcoming racial inequality.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen both disappear into their roles as only actors of their caliber can, making every scene so captivating that the movie's 130-minute run time feels half as long.There's plenty of contemplation and outrage to go around. However, it's the genuine laughs that truly round out the film, providing a full range of delightful (and sometimes dizzying) emotions that quickly come and pass like mile markers on the side of a highway."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,9/10,"I love a movie that restores my faith in films. Is it fun to see a movie with a zillion dollar budget and every special effect known to man? Sure. But can you take an issue, any issue, and break it down to two characters you care about and leave the theatre feeling you're better for it? Yes. And that's far more satisfying.Isn't Peter Farrelly half the team that brought us ""Dumb & Dumber?"" And now he makes this? Amazing. Worth the wait. Viggo Mortensen is the new De Niro, some things may be predictable but are handled nicely, and the last seventy seconds or so are pretty much perfect. So far, the best movie I've seen in 2018. In an odd way, it reminded me Breaker Morant."
GREEN BOOK,25 April 2021,8/10,This movie has a little bit of everything in it. One of the best movies of the last decade. Acting is superb.
GREEN BOOK,12 December 2020,9/10,"Having just watched this in 2020, it was heartfelt and the messaging behind it deeper than first glance. As a few others have said, this is not just the struggle one person or race. You view the story from everyone, even those you might not agree with, it's about what people/society perceive as right or wrong ad those will always be the hardest perceptions to change.I would watch this again, the characters spot on for the roles."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,,"So, I had to watch Green Book after it won Best Picture at the Oscars. I was weary of the movie even before I made plans to watch it. Why? The reactions of Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee at the Academy Awards were reason enough. Having seen the movie, I realised that this had ""Oscar Bait"" written all over it. But, I'll admit this. Green Book was a nice one. You get that heartwarming feel as the end credits roll. It's a bit too long though. They could have cut 15 minutes off of it and nothing would have changed.Coming to the performances: Mahershala stole the show. This was his movie all along. At least in Moonlight, there were the other kids and Naomie Harris. However, I wasn't onboard with Viggo Mortensen's Tony Lip. It was as if he prepared for the role by watching Scorsese films. His character seemed like an extra from The Sopranos. Linda Cardellini does a pretty good job as Tony Lip's wife - a role that could have used additional screen time.Overall, Green Book can best be described as a White Man's Wet Dream."
GREEN BOOK,4 June 2021,9/10,"Best picture winners of late have tended more towards 'important or significant' movies like The Artist or Birdman and away from crowd-pleasing entries like Braveheart and The Return of the King. Green Book shows the academy taking the step in the right direction in picking a movie that the average person will actually enjoy. Green Book is simply a good movie. Both leads act well, the story is moving and interesting, and it gives social message (condemning racism) without being preachy or ramming it down the viewer's throat."
GREEN BOOK,15 December 2019,9/10,"I have already seen Ali in ""true detective "" , he is a great actor and this role he was given in this movie is perfect, i don't know why people say this movie was predictable ! This is a biography , it's a based on true story !! So obviously the director shouldn't change much of it , i enjoyed the movie the connection between the two characters is great , the movie deals with a very sensitive issue back in the sixties in the United state and also present the importance of family ,the sparsity between the wealth and the poor and many other things , it was worth watching truly"
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,2/10,"In real life, I especially hate those opportunistic things - just like the production intention of this movie.
So no matter how much (in some respects) it is praised, I will not give it - and such things - any good evaluation."
GREEN BOOK,18 June 2021,9/10,Exceptional! So different from what I expected. They story is well told with just enough humor and somberness to make it grab you in the gut.
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2021,3/10,"The reviews are so telling. People watch this film as an excuse to perpetually ignore their own racist bias. White people and their self-absorbed white savior fantasies such as ""Green Book"" are the reason why black people of color feel so misrepresented in film and tv.Not only is the film highly offensive in the way Mr. Shirley is being guided by Mortensen's character, and how he dictates him how to find his roots to his culture back, which is just so wrong on so many levels, but it also makes the racist a literal hero, who is excused in such a rushed and inelegant fashion.He teaches Shirley how to eat chicken wings in what comes across as one of the most misguided and stereotypical colonial views of cultural identity. Of course the old white boomers in this world laugh their ass off when it comes to such badly written trite garbage, because it reinforces their black and white views.Its such a caricatural portrayal of a very one sided story, fabricated by three white writers (!) who didn't even ask Shirleys family for permission and creative direction. As such, the film can barely be considered progressive, faithful or even emotionally intelligent. Its as if three white-frat-dude-bros gave a presentation on how to fight racism. This aint it guys.Green Book is hilariously inadequate oscar bait made for the masses, a film that will go down as one of the most horrendous oscar winners and remind people in the future how award shows were dominated by ignorant white voters who didn't bother looking up the terms ""white savior narrative"", or who simply didn't care.I hope people on IMDb reach out of their cultural bubble and confront these films in a more critical manner, and not just watch films superficially while being fed with problematic narratives. The previous winner ""Moonlight"" made by an actual black director has a lower score than this, and it basically says everything we need to know about racial insensitivity on here."
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,10/10,I thought this film would be boring. But was I wrong acting brilliant story even better and it's a true story. Well done.
GREEN BOOK,13 October 2019,9/10,"The myth that the victory of the Union in the Civil War freed the African-American is punctured in this extraordinary movie which does not duck one issue about the continued post Civil War divisions - even well into the second half of the 20th Century.The ""Green Book"" is a travel guide which listed the places where negroes were permitted to overnight. Especially in the South. In 1962. A hundred plus years on from Lincoln. As in ""The Heat of the Night"" if you venture south of the Mason-Dixon Line you'll find a foreign country where they do things differently.Don Shirley, the black pianist, and Tony Lip, the Italian from the Bronx who is his driver, defy the black/white stereotypes. The former is sophisticated, supremely talented, squeamish and refined. But black. The latter is rough, lives from hand to mouth, physical and limited. But white. In Birmingham Alabama Tony can eat in the restaurant and piss in the bathroom. Don has to go down the street to somewhere the black folks eat and piss in a shack in the yard.That's the essence of the story. Prejudice. Racial divides. Discrimination. Overt and largely unchallenged racism. Even to a genius who lives in a beautiful apartment on the top floor of Carnegie Hall. The ""Boy"" has to telephone Attorney General Bobby Kennedy to get released from jail where an indiscretion of Tony has landed him.The film is impeccably directed, brilliantly cast and cleverly written. It is fictionalised from the true story of Don and Tony but this is not a documentary. In 2019 in the Age of Trump it is appropriate to revisit the recent past of explicit prejudice ( and worse). America is rotten fro the bottom up - ""Green Book"" tells you why."
GREEN BOOK,11 September 2019,7/10,Some movie that are nominated and win awards don't actually deserve it. This is not an example of that. This movie deserves all the accolades it receives. Wonderful directing. Screenwriting was perfect. Cast was spot on. I really enjoyed this movie.
GREEN BOOK,26 June 2020,9/10,"Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended."
GREEN BOOK,21 August 2020,,"I'm not sure what the fuss about this movie, I swear I already saw the same type movie many times already.It's sad to see such talented actors/actresses in such a bland film."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,8/10,"It was an ok movie for a weak year in movies. Good acting made this movie ok. I dont agree with a lot of the commentary about how it handled racism; and how Don Shirley was portrayed. His family did not write the film. This story developed from the writer hearing it mostly from his dad, the driver. So from that point of view the story depicted was accurate. It wasnt the important view, or the more interesting that of Don Shirley. I think that would have been a better movie.My guess is there was some distance between Don and his family; or they would have written his story. A black man in the 50's and 60's who was a music savant; PHD in 3 subjects; and they didnt write his story? Spike Lee didnt think enough of Don's contribution not to write it??? Is it because Don has contributed more than Spike? Noone should care what Spike Lee thinks anyway.Again I do think this story is accurate, but from the wrong perspective. It could have been a great one....."
GREEN BOOK,8 June 2019,10/10,"For anyone who has a tendency to stereotype, you can learn a lot from this movie. Not all blacks are the same, not all whites are the same and yes as painful as it is to believe not all cops are the same. It's never to late to change. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone!! Powerful and duntsey."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2020,9/10,"The script is great, the details are substantial and the performance is in place. We can see the experiences of some groups in different times in this film. It's a warm film about courage and change."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,8/10,"The stories about unexpected friendships are recognized for which are inspired by real events, to see the main characters would initially meet each other for the job. Until they would travel together in a journey, which a friendship between them would come out. Some of these stories would end that the main characters would remain connected by keeping seeing each other, others would end that the main characters would separate each of their roads but without forgetting what an incredible bond they have. The filmmaker Peter Farrelly was intrigued to release a movie about friendships, inspired by a real event but without his brother Bobby Farrelly's collaboration. In 2018 came out Green Book by Peter Farrelly, with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The movie's plot: in 1960s, an Italian-American bouncer Tony Vallelonga or also known as Tony ""Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen), would get a job as driver and bodyguard for the talented jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). For the long venues tour through South America, since they would travel in this journey a friendship between them would come out. The movie is a comedy-drama which mixes both elements to be workable, by using the humor in a natural way without forcing it and the drama can be emotional to be touching. The movie's narration tells the story to catch the audience attention, as the screenplay was elaborated to maintain the rhythm without ruing it. Viggo Mortensen did an excellent performance as Tony Lip, who would act in a rude way when he would take some actions. But since he would travel in the venues tour, he would take care Don Shirley to make sure Don would not get in trouble. In the course of the story Tony would write love letters to his wife, until he would get helped by Don to express better Tony's emotions. Mahershala Ali was extraordinary as Don Shirley who even is a talented jazz pianist, he would be seen with bad eyes because of the racism at the time set on the movie. Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga would find out through the tour, they have many things in common to be then close to each other. They both would also help each other to find solutions, to be surprisingly smart as they would move forward on their journey. Green Book is one of the best 2018's movies, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both surprisingly extraordinary in the movie."
GREEN BOOK,1 December 2019,10/10,"A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour through the 1960s Jim Crow American South.
After a string of weak and questionable choices in recent years the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences finally got it right for a change by awarding Green Book the Best Film Oscar of 2019.
Whether or not similar stories have been told before (e.g., Driving Miss Daisy) this one takes the cake on every level. Viggo Mortensen is beyond belief as the low class Italian American slob hired to Chauffeur an erudite posh mannered snobbish  Pianist (Don Shirley) on a concert tour of the horridly outrageously racist deep south in 1961. The way in which their early antagonism turns into deep friendship along the way is told in a most amusing manner skedaddled along by the bottomless talents of both actors. The situations are perfectly chosen to point up the deepening racism the deeper south they go. In one rain soaked scene we are subtly reminded that in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave there actually existed places (in Mississippi) where it was illegal for a black person to be see on the streets after dark! ( don't let the sun set on you) -- Shameful, shameful but true! In this scene Viggo punches out one redneck cop and both land in jail. Will they ever get out of this one? -- Shirley knows his rights and is allowed one call to a lawyer. The return call shocks the sickening redneck cops into letting the prisoners go. It was from the Attorney General in Washington -- Shirley was a personal friend of RFK, brother of JFK -- neither mentioned by name.
The picture opens without so much as a main title plunging right in to the back story of Tony Lip the night club bouncer (Mortensen) and his Italian dialect speaking extended family with Mafioso connections. All mix their English up with snatches of Sicilian immigrant Italian (subtitled) adding an immediate element of authenticity. We don't even get to the main part of the film for art least twenty minuted when Tony, out of work, is hired for a well paid job as a chauffeur and bodyguard by Shirley (Mahershala Ali, Best supporting actor) but this part alone is almost a complete movie in itself. We don't get to understand that the Green Book of the title is the name of an actual hotel/motel guidebook that was published to help black people find accommodations when traveling in the racially segregated south until nearly a third of the way into the story. But by this time the tone is already set. Another strong plus is the way Shirley's swift piano fingering is shown without a hitch making it look as if Ali is doing the playing himself.
At the Oscars Spike Lee was brimming with bitterness that his BlaKKKlansman was so easily outflanked by Green Book, but having seen both pictures I am inclined to agree with the critic who said that he was very glad that a heartwarming and highly entertaining film like Green Book won out over Lee's angry hate filled diatribe. And that's exactly what KKKlansman was. A hate filled diatribe.
Ps: Although I was very favorably impressed by Rami Malek's rendition of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody I was even more impressed by Mortensen's amazing ability to totally enter the skin of a low class Italian slob and endow the role with a perfect mix of violence, humor, and humanism. For me it was Best Actor, Viggo."
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,10/10,"Two different heroes influence each other. In the end they get better. The film is filled with humor and rich history. The film says that there is always a choice, regardless of the rules and standards of society. Awesome performance of roles, great compatibility of Viggo and Mahershala."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,6/10,"This was a very good movie, not the best , but considering most of the others movies the last few years have been garbage, this is one well worth seeing. The movie is entertaining, music is enjoyable, and overall it will make you feel good. It does not portray New York Italians as very bright, which is not really fair, but does show a friendship can develop between people from different backgrounds regardless of their ethnicity. Of course a good part of the movie shows how bad it was in the south with Jim Crow in effect, and rightly so, but I was happy the movie did not make that the only focus like the movie Mudbound (a depressing movie). This movie is well worth your time to see, and both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were superb in their respective roles."
GREEN BOOK,8 June 2020,9/10,"Based on the true story of Jamaican American pianist and composer highly educated and influential Don Shirley (and his actual ""driver"" for his road trip). Doctor Shirley displayed immense talent at an early age, debuting in concert with the Boston Pops at the tender age of 18. Despite the obstacles of horrifying segregation in the 50's/60's, he performed at prestigious venues, including the South, and earned acclaim for his work with his group, The Don Shirley Trio, showcasing a unique style that melded classical, spiritual and popular elements."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,Definitely one of the best movies of the last twenty years. A movie that kept my attention from beginning to end. Emotional and dramatic. When it ended it left me wanting to know more of the story.
GREEN BOOK,13 July 2019,9/10,"Really wonderful.. I like this type of Art film based on reality. The film successfully represented the then situation. It's really very touching and heartening. I just can't think about the situation faced by the famous Pianist. How gentle he was! How the people had behaved that time; I Just can't think it anymore. Ops, the great thing is that now-a-days we don't have to see or face colorism anymore! Judge one by his activity & creativity not by his color!!"
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2019,10/10,"Green Book is not only a well-produced film, but it is also an important one. It transmits an edgy message without over or under exposing it to the viewers, and the story ties together really neatly thanks to the vision of the director and the outstanding performances from both of the main leads. This film should be watched by everyone, as it is as important to our society today as it is a funny and entertaining road trip movie."
GREEN BOOK,25 January 2021,5/10,"Yep i see what they wanted to do with this real life story , but is it really Oscar material ? No.. but it fits perfectly into todays liberal agenda and reversed racism, where white people are dumb and black people are always right, always better.. Forcing this agenda into almost every second movie is you know ... bad...
Mahershala Ali is great actor , i loved him in Predators and here as well.. I liked Viggo as well .. The real life story is nice , true friendship build up from the scracth is always something you can get hope from in these days.. But i missed key scenes between those two where the friendship was building.. I mean, i wouldnt want the truth being bended only for movie plot but some key scene should have been more powerful , more philosophical , more opinion vs opinion... 95% of this movie is just banter..."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,8/10,"This is not a typical road movie. Entertaining, funny in parts,
this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,6/10,It's not as good as Driving Miss Daisy but it's better than Black KKKlansman.
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,8/10,"Let me start by saying I'm basing my review on watching the film and not based on the actual facts of the true story.
Green Book delivered!!
I went to see the film twice and wanted to see if I felt the same both times, I can say It did.
Perfect blend of emotion and humour with great acting from Viggo and Ali, Viggo Mortensen's character is portrayed brilliantly in his over the top display.
Mahershala Ali Gives another great performance and maybe best of carter to date.
what I enjoyed about this film was the acting and the screenplay which had me smiling throughout especially when Viggo & Ali we're on screen together with the chemistry they engaged.
Green Book is a must see and now an Oscar winner."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,8/10,"In this day and age it is a good reminder of how far we have come and also how far we have to go.
This movie is Driving Miss Daisy role reversal for hipsters.
Adequate but not far reaching."
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,"This was the movie I had been dying to see for weeks. And then, I watched it. I was not wrong about this movie being a comedic and hilarious movie, but it also left something unexpected. The story was meaningful, thoughtful, and tears were brought to my heart. It's one of those movies that made me laugh, that made me cry, and that made me sit there in shock, in wonder and awe. This movie is simply about a black man and a white man, and a friendship, an unlikely friendship tying them together. With all the challenges that they face, and the obstacles in the way, they face them, and you'll see what happens next. The story of Tony Lip and Doctor Shirley is surely a story that we want our children to know, their children to know, and our great grandchildren to know, and the entire generation passed down before us; to show people what really matters in the world, what reigns over racism and electronics and following what the society does, letting reputation get the best of you. These are all the least important. Friendship can tie us together. So let us appreciate it. It doesn't matter what other people do, it matters what you do. What you do, make it right. I was not surprised when this movie received an Oscar, and it surely is a beautiful movie that everyone should watch in their free time."
GREEN BOOK,11 May 2020,9/10,"The two men, whose skin color, class, character and sexual orientation are so different, are married because of music, and become lifelong friends because of road travel. Sometimes talent is not enough, but also need to be brave, push down the wall in the heart to get to the point. The movie is like a green pebble, which is put into the black and white American society and arouses light, small and beautiful ripples."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,"I kind of went into this thinking the issue of racism would dominate and there wold be a lot of those ""important"" messages. It doesn't. The film is about how friendship can transgress boundaries of race, colour, ethnicity. It reminds me a lot of the stories on how the British got Ian Paisley to talk to Martin McGuinness at the height of the troubles in Ireland and their animosity to one another. They made them share the same car. The Green Book is a similar journey and along the way says something important. That we are social beings and a lot of the differences we see between us are contrived and of lessor importance. Watch out for the scene where they argue about who is more black."
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,9/10,"This is a good story, and nicely told and acted. It's worth watching a few times, because it has a few tiers and points of view for assessment. (From whose point of view, inside-out or outside-in, etc.)For a prejudiced person, it probably will not cause the trauma needed for deep change, but perhaps for someone on the fence, it will teach something. For an inviting free-thinker, it is a pleasure of truth.There is the usual hypocrisy juxtaposition, such as in the Godfather. In the Godfather, assassination scenes were cut into the communion scene. Here, it's acts of prejudice followed by religious symbols and prayer.Starting conflict, the growth of bond, transformation and redemption. Low-key comedy along the way, which was nicely balanced to the message and tone.There is a great discussion in the car, too subtle for some, about the complexity of a human being, but the singularity of how prejudice is formed. That is, how we form opinions based upon one criterion, when a human being is complex. Again, it is subtle, but the movie balances nicely that human beings in similar roles, including roles of power, all do not act the same.Well-done. This story and the acting duly earned its awards."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,9/10,"The critics review's of Green Book naturally zero in on artistic merit and other factors but I review movies based on how much I enjoyed them and artistic merit is factored in later. Green Book was the movie I enoyed the most this past year. It kept me engrossed from start to finish and at the end I felt that was two hours well spent. Acting was superb, store was fasinating, and it was fairly accurate as biographies go. Even though I came of age during the time period of the movie I had never heard of Don Shirley. His musical style does combine jazz, pop, and classical touches and it played well on the big screen in 7.1 Dolby. A great sound track of his music as well as other popular music of that era. Yes, the movie was somewhat formulaic but so what? It was both funny and dramatic and captured the spirit, good and bad, of the times. I especially liked the way the movie opened with recreated scenes of the famous Cocacabana night club in New York, and ending with the extended family Christmas dinner in the Bronx. The two leads should both get Oscars as should the original screenplay. My overall feeling is the movie somewhat downplayed the racial issues in the south, even though they were disturbing to watch. I have a feeling it was even worse that we northeners could imagine. But maybe that is what made the movie enjoyable - it wasn't a downer by any means, but reflected the good in people for the most part. Go see it. It is a great story with great actors."
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2020,9/10,"The film begins with a road trip between a black customer and a white driver across South America. Two people who are completely different identities, different classes, and even prejudiced against each other, they are established during this dangerous but interesting journey. Friendship. Not only across the racial barriers, but also explains how we should truly face ourselves in life."
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,10/10,"Just watched this gem last night and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed throughout the movie. Viggo and Mahershala provide them in this wonderful movie based on the true life of Tony Vallelonga and Dr. Don Shirley. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about, but I gave it a try and I was absolutely mesmerized by both characters and the way they interacted. Both play off each other brilliantly and again I laughed out loud several times. Viggo should win the Oscar, but wouldn't you know it Mr. Bale is standing in his way. The movie hums along at a nice pace and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. Director Farrelly does it again, this time with two of the most brilliant actors of our time. Green Book is a winner in my book."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,10/10,"I'm not going to rehash what everyone else is saying. See it for yourself. This should be a 9+ movie. I think the critics are hung up on the racism issue but these so-called critics don't know the difference from ignorance and deliberate, conscience racism. I think many of them think it's all the same. Tony of the former, and over time he sees the truth. It slowly changes and we as the audience feel it and empathize. This is why you get nominated for an Oscar. See it! For those bashing Mort for his ""N"" word transgression, ""He who is without sin can case the first stone!"" Too many hypocrites out there."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,8/10,"'Green Book' is charming, funny and heart warming. Oh, and ""based"" on a true story. ""Inspired"" may have been an even better choice. So if your looking for historical accuracy, you may want to pass. However, taken for what it is, a road trip movie about two diametrically opposed characters directed by Peter Farrelly, it's a fun and thoughful story. It's flawed only by its inability to decide if it is about the characters or investigating a bigger idea about race then and now. There is no question that this subject, especially in these times, deserves better and more serious consideration but does every movie about race in America have to be charged with that duty? (This may be the fault of sloppy marketing that leaned into the ""based on a true story"" trailer plug. ) Having said that, there is a lot to unpack here and the movie gets bogged down in too many running themes. (Thus a 7 over an 8 rating) Mortensen and Ali have a nice chemistry. It'd be cool if they did something else together. To coin another movie, ""This might be the making of a beautiful friendship.""."
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,7/10,"Good screenplay, nice story, great performance by Mahershala Ali. But still I would say 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was more deserving to win the Best Picture award at the Oscars this year. The Academy is giving priority to the films based on the ""Black and White"" situation in America from some years. This partiality should be stopped, I believe."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,10/10,"Brilliant film well written and directed, really good acting. Well worth the watch I was quite hesitant to watch this film because it's not really the kind of film I like to see but I'm glad I did. It doesn't matter if where black or white we are all equal and that clearly portrayed that between the two characters especially towards the end. Lovely film it's definitely a must watch."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,9/10,Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali recreate the epic personalities of two individuals that not only made a difference to those around them back in their day but who most certainly would have brought alot of colour into our lives had we had the pleasure of meeting them.With such an abundance of personality within this story come the moments of entertaining dialogue that everyone can enjoy. From family dichotomies to awkward them and us scenarios.Simply charming.
GREEN BOOK,27 March 2020,8/10,"The When blacks and whites could reconcile their centuries-old grievances,Why do we still discriminate in our own continent?Don't say there's no race here.
On differences in region, nationality, city and country, occupation and sex,Neither should be grounds for discrimination or to be discriminated against.
But the elimination of discrimination is based on full dialogue and discussion,
Rather than being full of no-go areas,especially ethnic issues.Why not spread the word and let people speak freely?
Beauty's understanding of elegance in the details of dealing with people,Very impressive.
By contrast, we should be more casual.
Ali plays the piano and the snow scene are special effects.A tender and moving film,Maybe one more emotional tears point, perfect."
GREEN BOOK,2 November 2021,10/10,"One of the best films of the past 10 years, one that deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture. Of course, some black people will play the race card and find fault with the film, but that's nonsense. This is a factual story that accurately portrays the way it was then, including for black performers like Don Shirley, so get over it (and yourselves). They should feel proud that they have a role model like Don Shirley instead of the untalented clowns there are today like Kanye West and his ilk who think getting shot is a badge of honor. Being both black and gay, Shirley had a lot to contend with and rise above and he did so admirably with class and dignity.I've always liked Viggo Mortensen's work, but I fell in lust with him after seeing this. I don't care if he has a dinky winky (like he proudly displays in Captain Fantastic), his character in Green Book does it for me, Mister Daddy! He plays prime Italian beef to perfection and he should have won the Oscar."
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2021,9/10,"Both leads are very good. Well written and played.
Best serious film I've seen in some time.
Watch the faces in the final scene."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,4/10,"An OK film, but has been overhyped and not sure why it got the oscar. It has a few nice moments, but there's not much beyond the usual cliches. Finding it out it was based on a true story was the only real surprise and was heartwarming enough."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,7/10,Well crafted movie with a good heart and a story worth telling. It was an enjoyable storyline to watch play out. I didn't see a best picture win coming when I watched it however and maybe I'd have expected too much if I did. It's a nice ride in a time machine with the added bonus of discovering not everyone in that era was as bad as they seem in hindsight.
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2018,8/10,"Green Book is so perfect it hurts. The story is pretty much dead on. The casting and dialogue couldn't possibly be any better. Green Book is winning an Academy Award for Best Picture for sure. I have no idea how someone could write a true story about racial tensions in the US during the 1960s and make it comical and cheerful, but it happened and it looked damn good. Amazing from start to finish."
GREEN BOOK,18 September 2020,7/10,"I admired the film & one cant deny the fact why it's a wonderful film to binge . Frankly this movie doesnt do much justice to the title Green book apart from few seconds where we are told what's it's about . There are scenes which anger you as well because there was so much prejudice between white & the black in the 60s .
Overall grab this film to watch but I wont call it a masterpiece"
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,"I got tickets to see an advanced 'secret' showing of this movie, a movie I would most likely missed if I had known what it was in advance, but I'm glad I saw it. It's a funny feelgood heartwarming story. Well worth a look!"
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,6/10,"This movie is just average. It's too soft, too slow and almost nothing happens. The acting is just ok. Nothing to remember in years to come. The storyline is way too predictable. The sound effects are almost zero; like the background music. I didn't feel strong emotions in either way...positive or negative. Medium movie with medium feelings associated to it.
""GreenBook""; ""Moonlight""; ""12 Years a Slave""...it seems that Hollywood has found a way to purge American's Guilt over years of opression. These are definitively not oscar material movies!"
GREEN BOOK,25 August 2019,10/10,Fantastic film. Everyone should see this movie. It is not woke in any way it a great story.
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,3/10,"White guy acts racist to black guy. Black guy's white driver steps in to save the day. Repeat.White driver acts ignorant about everything. Black guy corrects white guy or acts offended by him. Repeat.White driver and black guy get closer. Repeat.These are the three types of scenes in the movie. What's the point of the movie? It's not a feel good movie. It's depressing.Dr. Shirley puts up with Tony. I didn't see them as friends at all. So, I didn't get that criticism of the movie in terms of historical accuracy.However, making Tony the main character was not very good. He is not a very redeemable character. Nor does Tony ever seek redemption."
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2020,8/10,This movie was so good and so positive. You smile out of these emotions sometimes. Actors also were perfect.
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2020,9/10,"While you could argue if the topic raised in the movie is really suited for a feelgood movie such as this, when the credits rolled, I could wholeheartedly say yes.For once it's not dark, gloomy and preachy drama about America's 1960's racism. No, this is an uplifting and hopeful tale of two men, getting closer together and evolve beyond the beliefs they have been brought up with or the semi-hardcoded (mis)conceptions of things that simply are a certain way for them, mostly because of groupthink and indirect group pressure to behave a certain way.The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.You can top it all off with beautiful classical and sixties era music.All in all, a very entertaining and loveable movie. 9/10, well deserved."
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,8/10,"A worthy watch with the leads pulling off some excellent and endearing characters.A good meaningful thread of racial issues in the Deep South of the US, entwined with the Human story of a lost black man who is a brilliant pianist, stuck between white and black cultures and feeling no place in either and a Italian doorman/ hustler with a big heart and a healthy knowledge of what he is and where he is from.Their relationship is warm and human and at times laugh out loud funny. This teachers you stuff with feeling, emotion and entertainment, it has depth but is fun.8/10 for me. A very worthy watch."
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,9/10,"Green Book is inspired by the true story of Tony Lip and Don Shirley. This movie really grabbed my attention because it is a buddy film. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen give out standing performounces that got them both the honor of being nominated for best supporting and best actor in a motion picture. Over all this film was funny, sad, and maybe even violent. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who love history and dramadeys ."
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2019,10/10,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie, but I was wrong.If I write anything else, I will spoil it, so I won't.But it really gives an amazing look at how things were back then.Unfortunately, many of these prejudices and attitudes still persist today."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,6/10,"I thought this film was Alright when I saw it. The more people are raving about it, the more I dislike it. It's essentially a male 'driving miss daisy'. It is SO predictable so quick, I just rolled my eyes. I'm sure it was supposed to be funny that it was a role reversal that ali's Character was the refined one and mortensen's the white trash one, but it wasn't funny. At all. I don't really have a lot to say about this film because it's not memorable. Skip it for sure."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2019,10/10,"This movie is a reminder of how bad it was in the US not so long ago. It's an eye opener (again) the characters are well chosen, and Viggo is playing a great role as Italian. The story, which was new to me, is one of a reversed stereotype, but it will keeps your attention during the entire movie, the outcome is a little bit predictable, they become life time friends as they adapted the best of both worlds."
GREEN BOOK,25 September 2021,8/10,"Amazing acting by Viggo Mortensen, he was the star, I was astonished by the way he did his character. I don't understand why Marshala got nominated and won the Oscar he didn't really do anything extraordinary like Viggo, his character and acting was standard."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2020,10/10,"The movie tells of two people with different personalities, who strive to break the prejudice and become friends.""The world's full of lonely people afarid to make the first move"""
GREEN BOOK,28 November 2018,9/10,The only thing better than the story is the performance by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Both of them deliver flawless performances and show tremendous chemistry together. This movie will be in the running for many awards and I think they will come home with some silverware. It was much better than I was expecting and I went in the theatres with high expectations.
GREEN BOOK,18 May 2019,10/10,"That's what this movie perfectly showcases. It's about a highly respectable and highly regarded African American pianist who dares venture into the highly discriminatory and apartheid realm of the Southern United States in 1962. He's treated with acclaim at the beginning of his tour, but slowly, as his chauffeur/ bodyguard & assistant (wonderfully played by Viggo Mortenson) drive further South , the more inhuman and disturbing the situation becomes.Mahershala Ali is absolutely terrific as the highly cultured and professional pianist, Dr. Shirley, who demands respect and appreciation for his musical talents, but later realizes just how much ""race"" and treatment depended on who he was.His dignity is highly apparent at the beginning, but as the tour gradually moved further South, you could could he had trouble ""keeping it together"" and trying to deal with just how truly demeaning and disrespected a man in his situation could be in at that time.He even admitted to Tony his ""alienation"" from who he was and how he couldn't relate to either black or white. Tony, an apparent racist at first, does gradually come to his senses about the annoying obstacles of racism, but gradually learns to deal with it in a ""less violent way"". That's the major potency of this film.This is a beautiful movie and tugs on the heart strings in a lot of ways. It can really make you think and question the status a person can be in no matter where they are. We'd all like to think we'll be treated like equals no matter what part of Earth we might venture in, but sometimes it's not that way. This film terrifically addresses that issue. I highly recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2021,10/10,"This film does just everything right. Its just incredibly fun to accompany Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali through this adventure that offers so much humanity, strong emotionality and apt humour. And despite some intense moments, the film always remains light and elegant, which proves Peter Farrelly's skills as a director. Rounded off by a wonderful ending, a film has been made that I can watch again and again."
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2020,9/10,"In this movie, it is more about this black talented doctor who strives for himself and his personal dignity. In the eyes of white people, they invited black people to come and play the piano to listen to his performance, just to set off their noble taste. Although he and Tony also had different conflicts of views during the tour along the way, but in the process of getting along slowly, using his own personality charm, he also constantly affected Tony."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2020,9/10,"I was initially reluctant to see this as I had assumed that it would be full of the usual Hollywood clichés and tear-jerking tropes and it is not my type of preferred film.However, I was wrong. This film is excellent. The story is strong with no fill, the acting and dialogue are natural and the chief protagonist is likeable.I was surprised that Peter Farrelly was behind this. It goes to show that Hollywood can produce a fine film if they want to."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,10/10,"Green Book is an absolutely beautiful film. It shows tolerance, acceptance and friendship, against all odds, despite all the arguing the main characters are doing. The purest kind of friendship, the unconditional, natural and semi-confrontational. Tony and Don's friendship happens purely out of circumstance, the fact that they are driving many miles on the road together, from state to state. I have heard that this film has gotten a lot of critique, and I'm not sure why. I presume people think it overshadows the deep problems of segregation by having it be a signle man, a musician, who is less affected than most other African-Americans in the deep south at the time. Frankly, I disagree with this complaint. The Jim Crow days of US History spanned not one, but TWO decades, and were wildly complex, I mean, if it wasn't, JFK would have been able to do a lot more than he did. And that's why I don't blame him, nor do I blame this movie. It's impossible to make a heartfelt movie about race and not miss details some people find crucial. I think, to truly enjoy movies like this, one shouldn't nitpick these films, but look at it in regards to the big picture. This movie is instrumental in bringing awareness, as there very well might be people who think like Tony, narrow-minded, but not with the intention of supressing or hurting non-whites. Simply because they don't quite get it. Here, one can get educated through seeing Tony taught lessons as well. All in all, this a wonderful, family friendly, hilarious film with huge societal impact. Recommended for everyone."
GREEN BOOK,11 October 2019,8/10,Excellent movie with engaging characters telling a story of historical significance.A very good story well acted and thought provoking.
GREEN BOOK,15 April 2019,9/10,"In hindsight, the character setting of this film is immediately reminiscent of Les Intouchables, but with positions inverted, namely the black man being the one solicits the service and the white man offering it.Set against the background of 60s in USA, the film approached the racism subject with a different touch. At the beginning of the flick, the Italian-American, working as a bouncer in a night club, was never to think that he would be working for a colored man. As when some repairers of African origin came to his house, his wife called the whole family there in order to guard against the unexpected.His employer, however, offered a quite handsome recompense and even gave a call to his wife to acquire her consent. After setting off for the south, soon the two have had opportunities to get familiar with each other through hours of highway conversation. Trying to help the Italian get rid of his cheesy habits, the pianist meanwhile was endeavoring to persuade him into pursuing a different way of life. Nonetheless, as the film unfolds, many complicated aspects of this sophisticated pianist are to be revealed.Brought up in the environment of high culture, the pianist is certainly with a distinct personality from most of his fellow compatriots. On the other hand, he is also alienated by the mainstream Americans because of his complexion, only with the exception when he is performing on the stage. In want of recognition and companion, the inner self of the pianist actually lived in agony, as was proved by his bursting into roaring confession to his driver while they were rushing through the rainy night.At the end of their journey, the pianist finally stood up for himself by turning down the request of the restaurant where only the white people folks be served. They ducked into a roadside bar and drank with local colored community. Previously in despise of popular music, the pianist even willingly condescended to play for the not-so-educated crowd. The applause that he won from his fellow people is the sign of recognition that he had so long been desiring for.The film has a quite heart-warming ending, where the pianist drove in the place of the fatigued driver and managed to get back to New York at Christmas Eve. The pianist received the invitation and came to greet the Italian's family. As it turned out, the wife had always been aware of the participation of a ghostwriter, but who would care? The friendship of the duo from different race and social class finally melted down the barriers, and made each one of them benefit and grow from the experience. We would be surprised to find that pianist, who was supposed to be the educator among the two, has also gained more spiritual maturity through their relations. In the end, nurture and nature have reached their best reconciliation."
GREEN BOOK,15 April 2021,8/10,"The old adage ""Walk a mile in someone else's shoes"" takes a whole new meaning with this delightful film. It also proves another proverb true, ""To really know someone, travel with them.""
I almost didn't recognize my beloved Viggo, previously cemented as Aragorn in a classic trilogy. But his depiction of Tony Vallelonga in this movie is really memorable, he slides into the role with the same ease as he digs into a bowl of homemade pasta and meatballs. A worldly wisdom, a straightforward honesty, and a strong moral code of a man who grew up in rough streets. Swift with the blunt fists and the sharp words alike.Mahershala Ali as Shirley was also really well played, a man truly lost between worlds, belonging to none, with a blistering genius that only increases his isolation. One truly feels sorry for his self deprecating analysis as a puppet on strings, an erudite carnival showman, a bizarre exhibit surrounded by racism.The lovely message of this movie is the ability of these two men to learn from each other, to embrace each other's world views, and in the end to valiantly rise in friendship and mutual respect. We could all learn from their journey, especially to never underestimate the knowledge and wisdom we can share to become better people.As with any period piece I adored the authentic reproduction of a bygone 'simpler' age steeped in dark racism and hate. The nostalgia of the past is a dangerous thing when it whitewashes what really happened in sundown towns and plantations, even after the civil war. The Green Book is as insidious a piece of literature as Mein Kampf, born from the same cauldron of hate."
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,8/10,"Green book is about an unlikely friendship between two people who are as different as chalk and cheese. It is about humanity, about understanding the other person, being in their shoes and how the simple act of talking to the other person erases all sorts of boundaries. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali slip into the two characters effortlessly, It is a delight to watch the journey of their friendship. Their performances shine and their dynamic with each other is what makes the movie so watchable"
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book has a lot going for it. A story so incredible, it would be hard to believe if it weren't based on real life. Two fantastic actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali giving best performances I've seen from them. (Not that I've seen that much, but I thought the latter was 10 times better here than in Moonlight that got him an Oscar). And Peter Farelli's precise, no frills direction, which I felt was perfect for the story. Parts of it were unavoidably predictable - a black man goes to the deep south in 1962 to perform to all white audiences - bad things are bound to happen. But nearly every predictable episode had a quite unpredictable resolution. And I loved how Tony wasn't just transformed by the extreme racism he witnessed - towards someone he knew and have come to respect, he was also kind of cultured by his overeducated boss. And the fact that Tony was the one who in turn introduced Dr. Shirley, sometimes rather forcefully, to African American music and food was a nice touch."
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2019,9/10,"A compelling movie that fulfils your deepest desires for the protagonists. They are both transformed by the encounter. One aloof and isolated, and the other a product of his environment. Both break their prejudices and become all the happier for it. It's a love story. Two very different men' whose conditioning you would think precludes it, develop a very special thing, a lifelong friendship. Yes, this just a movie, and yes, racism is sadly alive and well. But if this movie encourages just one person to look beyond skin colour and see the person, and love them, then it's been money well spent.
It's a message for our time, don't just tolerate each other. LOVE each other and your life will be transformed."
GREEN BOOK,2 April 2021,10/10,Rarely do I want to watch a movie a second time within a short time but I liked this movie so much that I'm going to watch it again tonight after having just watched it. Great story and great acting.
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,10/10,"Great acting and great story
The relationship between these two very different people is fun to watch. It was an enjoyable film."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2019,10/10,"There is something so extraordinary, about the Friendship between these two characters. Teachers us a valuable lesson, that we could all learn from."
GREEN BOOK,17 June 2019,5/10,"The Greenbook is incredibly uninspired. It's an Average film with a story that contradicts the true events. The acting is solid. The cinematography is textbook, but what holds this film back is the sheer ignorance of those who wrote this script. Overall, it's an average movie that makes an awful attempt at being socially conscious."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,7/10,"There are some over the top reviews saying how great this movie is. It's nothing special, but well worth watching.Everything you probably expect does happen, but they manage to package it beautifully with a few giggles along the way.I was worried the direction would be overally sentimental, but they stay clear of this."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,"What a gem of a film...Both main actors shine throughout. It is such a simple, yet effective true story of an unexpected and also unimaginable friendship between two men, who come from different worlds and cultures. They learn so much from one another, being stuck together in a car, growing in the process. While I watched this movie, I remembered why I fell in love with movies, due to the fact that it managed to capture magic, for what we all go to cinemas in the first place."
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2019,8/10,"Green Book certainly stirred up controversy when it unexpectedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. I personally didn't care as I lost interest in the Oscars completely (these are the people that nominated Black Panther for Best Picture). Certainly is the film in my Top 5 favorites of 2018, not really. That doesn't mean however that Green Book isn't an endearing, enjoyable and above all funny film about friendship and acceptance. The themes of this film have been highlighted around a zillion times in other films such as The Help. However that doesn't mean that the formula is broken. I for one appreciated this films humor, performances and story. A tough Italian brute (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for a new job. He is hired by an African American musician (Mahershala Ali) to drive him through the Southern States in the early 1960s for a tour. The film wisely goes for humor over melodrama which is what sets it apart from all the other films about this topic. Not that the film doesn't have dramatic moments, in fact these are all the more effective because the two main characters were so likeable and funny. Mortensen gave such a heartwarming performance. His character is a brute, he doesn't mind getting physical when someone pisses him off. But his character also expressed such an aura of warmth were the audience simply gravitated towards him. He doesn't understand the racism, he doesn't get the absolute treacherous and human rights violating laws of Jim Crow under which African Americans suffered. However the film wisely never preaches about the privileged white man not knowing the truth, it just shows it, plain and simple. Ali too gave a terrific performance, his character had a sense of sophistication and coolness even in intense situations. It is incredibly heart wrenching to see such a professional guy who lives his passion pushed to his breaking point by his societies' racist rules. Overall there is not much else to say about Green Book. The themes are obvious and the film doesn't attempt to hide it. Mortensen and Ali are terrific and share great chemistry. A heartwarming family film that allows children to have a more sanitized look into America's darkest points of history. No 12 Years A Slave but still a good time."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,7/10,"Preface to this review before I get to the art itself: This movie is problematic in more ways than one. Not only does it act as though it solves racism by the end (by simply suggesting that people not be racist), it also uses the concept of the white savior (an ideal that everyone should research), which is definitely a move that should be disposed of. If you're willing to ignore that idealism (although you shouldn't), there's more than a few redeeming qualities to this movie.Writing/Direction: Who would've thought that the guy who brought the world Dumb and Dumber could deliver such a deft touch? Peter Farrely (Farelly?) gives us a mushy feeling throughout the whole picture and lets us know he's got it under control. Given the fact that the two leads are in a car the whole time, I'm impressed. The writing, while claimed inaccurate by Don Shirley's family, is definitely impressive in that it uses humor in a well-timed way. I will admit that at the end, I did have a warm feeling inside.Performances: Mahershala Ali has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with so few performances; his performance as Don Shirley truly is the heart of the movie and succeeds as such. Viggo Mortensen is the lead actor and can hold his own as well, from eating an entire pizza uncut to going through an impressive body transformation to showing off his ability to once again master an accent. Viggo and Mahershala's chemistry just makes everything better, so thank you for that. Everyone else in the cast was just fine, they clearly knew the callibur of actors they were working alongside and let them do their thing.Other than that, it's a relatively basic movie. Yeah, there's some fancy music and some period-accurate production design, but it's just nothing special. That combined with the issues it has socially makes this an alright piece of filmmaking.Opinion: This did not deserve best picture.Green book is not revolutionary, nor is it entirely bad, but it certainly is funny through and through. (7/10)"
GREEN BOOK,12 April 2020,9/10,"Very good. The story is sweet and ironic.
With racial discrimination as the theme, the traveling performance reflects that no matter how famous black people are, they are not free from unequal treatment.
The protagonist also goes from initially discriminating against blacks to accepting and treating blacks with equal respect.
Overall, the movie is true, ironic and positive!"
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,9/10,"I saw this movie recently and liked it a lot - perhaps you will too. I think it effectively covered a period in our history as a country that was not the best. Nevertheless, it did so with unexpected and unusual insight, humor, tenderness and the birth of a friendship between two men that seems highly unlikely but beautiful in the end."
GREEN BOOK,17 June 2019,10/10,"Viggo Mortensen was incredible as always, it's unbelievable that he is Aragorn he range of acting is incredible."
GREEN BOOK,7 June 2020,10/10,"A journey, a ""dignity"" struggle, the beginning of a lifetime of friendship, The interaction between two people is really the cutest I have ever seen. Only courage can change people's hearts. It's sweet. It's touching. A politically correct story."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,10/10,"This was one of the best movies I've seen this year! It delievered on everything from comedy to drama, and emotion! Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were excellent in both of their roles and deserved Oscar Nominations for Best Actor! Even though this is a story that deals with some very serious subject matter, their is a lot of humor and heart here as well! It's a perfect feel-good movie that the whole movie can enjoy together and I think will certainly win some Oscars this year! One of the best films of 2018 and a must-see!"
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,9/10,Walked out of theatre and thought Viggo should be nominated for award. See on IMDB that be has been nominated for academy award for best actor in leading role. A little surprised that his co-star has more nominations.
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,9/10,Loved this movie all the way through. Viggo Mortensen was brilliant. Hoping for Academy award for him. Has been Nominated for Best Actor.
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,10/10,"""Green Book"" may be a little cliche, but it's execution and Humor is fantastic! Viggo Mortensen's performance is amazing and so is Marhershala Ali's! It's just a really entertaining movie. All 3 Oscars deserved!"
GREEN BOOK,17 July 2019,10/10,"A must see.! I was glued to my seat for two hours. Loved, loved everything about this movie. Definitely deserves the best picture of the year 👏"
GREEN BOOK,19 July 2019,10/10,"The story is quite litteraly a
2 hour incredible journey about two men from completely diffrent backgrounds bonding and taking care of each other. They teach each other diffrent things from their worlds and try to change each other. Sometimes it works, sometimes not and It's funny to see that. They have a lot of ups and down's through the journey but at the end everything works out and they stay friends till death did them apart.Over the course of movie you get to know those 2 characters so well you feel like you know them. You feel for them when something good or bad happens and time to time it's very Emotional.I would recommend this movie to anyone."
GREEN BOOK,23 December 2019,6/10,"I like to think the Oscar's are based on quality of content, but for many years I feel politics has influenced this award. Since the early 2000s african Americans among others have felt like they were under represented in the Oscars. So we have had years where gays won, african americans have won, all seeming to follow years where there was a big deal made by the acting community. Me I am a mindset of I don't care if you are black white purple gay or prefer the company of chickens. That being said I haven't seen all the films nominated for the Oscar's in 2019 but did see roma, Roma was an exceptional film made by a master filmmaker in the style of another master filmmaker. This was a made for tv movie made by the man who gave us dumb and dumber. Don't get me wrong kingpin and Mary are exceptional comedies. But this is not a great filmmaker making a great film. This is an ok director making an ok movie. Nothing special here, which appeals to the masses I guess, but to a film buff I simply am sick of movies getting awards because it's time for a color, gender, or sexual preference to get that award. They should always be based on merit anything else cheapens an award, and gets me to waste 2 hours watching a film that really was not worth watching."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,10/10,"A superb film with two fine actors at the top of their game. Whilst it's subject matter undoubtedly appeals to today's Oscar voters, it is much more than that, it provides two hours of great entertainment. If it fails to win the top Oscars, the system is seriously flawed."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2020,9/10,"The eight-week trip of two people, one black and one white, in the southern United States is like a mirror, reflecting the various social phenomena in the United States in the white supremacy of the 1960s, or the stubborn concept of the deep white American psychology: being kind to black people, It does not mean respect for them."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,9/10,"I an not one to use the word ""heartwarming"" to describe a film I like. A rare film that goes for the heart and succeeds. There are some genuinely laugh out loud moments, the cast are superb and a cracking yarn. A 9 instead of a 10 because the piano playing isn't quite as good as the real thing - listen to the records."
GREEN BOOK,25 January 2019,7/10,"A feel-good movie before anything else, a sweet story with lots of heart. Really wish this kind of a thing would win the Best Picture this year, but it doesn't seem to be in the stars for it. Great chemistry between Ali and Mortensen. Not for cynics.Rating: 7/10"
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,10/10,"Green Book is definitely our most favorite movie of 2018! Both actors deserve Academy Awards, the music fabulous, the message heartwarming & the director did a wonderful job at conveying a beautiful movie. We need more like this instead of constant violence."
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book is as smooth as they come, this film covers a lot of things at once and it does it so seamlessly and effortlessly and the credit for that goes to two amazingly talented leads who shape this film to what it is, an affectionate friendship story, considering that this is based on actual real-life story and how hard is to put together something worth telling without slipping to no man's land of storytelling is amazing in and of itself, but this film doesn't stop there it offers a heartwarming story between seemingly opposite men but deep down they're the same.I gotta say that Viggo Mortensen opposite Mahershala Ali is one of the best lead partnership I've seen in the last couple of years, talk about chemistry and strong presence, they make this story memorable and gripping and convincing as well, they have this special back and forth in dialogue that makes it very enjoyable to watch.Adding to all of that, Green Book is extremely well put together from the directing to the camera work and the writing and it just has that good ol' fashion classic film framework to it and you can't beat that.To put Green Book in a few words, I'd say it's a satisfying story that couldn't be presented in a better way, I absolutely love this film."
GREEN BOOK,7 November 2018,8/10,"The first thing that struck me on watching the movie unfold is how much it follows the structure of France's 2011 buddy flick, The Intouchables. It has all the exact beats: two people from different backgrounds bonding with each over the course of a few months as they learn to mutually change each other's perspective for the better. However, the filmmakers were able to add several other touches to make it stand out as its own unique thing.The movie takes place in 1960s America, still a bit rife with racial tensions. However, the film intends primarily to entertain and delight the audience, so while they do touch upon very significantly on the plight of minorities , the message is conveyed in a way so as to not shock the viewers but rather as a gentle reminder of our torrid history. So overall, this movie is pretty safe to watch and enjoy for any demographic and age. Every member of the family will have a hearty time in the theater."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2020,8/10,"Although the theme is serious, the feeling of the movie is light, humorous and gentle. I like it"
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2020,9/10,"Obviously, this is a movie with almost no flaws. Except for the somewhat clichéd ending, whether it is the plot or the rhythm, this is perfect. I ca n't forget that the hero is sitting in a limousine watching the scene of his tribe working in the wheat field. At this moment you can experience the common emotions of human beings. awesome. Watching this film is a long time ago, and I've revisited it today and it is still comfortable."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,"From the man that has given you comedy gold in the past, what a 180 turn. The story inspired by true events (how true is irrelevant) takes you on a heartwarming jouney of friendship and self discovery. Scripted beautifully the rollercoaster of emotion will make you laugh and cry.Viggo is brilliant in his role as the down and out of luck Italian driver, he gives his character a more than believable warmth. It's that man Mahershala Ali again...gives yet another exceptional performance. His charecter is hilarious and yet humane. Definitely worthy of his second Oscar.Watching how all the script, direction and acting tells this story keeps you engaged and captivated to the very end. Just a great film."
GREEN BOOK,25 August 2019,9/10,It's difficult to decide whether or it's a 9 or 10. The story is absolutely fantastic and the actors are very good.
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,9/10,"Being an obsessed music nerd (especially for THE VERY BEST music ever made from the early 1900's towards the 70's, such as american/british jazz, blues and rocknroll) this movie got my attention and impressed me by default. But then the script, storytelling, actors and the 60's atmosphere were easily added to my overall opinion that this may be one of the most interesting (and important) flicks made in a long long while. The segregation sensmorale was wellmade in the movie, with excellent acting by Viggo and Mahershala. A memorable drama with a heavy splash of timeless music but also some well timed tunes of comic relief."
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,10/10,Put 2 great actors together and you have a winner. A wonderful road movie with exceptional performances. A truly glorious period drama. I enjoyed this movie immensely.
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2021,10/10,Just added this to one of my top ten favourites.Really enjoyable and some fantastic humour.A must watch.
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,6/10,"Nice, entertaining and brilliantly performed by the actors, but why does it give me the feeling that a movie about racism, intolerance, one of the darkest chapters not only in American history but in American Society up to today, shouldn't look like a nice feelgood movie?"
GREEN BOOK,24 October 2019,6/10,"The leading actors were superb in their roles. The scenes involving just Don Shirley and Tony are great. The scenes concerning racial issues and blatant racism seem contrived, cliched and amateurish. I don't see how this film won best picture or best original screenplay."
GREEN BOOK,16 December 2018,7/10,"The review title pretty much says it all...don't get me wrong, the film has a lot going for it - but........SPOILER ALERTHere is the thing - there are two main characters - Don Shirley - a world class concert pianist who basically is the Miss Daisy. Then there is his chauffeur, Tony Lip - the lower class Italian who gets a temporary gig driving Don Shirley around. In the course of their road trip, the two interact and wind up changing each other - sound familiar?So the movie alternates between serious scenes and more whimsical scenes. The thing is - Don Shirley comes across almost like Sheldon in Big Bang Theory with times of extreme arrogance and needing things to be just right during the whimsical moments. Really, if you are a fan of Big Bang Theory, you will see echos of Sheldon and it is distracting as all get out.The movie becomes serious when it talks about race relations in the 60's in the US. Don Shirley is a highly talented black person in an environment where a black is expected to be uneducated and eating fried chicken - like Hidden Figures, it becomes necessary to break that stereotype. These scenes are powerful and meaningful - but we have the same sort of conflicts we have seen in Hidden Figures and The Help - basically black people trying to do things like use the bathroom, eat in certain restaurants and stay in certain motels (the title - Green Book - refers to a guide to establishments that allow black people to use their establishments). OK - I get it - this was actually the way things were and it is an easy way cinematic way to bring the discrimination up the but this is getting well tread.And as I write this - it becomes obvious that I don't talk about Tony Lip much. He is really a foil for Don Shirley - but taking that out - he is a stereotypical uneducated Italian - hooked up with the mob apparently, smokes and drinks, and will throw a punch in nothing flat.At the end of the day - OK - we got a necessary history lesson about race relations in the Sixties...with well acted performances to be sure - but it is still a largely formula buddy/road film. Certainly worth a look, but don't expect too much you haven't seen before or new if you are familiar with race relations in the Sixties...."
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2020,9/10,"Some wanted this to be a lot more critical and biting so the critic it badly.
For me it was a character based movie telling the story of friendship. For me it achieved what it set out to do. If you just watch with a clean bias you will love it. If you insist expecting it to be something it never asked to be you will indeed be disappointed."
GREEN BOOK,29 January 2019,8/10,What a very nice and moving film. Viggo Mortensen shines in this movie. And maybe he deserves the Oscar for his role. You can tell the film was made with a lot of love for the story. Inequality treated with dignity. Well played.
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2020,9/10,Thoroughly recommend this movie. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are absolutely superb! To find out more about how good this movie is... just watch it! 😊
GREEN BOOK,5 April 2019,10/10,I normaly avoid Viggos movies. But he was great in this film. It is by far the best film I have seen in a very long time.
GREEN BOOK,22 April 2019,9/10,"Green Book is one of the best road movies in a long while. We have seen a lot of films that deal with ""the Afro-American experience"" in the last decade, some of which have been highlighted by various awards. But Green Book goes beyond them, because it covers the diasporic standpoint not just from an Afro-American perspective, but also suggests that white Americans have a cast system between them as well. As we see in the film, Italian-American, as opposed to Irish-American, British- American or German-American, is the black of the white race. This is where the chemistry between Tony Lip and Doc Shirley is formed; Shirley is a black man who lives by the white standards and cultural values, but as we see later; he has been through a lot, he has experienced what being Afro-American means in this country, although buried deep; he still knows his roots. But he has ""whitened"" himself to fit the society; and in Tony Lip, he sees himself, and Italian-American, not much different than himself, the only difference is, Tony does not care to hide his true identity and Shirley learns from him throughout the film.Viggo Mortensen and Marshala Ali have a chemistry beyond words. They brilliantly convey the brotherhoodly bond between the characters to the audience.Except for a few minor plotholes, this film is amazing."
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2020,6/10,"After seeing a thousand movies ""Green book"" feels a sympathetic road movie, but only comparing it with fantasy and scifi-trash that the film industry today consists of. It is an OK film with surprise ending that is not very surprising. Personally the idea of selecting Viggo Mortensen to play italian is controversial choice when his aspect is not full-blooded: the same issue was when he played (jewish) Sigmund Freud a couple years ago.
Maybe in 2018 there was no available ""One flew over cuckoo's nest"" or ""Deer hunter"" so the Oscar academy decided to celebrate ""Green book"" as best picture. I don't know. I have to check other candidates."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"After I watched this the first thing I thought of was the Oscars. Both Viggo and Ali should win Oscars and then the movie itself should win and probably several other categories. I've been waiting for a Viggo performance like this ever since the Lord of the Rings. What makes this even more interesting is the fact that it is a true story. Viggo was so great that I forgot during the movie that it was Viggo. And Ali was so powerful that I hung on his every word. It's moving, touching, real life, and powerful. I found myself laughing so hard sometimes I was crying, not that it was funny like a comedy, but it was humor that can only come from real life and real moments. Amazing movie. Solid 10. Might be the best movie I've ever seen.(I don't include LOTR because that's a whole different thing and I don't compare any movie to that)."
GREEN BOOK,8 January 2019,8/10,Went into this film not knowing anything about the storyline - Brilliant performances by the 2 leads - Strong storyline about a road trip to Deep South USA and the racial tensions at the time - Great film which develops along the trip - Worth a view
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,9/10,"Just seen this at a secret screening. Had heard a bit about it before. Wasn't too sure what to expect. Based on a true story about a friendship forming between two unlikely one people. Loved it. Made me laugh, cry, cringe at how coloured people were treated in the 50s. Loved the acting. Wait around for the credits as they tell you a bit more about them and photos of them both. Well worth a watch when it's out"
GREEN BOOK,27 May 2019,8/10,"First of all, I liked the story, because it's a story of a wonderful journey of a driver and a pianist and the wonderful friendship between them. Then, it's a story of two changing person who became good friends after the half journey. I have never seen such a touching story of a wonderful journey and a wonderful friendship.You must see this wonderful film which is based on a true story."
GREEN BOOK,1 May 2019,8/10,Pretty good movie based on real life events. It was deep funny and well put together
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2019,10/10,Where to begin. Stunning cast. Stunning screenplay. Felt like i was swept back to the late 60s. Eaisly one of the best bios of a man ive seen in years. Absoulety stunning
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,8/10,"The sort of movie you can settle into and really enjoy. Was glad when I heard it won best picture.
A few things pushed the boundaries of believability e.g. the way the driver does such an about turn in his racist views when he through away glasses black men had drunk from at the start to throwing open his home to him at the end. Also it was not believable that the classical pianist immediately and spontaneously became a jazz bar/ popular music player in the bar. Also how he suddenly gets a life long passion for fried chicken after not even wanting to touch it at first.
But you can overlook all that and just enjoy. Vigor was unrecognisable to me all through the film even though I'd earlier read that he was in it - a real body transformation!"
GREEN BOOK,9 November 2021,10/10,"No doubt that this movie was nominated for Best Picture and eventually won it. The screenplay is really very strong and captivating, didn't bored at once.Mahershala Ali's best performance ever is seen. Can't understand why only 8.2, clearly deserves >8.5."
GREEN BOOK,16 September 2020,10/10,"Biopic of Dr Don Shirley & his driver Tony Vallelonga on the Shirley Trio's tour through the midwest & deep south. A well written, acted & filmed piece. Well worth watching. The music will bring calm to your soul. The pacing was spot on allowing for development of the relationship between our main characters. You will find yourself feeling the full gamut of emotions. The movie is especially relevant to these times."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,8/10,"Unbelievable. It's only 60 years ago that people in the US south were so ignorant and biased.
But are we better today? Would you let a muslim date your daughter?
Will we ever learn that all humans are equal?
Movies like this one helps. But why does it take a movie to show people, that all people are people?"
GREEN BOOK,22 September 2018,9/10,"Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does."
GREEN BOOK,5 July 2019,7/10,Synopsis: A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2020,10/10,"Friendship,family but most importantly understanding, everyone should watch this movie, a very honest depiction"
GREEN BOOK,2 May 2020,8/10,"And the world is complicated, even narrow and indifferent often more common than tolerance and warmth, but it is those few warm moments that make us believe that life is worth loving."
GREEN BOOK,14 August 2021,9/10,"A great story is buoyed by fabulous acting, some terrific situational drama, and just the right amount of hilarious malapropisms. GB is comical and heartbreaking, occasionally in the same moment. It perpetuates certain stereotypes while turning others on their head, all the while showing a humanity that inherently lies underneath them all."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,10/10,"We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"
GREEN BOOK,14 April 2019,8/10,"This film has gotten a lot of bad press from the historical inaccuracies to it's controversial win for Best Picture-I have to admit I did buy into some of that press. Despite that however, the audience reaction seemed to be very positive (at least in Japan)-several of my friends recommended the film to me. So, with slightly low expectationsI I finally watched the film last night-it was pretty good. The performances (especially by Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, and Linda Cardellini) were wonderful, the story was very heartwarming, and the music (both the score and soundtrack) were solid. Was it worth the Best Picture? Not really, far from the best, but I don't think it was an outrageous decision either. One of the controversies was the depiction of race- such example is apparent when Don Shirley, a high-brow black man embraces the low class stereotypes in the latter half of the film. I personally thought it worked in the film because the friendship and trust between the Tony Lip and Don Shirley changed the two men-both embracing something new. It's a typical buddy, road trip movie, not a historical epic like 12 years a slave or The Color Purple. Some critics and haters called this Driving Miss Daisy 2, I completely disagree because it does this film does provide a fresh take (A white working class man chauffeuring a black and gay musician) on the Roadtrip genre. It's worth the watch!"
GREEN BOOK,10 November 2018,9/10,"I just enjoyed a preview screening of ""Green Book,"" a heartwarming family film scheduled to release over the Thanksgiving holiday. Green Book is based on a true story about a black concert pianist (played by Mahershala Ali) who tours the American Deep South in the early 1960's, and takes along a rough-and-tumble Italian bar bouncer as his driver/fixer (played by Viggo Mortensen). The driver begins the tour as a northern racist who takes the eight week assignment because he needs quick cash, while the pianist starts the tour as a lonely and pompous prick unable to fully navigate the white world where his music is highly valued, and equally uncomfortable in black-America. Through the film we see the two characters find each other and themselves as they subtly bond, and we feel the connection as a real friendship blossoms. The title of the film comes from a once essential tour book that listed hotels and other businesses willing to serve black customers, in an era when American blacks were legally equal to whites but discrimination remained grossly overt. I was fortunate to see Green Book at Dartmouth College in a packed 237 seat theater with an audience that responded well to the drama and humor, and to the empathy developing on-screen. Green Book is a well-crafted PG-13 film that pulled excellent reviews in festival showings, and tells an important story in a touching way. The film shines a light on an ugly part of American history, and offers hope that by connecting with diverse characters and lives we can overcome our divisions. It's a wonderful story that perfectly fits our present times, and it needs to be shared."
GREEN BOOK,20 December 2018,,"This film has some entertaining moments. It touched upon some important points, and the overall tone is fairly light. The production design and music are both outstanding in this film.Here's what is disappointing: it seems that the Director and writers did not do due dilligence to make sure it would be a fairly accurate representation of Don Shirley. Recently, there have been complaints issued by several members of Shirley's family. They were not contacted for their contribution or their approval. Because Shirley was a private man, there are certain unknowns about his relationships. To go further, there seems to be strikingly different views on the relationship between Don Shirley and Tony ""Lip"" --- was their bond of friendship genuine, as the film presents? Or did this film take measures to pump-up-the-volume, to serve it's own interests? Others viewers might ask: why would a director or writer proceed with a project without making sincere efforts to communicate with surviving members of Shirley's family?Lovely cast, although Mortensen (an outstanding actor) gave a over-the-top (sometimes cartoonish) delivery of a Bronx tough-guy with a soft heart. Mahershala (another very apt actor) was fully committed, but after seeing an online video of the ""REAL Don Shirley"", I have to wonder if Ali researched the persona of Shirley. The actor recently offered an apology to Shirley's family members, but if this project had been vetted out, some of these mishaps could have been avoided."
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,9/10,"This movie is incredible. I should end the review right there, truthfully the message is golden, the acting is superb, the musical score was phenomenal. I'm not just talking about Ali's piano playing, I'm talking about even the subtle music when the freindship was expanding. It was a visually beautiful and wonderfully done film. I would give it a 10, but apparently there were inconsistencies to real life...but honestly, the message still rings true. No matter what color/sexual preference/ economic status you are, you can always learn something from the someone you weren't expecting. I loved the movie
9.5"
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,"This is not just a story of racism and suffering but also of evolution through friendship. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Tony Lip was not only hugely refreshing, it was also one from which many people can learn a lot from. I don't want to say more about Mahershala Ali because he's just too amazing to comment about.A simple Italian-American whose life revolved around family and friends in the neighbourhood embarks on a journey with an African-American celebrity musician and the two start learning a bit more about life from each others struggles and values. One of simplicity and love and the other of maintaining dignity through suffering from racial discrimination.It is not a sad movie, it was super fun to watch while also emotional when you see how even a celebrity musician used to be treated like dirt in none other than the land of freedom.A must watch for everyone."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,9/10,"Well written and acted, the film dealt with an historical (?) issue very well and sympathetically. Superb performances from Mortensen and Ali which highlighted outdated views superbly.
Well worth a watch and probably it's Oscar for best Film - just not sure why every film has to be 2 hours plus long these days, this could have been done in 90 minutes"
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2019,8/10,"The title refers to a travel guide used by African-Americans during the time of segregation to find safe, friendly hotels and restaurants from 1937 to 1966. In 1962, African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) employed Frank Vallelonga, aka ""Tony Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen) to be his driver and bodyguard when his trio, which included George (Mike Hatton) on the upright bass and Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov) on the cello, toured the American Midwest and South. Shirley suffers many indignities, and, to a certain extent, Tony can shield him. For example, the trio is employed at a country club in Alabama, but Shirley cannot eat in its restaurant so he and Tony find a BBQ restaurant down the road. Other complications are that Shirley is gay and an alcoholic. The two men bond, of course. One of the funnier scenes takes place when Tony serves Shirley friend chicken without utensils, which Shirley initially refuses because he is a fastidious eater. Overall, this is the feel-good movie of the year, although predictable and rather old-fashioned, and the two leads are excellent with able support by Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife. One reviewer described the movie as ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"". It was based on a true story, and Tony's son Nick co-wrote the screenplay, which won the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category. Unfortunately, it has been a controversial winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, because many people felt that it oversimplified race relations in the United States and members of Shirley's family have objected to his portrayal."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,8/10,"Peter Farrelly, who is mostly associated with his quirky, slightly offensive comedy and romantic comedy films that he usually directs with his fellow brother - Bobby, such as Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, makes a solo heartfelt, pragmatic and humanistic direction (that marks a stark contrast of his directions on the comedy) while tackling down difficult subject matters of racism into the filmmaking, making it as relevant to the today's divisive political background and at the same time, blending well with comedy into the narrative.While the story is nothing short but meaningful, compelling, nuanced, and thought-provoking, it also resembled some similarity to Driving Miss Daisy, in which the narrative of a black driving for the white is now role-reversed with a white driving for the black, which is somehow problematic but is nevertheless outright entertaining. Furthermore, its display of an unconventional friendship between a black and white is also convincing.But what truly serves as the film's shining quality was of the exceptional, charismatic and superb performances, and chemistry of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in their performances of Tony Lip and Don Shirley, both of which really nailed the perfectly comedic timing as well as the earthly dramatic performances in every scene of which they dominate and can be summed up as a total knockout.Yet, the film can't be described as truly perfect as it has its share of flaws, most particularly into the story's blatant historical inaccuracies, which focused onto the relationship of Shirley to his family and to Tony Lip that were being misinterpreted into the translation to the film, as well as its perceived white savior narrative. In addition, the story is also predictable especially to the third act. Other issues that plagued this film is mostly focused onto the pacing that can be uneven and quite dragging as well the editing which also looks uninteresting and cliched.Still, the film is yet worth watching and makes it as an heartfelt and entertaining experience especially to any group of friends that can relate to its story and is no doubt serves as one of the best films of 2018."
GREEN BOOK,25 January 2019,8/10,"It is possible to analyze ""Green Book"" from some points of view. It's a film about racism. But it's also a road movie that talks about an unimaginable friendship. It is also a film that shakes the prejudice of deep America, especially the South of the United States. It is still a film about a character who is not in any environment because he is in the rare position of the privileged black and feels a deep loneliness for it. None of this is original. None of this is something that other movies have not talked about in movie history. But how delightful, bothersome and interesting is to follow the journey of pianist Don Shirley (a brilliant Mahershala Ali) and his driver and captain Tony Vallelonga (equally wonderful).Particularly, ""Green Book"" has more interesting in two of the points above. The first is such an improbable relationship between Tony, this brassy, simple-minded Italian who sees the world so bluntly and directly, separating people into tribes with their own ingrained and unmixed customs, and Shirley, a black man of erudite education, who lives as an isolated king at the top of Carnegie Hall. And it's amazing that even in such ignorance he made Shirley see how far he was from himself.The story of Peter Farrelly's film is real. In fact in the 1960s, Shirley was a very popular pianist who decided to tour the most racist chants in America. Your objective is touching people's hearts.But how difficult it is to break historic and archaic barriers. Shirley has to go through some ridiculous situations. At night, he is a brilliant pianist applauded by all white and wealthy audiences. But during the day it's just another black man who can not eat at the same restaurant in his audience or use the same bathroom.As much as the film does not portray the hell it was to be a black man in that region, and its name comes from a survival guide there, it's still cruel, almost disgusting to anyone who sees everything that Shirley has to go through to keep the idea of your tour alive. It is important, however, as the character himself states, ""maintain dignity"". Only by dignity is overcome the rabid prejudice.But ""Green Book"" is not only about the pure denunciation of racism in a region of America. It is in the hassle and distance that Shirley himself feels among his peers that the film exposes his signs of greatness. It is by showing that he is not black enough to be among his own, neither white nor man enough to occupy other groups, that ""Green Book"" exposes the terrible loneliness of a man who finds himself in the middle of the path of a triangle over which he does not have the skills, or the supposed qualities, necessary to occupy no vertex.In a fragmented society that needs labels Shirley is never to be found. It connects to nothing and feels isolated in all environments. His most faithful companion is a carafe of expensive alcohol, which keeps him away from everyone and plunged even more into solitude.Who are your peers? It is not whites who hate him when he is off the stage and deny him the right to experience a suit in a shop. It is not the black people, with whom he does not connect precisely because he does not share the same rich but different culture from his classical piano education, and by wearing expensive, well-cut suits.For him, approaching both sides requires an instrument of conciliation for music. Hence his tour trying to repeat something similar that Nat King Cole tried a decade earlier. Its purpose is to touch the hearts of the people and to approach the vertices so far apart appealing to the sense of humanity. To perhaps feel less alone. But also help change the society.The work, however, is slow and gradual. And in the great friendship that Shirley builds with Tony, a man who shows himself to be racist at the beginning of the film, but whose friendship and partnership with Shirley grows throughout the tour, is that his success can make itself present.""Green Book"" relies heavily on the excellent work of Ali and Mortensen. It's not by chance that both have received well-deserved Oscar nominations. The first one proves the excellent moment that is living two years after receiving the supporting statuette for ""Moonlight"" (2016). His work on the third season of ""True Detective"" also deserves praise. The second is an actor who is in his third Oscar nomination and almost always does good work.But beyond that, it is a great story and so necessary to be told in times when racism and prejudice in general against various kinds of peoples, ethnicities, sexual orientations and religions are unfortunately so vivid. They are wounds that still bleed too much when one should work to build a more just and balanced society for all. If each sought to create bridges such as those that united Shirley and Tony, it might be a less lonely, richer and more interesting planet to live for all."
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,8/10,"I went into the cinema for 10 minutes and saw a lot of people leaving. I thought the movie was definitely not good, but to my surprise, the film was not bad. Maybe the film was opened for more than 10 minutes. Character has been laying the ground for too long.
The Green Book is a distinctive road movie. I never imagined that a black people affirmative film would be conceived from the perspective of road movies. The road movies have a strong characteristic as narrating a story.
The emotional relationship between characters becomes strong with the increase of mileage, and the personality of the characters is clearly revealed with the increase of mileage. Dr.Don Shirley and Tony Lip are gradually becoming friends on their road of tour.
Some people think that road movies are very simple, because the clues are clear and the narrative is simple. Just make clear what is happening on the road. In fact, road movies are the easiest to become a self-speaking film without any focus. In fact, this movie has not completely escaped this threat. It is true that there is a constant episode in the film on the road, showing the relationship between the two, and then Tony understands Don's practice for him to come forward. But after all, there is no major outbreak, and the whole story lacks a core chapter. Several equally important chapters have made the film without any major ups and downs."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,9/10,"I already said in one of my previous reviews that this was fixing up to be a great year for cinema lovers. And so far, it has lived up to expectations. Not only has the output of movies been great, but it also seems that the Academy heads this year have made a sensible selection; this movie having been included in the category for best film of the year. Academy accolades aside, this a truly remarkable film, especially coming from a director, Peter Farelly, who, so far, has specialised in the comedy genre.
This is a huge departure from his previous body of work and it shows that, given the right script and the right assemble of actors, he can be a huge game changer when it comes to telling heartwarming stories about flawed, but ultimately, good-hearted characters. Beautifully shot ( the production design is especially remarkable) , written and acted ( Viggo Mortensen surprises once again in one of his most nuanced performances to date and Marhershala Ali delivers another strong performance, in what it's turning out to be an outstanding acting career), this is truly one of the best movies l've seen this year, and unlike so many others Oscar winning movies, one that is destined to live long in the memory of its audience. This is not your ""run of the mill"" Oscar bait movie. This is a solid, very well put together movie that will make you think. And that's what movie going is all about."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,10/10,"Wow! What an amazing movie. My expectations going into the theater was oh great it's going to be Another cliche Oscar film, where all white people are bad..yadda yadda yadda.. well to my surprise it totally wasnt! It was an open minded approach to the race situation today. Showing that (gasp) not all white people are bad!! The message was driven into my head but I was happy about it it had a positive spin to it. The acting was supreme! Really! This movie shows that there is still hope in today's left-driven liberal Hollywood! Watch it you won't regret it!"
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,10/10,I simply adored this movie.. a really beautiful story told by two exeptional actors. I know it's a dark horse for the Oscars but I would be surprised if it sweeped the board. Wonderful film..
GREEN BOOK,2 April 2020,7/10,"The two men, whose skin color, class, personality and orientation are so different, became acquainted with music and became friends for life became of road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough. It takes courage to push down the wall in my heart to open the door. The film is like a small green pebble, plunged into black and white American society, and stirs up small and beautiful ripples.
I like this movie."
GREEN BOOK,11 December 2019,5/10,"One of the most overrated films I have seen. I saw it when it came out and was shocked by the Oscars. Did we see the same film? I mean, it's okay and fairly enjoyable for a simple, feel good sort of movie. But the actors are not believable at all, I'm aware they are ""acting"", the script is silly at times, and at no time did I get lost in the story. It felt more like a made for TV type of film. It's enjoyable and easy to watch and a lovely little story line but best picture? Seriously? And while Mahershala Ali deserved the Oscar for Moonlight (a stunning film) this win was a real stretch. He was not believable in this role and the dialogue was eye rolling worthy at times. Not his fault, he did the best he could with it. He's a great actor but I just felt the film was too shallow and trying too hard in the ""feel good"" department. I enjoyed it but compared to The Godfather? Gimme a break on the 10 stars lol. It wasn't the best year for movies so I can forgive the Oscar (my personal pick was The Favourite) but this is one seriously overrated film."
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,9/10,Haven't seen this movie. But Oscar gave Get Out a statue like it was selling girl scout cookies. Well done Green Book.
GREEN BOOK,4 November 2019,9/10,"It's such a nice movie. Very well played characters. Very meaningful dialogues. In the world of so many nonsense action and drama movies, this is a true gem.
I strongly recommend it."
GREEN BOOK,4 September 2021,9/10,"This tale of a NY Italian hired to drive a black concert pianist to various venues through the Deep South is a fictionalised version of a true story - and it could not have been better played nor better cast. What a terrible shame for Viggo Mortensen that he was faced with Rami Malek's stellar performance as Freddie Mercury at the Oscars in 2019 (for 2018), otherwise he surely would have won. This delightfully told but disturbing film makes the viewer's skin crawl at the inexpressibly inhuman attitudes of the White residents of the Deep South - how could anything so intolerable have existed in living memory?I have no doubt I shall watch this film many times in the future - it is beautifully played and wonderfully written.A MUST SEE film."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,10/10,"Please Hollywood, make more of these movies
Great perfomances, nice humor, excellent music, well-written, well-directed.
Everything aovie should have."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,9/10,"As far as on the road, buddy movies go, I'd say Green Book is my new favourite. This was marvellously directed by Peter Farrelly in his first solo venture, apart from his brother Bobby. The movie, though it has some good laughs in it, is clearly more of a dramatic movie and Peter Farelly's first one in his career. I guess he knows how to do great drama too! The performances were stellar. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are terrific together and have a great chemistry in this. The musical scenes were tremendously performed by Mahershala Ali and on top of that the score was great too. For a movie about race and prejudice in the early 60's south it will undoubtedly win you over with its heartwarming touch. Funny and dramatic. This is a great holiday movie. 9/10"
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"This movie is probbably the best movie I have seen in the past few years
Such a beautiful movie that brought me to tears.
Movie about friendship, love and the rascism in late 50s
Im happy this movie exists
Well deserved for winning an Oscar"
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2021,10/10,"With the way the states are moving and with racial tensions as high as they are this movie brings to the screen, an update/continuation ""In the Heat of the Night"" with an element of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", it's a marvellous movie, poignant and absolutely contemporary in it's telling, a joy from the beginning to it's wonderful end."
GREEN BOOK,31 May 2020,8/10,"Dis Movie is Very Heart Touching, Emotional nd it explains hw hate can turn into Love & become Good Frnds. This Movie Deserves an Academy Award. Screenplay is Clean."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,9/10,"Beautiful story, outstanding production of this picture and Masterful performances from both leads.
With all the substance and seriousness of the subject of this movie, it's so light on the audience and watching it is a pleasure. Bravo!"
GREEN BOOK,19 September 2019,8/10,"An Italian-American bouncer takes up the job of driving an African-American pianist on a 2 month tour in the 1960's of America's South.
This is essentially a buddy road movie bringing to mind Midnight Run (1988) and Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987). Two opposites are placed together and we witness conflict and humour and two characters growing together. So the template is set and it largely follows true as you'd expect.
What make this different is the setting. No matter what is going on there is the palpable racial tension and real threat that could dissolve this affable caper into something altogether more heinous.
This makes it more worthy, in an actual sense and that of the Oscars. This would also be my main criticism of the movie. It feels too crowd pleasing when it could have laboured further on the fight for civil rights.
Viggo Morensen and Mahershala Ali are superb and entirely convincing. Their characters evolve and grow credibly. Linda Cardellini, who i feel is underrated provides an anchor to the story and is excellent.
It's beautifully shot, as a road movie in the south should be. The period element isn't laboured beyond the opening scenes of Tony Lip in his bouncer role but is quietly effective. The soundtrack is top drawer combining Aretha Franklin, Chubby Checker etc with the very interesting, classically influenced, jazz stylings of Dr. Donald Shirley's trio.
Tonally it's hard to argue with, shifting gear effortlessly and it really is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud nearly every time they went for the comedic schtick.
For me it hasn't got the heft of an Oscar winning movie or the uniqueness and magic of e.g. its predecessor The Shape of Water (2017) but it will be timeless, pleasing and important enough to be looked upon with fondness. EIGHT"
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2019,10/10,"I loved everything about this movie. Not the usual redemption story and not the common ""let's grow together"" movie you may have warched before. Firstly and mostly, it's just a very well told story. No matter where do you come from, and what is your background, you can see this movie and enjoy 99.9% of it. Just with a notch of comedy when necessary, inherently charming acting of Viggo, fantastic acting of Maharshala, for which they both received the Oscar nomination, and Maharshala won it for the second time after Moonlight.
It's such an easy movie to watch, and such an easy one to love. Let alone the cinematography and the expected beautiful landscapes when driving in American roads.
I don't completely get the frustration of some film critiques, from not a very trained eye's perspective, it's a complete movie. And isn't what most movies should be about?Notice the details in the movie, most of which are perfected meticulously. The influence of both main characters on each other that comes from respect, or plain situational necessity, is remarkable. Both characters are vastly different from each other, and I'd assume from people like me. What keeps the audience's focus in tact is for sure the universal values they share. Both of them. Reminding us, no matter the difference in backgrounds, values can be the same and used as infrastructure of relationships, growth, and in some cases prosper.
I'm trying to stay out of spoils, but may I be excused to mention the farm scene? Reminding me once again, that what may lead to a certain race being/staying in a certain class of society.How prejudice can cause problems all around. It's not just one race towards another. I'm in a place in my life that I'd appreciate the globalization and interracial understandings and relations.All in all, I'd watch this movie again, I love the music in it from the very first scene. I love how the story is told in a soft way. I love how Mahaeshala and Bowers worked together to create all the Piano scenes, which to be honest, is so cool. I love how the amount of redemption in the movie is not that big to be interpreted as excessive or emotionally surprising, yet not that small to omit its significance. I just love that this movie has people who do good and the ones who do bad. To me it's just real!
How Dr. Shirley tries to impact the society with his music knowing the obstacles is another great interest of mine. I love a good struggle when I see it, and I loved this one."
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,8/10,"I saw Green Book today and was thoroughly entertained. The outcome is predictable, but the journey getting there is heartfelt. It is by turns dramatic, funny, touching and scary - as in how people were treated in the south in 1962. Last time I saw the horror of it on screen was in The Help.
Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali both give award worthy performances. In fact, I read that Viggo won best actor, and the movie was named best picture by National Board of Review.
It is a riveting portrait of how two disparate men found a bond that lasted a lifetime.
And the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more poignant."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,10/10,"In this biography, comedy, drama film directed by Peter Farrelly (There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber) and written by Nick Vallelonga (Vigilante Diaries, I Am Wrath), Brian Hayes Currie (Armageddon, Con Air) and Peter Farrelly, Viggo Mortenson (The Lord of the Rings, A History of Violence) and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, Hidden Figures) star as Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley, a musical virtuoso.On an enforced leave of absence from his normal job as a tough bouncer at the Copacabana Club, Tony Lip needs to find gameful employment and, after some reservations which includes leaving his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini: Brokeback Mountain, TVs ER), agrees to accompany the American classical pianist on his concert tour of the Deep South states using The Negro Motorist Green Book for places to stay due to racial segregation.The erudite but snobbish Dr. Shirley clashes with the crude yet practical Tony, their ideals and attitudes to life are at odds but as they travel they come to see the value in and respect for each others' talents.Inspired by true events, this is a powerful story about friendship that transcends barriers and shows us what it means to be truly human. Teaching us to put aside what others tell you, what you are told to believe and really see a person through their actions, words and thoughts. Difference should not be an issue and in this world that is more divided than ever (e.g. Brexit), we can all learn a lot through the honest friendship of these two men. The world should not have needed a green book, but I am hopeful that this film can teach us to not need anything like it again.The acting was superb and solid scriptwriting, the film has so many layers I feel like I could watch it again and again.You can tell that the film is based on a real friendship as it never feels contrived and the viewer goes on their journey with them. It truly shows you that friendship should transcend who or what you think or others think you are and the nuanced and poignant performances given by Ali and Mortenson show us that despite social complications, every human wants and needs the same thing, love and acceptance.The cinema was almost full and at the end of the film, some of the audience broke out into spontaneous clapping. I have never understood that as the writer, director or actors are not there, but I get that people wanted to show their appreciation for how good they thought the film was in some tangible way.I have been to see The Favourite, Stan and Ollie and Bohemian Rhapsody as well as Green Book this year and I think Green Book is the best movie in this group and deserves to win an Oscar the most."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2020,10/10,"You know what the story is about, and you know what the journey is about. You understand that it doesn't touch anything too profound, but it also shows a lot of frankness, and you understand that identity is something everyone can't avoid, and how hard it is to understand each other. You will naturally like the characters that are not so well described as real people, and you will laugh at the funny or not so funny bits. It may also be that laughter is used as a first response to neutralize or hide other feelings. You know the story doesn't have much to do with the title of the green book, and you probably didn't think you'd like it."
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,10/10,"Viggo makes a character good at heart. Even in his violent scenes, the anger is understandable. As a history lesson for the way it was, it took men like this to push the envelope. Like when Howard Zinn went down south to teach at an all black girls school. Viggo sees the bigotry in his fellow whites and crushes it where he can, he's a good example for anyone that cares, IMHO. Great movie. Lawson di Ransom Canyon"
GREEN BOOK,28 March 2020,9/10,"OK. Now I didn't like the piano playing much.However, it didn't make the film flowery, it didn't demean the character of a gentleman, in both their interpretations.I also read the family of Donald Shirley were not consulted on the film,man's, of course, the film doesn't tell the true story of the  DS had to go through. If it helps, I can 0nly say to please not think he has been compromised.It also taught me that a Green Book exists. Like seriously? And sundown towns? Jesus, you Americans are up. And still today you do this to people because of colour? You only show how scared you are about your disempowerment.It's an interesting film. Of relationships of empowerment. These gentlemen are presenting their differences with honour, together. Not a black man at the mercy of a white guy. They needed each other. To the family of DS, honestly, he is presented as an extraordinary educated gentleman.And living on top of Carnegie Hall? Wow. i used to live on top of a room of a swanky pub. That was cool at the time. That's about it.Movies are never real, more bromides to allay our reality of compromise in cages. But humanity is learning. Now if only I could find someone who wanted to do a film on the true disempowerment of money, and how it leads to disempowering discrimination like this.That last scene in Birmingham is awesome. Those whities were such losers.How people think power is built on compromise, segregation, and dominion are pathetic.PS (at the risk of DS's critique of such a format of writing), I really hope Viggo didn't really put on so much weight for his role."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,10/10,"I like a film that entertains with comedy and drama. This film has a good message about race problems in the '60's, and what people were subjected to. Everything about this film is perfect. Great cast that deserve recognition, and a story line with educational value. Please see this film when you get a chance. It's not boring, and your family can see it as well. Just not young children, but 12 and older perhaps"
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,8/10,Really enjoyed watching. Beautifully told true story. Good pace. Emotive and captivating. And of course fantastic cast and acting. Oscar winner!
GREEN BOOK,24 May 2019,8/10,"The film is good in all respects, a representative performance of all major actors especially the main duo We have missed films that address the issue of racism in comic ways, What only hurts is the length of dialogues that can be shorter

GREEN BOOK,14 November 2020,7/10,Pretty decent movie and there are laughable moments throughout which is great. I think the director had made the whole apartheid topic less heavy and focussed on the friendship between Shirley and Vallelonga. A really good Saturday night movie.
GREEN BOOK,12 October 2018,9/10,"Just caught this as the surprise film of the London Film Festival. Such a well written drama with heart, soul and comedic touches, brilliantly performed by the two main actors, and given such an authentic 1962 shiny look to the film by the production designer and cinematographer.
A truly great true story with themes that all audiences can connect with - namely, music, family, race, sexuality, friendship and love - and Viggo Mortensen probably gives the performance of a lifetime. Will surely rival A Star is Born at the Oscars in many of the same categories."
GREEN BOOK,4 April 2020,6/10,Generlly it is not silly despite it Is based on true story i saw it and enjoyed it so much i loved the lesson a lot and how can the person who you work with or friend will change your behaves for better with two main characters. Dignity 'pride' this two words you can shortcut it with this film.
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2021,6/10,"I feel like I have seen this many times before.Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful story that stands at a pivotal point in race relations in the United States in the 60s, yet it doesn't make you think too much.You know who the good and the bad guys are it's been told many times over, yet this film is definitely still worth a watch."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2020,5/10,"It is never directly spelled out but certainly heavily implied:Tony Lip: ""Hey Doc, we're both marginalized - me because I am not highly educated and you because you're discriminated against and have to fear for your life just because of the colour of your skin. EMPATHY! Oh, and I am not racist because I have a black friend."""
GREEN BOOK,8 August 2019,9/10,"Thought this would be a good one already, but was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed it.
Masterful performances by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Brilliant chemistry between the two actors really drove the show with wonderful subtleties in the acting style of Ali especially. A beautiful tale of not only healing racial divides but particularly a profound story of two clashing personality types learning from each other."
GREEN BOOK,26 April 2019,10/10,"I was skeptical when my wife raved about Green Book , but I do like Viggo Mortensen and Linda Cardellini. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was astonished at the no frills, matter of fact style of a story that it told about a courageous black musician and a rough around the edges sweetheart of a guy from Brooklyn. The way the two characters evolve and the friendship that stems from the experience of touring in the deep south is truly a pleasure to watch."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2019,10/10,"First, for those reviewers who can't get the Title of the movie. The title is a guide book given to Tony called the Guide to Negro Motorists in the South. He was given the book right before they left NYC. The movie is perfect in every way. Definitely not a Driving Miss Daisy movie. Just a really good movie that touches on many ""untouchable"" topics and situations and how two very different people handle those situations. The racism in the South is very real. The racism in this country right now is very real. The high point of the movie was the argument between the two men regarding who was blacker. Many middle class white people feel this about affluent black people who have more materialstic things than they do. Money. And integrity. It is a very class and race set of circumstances in which one finds oneself; a state of affairs. But many black people feel they are in a situation where it can't change because of their skin color. It can. We are all people; no matter our ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs etc. This movie really brought that home for me. And it didn't preach or show all the uglies. Just enjoy the acting and movie script. Excellent. This movie should sweep the Oscars."
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,7/10,"Brilliant performances from both lead actors and the story itself felt like a brilliant message. The more we learn about the people we don't commonly associate with, the less likely we are to be prejudiced to them. My only issue and this on a personal level, the movie felt long, I get it's essentially a road trip but at times felt boring as a result."
GREEN BOOK,14 April 2019,10/10,"This story grabs you right from the start, amazing acting and an emotional story. This movie deserves a lot of credit."
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2019,9/10,"How could a nation's basic values differ from region to region? How could you applaud a performance and abhor the performer? There are so many disturbing scenes in this movie but things get better as the movie absorbs you in... We only start noticing the positive things like friendship, courage and principles. We feel good as two very different man get closer and as they learn from each other. Mortensen and Ali shine together in their roles as a team of harmony. A top notch feel-good movie; mission accomplished..."
GREEN BOOK,26 June 2019,9/10,"Worth it , amazing , touching , emotional , comedy , humour , everything"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,8/10,"Green Book is litterally the celebration of Friendship and Humanity in 2 hours! It just melts Your Heart to see the mutual understanding between the two main characters in the film that It really goes out of the screen! Green Book has a simple storyline but a strong message to share: That despite differences and diversity, we are all humans. Farrelly tells it perfectly in the film. What I like in Green Book that I might not like in other films, it's that It goes straight to the point, to what It should tell first. Mahershala Ali's acting is stunning, that I think he's a true contender for a second Oscar; Mortensen's performance is breathtaking as well. Green Book is the proof that you don't have to bring tons of technics to have a good movie, or to be recognized at the Academy Awards for example. A strong story is enough, and stories are the main power of movies in our society."
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2020,10/10,An excellent film with a fantastic performance by the leads...VM should have got the Oscar! Made me laugh out load...I loved his character....don't miss it!
GREEN BOOK,21 May 2020,7/10,"Using a gentle pen to show a profound theme, such ironic discrimination is a solution to the problem. Prejudice is indeed difficult to eliminate completely, you can fight and resist! But in the end it is to use human light to infect, penetrate, and understand. Overall it is warm, bright and exciting!
The most touching bridge is the last affectionate embrace of Dolores and Donald! That is complete acceptance, approval and thanks! Letting go of prejudice and embracing what you think is right is the greatest progress."
GREEN BOOK,4 January 2019,10/10,A beautiful story of friendship. Based on a true story.
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,8/10,"God dammit I love Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Any friend of mine knows I RAVE about these two and in Green Book, they take an above average script, a workman like production to a greater height.Viggo Mortensen can do anything. Simple as that. The man is our modern day Robert De Niro but better. Tony easily could've been unlikable, but Mortensen exudes charm without sparing complexities. His Tony still says wrong and insensitive things but with Mortensen's nuance the audience are able to understand where this comes from. Another staggeringly warming performance to add to Mortensen's impressive resume.Mahershala Ali, I said to everyone after seeing Moonlight he would be the next big thing and my god is he a talent. Subtle, refined and vulnerable. Ali contrasts his mighty stature with an incredible vulnerability that gives Doc Shirley all the layers that in a lesser actor's hands would be one note. Mahershala Ali never fails to impress, at times showing his comedic chops but then his deep isolation only seen through his expressive eyes.Linda Cardellini also provides solid support to a script that doesn't really do her any favours. The minor gripes I had with the film was the workman like effort of the cinematography and editing. Simple two way shots and cuts but this was all pushed aside for Mortensen's and Ali's magnetic performances.The story was interesting and one hopes that it was true and without any addition of false events as some scenes were genuinely funny and it would be even funnier to know that they happened in reality.Whilst the script in my opinion wasn't worthy of an Academy Award Nomination (mainly due to worthier competition), there are some incredibly subtle references and notions that were fun to pick out whilst the more overt references were also enjoyable.The film is infectiously funny, heartwarmingly touching and I completely recommend the picture to go and have a great laugh and an enjoyable time. I usually go to watch more serious and depressing stories at the cinema but it was a lovely change to come out of the cinema with a great big beaming smile on my face, which was in no small part to Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali."
GREEN BOOK,2 October 2019,9/10,"This film is very enjoyable to watch. Given the very difficult issues of discrimination that are at its centre that is quite a surprise. The film in no way undermines the importance of its subject matter by being surprisingly easy to watch, it really is quite a success.It is a road movie and this is a favourite genre of mine. It is also what some call a ""buddy movie"". It is a journey and the experiences of that journey change the two travellers. The film has some special magic because to describe it makes it sound like a series of clichés, but that is not how it is at all.I think this film very successfully engages the viewer in its story, not using any clever plot tricks but rather by having interesting characters that you care about.It would make a great Christmas movie and my guess is that was the intention. I notice it was originally released in October in most places.It does not shy away from depicting the terrible discrimination and attitudes but at the same time it is very warm-hearted and entertaining.Really quite a success I think!"
GREEN BOOK,28 November 2019,8/10,"A delicate and precious film, ruthless towards good feelings but hopeful towards racism that comes from ignorance and not from the heart, when in the end human solidarity is still able to redeem men and their sins. It is a film that perhaps we Europeans cannot fully understand (even if racism begins again to meander dangerously between our feet) but I like to think that the choice of an Italian American of the populace as a counterpart to the cultured afro doctor American is not random. After all, among the many ugly figures that the driver does, in the end he is saved because he truly begins to believe in his neighbor, because in the end he makes himself loved, because he begins to understand and participate in the harshness of the battle, because he contrasts and shares a fundamental value, that of the family, which we once had but which we are losing today. Because it is true that in life you have to be what you are (otherwise you generate monsters) but what sense does it have if to crown a successful life, on Christmas Eve we find ourselves alone or worse on the point of death there was no one to greet us with the serenity of an affectionate embrace? Another element common to films that involve some form of catharsis is that of travel, an ancient metaphor for the path of the soul. I sincerely would have given the Oscar to Viggo Mortensen, more and more an actor of thick cast in roles that makes him look easy but that are not easy. And as the protagonist says, it's really a pleasure to see the landscapes that are the backdrop for this trip."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,Nick Vallelonga has surely an Oscar here a heart warming tale from beginning to end.The acting is a masterclass of how it should be done. Racism in the 50s ruminates throughout and the ugliness it reflects on everyone who promotes it .Mahershala Ali plays the irrepressible Dr Shirley with passion and grace and is hilarious at times without slipping from the role. This said his co star Viggo Mortensen is equally stunning as Tony Lip and is the total opposite to Alis character care free but still holding on to his morals for the love of his wife and children. An absolute delight and an absolute favourite to be awarded for its shear delight.
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2020,9/10,"Tony is really a good husband. He feels embarrassed to write a letter and is unwilling to write because he cannot write well. But his wife asked him to promise and he said ok I promise. I began to think that he might only write one letter, but I didn't think he wrote all the way. Ha ha, it's really very warm. Seeing him scratching his head and making awkward sentences, he would write to his wife during the rest of the day and night. I like this setting very much."
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,9/10,#greenbook 9/10 well well well that's my fav film of 2019 and just pips a star is born for the Oscar in my book. #viggomortensen and @mahershalaali are superb a real bromance right there. Another true story hits our screens with a real bang
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,10/10,"This movie was superbly written. Now it's easier to see why it won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar at this year's Academy Awards.Green Book was powerfully and yet smoothly executed. It is also no wonder why it won Best Picture among the other nominees. However, I will say it was a much safer choice than BlacKkKlansman, which I also reviewed here. Nonetheless, this film captivated me with it's own unique and unexpected charm. The mutual support and nurturing chemistry between the two main characters was beyond belief."
GREEN BOOK,30 June 2021,,Probably the best movies I've seen Regarding race relations. Funny. Clever. Great choice for best picture as well. Bravo.
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2019,10/10,"It is truly a rarity to come across a modern classic like this that is both educational and entertaining. The black passenger in this film will surprise you from start to finish and so will the white driver. This duo played very well together and this has the right amount of action along with a good story line to satisfy you!
For the most part the black passenger is the type of good mentor that makes up for the white drivers bad influence!
What a dynamic duo. What a riveting performance from two wonderfully convincing actors. This is a must see that is worthy of the accolades it has received."
GREEN BOOK,22 November 2018,,"I'm officially on the bandwagon, this was magnificent. It's a beautiful story to begin with, but Viggo and Mahershala give other-worldly performances that elevate it to even greater heights. Visually the film was nice too, there weren't any magnificent set pieces or anything like that but there was an intimacy to the cinematography that I haven't noticed in many other films. I'm sure people will complain that it's a little fluffy, but it took on very sensitive subject matter head-on and did it in a way that forced the viewer to confront their own beliefs in the process. Personally, I loved it and I'm going to remember the way it made me feel. I understand it takes more than just a film to change people's perspectives, but as this one said ""it takes courage to change people's hearts""."
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,8/10,That was niceeeeeeeeUWUeeeeeeeniceeeeeeeeUWUeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,9/10,"What a great movie to see and think about. I do honor the courage the movie industry takes and it is also taking some responsibility for showing our USA past, embarrassing as I see it but truth is one to learn from and become better. The movie is not flashy and not one with lots of special effects, etc. Its a story. I also work with many races at work and I don't think I would ever judge another by their color as ability is what matters when you try to save a life at the hospital. This movie helps me understand what a few percent of out humanity feels and acts on. I mean it is very hard for me to see how others could do what they do, more like unreal, and that is not confronting reality either. See it on the screen or at home with another. Good for the soul, pun intended or not."
GREEN BOOK,27 April 2020,9/10,"At the end of the story, don shows up at Tony's house with a gift. The family is surprised and welcomes don. Tony's wife gives him a warm and sincere hug and thanks for teaching Tony to write those romantic letters. The film is full of descriptions of the discrimination of black people in the social environment at that time, but it also reflects the warmth between people."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2020,10/10,"This is a beautiful film. It took me on a journey that involved intrigue, humour and a beautiful set of emotions. It's a story of evolution of realization of self, the community and the kind and the harsh society of that era in the states. Simply a beautifully crafted emotional journey. Loved it."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,7/10,"Finally saw the Green Book and I understand why there are some dissenting opinions about its merits. My take is it is a solidly good picture, but it also doesn't quite hit the brilliant mark for me as well. Still, what tips the scale beyond being just solidly good is not on the artistry of the making but in the new angle of looking at racial inequality. It seems to suggest for some people, their prejudices based on skin color are more innately grounded and thus, creating almost absurd contradictions in social acceptancy. In short, a person is not quite the totality of his sum, but a collection of fragmented personas which are then treated differently and accordingly depending on the context of what he should be. This is what makes the film so uniquely interesting, this point of view. Viggo Mortensen whom I hardly recognized as the same actor who did Lord of the Rings, or The Road, or Captain Fantastic did a fantastic and transformative job with his character. As for Mahershala Ali, well, he was at least a class or two above in his abilities as an actor in True Detective. Based on this, I must hand it to the director of this show, Peter Farrelly. He is only solidly good, but not quite brilliant yet."
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2019,7/10,"This film is really really good, but that's it. It's nothing spectacular, Vigo is phenomenal in this and deserved awards for his performance. The serious parts of this film don't connect with me because of the humour they've tried to insert. This literally could be considered a road trip comedy at points and this is detrimental to its emotional power. It's definetly worth watching but there's many better films from the last year that should've won the award"
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,3/10,"How did this film even get considered for an Oscar? This is low grade pap, unchallenging, unbeleivable, dull and so cliched its difficult to believe a fine actor like Mortensen would get involved. And why cast a Scandinavian as a Bronx Italian? Mahershala Ali has done himself no favours either creating a cartoonish 'sophisticate', though the hand doubling during his piano playing was impressive. This is heavy handed populism, shallow and self-righteously preaching, reducing a complex social struggle to simple stereotypes. The cinema landscape of 2018 must be very lacking for this to be lauded as it is. But then in reality it is not, with Masterpieces like Roma on display, its just that the Oscars is not really as important as it would like to be."
GREEN BOOK,1 December 2018,10/10,"Beautifully shot film pulled me away from today and back into the 60's. Loved the acting, Mortenson and Ali were wonderful. The story is honest while being entertaining. The issues of such a trip in the 60's are well depicted while the resulting friendship demonstrates the power of love over superficial worldly expectations. Big thumbs up."
GREEN BOOK,20 July 2019,9/10,"Just watched this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Great acting all round and there's some great comical, poignant and touching moments. Brilliant chemistry between Mortensen and Ali. Especially impressed with Mortensen's performance. I can now see why it won best picture."
GREEN BOOK,12 November 2019,5/10,"The premise of Green Book certainly sounds intriguing, but this film adaptation is bland as can be. The acting is good overall, but the direction is perfunctory at best - Peter Farrelly's approach seems both heavy-handed and simplistic. It doesn't help that the story favors the less interesting of the two lead characters - it would really have been nice to learn more about Don Shirley. And more about the actual Green Book, which gets barely a mention in the screenplay despite the impression the film's title gives that it's an important element of the plot.What we get instead feels like a by-the-numbers exercise, designed to make a potentially thorny subject palatable for the mainstream. It's mildly thought-provoking in a few spots and mildly entertaining in a few others, but it contains virtually no surprises of any kind, and it ultimately doesn't illuminate much. I didn't hate Green Book, but I am frankly mystified by the number of awards and accolades it has received. I found it to be a pleasant but thoroughly unremarkable movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,4/10,"Yes, we know black people was discriminated against. Unless you want you want to pay to be educated about race issues skip this one."
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2020,10/10,I've seen this movie 3 times now. I absolutely love it.
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,9/10,"Made me proud of Viggo as a fellow Dane. What an amazing performance! Ali played a perfect role in this movie.I will not spoil it but this has been the most fun, dramatic and most important movie I have seen this year!! The story is amazing and it makes me proud that we are finally living in a world where this story can be told and is watched with open arms (in majority of the world).I do hope this wins many oscars!Thank you for an amazing experience."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,8/10,"What a movie, what fantastic actors. Based on a true story. Two ethnic characters, black musician and Italian hustler, learn to stand up (musician) and what segregation means (hustler). The'white' being the chauffeur of the 'black' and their very different characters and backgrounds are the base for both humorous and endearing moment. Through great acting both main characters are brought to life as real life sympatic persons. The story (kind of road movie) is depicted from an actual begin '60 experience. It's about a friendship built against the background of segregated US. Both the (mild) portayal of US segregation and how the respect and friendship evolve makes 'the green book' a strong advocate for respect. Go see and enjoy!"
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,10/10,This is just a lovely simple movie of friendship built while travelling on the road playing the piano. Give it a watch it won't disappoint 10 out of 10.
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,"The characters are very charismatic, the actors do a very good job and the dialogues make you burst out in laughter more than once. The music and camerawork is wonderful as well and does manage to take you back in time to experience the racial issues of that time.
I did wonder a bit about the casting of Viggo Mortensen for the role of an Italian guy. He is acting very well and gets the right hang of the accents, though."
GREEN BOOK,20 May 2020,10/10,"Respect is not only reflected in courtesy, but also in self-cultivation. Only those who respect others can gain the respect of others. There is no cruelty or darkness in the Green Book. Instead, the understatement along the way are touched me."
GREEN BOOK,21 November 2018,8/10,"When your whole theatre starts clapping at the end, you know it's a great movie. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such great rapport in this movie, you can't help but be 100 percent along for the drive. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and most of it sticks. It's a story we have seen before, and will likely see again, but it's these two actors' chemistry that make this film. It could have been a little more dramatic and I do wish it delved into that a little more, but it ended up being a nice Christmas movie that arrives just in time for the holidays."
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,,"Not only boring and cliche but also poorly acted. And apparently the family of pianist condemned movie for ""hurtful mistruths"".A movie about the actual Green Book used by African American motorists in the south is what I was expecting because that's the title of the film! Instead we get a sugar coated, formulaic piece of Hollywood garbage full of inaccuracies. But the IMDB review bots and paid off critics fulled me once again. At least it was free on my flight, the only way to watch this time waster"
GREEN BOOK,3 September 2021,6/10,"It's a feels-good basic odd couple road movie with two colourful characters exploring usa-brand of racism, mildly."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,9/10,"The film follow's two men's journey down into the deep south of America,It's based on a true story of how Tony Lip a street smart chain smoking Italian was hired to drive Doc Don Shirley - a virtuoso cultured piano playing African American - on his 2 month performance tour down south.Along the way they grow to accept each other and more importantly themselves. Tony is challenged to appreciate the more cultured things in life (like writing more eloquent letters to his wife back home), and Doc to enjoy everyday pleasures (like eating fried chicken straight from the KFC bucket with your fingers)Vigo and Mahershala as Tony and Doc both give effortless performances and their growing rapport is a joy to watch.I challenge you to watch this movie and to not leave feeling both more upbeat about the possibility of how we as a society can become even better, but also chastened by a reminder of where we've come from ... and in some cases still are.Go see it."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,8/10,This movie about an unlikely friendship will grow on you. It reminds one that the way you perceive yourself is much more important than how others actually perceive yourself. Step out of your own head and you just might be surprise how everything is not what you think it is. Vigo has the chops and certainly justifies his Best Actor Nomination and Mahershala too as Best Supporting Actor. You will not be able to tell who is in the Lead or Supporting role :) A movie that will make you laugh and feel good after.
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,9/10,"Sometimes you don't even hear about a movie and just notice it is in theaters, with two actors you like and a nice poster. So you go see it and it comes out of nowhere and turns out to be AMAZING.
Just go see it in a legal way, this movie is worth it."
GREEN BOOK,16 April 2019,9/10,"I cannot believe I didn´t watch this movie earlier, but I am so glad I got to it at all. As I have stated before with other movies - for me a very important part of a movie is to make you feel something, anything, stir up some emotions and leave you thinking and debating on some things. Yes, this movie has all of that. It talks about imoprtant issues and gives a glimpse of different sides of humanity.
I do believe that the big part in the success of this movie is on Mortensen and Ali - they did their roles just perfectly, but I was especially impressed with Mortensen.
What is another interesting thing about thos movie is that it often seems like you can predict what´s gonna happen next, but that´s not the case and I quite liked that.
Also I just realized in the very end that this was a true story and usually movies make it pretty clear at the very beginning. But that just made it all that much more enjoyable.
When the movie ended I felt sheer happiness and gratitude that I had spent 2 hours of my life looking at an incredible story that took my mind to so many different places and made me feel in many different ways. I fully reccomend this film to everyone."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,7/10,"Although Oscar winning, I found this film to not really stand out as a ""best picture"". It was good yes. Not sure Ali was deserving of best supporting actor either. The pacing of the film was very flat but I appreciated where they were going with how racism towards blacks was dealt with in those times."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,8/10,While the decision for best film is contentious - I still enjoyed this film with a message about treatment of another race. It's a comedic and sad reminder of how we shouldn't be in the modern era. Well acted and directed.
GREEN BOOK,6 December 2018,8/10,"So despite my reservations about watching another racially driven movie, I checked out green book. First, let me say that the Italian rhetoric made the film genuinely enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. The 1960s based film is about Tony Lip who is a rough around the edges back streets Italian who is hired to drive slightly eccentric Dr. Don Shirley who is a classically trained black pianist on tour with his trio through the Deep South. Despite being socially accepted in the north, Dr. Shirley takes on this tour where he knows he will encounter issues along the way. Without spoiling the movie, the film explores an unfamiliar narrative of a white person hired to do a job of somewhat servitude for a black person, which I don't remember seeing on this caliber since the body guard. What's interesting to note are two things, the development of the relationship between the two characters from the time they first met to the end of the film and why Dr. Shirley even made the decision to perform in the south which I will leave you to figure out. Both Mahershala ali Viggo Mortensen put on a great performance and the movie definitely has a well-developed storyline."
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,10/10,Watch it. Viggo Mortensen appears to be that tough guy but is a darling throughout the movie. The movie keeps getting better and won't bore u anywhere. Ali holds on n definitely deserves the supporting award. Good Christmas movie
GREEN BOOK,24 May 2019,9/10,"Personally, after filming the ""Shindler List"", I was impressed by the film, enjoying my heart, warming the heart, and then losing my mind. The film featured an uncritical lesson in relation to racism: a preaching about empowerment and the guidance of viewers, in the form of a comedy, with the presence of two friends who are not very similar, thanks to Two good artists of this movie ..."
GREEN BOOK,28 March 2020,10/10,"""If I'm not black enough, and black people don't recognize me, and white people don't recognize me if I'm not white enough, who am I?""Discrimination is the biggest barrier between people.When will race, sexual orientation, etc. be fully tolerated by human society?"
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2020,10/10,"Saw in a packed house. Audience applauded at end of film. Appalled at behavior of Spike Lee at Oscar ceremony. Saw his film as well. Ok but even if Green Book didn't win, Spike's film was not Oscarworthy.
Recommended GB to several friends; they ALL loved it!"
GREEN BOOK,20 August 2021,9/10,"I'd put this with forest gump as the two best ""old world"" movies ever made.The juxtaposition of a time I wasn't alive during along with the perspective I have today, makes me sad and empathize with the burdens that people endured and fought against in the past.9/10."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,10/10,Green Book is simply a great movie. The acting is excellent. It's always hard to watch any movie that deals with America's awful and forever embarrassing chapter of segregation and the outrageous Jim Crow period. This was deftly handled. My only complaint is that the movie wasn't 15-30 minutes longer.
GREEN BOOK,25 July 2019,9/10,"The movie were packed with great moments.The chemistry between the two lead roles (Viggo and Mahershala) felt so organic and genuine, like it wasn't even acted.
The character development through out, was very fluid and well done.The movie had many, however subtle moments of laughter (for the viewer) through out the movie.And the movie seemed to have captured the time period quite well and how life was back then.
Also the pace of the movie were balanced nicely. Not too rushed and yet not too much detail into the characters of the movie. It left a little to think about, and just gave the viewer enough to not get bored."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,8/10,I really enjoyed this movie. Great cast especially Viggo who played his role with perfection. Based on a true story with humour and some serious moments. This story brings together two men from very different worlds who come to understand and support each other on this trip. Recommended.
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,6/10,"Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.
Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.
There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There's a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America.
It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.
That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.
In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances."
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,7/10,I liked their acting very much. Their chances are very high for oscar. Akdemi members like social problems.
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,9/10,"Didn't know much about this film going in and saw it a little later as it didn't come out till the end of January 2019 here in the U.K. and it's not usually my type of film, but I am so glad I saw it. I don't really care for the whole political racial stuff but it was nice to see an insight into what happened back then. Scary to think that people were treated like that just 60 years ago. Anyway I found the script was so great and was so well well acted by the 2 leads. The cinematography was great and as was the music choice. There was real chemistry between the characters despite their obvious differences, interests and upbringings. The comedy was great and I laughed more than I thought I would, and it was the perfect amount and was done tastefully and was not constant and excessive, so it's not strictly a comedy. Overall I loved this movie, I understand why it's getting the praise it's getting and is more than justified. And I think everyone should see this."
GREEN BOOK,7 July 2019,10/10,"I enjoyed everything about it. The scenario, the characters, filming, directing, everything. The humor was also exceptional. I was absorbed in the movie until the very end.
What's very interesting and special about this film is that it gives a different perspective of racism against Afro-Americans, because it talks about an Afro-American that had a completely different lifestyle. High class, economically successful, always formally dressed, performed music for the Western European people etc. Before watching this movie, I'd rush to the conclusion that he'd be very respected because of his fame and skills, but that was certainly not the case. There was prejudice about him from both sides: light skin colored and dark skin colored people. I had the impression that individuals like Aretha Franklin or Sam Cook wouldn't have to deal with racism that much: but maybe they faced it, just like Don Shirley did. Therefore, this movie presents everything from a very unique angle.
It's a movie I'd definitely recommend, not only for entertainment purposes, but also educational and awareness reasons."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,8/10,Some cheesy moments and cliched acting but definitely a gorgeous but slow paced story that will again make us reflect on our dark and horrible past
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,9/10,"The story catched me from start to end. Acting is amazing, imo deserved best picture."
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2018,10/10,"Going in to this movie without any expectation I was surprised to see how a movie like this can miss the lime light of media and hypeThis is one of those movies that are made once in a decade. With a great case, powerhouse performances by every characters and a gripping story this movie has a a lesson we all can learn and relate to.I hope more movies are made like this"
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,9/10,"Most of the favorable responses accurately capsule this film and don't justify repeating. But such care in producing a fine effort is always diminished when annoyingly full of historical error. Aretha Franklin (referenced) was not a well-known performer in 62. A black police officer on the Macon force in 62? Hummm. Maybe. Lawrence of Arabia (background marquee) not released until a year after the setting. And always, wrong vintage cars being used. And would someone fact check whether Bobby Kennedy convinced George Wallace in 62 to order a small-town police chief to spring both guys within hours after what was, technically, a righteous detention? Come on, two years later he couldn't get a black in 'Bama without Federal Marshalls. Millions spent on such productions are routinely skimped when it comes to due diligence."
GREEN BOOK,26 January 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies I have seen for a long time.
Emotional, great characters and script and perfect acting.
The racism card is not overplayed, but done credible, I am not saying anything else, so that I don't spoil this lovely piece of entertainment. Do watch it."
GREEN BOOK,18 August 2019,8/10,One of those films that remains in your memory for a long time because of the way it made your heart feel.
GREEN BOOK,9 July 2021,9/10,"I thorough enjoyed this movie. The chemistry between the two leads is outstanding. In my opinion, Mahershala Ali overacted in a few spots but forgivable due to the short duration."
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,"Our family chooses a movie to see in the theatre every year during Christmas. This year we accidentally chose VICE, which is horrific. Tonight, we feel like we redeemed ourselves by catching Green Book.
My first impression is that it will be a shame if Viggo Mortensen does not win an award for his performance. He was absolutely incredible--every single line the entire movie. He nailed it.
I gave this a 9/10 instead of 10/10 only because it had the slightest ""Disney"" feel to it. NOT a big deal, but I'm the kind of reviewer that reserves a 10/10 for just a very few movies.
This is a feel good movie that would be easy to just sit back and enjoy. This one should have been our Christmas movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 May 2020,8/10,A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2019,7/10,"It's a good movie to watch, but thats all.
The plot is a regular story, nothing extraordinary.
I dont see any overwhelming performance tbh, there werent any hard scenes by the supportive role to win an oscar tbh.
IMHO its a regular story, like many in sunday afternoon movies.
To watch once and forget"
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2019,7/10,"Regardless of its veracity, Green Book offered a tame but warming story of race relations in the 60s. Viggos character felt a bit like an overly wholesome stereotype, but nevertheless like able, while Ali's role seemed very dependent and vulnerable. Nothing is spectacular about the film but still a well done, feel good fick."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"Mortensen e Ali are totally fantastic.
It's a simple movie, but perfect. The 1st main character is introduced, then the 2nd; the story unfolds fluidly until the expected but not guaranteed end."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"I have read some bad reviews about this film. They were all wrong. It is a wonderful piece of movie. True, the story is not so original but life repeats itself from time to time. And it is inspired by true events.
But what is utterly breathtaking is the acting of the two characters. Viggo Mortensen, a great actor gives the performance of his life, definitely worth an Oscar. He became an ordinary working class Italian-American guy, I felt he is a member of the Sopranos' family... Mahershala Ali has a mighty presence, as always. The contrast between the aristocratic Ali and the working class Mortensen is funny and heart-warming at the same time. Both deserve the Oscar for their outstanding performance. The directing is professional and flawless. It is a must watch movie and you will will enjoy it for sure."
GREEN BOOK,9 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book is undoubtedly one of the year's best. This film ticks all the right boxes: exceptional performances, great story and powerful message. I believe this is one of the strongest contenders for the Oscar race and wouldn't be surprised if it wins Best Picture.Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give their best performances to date, particularly Mortensen. However, Ali is the one that may take the Oscar as he is in the race for Supporting Actor. Other stand outs are direction, screenplay, score, cinematography, editing and production design. It might end up with 6 or 7 Academy Award nominations on top of the 3 Golden Globes that has already won.I watched this film during the New Year's Eve premiere and had a terrific time. Overall, it's a very enjoyable and positive film, it touches many topics which are relevant today and that's why Green Book is magic.Score: 10/10FJ Medina"
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,9/10,"I don't understand why people are complaining about predictability. When you see a movie which is based on a true story, you have to make yourself ready for that then see it. You need to focus on the ""Film"" here."
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2020,7/10,I never heard of this pianist but he was absolutely wonderful. What a dark time in America especially the South. We have gotten better about discrimination but still a long way to go. Movie is a keeper
GREEN BOOK,21 December 2018,8/10,"One of the years best, truly beautifully acted and directed, along with a heartwarming and simply fun story.This feature is a great achievement, it was funny and engaging and very much worth the wait to finally see. In partiuclar the performances are the first pieces which pop out, the brilliant chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali's at the core of the feature, placed in conjunction with the screenplay, gives the film great heart and emotion and an inspirational human story.While Peter Farrelly's direction is not particularly special, it works extremely well. Most notably I suspect that the feature was shot on film, which brought out very poignant colours and sold the 1962 setting extremely well. As well as the classical look of film, further feeding the atmosphere. It has an extremely charming feeling, that delivers the change in seasons, the different locations of both poverty and wealth to a stark but consistent contrast. The direction does not feel forced, not at all, it flows magnificently thanks to Peter Farrelly. Nothing feels out of place, the editing is clever. The features aspect ratio of 2.00:1, which is uncommon for many films, gives a more unique frame and look to other cinematic endeavour, especially since I saw it in a cinema. It gives the look more character and personality.Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip (Vallelonga) was perfectly cast, although he has never delivered a performance of this type or ethnicity, he truly delivers the part like a natural. Some may call it a little over the top, but so was the real Tony Lip, it goes all the way round into a very memorable performance. Mortensen truly delivers deep charatcer, and his work with Linda Cardellini as Dolores Vallelonga I'd say was one of the highlights of the film. But of course, his chemistry with Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley is the highlight, the play between these two, one is an informal bullshitter and the other a high class musician, the sparring is fun and memorable. Truly well cast and directed, there's so many scenes, almost all deliver the perfect chemistry to near perfection.Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley is the supporting role of this road feature. I believe that his performance here may be even better than in moonlight, for not only is there more content, but the layers that Ali delivered through this character are incredible. He is a black man in 1960's America, the best piano player possibly in the world, and keep's his sexuality and past quiet. He is a highly conflicted and rather tragic character, and Ali delivers his vulnerability, and bravery with such class and vexation. Truly it may be the best of his career so far. And how this spars with Tony Lip is truly amazing. They are polar opposites, and the film doesn't just say it, it shows it, it make's it a core aspect of their relationship, they they can come together in such a wonderful intertwined friendship. Ali's gives a highly emotional and very layered performance, extremely well processed and masterfully performed, both seem like real awards contenders.The supporting cast of this film was very strong, they all had functions that were clear. Most of all was Linda Cardellini as Dolores Vallelonga, her performance was absolutely wonderful. I'd say it's even being overlooked by awards due to how good the other two were, its truly amazing in its own right.The mix of drama and comedy in this feature is tonally near perfect. Many films would dream of being this consistent and well balanced, it gets it just right, and is a great achievement by the screenwriters and how director Peter Farrelly has constructed the film with his editor. The characterisation in this film is very strong, for almost a fifth of the film is carried by Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip at the beginning. We meet him in the Copacabana nightclub in way that reminded my of Rick's in Casablanca. The vivid colours in the film and the suits, it displays who Tony is highly effectively and is some of the strongest characterisation I have seen all year. It was a perfect start to the film, without staring card and credits, just straight into it in a very natural and really probably my favourite opening to a film all year. The film has such a great message about friendship, overcoming racial boundaries and personal identity, it is a really good aura and atmosphere, particularly in these polarising times.Musically this film is magnificent, I had heard that the films composer, Kris Bowers, had been a double for Ali on the piano. It seems absolutely seamless, we see Ali's full body while playing, its very well integrated. the score its self is beautiful, these compositions are complex and help to deliver Don Shirley's character, its part of his identity.However, I must mention that in the innards of the second act, the film dragged a little too long. Perhaps if the film had been 10 maybe even 15 minute's shorter, it could have been a little bit slimmer but overall this didn't impede upon my enjoyment of the film overall much.Overall, this was a wonderful movie, I enjoyed all parts of this feature. The spectacular cinematography that was poignant from start to finish, particularly in the opening. The wonderful performances that are truly worthy of all their recognition, and the great direction by Peter Farrelly, the beautiful music and heartwarming message the film delivers. Truly worth watching during this years christmas/holiday/awards season, great for all types of moviegoers, a great feel good movie. And truly a memorable one, 9/10."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,6/10,"For the first 20 minutes I thought this was going to be ANOTHER whites are bad, blacks are good movie. Movie starts out with the wayyyy over the top racist white people in almost every scene but then the film suddenly shifted and became a pretty great story. I don't want to give anything away with the plot here but the two main characters put on a good show, very believable. I do wish they took the time to develop the backstory of these characters a little more, but it didn't take away from the movie all that much.Overall: Watch this movie"
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2020,8/10,"The highlight is the integrity of the characters and the use of wonderful details, drama and performance is outstanding."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,6/10,"With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" with much focus on the recent changes.
Times were simpler back in 1989 when ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades' focus became less and less towards the story and more on ""How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?"".
Movie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.
As far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we'd expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for ""Eastern Promises"".
The Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow."
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2019,9/10,"I have become hesitant to watch movies that feature racism from back in the day. I tend to find them depressing and upsetting. Although this movie did feature racism it also had great comedy, and was uplifting overall.I was so sorry to hear of all the controversies the movie faced. I never expect movies like this to be absolute documentaries, with a blow-by-blow of what actually happened. I love Mahershala and Viggo and think they did excellent.I did want to point out the ""Elephant in the room"" Viggo Mortensen is Danish and he's portraying in Italian isn't that a ""Race swap"" or ""Culteral appropriation"". It interfered with my ""immersion into the film"".... I'm totally just kidding, some people need to calm down about that stuff. : )"
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,I was very young during this period and had no idea what was happening in the rest of the country. This is just a terrific movie providing the perspective of both black and white during the early 1960s. Well worth the time and money to see. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Linda Cardinelli steals the show.
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,7/10,I was expecting a PC barf-fest and eventually watched it because of Vigo but it turned out to be a very thoughtful and well executed movie with both the main actors doing terrific job in playing their respective characters... A rightful nomination for the Oscars...
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,8/10,"Great music, wonderful acting, both Marshalla Ali and Viggo Mortensen are performing very good. Great dialogs even there are cliches and predictable scenes, this movie is worth to watch , very enjoyable and funny too."
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,10/10,"I did not want this movie to end. I can't say enough good things about it! I laughed, I cried, and I wanted to see it again as soon as it ended. You should not miss this one... trust me!"
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,10/10,"I could hardly wait to finish the movie before writing this review, and I don't write them terribly often. This is just an excellent film all around. It's heartwarming, insightful and moving, but best of all I thought it was very very funny! There aren't too many movies that cover so many bases and do it as expertly as this. If you haven't seen it, definitely add this one to your list."
GREEN BOOK,8 January 2021,10/10,"Once in a while a movie really lifts your spirits, and this is one of them. It's not a feel-good movie, or a crowd pleaser, in my opinion. Although audiences surly was pleased and feeling good after seeing this gem. It's based on a true story, one of the redemption we can achieve if we see another as we truly are, beyond bravado, facade and stereotypes. It's beautiful to watch masterful actors like Ali and Mortensen enact true humanity that transcend surface level contradictions in a hard world where their humanity seems alien to most. My hope to future audiences is that you might let this movie lift you."
GREEN BOOK,18 April 2021,10/10,Opens your eyes to how terrible segregation was 60 years ago in the south. The acting was great and very authentic scenery. A complete contrast to today where we are expected to get on a bender knee to show your support to the BLM.
GREEN BOOK,21 October 2019,10/10,"I mean come on, who else should have got the Oscar that year..."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,8/10,"Oh, this movie is a little gem!Depicts--by all accounts--authentically this portion of life of Dr. Shirley, and the relationship that developed between Tony and Don Shirley.The acting was spot-on, with Mortensen effectively conveying 1960's Italian family life in NY, as well as Mahershala Ali and his ""privileged aloofness."" The story could have gone more into detail regarding how Dr. Shirley went from hitting the road with his mother in the Florida Pan-Handle to the ""top of a castle,"" but maybe that would have been too much for the time constraints of the viewer.I enjoyed it, and believe it was well-thought out. The performances were top-notch (still wondering how Tony palmed that ""lucky rock""), and I rated it accordingly."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,Not my usual type of movie but th8s I enjoyed alot...
GREEN BOOK,15 October 2019,6/10,"Only thing i didnt like, the black man was presenting a weak one! But i like the message"
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,9/10,This was a great all around movie. It teaches how friendships can be created in an unusual circumstance. It had a great amount of 1-liners as well as serious moments that were acted perfectly.
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2020,9/10,"What the film shows is so common that even decades later, discrimination and estrangement continue to play out repeatedly. Even if history is a cycle, can human civilization fully cross that gap?It is not too profound, nor is it inevitable, but mutual understanding and respect seem to be difficult.Of course the ending is good, I believe that the beginning of reconciliation of one symbolizes the beginning of countless understanding and reconciliation."
GREEN BOOK,24 May 2020,8/10,"Racial conflict is a big and difficult topic. The director's logic is meticulous and clear. There are several clips of restaurants, hotels, concert halls and bathrooms refusing to accept black people. There's a clip of a white driver repairing a car for a black musician, and a group of hard-working black slaves in the nearby field stop to watch them. Another clip is the driver bribes the police to help the black musicians.
These fragments later erupted in a rainy night with black musicians roaring: in their eyes, I am neither white, nor black, nor man, and I do not know who I am! I'll string all the above clips together."
GREEN BOOK,27 May 2020,8/10,"Let me talk about the advantages first!In many reviews, the good part of the film has been said almost, the two protagonists achieve each other, help each other, and perfect their personalities.At the end of the story, there was a suspense, and the appetite of the audience was suspended. Tang Shili was late, and the audience must be relieved when he saw Tang's arrival. In the welcome of Tony's family, the story has a good ending.This is one of them, because the standard carnival-style ending makes the audience comfortable.Secondly, it is the ""lucky stone""In terms of the care of things, the scene of the ""green lucky stone"" is very delicately arranged. I have an idea for this, a sentence-""Dignity, you need to fight for and maintain by yourself!"" I will expand on my own views in short pieces:At first I picked up the stone for Tony and took it as my own, but Tang was determined to stop it and let him pay to buy the stone. There is a line in Tang saying ""You can feel better when you pay"". This line has two meanings:First, on the subject of the film, it is better to take the initiative to fight instead of expressing your understanding and approval by waiting for the lucky god to send others. This can be understood in this way-the writer means that, in terms of racial discrimination, there may be good luck to meet someone who has the same mentality as Tony 's wife, but after all, it is only luck, a small probability, a small number of activities. In this kind of society, only by fighting for and maintaining dignity can you live up to the god of luck.Then we put it into the design of Tang, Tang is an elegant, principled, and upright person. This plot is very in line with the character's setting, and the screenwriter also expressed his views on the social phenomenon of racial discrimination. That is to say, the real version of Tang Xueli thinks so.Second, but from the background of the plot connection, it is very straightforward. Perhaps even small things like picking up stones can become an excuse for racial discriminators to humiliate people of color. Tang Xueli's move may be to be careful and not to trouble yourself. That's it.Finally, the characters' personalities are full, such as the characteristics of Tony's eating, and Tony's appearance of eating in the film has been repeated many times, and a close shot is given. In addition to highlighting the free and easy characteristics of the characters, he tells the audience that Tony is very satisfied with his life He may not have the spiritual world as elegant as Tang, but he lived his own way.But Tang is lonely. For example, Tang is injured. A person wipes the wound, which is not only a treatment for the current skin, but also a psychological injury. He may have an elegant spiritual world, but it is limited and short-lived.On the whole, many turning points make people feel reasonable and not prominent. The plot of the conflict is very contagious, especially in the rain scene. The actor handled the tone of the characters' lines very well.In the end, I also found a flaw, something unreasonable-Tony's attitude towards Tang changed for the first time.I do n't need much foreshadowing. My question is very simple. For a person like Tony, a life-stricken life, relying on picking up various small jobs, only staying in the survival stage, he only listened to the first After Tang Tang's performance, tears flashed in his eyes, and he was admired for it, which was obviously a little abrupt. This is not to say that it is unreasonable, but I personally feel that the plot can be used as a foreshadowing, but there is nothing in the film about Tony's attitude to classical music, and there is no drama comparing his attitude.Of course, this point may be far-fetched. If you have a better idea, you can comment and share it!"
GREEN BOOK,6 April 2019,10/10,"I kept passing this film by as it didn't appeal to me. But tonight I was at home, bored with nothing much to do. So I thought what the hell. Boy am I glad I gave this film a chance. It's very good and different from what I was expecting. It has humor throughout the film and the connection between the two main characters is great. This really is worth a watch plus it's based on a true story...
Great"
GREEN BOOK,13 September 2021,7/10,If only things were this simple. But it's undeniably entertaining.
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,9/10,The performance of the two main characters is very good. I thought it was great that the film was based on a true story.
GREEN BOOK,3 May 2020,8/10,Green Book is one of the best movies i've ever seen.A brilliantly touching and fantastically shot picture with impeccable performances by Mortensen and Ali.Watch it with your wife or husband.
GREEN BOOK,6 May 2019,10/10,It held my interest. It was well acted. Perfectly cast. A good story. Well directed. I don't get the criticism that has been flung at this movie.

GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,10/10,It should be watched just to experience the heartwarming story that this film portrays in such a way that these characters come to life. I also does not come off as cheesey
GREEN BOOK,18 April 2020,8/10,Reminded me a bit of the movie Untouchables. An acquaintance which involves to a friendship and where the two main characters were helpful to one another. A nice well executed movie with a great story!
GREEN BOOK,15 December 2019,10/10,"My favorite of the year
Loved the story and acting great"
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,3/10,"I get the point. American guilt about its attitude to race. It has a message but too what end? The USA is still deeply divided.
What is the story trying to say? It was bad then but now things are SO much better? Nope.
2 guys, a cultured lonely black gay guy driven by the cartoon character Italian dumbo on a long 'journey' to enlightenment, with an 'in time for Christmas' ending.
Nothing adequately explored, nothing new to say. It is a lovely story based on true events, lovely photography, good acting.
I'm just left not feeling much about either character.
It's all been done before only better."
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,10/10,"This film has a wonderful message. Regarding racism, and the way some individuals in a modern society treat others by simply being colored. I believe that this film did an excellent way of portraying such a miserable, and painful topic. In order to comprehend this film it is crucial to ANALYZE. There was not one weak scene for me. It had a little bit of everything. I laughed.. I Cried. I enjoyed.Amazing! =10/10 stars! :-)"
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2021,7/10,Good movie with a good message. But I do not really feel it. But I'm still glad I'm watching this.
GREEN BOOK,6 July 2019,8/10,"The subtlety in this movie is exceptional - and it has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, racism, music and friendship. A wonderful socially-conscious film. There are many films about racism but Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them. The Green Book is a film about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual support between people. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,,Best movie I've seen in s long time. Didn't even get up to go to the bathroom. I'm pleased that storytelling still exist. Amazing.
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2020,10/10,I dont know whats happened to the movie making business but its not good. Green Book was an enjoyable easy to watch flick based on a true story which was very cool. It was both funny and sad and had a good ending.
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,10/10,"Fantastic masterpiece: A journey that gives you the meaning of true friendship. In the beginning of the film I actually thought it to be another racial discrimination film between White and colored people, but I was so corrected by the amazing turn of events which take you to an adventure you never want to get over and quit. This film has honesty, friendship, encouragement and much more than one can bear in mind. Hats off to the director and every person behind this epic journey!
PS: we need more organizing films such as this"
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2021,8/10,"Directed by ""Peter Farrelly"" who is mostly known for making goofy comedies gives us something completely different. Based on a true story ""Viggo Mortensen"" and ""Mahershala Ali"" make it real with ""Mortensen"" playing ""Tony Lip"" an Italian American and ""Ali"" prorating the rich, eccentric pianist/doctor ""Don Shirley. The movie takes place in the deep south of America during the 1960s and it's accurately depicted. The two main characters journey from state to state as their unlikely friendship begins to form. The film deals with important subject matter and there's some scenes that truly demonstrate the division between people during that time. The cinematography is great and everything comes together nicely in this film, I highly recommend it!👌"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"This film is a brilliant commentary on racism and the thought process regarding that. Green Books tells a story of two characters , who discovered each other during a journey. One of them is full of life and have a very different approach on things the other person is black and is so obsessed on proving his loyalty for white people with his art , doing that he become aline in his own community. The director cleverly written both characters specially the driver. I loved the film for its telling of self discovery with enjoyable manner."
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,10/10,"This is an incredible, well-paced, finely acted and riveting film that flows beautifully. Motensen reminded me of all of my Italian American uncles from my Dad's side of the family and Mahershala Ali is becoming one of my ALL-TIME favorite actors, with so many nuances in seemingly every role he plays. In this, both actors shine. It is a rich and lovely film about a touchy subject, but it is the relationship that unfolds between these two men that is a nice showcase of how humanity outshines blurred color lines - without shoving the point down our proverbial throats. Bravo!"
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,10/10,"This is a classic film already. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali worked this ""odd couple"" to perfection actually defining how the development of deep lifelong friendship is derived. Having seen the film tonight for the first time after hearing all the Oscar talk, it strikes me profoundly that the best supporting actor role was undeniably dependent on the nominee for best leading actor in this film. I think that both actors deserved Oscars, but not one. That is to say it should have been both or neither as the only choice. I don't get the academy's ambivalence, since they awarded best picture for the film. (Yes, I have seen Bohemian Rhapsody and loved the film and Rami Malek's performance.)
This was a beautiful and moving film mainly due to the chemistry between the two men."
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,8/10,"Occasionally a film comes along where the acting is so extraordinary that I can overlook its flaws. Much like Malek's brilliant portrayal of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody -which I'd say is an average film overall- Mortensen and Ali are transcendent as Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley. I'm admittedly a fan of both actors' work, but Green Book is in my opinion their crowning achievement and they both deserve Oscars."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,8/10,"Green Book is an amazing movie. It had me in stitches with the comedy and the performances were spectacular. It was slightly predictable in places, but it was so funny and heartwarming that it didn't affect the experience too much!"
GREEN BOOK,23 October 2019,9/10,"What an absolutely brilliant movie, with every emotion covered.I do not think these roles could have been portrayed better Viggo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali are captivating in the story.Every aspect of the film is like a reversal of the world or how it was. I hope the story was played out exactly as the film narrates it. what a tremendous story.Do not miss this!"
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,10/10,"This picture should be up for BEST PICTURE. It has everything: great acting, solid script-writing (something that Hollywood really needs), and lots of humor. I wish that Hollywood would make more pictures like this."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"I feel this is the first movie in a long time that was worthy of my time and held me engaged from the beginning to the end.It is truly amazing and inspiring to observe what it took to overcome the paradoxical situation of being an underdog regardless of your incredible talent and formal intellectual capacity - just because some traditional societal norms say you are. See how far society truly has progressed over the years and what it takes to make a difference when leading future thought.
Expose yourself to this title and experience a brief Passage of life from the ""good ol' days"" with a laugh and a tear, where gender and the color of your skin defined your value, aspirations and the parameters around your dreams. It was a time where intellect was cheap and modern neoliberalism was trailblazing the future, a time of ""simplicity"" both in terms of technology and humanitarianism."

GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,8/10,"A very easy movie to watch. It's funny and at the same time it shows the problems of racism in a very subtle way. If you look for fun, for a movie who makes you think and who leaves you with a good taste in your mouth then add this one to your list."
GREEN BOOK,21 September 2021,8/10,"This movie was very very good. It was shot amazingly and the directing was superb. The acting was top notch, especially from the 2 main leading characters. Its a really great movie to just sit back and relax to and watch how a charismatic Italian and a reserved black men find a way to grow attached to one another. It was a great movie but maybe just a bit too stretched out!I would give this movie a 7.6/10."
GREEN BOOK,3 June 2019,8/10,"Green Book is definitely a solid film to watch. I'm still quite surprised that the direction was good coming from one of the Farrelly Bros.; but hey, he proved me wrong. The true heart of the film comes from the relationship of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as it felt so natural, comedic, and quite touching. The story isn't really that original (been there done that, especially when it came to the third act); but it still kept intrigued and the again, friendship angle was gold. Now did it deserve Best Picture? Not a chance. Felt like the safest to me."
GREEN BOOK,11 April 2020,9/10,"What Tony and Don think is that ""still to Chu and northbound"" is not on the same road. On the other hand, because of the fate of the association to become partners and partners. Don is an outsider in the eyes of whites, although he is a pianist, but because of his different complexion, he has never been really treated as a master by whites. In the eyes of blacks, he was also alien, because he lived an elegant life and never lowered his posture, contrary to the black public at that time. In fact, the Don in the lively atmosphere is lonely, he can not really integrate into any race, he is not black, nowhere to go, he is ""proud to live"" but humble to the dust. Tony- started with the mentality of working and making money, but when he saw what happened to Don, he gradually broke the relationship between employers and servants and extended a helping hand from a friend's point of view. The ""toilet incident"", ""suit incident"", ""fried chicken incident"", ""writing love letter incident"" in the Green Paper. Let the relationship between Don and Tony constantly change, each collision between the two people is not only a collision of human nature, but also a self-discovery and self-cognition of the protagonist.The film Green Paper is a very comprehensive display of all kinds of people from different ethnic groups and classes in the United States, showing that people's status and respect should not be divided by skin color, nor should they be educated. Degree or wealth is treated differently. There are good and bad people in every ethnic group. Don't look at others with colored glasses. ""most of the good things are not firm, and the colored clouds are easy to disperse glass. Brittleness "", human nature is fickle, but ultimately good nature, put aside arrogance and prejudice, do not need fists to argue, as the play says"" You never win with violence. "" Youonly win whenyou maintain yourdignity (, you'll never win by violence. Only by maintaining dignity can we overcome everything. "" So the proud existence, the warm life, is the true meaning and the meaning of life!"
GREEN BOOK,13 May 2020,8/10,"I saw it a long time ago, and some details are not remembered. What impressed me most is that this play shows the social problems that have lasted for a hundred years in a relaxed and humorous way. There is no bitterness, deep hatred, no roar. Regardless of how the underlying colored people are oppressed but succeeded, the elegant non-white people can't integrate into the mainstream society, and the perspective is quite unique. When I saw it, I knew it was based on a true story, even if I knew that the movie was inevitably sensational, but in the social environment at that time, the friendship between the two people was still beautiful and touching. However, the film has some achievements, and it ushered in the tears and hustle and bustle outside the play. Sure enough, it has to be lamented that the purest beauty and the purest evil are only found in works of art."
GREEN BOOK,27 June 2020,8/10,"You know what the story is about, and you know what the journey will take. You know that it doesn't touch anything too profound, but it also shows a lot of straightforwardness. You know that identity is something everyone can't avoid, and you know how hard it is to understand each other. You will naturally like the characters that are not so much like the real characters, and you will laugh with those funny or actually not so funny clips. Maybe it's just the first response to laugh to dissolve or hide other feelings."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2021,8/10,Wasn't in to movies at the time. I remember it was quite good. I almost never get disappointed when watching a movie in the cinemas.-watched it with Dad
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,5/10,"This a way to shallow buddy movie. It's just not offensive enough to make this relationship work. Instead, you have two almost cartoonesque characters who just don't bring the magic. The main promise of this film is to stay political correct towards everyone. Playing it save is not always good I guess. So is bad writing. Unbelievable scenes make it a worthy contender for the Golden Raspberry Award. But I guess me not living in the USA, is the reason why I don't get the Oscars. And yes I do like both actors, especially Viggo Mortensen. They were just cast in to a perfectly boring/shallow film."
GREEN BOOK,14 September 2019,9/10,"I rarely write reviews, but i've just finished watching this film with my husband and we were truly blown away, so I felt instantly the need to recommend it.What a beautiful story, well written and the acting was superb. The story was heartbreaking at times and, seeing the racism, was very hard to watch, but I'm only watching it, so I can't even slightly imagine how hard that was back then to deal with. My heart goes out to anyone who experienced these such harsh and inhumane times.The two main characters' friendship was beautiful, stunningly beautiful. I did not want this film to end. More films like this please - fabulous soundtrack also!"
GREEN BOOK,16 November 2019,9/10,I like the way Green Book conveys the message. I know it's just another movie about how black people were treated then but I've got to say the message is well delivered through The Don playing on the piano. It's really touching to see him that furious and determined.
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,10/10,"I am gonna be short and sweet here. This is a fantastic film especially in today's context where people are using race bait to profit themselves. No doubt the academy got right with this one. The two leads are absolutely amazing in their roles where they perfectly complement the story playing a opposing nature to one another, every side characters are there to move the story forward and not just shoehorned. Editing is breathtakingly beautiful, script holds perfectly tightly til the very end(even when the credits role), cinematography is top notch, music fits the tone of the film very neatly. I tried real hard to nitpick few flaws with this one but its just not there. This is a great hybrid of road trip comedy and biographic drama. Applause yourselves whoever have been involved with this gem because this is how you use real race issue and its history in a film."
GREEN BOOK,22 November 2018,7/10,I like this film but I could see EVERY cliche coming a mile away!
GREEN BOOK,11 July 2020,8/10,"This Movie made me fell in love with it.
It is an extremely blissful movie with awesome performances.
It is not an feel good movie but it's feel great movie.
Just go for it.
It's full of love and humanity"
GREEN BOOK,3 September 2019,8/10,"I was impressed by both Mortensen and Ali, and the story is alright. Camera work; more than solid, and it's like the 'best butter' you can find in an Old Hollywood type of way. However... my main complaint is a focus on dialogue scenes, particularly with the Lip's (Mortensen's) wife, played by Cardelini, that just drove a point home... too cute? I don't know, but these 'golden'-type moments in a 'golden'-type movie, just detracted from it all, from what I like, completely.Also, one final - minor - complaint I had that ticked me was Doc's seeing and observation of the rural black-Southern workers, who were looking back at Doc, dressed in his fine clothes and chauffeured in a car. That shot needed to be there, I'm pretty sure, and it goes to Doc's unsettled identity issues on race, gender and sexuality, later. However, it is, as a scene, comparable to Tarantino's own point on this in Django Unchained. So, it's like I've seen this point recently before, and this took away from the complete profundity of the moment, for me, in this film.Overall, worth a watch for all the good reasons people are saying though. A good Hollywood film."
GREEN BOOK,7 June 2019,9/10,"I've heard that many were unhappy with the fact that this film won the Oscars. On the contrary, I truly believe that this film deserve the Oscars. It was wonderfully made, from the script, the directing, and most of all, the acting.At the beginning of the film, I felt like there's nothing much going on in the film. However, as the film progressed, it kept getting better and better. This film is about mistreatments, friendship and learning to understand others from different point of view.At the heart of the film, we have two protagonists with nothing in common, Tony Lip, the crude driver and Dr. Donald Shirley, the African-American pianist, played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, respectively. These two are what moved the film. The two actors played their characters really well, and the chemistry between them is just simply fantastic to watch. I have heard many praises regarding Mahershala Ali's performance, and I was wondering what the fuss is all about. Watching him in this film, I finally understood why people love him. He was truly talented. Every subtle emotions he portrayed in the film are well conveyed, and I somehow felt related to him.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's thought provoking and heartwarming, at the same time. It's marvelous in every way, and you'll feel strangely satisfied at the end of the film."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2021,10/10,"One of the greatest greatest movies I have seen for years, great acting and story line, funny, sad, serious this movie has it all"
GREEN BOOK,1 June 2020,7/10,"""If I'm not black enough, or white enough, or a man enough, then tell me, Tony, who the hell am I"" - Congratulations, you're the most politically correct person."
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,8/10,"If I was not white enough. If I was not black enough, tell me who I am!.
This sentence that comes in the middle of the film almost embodies the content of the entire film.
I was reluctant to watch this film first, because the American director Peter Farrelly, one of the directors specialized in the manufacture of light comedy. There is an implicit fear of a distinguished director in the humor industry that would be able to make a biographical, dramatic film. But what I saw was truly amazing. Farley has outdone himself here.
For the first time, I see a highly professional film dealing with a recurring issue in American cinema, the issue of racism that America had more than 50 years ago. A very clever dramatic adaptation of the famous pianist Donald Shirley and his relationship with his white driver Tony Lip, who in turn had a somewhat racist view of black, but who, as a result of his need to work, agreed to become a driver for Shirley.
On a long journey towards the southern cities, Shirley plays for the white class, when it feels the importance of its culture when it listens to a genius. the story of the different style begins between the two people in a very sophisticated manner, especially from Mahershala as Shirley.
Interesting dialogues, cultural backgrounds, and dramatic development by influencing the other. Explains the racist concepts of circulation."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2019,3/10,"I had high expectations based on the positive reviews but was quite disappointed.The story had a good potential to explore a relationship between a sophisticated black pianist who employs a white working class driver as they travel through the US south in the sixties. They have seemingly nothing in common, from the way they were brought up, the way they speak and eat, their family backgrounds and financial situations, their way of treating other people. As they spend time together on the road trip, they start to appreciate each other and learn from each other.What bothered me was that the characters ended up being caricatures instead of being believable. The film tries to depict their differences to the point that it did not make sense. For example, we are supposed to believe that a black musical genius pianist never heard of Aretha Franklin or Little Richard? Or that he never tried fried chicken? I also thought that Viggo Mortensen was slightly over-acting.... The racial problems were not depicted in an authentic way.The movie just received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, likely because of the social commentary and not because of great film-making."
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2019,10/10,"Really deserved to be Oscar Winner!!
Great story with full of Life Lesson but Not so boring because many ""Fresh"" humour along the movie make this one really worthy to watch."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,8/10,"Set in 1962, when an racist Italian nightclub bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), who is searching for a new job because the place he worked is shut down a while for preservation. When he got into a bit of a financial problem he had to take a job as the position of chauffeur for black musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who is gonna do a tour through deep south. While on the road the two developed unlikely friendship and all these barrier between them came downIt said it is inspired by the true story but just watching at the story alone, you could tell that it is dramatized a lot.
Central piece of Green Book is Racism and it also talked about difference between race, class and about unlikely friendship but I don't feel the later part was truly evolved in the film.
Also one my biggest problem is Tony character development, he went from the man who dumped the glass used by two colored people to having a family dinner together with black man but it is not convincing and felt handled a bit rough.
But script address all the other things really well.
This got a lot of comedic moments and I loved them but when it tried to be serious, it is does turned into it and really engaging. I am aware of stereotyping problems here but I would say my certain enjoyment feeling took over all these things but it certainly got a problemTalking about two leads, both Viggo and Mahershala Ali did fantastic job, they got their respective nomination deservingly.
Viggo played quite the same role we seen him in his previous film like Eastern Promises and A History of Violence, a family man and a tough guy but this one got more humorous characteristic and hugh load of appetite for food.
Mahershala Ali got more dramatic moments to show his talent and his shone in all those moments. As performance wise Ali is more outstanding than Viggo hereFor everyone who is a sucker for sentimental movies, Green Book will surely work even if it not it will still entertain you.
Not even in a single tiny bit two are related but final part of the film reminded me of John Hughes Planes, Trains and Automobiles that kind of heartfel feeling is not something you can easily find in movies these days"
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,8/10,This is a fine movie. Definitely would recommend for good drama movie.
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2018,10/10,"At first I didn't want to see this movie but glad I did. What a phenomenal movie. First sometimes movies that are true stories are always a pleasure which I didn't know it was moments before it started. Acting was on point, the history of the men's friendship was funny and had its ups and downs. It also showed racism which was nice to further show how dumb people were and still are about it but then again Morgan Freeman said it best. "" It's only around because people keep talking about it."" But back to the movie it had its laughs, sad moment and just an all around solid movie I'm glad I went and watched it."
GREEN BOOK,7 May 2019,10/10,"I do not want to spoil anything.
But this was funny and heartwarming.
Watch this fantastic story, or you will miss out."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,"Two completely different types of person who became good friends at the end after a long journey. The film shows how difficult it is to find one's place in American society in the 1960s as an Afro-American who's additionally confrontated with the life of a star. All he needs is just a normal life style, and this is what he learns from someone living in the Bronx with any education. Considering the circumstances, it's an amusing story that really touches your heart."
GREEN BOOK,22 December 2018,7/10,"While this is an interesting movie, somehow, I can't say that it is great. Sure, the actors are flawless, the images are splendid, the editing is impeccable, the sound is perfect. There are no dull moments when the action seems stalled. Yet, I had a constant impression of déjà vu. I constantly thought of Driving Miss Daisy, Intouchables and, up to a certain level, Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Not to say that the movie is copy-paste of proven hits, but the result just wasn't as striking as I hoped it woud be."
GREEN BOOK,4 January 2021,9/10,"With so many awards you come to expect quite a lot from this movie. This film led up to all my expectations.From the very beginning of the film I was engaged and with a blink of an eyelid an hour had passed. I have seen very few movies that address prejudice quite like this. This film provides a much more calculated approach whereby showing the impact of how seemingly insignificant ""minor"" discrimination can damage an individual.Amazing watch would recommend to everyone."
GREEN BOOK,25 July 2020,8/10,"The strength of the film is that the script is solid, and it excels in characterization and detail. At the end of this journey, Dr. don Shirley can not prove his status in the white people's mind. He is in a lonely situation, and no one can help him, unless he reconciles with himself and completes a self redemption. It doesn't preach anything, but everyone can see what happened to some groups in different times, not just black and white. The theme of this film is just like the finishing line in the film. Because genius is not enough, only courage can change people's heart. This is a film about courage and change."
GREEN BOOK,2 July 2020,7/10,"Two people with vastly different skin color, class, personality and sexual orientation are bonded by music and become lifelong friends by road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough. It takes courage."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,9/10,"So far we had 12 years a slave, Django unchained.. and now we have got this! This goes far beyond friendship development between bad boy and a nice guy.. it touches you where you didn't expect. It touches your humane part. History and it's dark sides, violence and romance! It gives you it all and hits you hard. Enjoy!"
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,9/10,"With some films you can tell from the first minute that it is going to be good, well acted, well scripted, well directed. This was no exception and the greater than average running time passed effortlessly. Wonderful performances from the two leads, quite a bit of humour, and heaven if you love cars from the 1950s and 60s. Don't buy the criticism of too much predictability. Apart from one scene about halfway through where you could more or less guess how it would play out, this film surprised more than it fulfilled predictions. Nothing was more touching than the postscript. If you believe in a meaningful universe, it was as if Tony and Don were destined to meet and make each other grow."
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2021,10/10,"What an absolutely brilliant film. Tremendous screenplay and direction, with two excellent performances by Ali and Mortensen.
This was one of the most original fact based stories I've seen, and certainly deserves an award or two.
The film follows the journey of two very unlikely companions to the southern states in the early sixties, who experience some interesting and problematic situations. To say any more in this critique might spoil it for others, so I will not proceed any further with the story.Enjoy, I did very much."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,9/10,"Having read an interview with Viggo Mortensen recently I was curious about this movie. I was not disappointed. Both he and Mahershala Ali are excellent in this movie, and are working with a great script. It's a nice change to watch movie and not feel like you just wasted 2 hours of your life. Very enjoyable!"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,7/10,"I understad why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been condition to abide to his whole life."
GREEN BOOK,13 February 2019,9/10,This is a brilliant film with just enough humour and heart. The characters are interesting and you find yourself drawn into the story from the word go.
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,10/10,"This movie has it all, I laughed, I was touched emotionally, It left me with a great feeling of how two completely different persons in every way become the best of friends. Both acting performances are masterpieces. I liked every minute of this film and it thaught me a lot of things about humanity.
To me it was a must see movie in my all time favourite movie list."
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2019,8/10,"From the first minutes watching this family, we can knew both main characters has their own ego. They act incredibly as seen as they have their own idealism. Both story and act are very well presented.But the intro while applying a job is not hit me. ""The Upside"" still has a better intro and hit me up while applying the job"
GREEN BOOK,16 April 2020,10/10,"The color matching version of ""untouchable"", a road trip across the United States, but also a human journey across race and color, identity and class. All the subordinates were respectful to Tang. Only Tony treated him as an ordinary person, gave him fried chicken and told him the real idea. It's true not to discriminate against him by not treating him as black. On the other hand, Tang was discriminated and insulted by other people. He always held his breath. The audience who listened to him could eat in the restaurant, but not as a performer. It was Tony who taught him to fight back, to speak for himself and to defend his rights and dignity. It's ironic to be treated unfairly in the so-called ""high-end and noble"" places, but to be respected and supported in the ""low-end and humble"" black bars. Genius is not enough. Only courage can change people's hearts. Since he doesn't think about your feelings, why do you take care of his emotions? Bear to push forward for a while and step back to make progress. Violence won't win you anything, but cowardice is always a loser. Only by confronting the malice of life can we defeat it"
GREEN BOOK,13 May 2020,8/10,"The character development is wonderful. It was a story of friendship, love, and family"
GREEN BOOK,5 June 2020,9/10,"The director USES a clever Angle to show the audience the injustice of the time and the inner entanglements of the musicians. Although he has performed at various important events since he was a child, his most successful performance was at a small black bar on Christmas Eve. He finally chose to stand up for himself and not give in to discrimination. The ending is warm and touching. It's really a good movie."
GREEN BOOK,15 November 2018,10/10,"I absolutely loved this movie. Such a heart warming story about true friendships, overcoming prejudices, and battling racism in the 60s. The performances were beyond stellar. I laughed, cried, and even cringed several times at the racial slurs and horrible treatment of Doc. Watching their friendship develop gave me hope, which is something we need more of today. The story is a perfect reminder of how we can overcome things when we come together. I wish everyone would watch this film."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,10/10,"There are seldom any movies released today that compare with Green Book. This is a well written and acted film that spans comedy and pathos. The performances by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are award worthy. The filming in period locations using vintage cars and fashions was outstanding. The story of the seedy ""colored only"" hotels and the overt apartheid of the deep South of the early 60s was revealed through the eyes and feelings of the pompous but educated and musically talented black man and his white Bronx-raised chauffeur. Both characters took a journey together for two months on the tour-stop road and learned great lessons about each other. There were powerful scenes throughout the film that left one amused and uneasy. Nevertheless, this was a completely unexpected treat and one that I would heartily recommend."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,9/10,I started this with the lowest expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the end.Viggo mortensen and mahershala ali give oscar worthy performances in a movie that will become a classic in the years to come.Minus point:The Japanese barman of the Italian-mafia restaurant in 1950s America.I mean that was pretty laughable
GREEN BOOK,9 January 2019,10/10,"Clever, thoughtful, entertaining. Great script and performances. What a great film experience."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,"It's a powerful movie to portray the reality of racism in our society. Even the story occurred in 1962 with the segregation, and I was amazed by the fact that injustice had slowly progressed over time. As a white man, it seemed to me that racism showed in an obvious way in the past. However, that still run in today's society in more of a discreet way. It's due to the social media where it becomes the world in a smaller place. The stubborn white people become smarter to avoid the obvious. Tony Lip is a perfect example of many naive white men who were being surrounded by blue collars. They're not bothered to learn about the society through a different lens because they see survival in simply way at finest as a priority. Many of them are soft-hearted, but they overlook that sense for the reason of survival.Dr. Don Shirley is a perfect example of many people of color. They come from well-educated backgrounds that influence their struggles to find the identity. Both worlds are pushing them for different reasons. My family members and my close friends had to go through the phase of being depressed and used substances for escapism, especially in their 20s.Tony Lip and Dr. Shirley had crossed down from entirely different journeys. Tony's style of approach was interesting and very common for white men. He spoke out of his mind, but Shirley was smart enough to read inside of him. At the same time, Tony pushed Shirley out of his comfort zone with his simple-minded perspective of society. And, Shirley pushed him to be engaged in his feeling and looked through a different lens. The friendship was raw, but they appreciated each other.It demonstrated that nobody deserves to be quickly judged by others because everyone's journey is different like orange to apple. It had several funny moments that made me laugh, softhearted moments that made me smile, and the message was profound! Well-deserved to win the Best Picture award!"
GREEN BOOK,23 December 2020,10/10,"A thoroughly enjoyable, touching movie with brilliant flashes of Italian-American humour throughout."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,9/10,"There are very few movies out there that are both great movies and great Christmas movies, and this is definitely amongst the few.Do yourself a favour, and if you haven't seen this yet, save it for Christmas Eve."
GREEN BOOK,12 April 2019,10/10,"After I saw the great reviews I decided to give this movie a try. This is definitely a memorable film. I sincerely appreciate the Directors, Actors and the entire Production Team for doing this film."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,7/10,"The two actors play a great performance, their relationship lead the story trough the South part of Us, the more racist.
It's a nice story which you can watch till the end without being bored."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book is one kind of film I can never ever forget and it remains with me even after I die and turn to the ashes. This is not just a film but one of the greatest lessons learned that counters Racism flawlessly. Set up in the vintage backdrop gets me going and I loved the simplicity of the film that's what it stands for. So Black or White, people gel by their heart and by choice. The entire film had me in the state of Euphoria and in the end the tears kept flowing and I don't know why"
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,9/10,"This is one of those movies that no-one wants to leave when the credits roll round. Based on a true story it plots the unfolding of an unlikely friendship between diamond in the rough Bronx-born Italian Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). Shirley is a concert pianist who needs a driver and some protective muscle as he tours the prejudiced South during the early 60's. Shirley is too cultured to fit in with his own race but too black to fit in with the white one. His internal conflict, Tony's external one as a coloured man's minder, and the friendship that develops make for riveting cinema. There is drama, hilarity, education and pathos in this wonderful movie. A masterpiece."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,7/10,"This movie was uplifting. It was based on the association/friendship between two men, but it is, for the most part, fiction. It is only loosely based on truth. To please Hollywood, they put in the part about Don Shirley being caught having sex with another man at a YMCA. According to what I have read, this never happened. It surprises me that Hollywood is so concerned about furthering the cause of the LGBT community, and about paying homage to the plight of African Americans in this country, yet they give the Academy Award to a film that portrays an Italian American man in the worst light. This film plays off a stereotype that insults the intelligence. This movie portrays Frank Anthony Vallelonga as a total idiot. That he wasn't. He was a very intelligent actor. If he were alive today, I am sure that he would object to his name being placed on this character in the film. I am sure that Don Shirley would object to the way his character is portrayed, as well."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,10/10,"Diane and I watched this brilliant movie yesterday, and we were both extremely impressed by the sympathetic writing of the, what could be an explosive script. Any film that attempts to travel the extremely volatile paths of this movie is bound to make viewers hugely nervous, and it did, at least for me.
The pre-desegregationist Deep South might be unfamiliar to many viewers, but the film dealt with the realities of being a Black Person in that awful area with sensitivity and understanding; we admired the scriptwriter's ability to do so. The penultimate scenes were particularly good with their dealing of this point; the pianist faced his worse moment when he was forced to dress in the broom closet before the performance even though he was a world-class performer.
Every performer connected with this film is of award-winning stature. See this movie, or you will miss out on a superb piece of contemporary film-art."
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2020,9/10,"Well as we get at some point in life that once our Human Nature/Character is developed it gets fixed forever whatsoever comes in way as influence it won't change... The movie is about the very human nature that makes change in character of these two guys Don & Tony by mutual behaviour at stage of midlife.. interesting to see how they retaliate it & enjoy the karavan..
Though the racism is revolving around but it doesn't impact much on liking the movie as it progresses.. Afterall it's our very lovely instinct of forgiving & accepting others is crucial to live happily..merry Christmas"
GREEN BOOK,13 December 2018,10/10,"Viggo Mortensen is especially outstanding. One of the top movies of the year. This is a film that bis extremely entertaining and at the same time, teaches a valuable lesson, especially to young people who cannot imagine a time like this in America! At the same time, it's filled with great humor. 10+"
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,"Forget about analyzing a film in sections, talking about its cinematography or the production design, or the choices the director made to work with actors that may or may not have acted before. 2018 was cluttered with talks about films that pure and simply did not have compelling stories but somehow made it to the festival headlines. Thankfully, this was NOT this type of film. The fact that Green Book is able to cohesively tell a heart-warming tale of two men from different ethnicities who become friends in the early sixties USA, and somehow get the attention of even the most cynical of centennials, is an unbelievable achievement in itself. Add the fact that the script was inspired by true events, written by Frank Vallelonga's son, and that the director of ""There's Something About Mary"" was the astonishingly best choice to take this ship to sale, and you got something special. The film is funny, witty, controversial, and simply put: beautiful. And how about that Viggo Mortensen? The guy can go from Sigmund Freud to a hippie living in the wilderness to an Italian garbage truck driver in a split second, and you believe every word that comes out of his mouth. He deserved the Oscar for this in my book."
GREEN BOOK,10 October 2019,10/10,"This movie is very, very good. It perfectly demonstrates how there used to be racism in America. Viggo's acting is off the charts and he perfectly represents the lower class Italians of the time. Deserving of an Oscar and shows the bond between two different people as they learn to accept each other."
GREEN BOOK,6 November 2021,7/10,"An enjoyable film in the mold of the unlikely buddy drama/comedy, with a core focus on issues of race and class; a period-piece from the early 60s based on real-life events. I thought the acting was quite strong and held the film together well. Sensitive issues were addressed sensibly and mostly poignantly (albeit more on the ""playing it safe"" side). The pace was also good, it never got boring.What held it back a few notches were the storyboard and scriptwriting, which were fine but not great. The storyboard veered towards instrumentalism - next you need a scene showing x,y,z, so here is a scene showing x,y,z - i.e. Compartmentalized to showcase a few key messages. Similarly, the scriptwriting was a bit too literal and overt in a few too many spots. The actors were plenty capable of conveying nuance more subtly, that parts of the dialogue seemed a bit forced and unneeded. I suppose that was just the mass market orientation but there could have been a tad more cleverness and touch.Overall, I might struggle to identify any truly memorable scenes for posterity, but the execution from start to finish was solid and I consider it a good and worthy contribution."
GREEN BOOK,4 July 2020,2/10,"This is a simple movie for simple minds. Its premise is a hackneyed plot device served up in cartoonish bite sized bits. The premise: A sophisticated man and a thug are thrown together by fate, and ultimately both learn from and are enriched by this relationship. And when you make one black and one white, and set it in the racist 1960's, the stage is set for the director to make a grandiose statement regarding race. On a sophomoric level, if only we took the time to know each other better we'd all get along better. But more insidiously - and the message Academy Awards voters responded to - that horrible, racial injustice is a thing of the past, and we can now all pat ourselves on the back with how much better things have become.
The problem is, for 2018 when the film was made, and for 2020 when the film is viewed, this saccharine re-writing of current history doesn't wash. Sorry 2018 Academy Awards voters, racism isn't something relegated to the past, from those bad old 60's, and Americans have no reason to pat themselves on the back with how much racial justice has improved since then. Given current events (2020), the movie's message seems even more unreal - and insipid - than when originally released.
The movie is a cartoon both in character development and in events. In an establishing scene the white character throws away some glasses simply because they were drunk from by black men. Yet moments later he is taking a job to work, drive and eat with a black man for an 8 week gig. In another preposterous scene, the black man is feted in a wealthy man's mansion, in fact he is the guest of honour, yet moments later he is forbidden from using the rest room and directed to an out-house visible from the window. As if.
The movie is a slog to sit through and scenes constructed to be hilarious - like eating fried chicken in the car - are inevitably excruciating to watch. There is little pay off for spending two hours of time watching this whitewash of a movie."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2020,8/10,"Worth watching.
Story of real people with real connection."
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2020,3/10,"Are our films so bad now that this piece of cr-p is considered one of the best movies of 2018? The film is rife with stereotypes of every kind. The scenes are so predictable. I knew what was going to happen next in every scene. And the dialog is written in 2018 vernacular (e.g., no one said ""travelling while black"" in 1962). This movie was so boring that I turned it off after 90 minutes. Don't waste your time."
GREEN BOOK,4 January 2020,8/10,"After a bit of an uneven start, this movie takes off and pulls you into the friendship between these two very different men during a time of much racial upheaval. I don't see a ""white savior"" controversy here as some reviews noted. I think that both men saved EACH OTHER in unique ways. If anything, this movie walks a very careful line at being almost too nice and too safe in its portrayal of some really dark things. Impressive performances from both lead actors."
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2020,10/10,"Years from now, when I'm old and feeble this will be one movie that I will recall with fond memories. It will go down in history with classic movies like Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and It's A Wonderful Life. Not only is the movie funny and heart warming, it teaches you a valuable lesson about very different people coming together in very different and unexpected ways despite their differences. Not only that, but it has lovely and incredible music. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!"
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,9/10,...that you don't want to end. This was a fantastic movie. Great acting. Great story. A shame that Viggo Mortensen didnt win the oscar for best actor.
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,2/10,"It is almost as stereotypical of a film as Crash. This was made for one reason, to appease. Film and TV are extremely competitive nowadays so we have relentless pandering to every little discrepancy and art has suffered in lieu of profit.Music is dead and so is film now. At least in America"
GREEN BOOK,20 December 2018,9/10,This film is a spectacle to behold. After first watching this movie I knew it was good but it has gotten even better the more and more I think about it. It was just simply amazing. This movie is a movie that has sort of went under the radar but I loved it and the reviews show that the people and critics have also loved it. 9/10 easily.
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2019,5/10,"Nice production, first 15 mins were entertaining and the rest was just OK. I really expected something a little edgier. I truly don't understand the roaring accolades this one is getting.
So to sum it up - it's worth a watch."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,4/10,"Terrible acting, TERRIBLE. No chemistry between the two main chracters. Cliché all the way through. What was the Academy thinking?!"
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,8/10,"Green BookRating: A-Green Book is a rare style of film these days in Hollywood. It's a drama, without being unrealistic and drawn out. A comedy, with a sincere, very relevant message.Set back in 1962, we meet Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), an impulsive, profanity using, Italian-American bouncer living in New York. After he loses his job, he gains an interview with Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an enigmatic, African-American pianist, who offers Tony the task of driving him around from gig to gig. The problem being that Dr. Shirley was to be playing down south, where people were not as accepting of his race. Tony agrees, even though the job will require him to be absent from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and his two young sons.Tony and Dr. Shirley seem opposites in many ways, however they are both outcasts, and use their differences from the normal folk to connect with each other. Through the movie, Tony becomes more accepting of people that may have seen worlds apart to him before, and he becomes protective of Dr. Shirley, and strives to become more in touch with his emotions. Whereas Dr. Shirley realizes just how different he is from most African-Americans at that time, him being a rich pianist with no wife or children to take care of. With Tony's influence, Dr. Shirley also becomes less uptight and willing to let loose every now and then.Green Book has something for everyone and deserves all the awards attention it has been getting. Don't miss this wonderful movie!"
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,,"About equal parts comedy & drama that shows the budding friendship of a white man & a black man by seeing the Jim Crow South first hand. It deals with racism & prejudice by exploring a man's attempt to make it in the world when he isn't fully accepted by either community, asking how someone can be black but not ""black enough."" It shows how these two people from vastly different walks of life come to understand & care about the other while highlighting the dichotomy of the American South in the 1960s, where a black man could perform for a group of white people but couldn't eat in the same restaurant with them. The performances are phenomenal here with both Mahershala Ali & Viggo Mortensen completely selling the changing relationship in this situation. Linda Cardellini gives a much more subtle but just as spellbinding performance as Dolores Vallelonga. Shot well & with an amazing soundtrack, this film is as important as it is entertaining, like Driving Miss Daisy (1989) in reverse."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,9/10,"Heartwarming is a perfect way to describe the developed relationship between Ali and Mortensen. Both of their acting fully submerged me into the story, and the humor sprinkled into Mortenson's part is a reminder that this movie sends a good message. Nothing, race, family, skill, or sexuality can mar this relationship that takes us through a roller coaster of racially backed scenarios."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,8/10,"It was good, make no mistake about it, just not quite as good as I was hoping for from an Academy Award Best Picture.Performances were excellent, as were the period settings. Scripting mostly good, though I'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of modern expressions that crept into the dialogue that were not in popular use at the time.My biggest complaint is the predictability of the plot. No surprises whatsoever. Runner up is the stereotyping of Italian Americans, particularly annoying in a movie that challenges stereotyping of blacks."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,"This film is the combination of 42, Hidden Figures, and Bohemian Rhapsody, and captures almost every good thing those films gave us. Dr. Shirley is played impeccably by Mahershala Ali, whose lonely poise is heartbreaking to watch. Viggo Mortenson captures the essence of 1960s New York City in his blundering innocence and assumptions of the world around him. Beautifully shot and directed, the movie is more than an unexpected friendship, it is one of discovery of the other sides of America."
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,9/10,"I was happy during watching this movie, because some of audience were laughing.
Usually, it's not happen in Japan.
This movie makes me smile and happy.
Italian main character's talking is very funny.
However, the others main character who is pianist is also funny.
Their combination makes success this movie."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,7/10,"Great characters, good acting, great storyline and a lot of laughter. Really, really enjoyable movie from the start."
GREEN BOOK,18 January 2020,10/10,"Green Book, if I say it's the best movie from 2018 I wouldn't be wrong. Green Book, based on a true friendship story, really it has a great script and awesome direction. Plus, the portrayal and acting were perfect. Although Green Book won Oscars, but still I would say it's underrated.
I wouldn't spoil the movie, go and watch it. Trust me you're gonna love it"
GREEN BOOK,28 March 2019,10/10,"""Green Book"" ist one of this little gems among big-budget perfections, which are more and more polished and boring.The two main characters (both brought incredible performances) are one of the rare examples of glorious chemistry of actors.
It's the perfect 50's bromance, and everything looks realistic, not exaggerated.Instant classic!"
GREEN BOOK,5 April 2021,9/10,"Loved it! The acting was great, it was somehow both dramatic and light hearted at the same time."
GREEN BOOK,7 August 2021,5/10,Decent movie. A complete lie says the family. The actors in the movie do a good job but the creation of this movie is screwed up.
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,9/10,"Loved this movie: the leads are true to their characters, good and bad. The story is both believable and unbelievable - who would tour the deep south in 1962 as a black classical/jazz musician? The way the world treats these two, it hurts and it raises them up. I'll probably go see it again before it leaves the theaters."
GREEN BOOK,17 April 2019,8/10,The characters are phenomenally performed. A comical and cohesive dichotomy between Tony & Don make this movie one that is easy to enjoy from start to end. It has the zest of Forrest Gump and will appeal to anyone who loves a good odd couple.
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,"One of the reasons why I love this movie is simply because we are soooo much more. We as ""Black"" people have rich, intriguing, moving, and funny stories-I hate that we are sitting around waiting for the Next Great Director make movies in which the narratives do more than entertain. I hope Tyler Perry would be one of those innovative directors, but now I don't care who tells it-as long as it gets told. Thank you to the writer and director for such a moving movie that touches more than my funny bone."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,10/10,If you like music and a good history about friends you have to watch this movie. Viggo was so good and truly deserved an Oscar for this role.I am happy that this won the Best Movie. Such a marvel to watch.
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,8/10,"Peter Farrelly has done an excellent job here in what can be described as his debut into the genre of drama. Don't be misled however, this film is in no shortage of comic moments to be found in the partnership between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali; which goes from strength to strength. It must be said that both fully are deserving their respective Oscar nominations. Furthermore, the issue of race is dealt with in a notably tasteful manor; underpinning the story plot by vividly portraying the struggles of a black man in Southern America. Nonetheless, the film succeeds in almost having a 'feel-good' theme with respect to the relationship between Dr Don Shirley and Tony Lip, which blossoms as their journey goes on, overcoming both their own respective prejudices and the prejudices of the people around them."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,9/10,"For me the well cast duo made the movie. Their dynamic is great enough to bring the story to heart touching life.
Ali and Mortenson are gold."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,3/10,So superficial. Without conflicts. It's impossible to believe in Mortensen's character: noboby can't change its highly racist behavior so easily.
GREEN BOOK,10 June 2020,9/10,"A great story is buoyed by fabulous acting, some terrific situational drama, and just the right amount of hilarious malapropisms. GB is comical and heartbreaking, occasionally in the same moment. It perpetuates certain stereotypes while turning others on their head, all the while showing a humanity that inherently lies underneath them all."
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2021,8/10,"It such a great movie, If you take out racism on black people debate in the film. You can also relate to Don Shirley's character. There are a lot of people around the world gone through that situation and still going through this, where certain people would make feel unwanted and underserving. It hurts and pains me alot to see how world has been unfair to people cause of their skin color, faith in certain religion and those people who are different and inability to do something. People who gone through depression and mental issue also faced this kind of issues and it doesn't feels right. You can't over power people,treat them badly or make them feel neglected or disregarded cause you're superior or richer from them. It's not right, World not only for certain people. This movie will provide great deal education for those people who still keeping hateful thoughts inside their minds, World has no place for hate. I hope people's thoughts change after seeing this movie."
GREEN BOOK,1 August 2021,7/10,American version of the Intouchables (2011).This movie deals with important topics such as racism.
GREEN BOOK,20 April 2021,10/10,"I sometimes share my take on films and TV shows here when they either give me a bad case of cinematic tourista or send me into deliriums of admiration. Other than film school, I haven't spent so much time during these lockdowns exploring the moviesphere and discovering a glittering gem here and there or something you'd scrape off the bottom of your shoe. I've also revisited favourites and discovered that a Breaking Bad, say, is just as good the 16th time around. Netflix has become my movie feeding trough.A few years ago, when features devolved into an insipid soup of cookiecutter plots featuring two-dimensional superheroes bouncing off skyscrapers and irritating, ugly AF villains, I did my own cancel culture on Hollywood. I refused to go to the cinema. I decided my days as a film fan boy were over. I'd stick to my collection of DVDs and was none the happier. Then HBO happened. Deadwood happened. Six Feet Under happened. And there was The Sopranos. Nothing before or after has satisfied my gluttonous hunger for good stories. I dug a deep hole in the cultural desert and buried feature film. It was dead to me.I will also skip films that give off that woke vibe. These days, one cannot help but dibble-dabble in the political muck, even in a film review. There's a pervasive foul odour in the zeitgeist. An insane head-first dive into societal woes that has put a sharp focus on certain issues, telling us they're systemic. I suppose that's why so many visible minorities want to immigrate here. Of course, there will always be the few dunderheads of this good Earth who think they're superior to certain groups not in their gene pool. These people are human aberrations. They do not represent the vast majority. This obsession with race and identity has become intolerable for me. It divides. Segregates us into tribes and parachutes us back fifty years when these problems were real. It creates an atmosphere of distrust and hate that sometimes (too often) manifests itself in horrible acts of violence.The well-meaning but feeble-minded munchkins of La La Land had made it clear moving forward. You can only qualify for an Oscar nomination if your project includes any of a number of diversity points. D. I. E.: Diversity, Inclusion, Equity. Words that represent everything good in our society and tell me instantly what I should avoid. I refuse to be made to feel guilty for the lack of melanin in my skin and the sins of our fathers. It wouldn't have sparked a single synapse in my brain just a few short years ago and I will not succumb to what is the real contagion among us.As I scrolled through the Netflix thumbnails wondering if I was going to watch Fargo the series for the 30th time, I stopped on a new release. ""Oh, here we go."" Another virtue signalling whack to the back of my head. I was just about to click the next button when I hesitated. ""Wait a sec. Didn't this thing win a bunch of Oscars?"" I pondered the poster of a stuck-up black dude sitting in the back of a '62 limo with a white chauffeur who looked like he fell off the FBI's Most Wanted list. What was it going to be? The Babysitter Redux (purely as an academic study of film structure) or Driving Mister Daisy?What the hell. I love Viggo Mortensen, so Toilet Training Day it was, with my finger strategically on the stop button.Fifteen minutes later, I was laughing and choking up at what I was experiencing. I haven't been this taken by a film from fade-in to fade-out since Silver Linings Playbook. Dare I say, Casablanca?An old film associate of mine sprung one on me when I was struggling with a screenplay. ""Pull the Italian card when it doubt."" Sorry. It never gets old. Penned by Nick Vallelonga, son of the real-life Tony Lip, and directed by Something About Mary's Peter Farrelly, Green Book is the true story of a tough Copacabana bouncer and an accomplished black pianist who set off on a string of performances through the Deep South of the early 1960s. Complications ensue, y'all.And what is a Green Book? You'll find out soon enough. The revelation is one of the strongest thematic elements I've seen in a film. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this little book is worth an entire library.Everything about this movie is deliciously edible. Viggo Mortensen as Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga pulls off a Bronx goomba with his virtuoso grease ball portrayal and a surprising command of Italian dialect. He even scoffed up a Robert De Niro/Raging Bull beer belly for the role.Embodying an African-American NYC society bunny known for his talent on the ivory keys is the transcendent Mahershala Ali. No, he's not a pianist. A few months of practice and a stand-in sold it. Ali won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Green Book, after picking up the award in 2017 for Moonlight. I would have handed a Best Actor to Viggo, but thems the breaks in the fickle marshmallow world of Lotus Land.The story, dialogue and character arcs are perfect storms. And the cast is peppered with actual Vallelonga family members, adding to its realism and appeal. For those in the know, the Italian Christmas Eve seafood meal is authentic.I'm watching this again very soon and the screenplay is downloaded, ready to read.Goodfellas meets 12 Years a Slave."
GREEN BOOK,7 December 2020,9/10,"I personally loved this film - the camera shots were great, the plot stayed true to itself, the DIALOGUE and ACTING were superbly done, and there was a great sense of musical appeal to me. We have been listening to a lot of Don Shirley & The Trio after watching this movie.In some places, I did feel like some things were moving too fast, although for the sake of time and the movie I'm willing to offer some leverage.An excellent 9/10 in my eyes."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2021,10/10,This movie is just so beautiful & such a fun joy ride & such a art when it comes to adressing history & showing us a little more into the culture of music & Mahershala Ali is such a master piaonist & his music is so heartwarming & powerful & I say this movie is for those who are tryin to find the soul in Music. Ooh also Viggo Mortenson was soo flippin funny in this movie & such a great actor <3.
GREEN BOOK,22 July 2021,8/10,"This movie speaks to two social issues still relevant today. Even though it is set in the 60's, its still very much relatable to the African-American and LGBTQ community. I think there is a trend going on where movies have to be overloaded with messages about social issues and overwhelm the audience with emotional content. This movie does do that but NOT in an overwhelming way, more classy.This speaks a lot to the main character Dr. Don Shirley. He is a closeted gay African-American Musician. Not the most generic type of person. But he is very sophisticated and proper and I think he elevates the film to be more flattering. His character in contrast to Tony Lip, a tuff mob type of guy with family values and a hard hitting personality. The dynamic between the two is quite interesting and captivates the audience quite well when we see the friendship grow.Tony Lip begins the movie not really sure what Dr. Shirley is all about. A bit thrown off by him, even if he doesn't want to admit to it. We get introduced to Dr. Shirley through Tony and learn more about him as Tony does. The friendship takes off when the two tour together for Dr Shirley's band and they have to go through the deep south. A very discriminative part of the USA.Tony becomes his protector and friend, maybe his only friend. Its a beautiful well put together film."
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2019,10/10,"This film was flawlessly executed. It reminds me of and was as good as The Intouchables, currently being remade as The Upside. Both are about two people from very different backgrounds who bring something vital to the other. Both stories are told with warmth and humor. Definitely Oscar worthy."
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,10/10,"WOW! Probably the best fell good movie in years. Great telling of an amazing story with obviously, award winning acting. Viggo Mortensen is phenomenal. Were he not against one of the toughest fields for best actor in years, he would have cleaned up with all of the different awards given out. At least AARP Movies for Grownups Awards got it right by giving Mortensen the Best Actor award. One of the few movies that I wanted to watch again as soon as it ended."
GREEN BOOK,21 May 2019,9/10,"I think this Movie shows you in a really hard Way the problems in the 60's of the South States in the US.
Its dramatic and emotional throughout the whole Movie!
Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen is an amazing Actor Duo which u can clearly see.
They were made to be in this Movie."
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"Simply the best film of the year.
Even if you don't watch any other movies for the next 12 months you can't miss this one.
Truly great."
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,10/10,"I just watched it last night. Those 2hrs passed quickly, kept my attention whole time and ended with smile on my face. Superb acting, overall just really well done, i still think about the movie.. 👌"
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2019,10/10,"It reminded me a little bit of Intouchable. Same kind of humor. It was hilarious, But also very hard.
Its about an italian racist who have to drive a black pianist around to pay his rent."
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2018,9/10,"This film starts with a modest story, adequately told in the trailer and plot summary. I went because it sounded interesting, but I wasn't excited about it. The film surpassed my expectations, and I left the theater feeling entertained, better informed about history, and with renewed faith in human nature. The film develops the friendship between the two men as it shows the society of the early 1960s in the North East, the Midwest, and the South. It also exposed me to some modern jazz I hadn't heard, and some traditional jazz from the South that I was familiar with. It reminded me of the richness of American music. The prejudice of their time was depicted in a realistic enough way to bring up anxiety over the fear that minorities faced. In their time racism was ubiquitous; today it is dormant, but the last two years have reminded us that it can rise again if we allow it to. The two men brought their own biases to their meeting and working together, but their humanity and basic good will allowed them to see each other as individuals, overcome their biases, and support one another more over the course of their tour. The issues they faced were at times deathly serious, but their ability to laugh at absurd situations kept the overall tone from becoming dark. In the end, the film seemed like a mixture of comedy, light tragedy, and road trip. I highly recommend the film."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,10/10,Beautiful storytelling. Edited properly. Acted wonderfully. Thoroughly entertaining. No agendas.
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,9/10,"Great , Great and Great stuff. Just go and watch the movie. That will be the justice for the hard work put in this movie."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,9/10,🗒It was NOT a typical Oscar type movie and possesses much greater appeal to audiences of all kind and is not some boring art piece but a well paced feel good 🎥 movie that deserves the hype-- Viggo Mortensen doesn't ever seem to have a real chance at winning an Oscar but his performance was the greatest in this not so newly inventive but quite truly a teaching piece
GREEN BOOK,12 December 2018,,"Loved this film, it's a meaningful and touching movie. Brings back memories."
GREEN BOOK,19 July 2019,10/10,Honestly one of the best movies ever made.The chemistry of the 3 main characters is electric. The movie is golden and will in no doubt become an all time classic.Do yourself a favour and grab a quiet room.for a couple of hours and enjoy.
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,9/10,No wonder these gentlemen were nominated for Oscar's. The best acting I've seen in awhile. Virgo is superb. After the movie it's almost like Tony Lip could have been your neighbor you know him so well.
GREEN BOOK,5 September 2020,9/10,"Another Saturday and what shall we watch? - Green Book.
Its based on a true story - a tale of an unlikely friendship set against the racism and prejudice of 1960's America. Delightfully filmed, and extremely thought provoking we join the main characters on their unorthodox journey through the deep South of America and witness the kindness and the hatred of man against man.It's an extremely enjoyable film and highly recommended - one that I am sure you will remember for some time."
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,10/10,"Didn't know what to expect from this film but I have to say it moved me beyond words. Yet again viggo doesn't fail to captivate his audience as does mahershala. Compelling story depicting the struggles of this era, the strong friendship which forms between the two characters. Wow what heart warming film which also brings much humour from viggo, sadness and just an amazing film. Deserves awards and an absolute must see. If your pondering like I was..DON'T & you won't be disappointed!! Will be watching this again..too compelling & wonderful not to."
GREEN BOOK,19 June 2019,9/10,Loved this movie. Some points of the story could be a bit better explained/explored but overall is a successful movie
GREEN BOOK,17 November 2019,6/10,"""The Odd couple"" goes on woke trip. Reminded me of planes trains and automobiles .im sure theres a real story to be told here but this is Hollywood as its most cliched cartoonish and superficial.
Find leads deserve for nuance subtlety and realism."
GREEN BOOK,12 December 2020,10/10,"Just like the Intouchables, this is a movie about an unlikely friendship that you start to love. A solid 10/10 that you have to watch no matter what type of movie genres you like. I currently have 11 10 star movies and this is one of them. Stunning"
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2020,10/10,"The chemistry between Tony and Doc is fantastic. Thet are completly opposites, but the situation they are in brings them closer and closer.
Also, both actors made an absolutly remarkable work."
GREEN BOOK,5 September 2020,1/10,"Italian stereotypes, black stereotypes, deep South stereotypes, ""cultivated"" people stereotypes. They intended this movie for people who can't think without prejudices."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,8/10,"Sweet story about friendship and accepting people that are different from us, Mortensen and Ali gave very good performances, especially Mahershala Ali. Everything else about the movie was good, the script, music and directing, but the second half of the movie was not as good as the first one, and towards the ending you start to predict what will the next scene's general atmosphere be like (happy or sad i mean), till you reach the final scene which is a bit cliche and very expected.
It's a nice movie but i do not think that it deserves the oscar for best picture, especially with contenders like Roma & The Favourite.
7.5/10"
GREEN BOOK,8 November 2019,9/10,"Marhershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are simply amazing in this film. The acting was spot on, Mortensen's ""Tony the Lip"" was wonderfully comedic as the foil to the intelligence of Ali's Don Shirley or the Doc as they called him. The pair worked together wonderfully well together and on screen it did look like a convincing pairing. The story is simple enough to follow, the majority light hearted and funny but also it deals with issues such as the racial injustice of the deep south at the time. The character of Don Shirley is complicated which Ali shows his depth to bring this character to screen. My wife and I were thoroughly entertained throughout the film. I seem some reviews that what to politicalise the film, it's just a film about two guys who form a friendship through difficult times and just enjoy it and learn from it."
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,9/10,"Amazing film which I didn't expect.Great writing. The best part about this film is that it's touching and sad, but on the other hand hilarious. I laughed my ass of on several occasions. Character development is strong in this film. One of my favourite films in a long time!Aragorn is awesome in this film. lol"
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,9/10,Can't get enough of this movie. Seen it twice and would see it soon again. Recommend it for everyone who loves a great story.
GREEN BOOK,15 July 2021,8/10,"A very interesting story, well related and superbly acted by the 2 leads."
GREEN BOOK,4 January 2021,9/10,"It is a good, realistic, sweet and emotional film. It is set up as a road-trip which you enjoy as you fall in love with its characters.It helped me understand an era that I had not experienced. It is funny despite the seriousness of the material. The best part - it beautifully avoids the trap of preaching.Please watch it once. 9/10."
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,9/10,"Great acting, amazing story. It's one of those movies you know that is amazing before you watch it, and after watching it your expectations are fulfilled."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2019,8/10,"Green Book told a story that is simple and easy to understand, but in a larger scope it deals with serious issue. You don't always need to have a complicated or complex storyline to enjoy a good movie. While I'm not one that likes to see politics in movies much less talk about politics, however, this film approached the topic of race in a respectful and less obnoxious way. Many have said this remark before about the film, so I will continue it by saying it was well acted, well written, well told, overall great movie! Performances from both Viggo and Mahershala were profoundly enjoyable, envisioning real people that you almost wish you were able to meet in real life. The screenplay or writing for it was told once again with a lot of heart, but also found itself being a good personal, conversational script where you as an audience member can find yourself feeling like you could have a similar conversation with someone you know. One of the biggest aspects of this film that I found impactful was the key ethnic demographic as being an Italian-American myself, this all felt very familiar to me. On one side of my family, they experienced much of the same situations as portrayed in the film being an Italian-American family living in the 50's and 60's America where people were divided. Understanding that we are all the same, which are people trying to live their lives to the fullest regardless of the color of their skin. This film's story hit me really close to home, which made it feel like I had a personal attachment to it. In the end, I'm pleased with the film and that a story like this one can be for everyone to enjoy."
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2019,9/10,"I was not very impressed by the trailer of this film. But when it got so many nominations in the OSACRS, I was forced to watch it. And I must admit that i was so wrong after watching the trailer.Green Book is a very nice film which should not be missed. The story of two people coming from very opposite background and with many prejudices against each other connects immediately with me. Although the film is set in 1962, many issues shown in the film are still relevant and true.Still the world is divided on the lines of colour, country, caste, religion, community etc. Most of the problems in world have popped because of these divisions. That is why despite this film being based on a true story, it can be adapted in every country. It is this universality of the film which made me fall in love with it.It is a well a well made film which is excellent in every department."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2020,10/10,I'm Italian American and if I wasn't insulted by the dumb as rocks talking style then none of the pansies on here should get their panties in a twist. This was not a modern day movie...why does every movie have to pander to you thin skinned viewers who get nauseas every time a movie is not in line with your worldview. Great film no ifs ands or buts!
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"When I skimmed through the plot, I was expecting some stereotypical interracial film but it turned out to be quite funny and delightful. This film depicts the beautiful journey of tony in discovering his true self and learning to accept his shortcomings. Also, we see the musical brilliance of don shirley and his sheer strength in fighting the discrimination. Truly a beautiful film with a beautiful ending. 8/10"
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2021,10/10,"I avoided this film because I was dreading the preaching and 12 years-style violence.
How silly was I, this was a beautiful film of great skill and style which imparted a true story without making me want to cringe with guilt and shame. We all know full well how bad things have been and this film touched on these things whilst still telling a true story and, for once, a happy ending. OK it was simplified and dared to have a happy ending but it was a great movie, superbly acted and made one feel good without forgetting history. To be honest the relationship would have been a great story regardless of skin colour. Why the Guardian critic only gave this 3 stars shows that glossing over the more hellish details and daring to have a happy ending was just not acceptable, one has to bleed more.
The fact that it probably won best picture to appease the activists was a happy coincidence as it possibly deserved it anyway."
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2019,9/10,"Subtracting the racist angle, which is sure for any movie to shout, I found this movie entertaining, touching, brilliant. The portraying of Tony Lip is marvellous. The skills he put in acting, the character he played sure would have been not easy.
Scenes after scenes we are reminded of two people handling injustice or rather racism."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"Thoroughly enjoyed it. Great acting, dialogue and chemistry. Sad at times."
GREEN BOOK,14 October 2019,9/10,"Tittle says it all !
Watch the Movie... it just one of the best Motion Picture out there."
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,10/10,"Although I was expecting predictable, SJW BS, 'The Green Book' was anything but. Gorgeous film which knocked me flat on my a$$! A must-see masterpiece!"
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2020,10/10,"Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. An Absolute Must-See Film."

GREEN BOOK,29 May 2020,9/10,"Bigotry is a terrible thorn in our consciousness like a stone in front of our eyes. How many people can't pull it off in their whole lives? How many people are affected by prejudice throughout their lives? Break it down break it down take the first step with our sincerity and love like shelly and like Tony. The last hug made my tears flow from my eyes. May the world be so brave to express its tolerance to others. It will be better, right?"
GREEN BOOK,29 January 2019,9/10,"This is thought provoking film on many levels. Who you are at the heart, family., wisdom, judgement, education racial laws in 1962. A fabulous witty script and great performances"
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2019,9/10,"Both the guys acted excellent. The Italian driver is brilliant with a realistic performance. Powerful message, effective dialogs makes the movie an oscar worthy one. Timing and casual comedies has worked out in a very good way. Loved every moment of the movie."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,2/10,"I watched this movie on a flight, the airline was quick to update the movie selection with the latest Oscar hits. I started watching with low expectations after reading poor reviews about it after the Oscar win. But it was worse than what low expectations I had. It was dull drab and boring, not remotely funny, couldn't get past the first 15 minutes to get to the message if there was one. Highly missable."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,10/10,"It's movies like this that give movies a good name. At least in my book. Before saying what I like about it I will venture to say why some people didn't like Green Book. Such people are either too jaded or numb to appreciate feel- good art. Or they went to film school and they can't get the formulas out of their heads long enough to view something with fresh eyes.The biggest compliment I can give Green Book is I didn't want it to end. . Forget the race stuff. Forget the politically correct BS. This movie consisted of great actors doing a great job with a superlative script and spot-on direction. The story tugged at the heart strings in ways that celebrated humanity, not black or white humanity. Just humanity."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,9/10,I am amazed what cinema magic can happen with a simple well written story and two gifted actors doing some of their best work. Add to that the challenging circumstances that was the south in that era and the transformation that can occur if the human spirit is willing. It was all I could do not to cry at the end. A moving experience.
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,9/10,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Brilliant acting, masterful script (which is getting rare for Hollywood) and funny but subtle humour. Loved it.My only gripe is the 12A rating. Here in the UK it means any child can see it with an accompanying adult. Some crude humour, a few strong curses and showing two naked men in a shower I feel was excessive for a movie with the same rating as some kid's movies.Otherwise it was a breath of fresh air for Hollywood and will definitely win Oscars next year.Would definitely recommend.9/10."
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,10/10,Beginning to end you are entertained and interested in all the characters. Great story for all!
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,10/10,Every now and again I watch a film that I know nothing about and leave the cimema dissappointed the film had finished. This was one of them. Complete entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable. Just a brilliant film.
GREEN BOOK,25 June 2021,10/10,"There's something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit, that the movie acquires a glow.It achieves that glow slowly, but by the middle and certainly by the end, it's there, the sense of something magical happening, on screen and within the audience."
GREEN BOOK,22 December 2019,8/10,"Great acting by both of the lead actors and colourful cinematography. The dialogue was fine. The scene in the rain (cliché dramatic but intense) was one of my favorite.A little less great was the pace, a little too slow. I needed a better look into Tony's mind. We didn't really get to see him change his perspective and his thoughts about Doc. And I would have liked the story more to be sharper, a little more brutal and honest, but I guess it focused more on Tony's point of view rather than Shirley's.All in all, i loved the story and i actually hadn't known it was based on a true story which made it so much more better for me.8/10 stars."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"What a great movie this is!!! It's one of the best I've seen in years. I had a bit of a Shawshank Redemption moment while watching it. The acting is nothing short of phenomenal. Viggo Mortesnsen puts in something to remember, and every bit Oscar worthy. Mahershala Ali is simply amazing in his role. All in all I cannot find any flaw in the movie. Do yourself a favour and put in on your watchlist."
GREEN BOOK,28 October 2019,6/10,"I enjoyed it, but I just didn't fall in love with it as I thought I might. After all the hype I felt a little let down, although the hype may be to blame all things considered. I think the story was interesting and that both leads did a fantastic job with their portrayals, but I'm not entirely sure an Oscar nomination was warranted. Then again, usually when it comes to Oscar nominations, there is always a lot of debate. I must also confess that viewing this movie on an airplane probably wasn't the best way to see it, but still it was a well intentioned movie that couldn't pass the muster in my book."
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2019,8/10,"The development of the two men as they both haltingly move in a closer and closer relationship made this one of the most rewarding films of the last decade -- yes those times were difficult -- lived through them.
The chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen is charming and captivating. A very heartfelt movie, that somehow came in short, through the lack in the depth exploration of Ali's character.
A lighthearted film which manages to touch on a couple of topics without over doing it and will almost definitely have you in tears by the end.
A moving feel-good story defined by the chemistry exhibited by the unusual leads. Surprising at every turn and entertaining. Perhaps too conveniently mushy at the end, but overall a great watch."
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2019,9/10,"This is a feel-good film about an unlikely friendship. The two main characters could not be more different. Tony Lip is a classic meat and potatoes family man who does nothing half, and dr. Don Shirley is the classy, eccentric and lonesome musical genius who is on a personal mission in southern USA.
The dynamic and dialog between these two characters are what makes the film so great. At times it is downright hilarious, for example, there is a scene where Shirley makes a saracastic remark about Tonys primitive way of describing food, which is super funny. The ping-pong between the two are great.Highly recommend this film."
GREEN BOOK,30 April 2020,8/10,If you are not black enough or white enough or male enough tell me tony who am we i you are the most politically correct person
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2021,10/10,"Greenbook is road movie that captures New York bouncer Tony vallelonga and African American pianist Dr. Don Shirley's unlikely friendship. The film follows the two as they embark on a journey of a life time that confronts racism, intolerance, loneliness and understanding in an era of segragation in United States."
GREEN BOOK,29 September 2020,10/10,"Excellent movie. Don Shirley's character was great, and the dynamic between him and Tony was outstanding."
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,7/10,Another proof of how Oscars don't mean anything anymore.
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"I will keep it short as its already late. This movie is worthy of getting the oscar for best picture. I am kind of disappointed for vigo not getting a oscar win for this. He was splendid as was mahershala ali who this time deserved the coveted award more than the last time he won it.
A must see."
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,9/10,"Absolutely fantastic, worth your time. Great way to speak about racism, serious but funny at the same time."
GREEN BOOK,21 November 2018,8/10,"It is not easy to convince viewers to a newly established friendship in 2 hours. Green book is super entertaining and more than that it is a great character building movie. Character development is right on pace, not rushed or not boring. Every scene works for understanding each character and their relationship to each other. There isn't big speech or sacrificing, but you can feel the bond getting created between these two men. Great plot and very successful narrative.
Cinematography is pretty decent. From New York City and new yorkers to the beauty of the nature of south and southern lifestyle. Everything is needly put together. Viggo Mortensen is in one of his best works and Mahershala Ali is helping him great. Probably in the best threes movies I've seen so far in this year."
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,Such a beautiful movie. The acting was nothing less than phenomenal and this picture deserve all of the awards and accolades.
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,9/10,"This is a very well told tale with life lessons that everyone should experience. The director did a great job making his points w the right balance of emotion without making it overly: preachy, sappy or upsetting. There is also the right amount of comic relief that makes for a quality mix of entertainment. The acting is Oscar caliber all the way.
Here two completely different and somewhat misanthropic individuals, living in a racially unacceptable time period find one another and learn vital life lessons from each other through their experience together.Excellent movie 👍🏻👍🏻"
GREEN BOOK,26 September 2020,10/10,"I very rarely write reviews because not many films touch me on a level where I need to share my thoughtsThis absolute masterpiece was not only written amazingly but the bond of both main characters was incredible.It will have you laughing, crying and thinking about the meaning of racism that is existed then and still does to this day.10/10"

GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,10/10,"One of the greatest movie I've ever seen ! ,I can't say more , just enjoy it !"
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2019,9/10,"How can anyone knock this film or say they have seen this type of film before?
It's based on the recollections of Nick Vallelonga and Dr Don Shirley.
If critics say they have seen this type of film before ""nothing new"" then maybe the film should get even more credit for bringing the lessor known activists to the fore. Less you walked a mile in their shoes. Each new story we hear about is something new. Let's not be so quick to dismiss this film as ""nothing new""This film creeps up on you in terms of how you feel about the characters in the beginning and how you feel about them at the end, which I believe was one of the missions in this film, a reminder to all of us that not everything in this film or in life, is simply black and white.Whilst the film centers around the two main characters, you should take notice of the others, especially Dr Shirley's butler, fellow band members and take notice of how the film addresses the role of the police.The writing, directing and acting is outstanding.
This is something new, this is another story we have not heard before.Before this film I had never heard of Dr Shirley nor Vallelonga and now I can't stop reading more about these incredible people, I feel educated.Deserved to win best picture."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,10/10,One of the best movies that I have ever watched. Loved it.
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,Just a great flick. Fantastic acting and accurate portrayal of our country in the early 60's.
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2020,7/10,"This film isn't great it definitely didn't deserve that best picture win and it has a very tame way of tackling the race issue at the time it's essentially a crowd pleaser which just frustrates me when I think of what it could have been an R rating could've really elevated this film it's sad that studios are more concerned about profits than making a movie that feels ""real"" not this tame BS we gotSide note: If you liked Bohemian Rhapsody then go watch this film"
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2019,9/10,"The Oscars got it right. An excellent film.
Everything about this was so well done."
GREEN BOOK,25 August 2021,10/10,"What can i say? From the beginning to the end, perfect movie. It's worth it. 10/10 for me."
GREEN BOOK,28 March 2019,10/10,"Similarities have been noted between ""Driving Miss Daisy"", but why is ""Green Book"" so much better? Ruth Gordon ""starred"" in DMD and I am not a fan of hers at all. That movie struck out with me already. Viggo and Mr. Ali were great in every scene of this movie. The way that they shared their two different worlds with each other was epic. DMD lacked all of that depth. You very seldom seem that kind of brotherhood and male bonding in a movie that is not either a war movie; or a sporting event movie. I cannot even name one."
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,Watched this at a cineworld unlimited screening and was so glad they picked this film! I'm not sure it's something I'd have gone to see had I seen the trailer but honestly it's a film for everyone. The screen was full and was one of the huge screens and only 2 people walked out just to give you a general picture of how the film went down. Definitely will be recommending this to friends and family.
GREEN BOOK,19 May 2019,10/10,"If you haven't watched a good movie that puts you in a good mood for a while, please watch this!! Just simply amazing!"
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2019,9/10,"This movie is on my top 5 for this year! It really kept my interest until the very last minute and I didn't want it to end!! It had a very special meaning and really touching scenes,and at the same time moments of true laughter. It's a must see !"
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2020,10/10,This is a great heart warming story of friendship and taps into the dark tones of American history. Outstandingly acted by both lead actors and great for multiple watches.
GREEN BOOK,21 March 2019,9/10,Good movie about men being men and finding common ground in life. Great performances by the two lead actors. Racism has been around for thousands of years. We need to get beyond it and find common ground as human beings. Great example of what acceptance and love can do in individuals lives
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2019,10/10,"Loved it, very touching and sends a powerful message. Would recommend to anybody"
GREEN BOOK,6 November 2019,10/10,"This is a story of 2 men from different backgrounds who go on a journey together both literally and metaphorically.
Yes, there is a racial element to it which you would expect from a story set partly in the American deep south at that time but this isn't a story about racism.
The white man is not the eloquent, educated man. Tony is a rough diamond. He is the best artist who ducks and dives to make ends meet. He's a family man who adores his wife and he is a man who stands by his word.
Don is a talented, articulate man who is alone in the world. He has made music his life.
The men form an unlikely friendship that had me laughing, tearful, but mostly smiling.
This movie has heart.
Don could have easily been a white man or Tony a black man. I say this to emphasise that this isn't a movie about black and white. It's about friendship.
Why did Don choose to tour the deep south when he could command more money elsewhere?
Some might say that he wanted to connect with his roots. I don't.
When the black men and women who were working in the field all stopped to stare at the impeccably dressed black man being chauffeured by a white man was the key. For me, it was showing other people of colour that they can achieve anything they want. They are no longer slaves to the white man. That's my take away from it.
It is a simple story but told so well. If the aim was to make us feel warm and fuzzy then it did its job."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2020,9/10,"I had heard the criticisms of this film - pandering to white guilt, white man saves the black man, too shallow on a deep subject - and found none of that.What I did find was a little gem of a buddy flick - beautifully shot, with fantastic music, great nostalgia, and above all, incredible performances by the protagonists and the supporting cast. I don't use the term ""buddy flick"" to demean the movie. it's a perfectly valid sub-genre, done to greater or lesser effect since light met film.I only mention this because I think some people either expected something more poignant on the subject matter, since it dealt with racism and segregation, or they want to read a broader meaning into what is basically a character-focused story about two very different people who became friends. It's there, and it's addressed, but it not what this movie is about.Since there is really no plot to speak of, this movie really hinged on the relationship between Tony and Dr. Shirley. While the buddy concept has been done before, it often depends upon the classic situation-conflict-resolution plot structure as well.That's not to say there isn't a story, but it's more of a shared adventure than a quest. There is conflict, but it has more to do with the characters, their relationship, and their own inner demons than the story. There is resolution, but it's not a two-out, bottom of the ninth, walk-off home run resolution - it's slower, deeper and more gradual, and as such, more deeply satisfying.So I claimed a spoiler, and here it is. I did not know the story before I watched this movie, other than that it was based on a true story (that's not the spoiler :) ).
I was genuinely worried that some tragedy was going to befall these two right up to the end. I was worried about their being robbed in Birmingham. I was worried about their driving in a snowstorm and being killed in a wreck. I was worried about the cop that pulled them over in the North, fearful of one final, ironic, heartbreaking twist. I was deeply invested in these characters, and was rooting for them.Spoiler alert: Happy ending. Dr. Sterling went to Tony's house and had Christmas eve dinner with his family, and they remained friends for the rest of their long lives."
GREEN BOOK,29 May 2020,10/10,"This story is emotionally intelligent, and the cathartic journey of the two protagonists compelling. All aspects of the film were woven together into a great story, and the performances by these two great actors superb. A must see for everyone."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2021,7/10,"There is a lot to enjoy in this movie! The script, characters, performances... Mahershala Ali is extremely talented. He gave a noteworthy and memorable performance. I would've loved to see this movie more in Don Shirley's perspective and his experiences. There was no reason not to do that! It just seemed like an unfortunate missed opportunity."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,10/10,I had no idea this was based on a true story but I'm happy it was. I thought it was well balanced with just the right amount of humour & emotion.
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,"This was something. Loved it from the beginining. Good cast, story. Very adventurous, funny film about friendshiop. This film was chosen as the best film of 2018. Now I see why. This movie is worth an Oscar and is just a very decent one. Some Oscar films can be strange but this one is a real life film. I see that this film deserves only positive reviews."
GREEN BOOK,18 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book was a lovely theater experience. Actually the best one I've had in a long time. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are outstanding in this film and their on screen chemistry is nothing short of amazing. Viggo Mortensen proves once again that he's one of the best with foreign languages and accents. It's inspiring to see him constantly take these risks as an actor with new voices and mannerisms. I recommend watching Moonlight (2016) and this one, back to back, to fully appreciate Mahershala Ali's performance. He's truly versatile and has fully established himself as one of the best actors of this generation. Just compare his performance in Moonlight (2016) with this one and you'll see what I mean. The movie has lots of funny moments but also moments where you are moved. All around a great film that touches your heart, stimulates your brain and inspires you. I just might add this movie to my list of heartwarming Christmas flicks.
Highly recommended 9/10."
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2019,10/10,This movie absolutely deserves the Best Picture nomination that it has been given. I hope it wins! Hands down...a gazillion times better than Roma (blech!). I thoroughly enjoyed Green Book and all of it's amazing characters. Viggo and Mahershala are phenomenal!! I look forward to seeing it again! Run don't walk to see this movie!

GREEN BOOK,31 December 2019,9/10,Vigo should've won for best actor. I believe him in every role he plays. This performance was really excellent!! Mahersh is an ok actor imo. I don't know why and how he won an Oscar for Moonlight. That award should've gone to one of the other actors in that movie but I guess they were not famous enough.
GREEN BOOK,17 October 2019,10/10,"This movie was amazing from the start, I love true stories and this one will tug in your heart and make you very angry! I'm not going to go into details, Just watch it! 10/10!"

GREEN BOOK,23 November 2019,10/10,"When I've heard about this movie, I thought ""oh boy.. here is another 'white vs. colored' movie"", but boy I was wrong !!
This movie is a real joy, and a breeze of fresh air compared to other movies that addressed this subject.
To take an Italian 'white supremacy' type of guy, and put him with a very gifted 'but black' artist, and make him understand the crime of racial behavior while showing him the other side of...well...everything... while taking us on this trip with them - was a wonderful idea and that's what makes this movie so good !!
I recommend this movie to everyone, it's a must see and of very high quality in all aspects !"
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,10/10,"I read a bunch of reviews here and the good ratings Are True! I saw this two nights ago, and I loved it. I have been a fan of Viggo Mortensen since History of Violence, and wanted to see Ali because I have been hearing his name around... this movie is very well done and seeing how atrocious racism in the deep south used to be made me think about how we have come very far in a lot of ways, but there is still more to do. It's not just that though, it's about two people who both are completely different and both have their own issues with stereotypes etc and they manage to overcome that and find friendship ..what a cool story .. the film is just awesome in the cars, clothing, set design etc and I highly recommend this for just about anyone"
GREEN BOOK,6 November 2020,8/10,Good enough movie about racism in the 60s with very good performances from Ali and Mortensen. Very Chertu coated however.
GREEN BOOK,22 November 2018,8/10,"Most would never mistake Hollywood marketing executives for softies, but this time they could have fooled us. How else to explain why Universal knew to release Green Book around Thanksgiving, a time of celebrating family and friendship. For, while the movie's true story may not be profound enough to change your life, it certainly altered its characters for the rest of theirs. Watching such endearing kinship play out on screen is enough to melt the heart of even the staunchest scrooge.New York, 1962. A bouncer at the Copacabana nightclub named Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), aka Tony Lip, is temporary laid off after the building suffers fire damage. Seeking work to support his wife (Linda Cardellini) and two sons, he is referred to Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a virtuoso pianist who needs a driver to ferry him on a concert tour through the Deep South. But Dr. Shirley is black. His companion can't just camp out behind the wheel; he has to be able to make problems...go away.Tony, as it happens, is quite good at this. So after some haggling over price, the two embark on a two-month journey from Macon to Memphis, Birmingham to Baton Rouge. The bigotry and violence they find along the way are no surprise; the fact that their relationship almost makes us forget about such hardship is another story.Peter Farrelly directed this movie. Yes, the same Farrelly brother behind such comedies as Dumb and Dumber and Shallow Hall. Green Book is obviously a different bird. But while Farrelly does impress with his handling of the dramatic material, it's the humor that sets this film apart from so many others of its ilk.Race is a tense, heavy subject. We need to be able to laugh, not just at characters on a screen but, perhaps, at ourselves. In comedy, like a universal smile, we find common ground.
Which is a perfect Segway to Tony Lip. I have to believe Mortensen had a ball
playing this character. Vallelonga is a pasta-munching Italian from Brooklyn who isn't just a presence, he's a force. Tony is the truth behind the stereotype. And despite a rough exterior, he loves his family-which, of course, includes aunts, uncles, cousins and the old couple who run the pawn shop down the street. There's more than one shade of Moonstruck lighting these tenement floors.All this describes the character, but that's the heart of Mortensen's performance. He disappears into Tony, making him cringeworthy and loveable all at once.Then there's Doc Shirley-talented, educated, single. Essentially the antithesis of Tony, which is the surface conceit of most 'road' movies. ""They couldn't have been more different..."" But, like the better entries of its genre-Midnight Run, Trains, Planes and Automobiles-Green Book finds the humanity in its headliners. Are Tony and Don really that different? And if so, why not celebrate such variety?Ali, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2016's Moonlight, makes the difficult seem effortless in peeling back the doctor's layers. Shirley is a complex character-austere yet vulnerable, lonely and proud-but by the end of the movie, we know him. We love him.When it comes to overall quality, Green Book is a unique case; there's nothing specifically ""wrong"" with it. That's not, though, the same as saying it's perfect. I've seen more emotional and inspiring movies, and even deeper characters. But the film is still a triumph, a 'real good feel good' experience that's hard to forget.The biggest reason for this is because of how it addresses its racial subject matter. There is no pointing of fingers. The movie pulls no punches when recounting instances of discrimination, but that's not its focus. Instead, the spotlight shines on two men accepting one another as fallen, beautiful human beings."
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,7/10,"I liked the concept of the film when I first read it but I wasn't fully convinced to watch it yet. However the Oscars happened and when Green Book got not one, not two, but three Oscars. That's when I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately I was unpleasantly surprised. The plot was kind of boring, nothing really major happened and at the end I was left unsatisfied. I expected so much more. The only bright side of the film was the spectacular acting. Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali did such a magnificent job portraying their characters and were extremely charismatic. They made the film delightful."
GREEN BOOK,30 May 2019,9/10,I mean this film is a masterpiece one of the best films of the last 10 years and he deserved to be the best movie in 2018
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2019,10/10,I like the game of actors they do beautiful work and this movie can learn you how people are leaving in 60s and you laugh from the beautiful game of actors.
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,5/10,"Planes, trains and automobiles, Driving Miss Daisy and many other movies with this theme, its not new.The plot lacks a lot of point, its also repetitive and predictible. I was expecting a lot more considering its nominated for Oscar."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,8/10,The movie is just great. a story told with wit and fun. it has moments which make you emotional and feel something.
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,6/10,"Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are the heart and soul of this film. Along with the great cinematography and direction. Green Book confronts racism in a way that is relatable, people keeping there mouth shut instead of confronting what is going on the front of them. You know that this is a great film when you just want to punch that racist guy in the face but you know that that's not what the other character would want. In this film, it's not black and white. If a character makes a decision you take into account how the other people will be affected by it."
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and is an Oscar contender for sure. That sentence is one that is still hard to fathom. That is because Peter Farrelly's previous credits as writer and director are for Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me,Myself & Irene, Shallow Hal and the awful Three Stooges and Dumb & Dumber sequel. He's a comedy writer. He has some great movies in that genre no doubt but this is such a huge leap in a biographical drama that is a commercial and critical success that it is a career turn that nobody seen coming. Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments in this movie and Farrelly will have been able to engineer those scenes to be as funny as they were. Nevertheless, this is still a huge achievement for the producer, director and writer and I hope he is acknowledged on the ultimate stage.It is hard to speak of the plot to this film in such a brief description. That is because throughout the entire movie you really get the feel that everything played out on screen did actually happen. There are several reasons for this but mainly it is because of the involvement of Nick Vallelonga as co-writer, the son of the real life Tony Vallelonga in the movie. You get the sense that his involvement really added an authenticity to the story and he was able to project his vision and history of his late father onto screen.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both excellent in this movie. The characters themselves are very entertaining but Mortensen in particular really brings the Italian-American bouncer to life and he adds a charm and humour to the movie. It is amazing how well he pulls off Tony Lip when you compare it to his other roles in The Lord of the Rings, The Road and his 2 previous Oscar nominations Captain Fantastic and Eastern Promises. It really is a brilliant performance and it's a shame that once again he is likely to fall just short this year in the Leading Actor category. Mahershala Ali just goes from strength to strength. With his Oscar win last year for Moonlight still in the rear view mirror he adds another string to his bow here and I am looking forward to his turn in True Detective Series 3 this year. The pair of them have great on screen chemistry together and you really connect with the journey that they go on as a viewer.I can't speak highly enough of this movie. It is a heartwarming tale of companionship and friendship at a time when circumstances prevented it culturally, socially and professionally. I would highly recommend this film and I think it has a real chance of winning Best Picture at the Oscars 2019. 9/10"
GREEN BOOK,29 January 2019,8/10,"Green Book tells the story of night club bouncer Tony 'lip' Vallelonga, who becomes the driver of African american pianist Dr Don Shirley. The movie is remarkable in its portrayal of two men both dealing with the own problems, with perfect examples of classic 1960's racism which is dealt heavily in the film. Viggo Mortensen gives an absolute stunning performance as an Italian american man. Mahershala Ali creates an almost magical performance with his character. It is with these two actors and there chemistry on screen together that creates a fantastic film. Green Book is by far one of the best movies of the year, and I am so glad to have gone and seen this."
GREEN BOOK,5 August 2019,10/10,"In same time funny and serious, it deserved all Oscars gained. I would recomed it to everyone"
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2019,8/10,Green Book is an excellent film. It is about a working-class Italian-American bouncer who becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South. Viggo Mortensen and Marshershala Ali give fantastic performances. The script is well written. Peter Farrelly did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor and drama. Green Book is a must see
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2019,10/10,Theeee best movie I've ever seen. I recommend to everybody that want to watch best movies like green book
GREEN BOOK,17 July 2019,9/10,"This movie gives not only spectacular insight in a unique way to an opposite type friendship but will likely also be one of the best movies seen in months. A movie connoisseur, I left off a star ro be modest. The cast is well suited for this true-based story not to miss."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2020,9/10,"Optimistic, humorous. By letting go of prejudice, they became better selves and reaped valuable friendships"
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2021,1/10,Literally trash. couldn't sit through the whole thing.
GREEN BOOK,16 August 2021,10/10,"This excellent film, based on fact, highlights the racial bigotry faced by intelligent talented people like Donald Shirley whilst simply trying to work, and how, with the help of a man, who at first sight, would appear to be his least likely ally. Beautifully acted it is a feelgood film, and if you haven't seen it, I encourage you to do so."
GREEN BOOK,28 November 2018,10/10,"More than the main topic treated in the movie, which is very well depicted, I think this movie is a must see because it brings the best from every person. It touches those sentiments and emotions that are almost forgotten nowadays, like compassion, true friendship, solidarity, courage, and obviously love. This is an story rare for today's superhero and marvel blockbusters, it's about being humans, good humans. And what makes this movie really unforgettable is the acting from these two individuals that captivate the audience, and make us feel that we are with them all the way. Vigo and Mahersala are superb in their roles and regardless of getting oscar nods or not whoever sees the movie will understand why movies last forever. This one stays forever, it's exceptional."
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2021,10/10,"The journey that takes place in 'Greenbook' is an all familiar American film-telling cliche. A bunch of people hop in a car with a destination of significance that the film slowly builds towards. The brilliance is in the tight screenplay, the authentic characterisation and most critically the exemplary two lead actors. The film builds like a symphony.Incredibly, this is the best I have ever seen Viggo. I didn't mistake him for Aragorn once. He became the complex yet charming Italian American angel. The acting here is special. Together with Mahershala they become one of the most watchable friendships. The film is set in a deeply troubled time but the director favours prevailing comedic sentiment and triumphant outcomes over all the injustices - you get a feeling of comfort that other films of this theme don't convey. Whilst there are moments that are deeply troubling, Viggo's character is never far away from protecting Mahershala's, and I suppose also, us; the onlooking audience.The result is a complete and fulfilling journey, with an exciting finale and a tremendous feeling of joy and hope. 10/10"
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,5/10,"I love Mahershala Ali. I just finished True Detective 3, and he shines in that. Same goes for Moonlight - a beautiful role.By comparison, this movie has Mahershala descend into a slapstick of a role in my opinion, up against even more of a slapstick character (that of Tony Lip) in a movie that tries to build from now-50 year old racial clichés, a one-dimensional drama.Very disappointed after the buzz at the Oscars. I hope Ali wins an Emmy for his work on True Detective S3 - a protrayal that truly deserves credit."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,9/10,"Friendship movie..A man has phd degree about musical and one of the best pianists in the word but he live single and he complain about black people inequity.I dont have any idea for 1960s USA..But the movie clinches an argument for bad behaviours to black people, and nonsense rules for black people.Other hero is like street bummer,but he is good family father and he is smart and cool character except of eating fast food appetite,KFC.Actually sometimes I was bored when I watched movie, but generally it is funny and romantic movie,and qoutated real life"
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,4/10,"There is nothing new in Green Book. The same story has been told many times by the Hollywood propaganda machine - improbable interracial friendships where the black man has to do all the emotional heavylifting in order to make our white protagonist slightly less racist. This ""friendship"" is ultimately portrayed as a mutual exchange of perspectives, where both sides manage to find common grounds with each other and come to understand their shared humanity.This is the archetype of the liberal humanist narrative, where power structures are conveniently ignored, and where political oppression and economic exploitation is reframed as nothing more than differences in culture and perspectives. As a result, according to this ideological narrative, the purpose of (liberal democratic) politics is reconciliation and compromise, as opposed to struggling for emancipation. The problems of structural violence and economic exploitation is reframed as individual prejudice and actions, which can be changed by respectability politics (""they go low, we go high"") and this bland humanist appeal to the oppressor's conscience.This is the deeply ideological narrative of Green Book and countless other stories, from Driving Miss Daisy (1989) to The Green Mile (1999) to Gran Torino (2008) to The Help (2011), where the real problem - the irreducibly structural problem - is always erased in favor of a feel-good humanist drama that appeals primarily to middle-class white guilt. Year after year, middle-class white audience can walk out of these Hollywood films with a smug face, complacently declaring that they're glad that ""racism is finally over.""Many people defend this film by saying that there's nothing inherently wrong with a comedic and light-hearted approach to serious social and historical problems. What they're saying is not wrong. In fact, some of the greatest works of cinema (and art in general) is about people finding humor and spirit in extreme positions of subjugation and poverty. Yet these artworks depict poverty and oppression with acute social awareness and compassion, instead of flattening them into bland archetypes or straight-up ignoring them, which is what Green Book is guilty of.Here we have two characters - an educated upper-class black man who is completely isolated from the culture and social conditions of his people, and a racist working-class white man who is portrayed as a misguided good-hearted person. The class dimension is never explicitly challenged or fully confronted, especially Don's bourgeois sensibility. Instead, the film focuses on how the two can learn from each other and become better persons - Don becoming more down-to-earth and in touch with black popular music, and Tony becoming less racist. Yet the film never backs down from its pedagogy of respectability politics and never challenges its narrative of black exceptionalism. What does the film ultimately show about Don and Tony's friendship? It shows that only an exceptional, upper-class, respectable, talented black man can change the racist attitude of a white working-class man, and the film invites the audience to participate in its complacency, its classism, and its outrageous reductionism.The problem is not the humorous approach, but the absolutely reactionary myths about racism and racists that are perpetuated in this film, and the bourgeois complacency that this film engenders, which does nothing but reinforce the continued whitewashing and cooptation of the civil rights strategy, and the perpetuation of assimilationism, respectability politics, and reconciliationism."
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,10/10,"This movie is not only smart and funny, it is incredibly watchable and enjoyable. The cars, the food, the clothes, the background music, the piano playing, the faces and voices of the character actors -- not a dull frame.To story, writing, directing --
This movie avoided the traps that road-trip buddy movies faceplant into. Scenes that easily could have been trite and corny were fresh and sharp. No punches pulled, people ground into the dirt and resurrected by sheer strength of will. Some of the events were so painful and unsparing that I had no idea how the movie would end.Another big thing, the movie wasn't cynical despite some of the ugliness it reveals. Faith, family, honor, are all part of the movie without being in your face. You'll fall in love with the characters."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,"Ever wondered if Viggo Mortensen could act? I know I did. Somehow he always looked like he could, but I was yet to find a movie to prove it.And now I've got it. His performance is the jewel of this movie. Just go and see for yourself.However, Green Book is good all over: every other actor, big parts, small parts, everything is just right.
To be honest it is so rare nowadays to see a high quality movie - at least my last movie theater experience ended up after about 20 minutes of sitting there literally boiling with anger (that was my attempt on BR) - that Green Book is something I'm quite thankful for."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,9/10,"I watched this movie without any prior judgment. Though I've seen the ratings and hear the fuss around it. It released in India a week later then the American release but I know like me many could've missed it. I'm Glad, finally I got the time to see it and I want to write about it. So, this movie is inspired by the true story about friendship between Donald Shirley (Ali), an erudite African-American pianist and his white chauffer Tony (Viggo). First of all, I didn't know what ""GREEN BOOK"" is before I saw the movie. It is a book which is ""to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable"" because African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from their town. So, it is a journey between them and how they're able to accept each other throughout. It is a ""MUST SEE"" movie even though you were not sure about what it is like to have an African American in 1960s. I enjoyed many scenes specially when they enter Kentucky and enjoyed KFC though Don was reluctant at first because of hygiene. I can't reveal much and I don't want to because the movie shows the essence of humanity which is above color and discrimination. There're many heart wrenching scenes too and humor top notch. Don't miss this movie of 2018! I bet you'll feel good after watching this, tell me how many movies can does that!!!"

GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,10/10,"This film is such a surprise for me. After watching Blakkklansman I was expecting similar propaganda in this movie, but that's not the case. It is tasteful and touching depiction of the friendship between two people that are more similar than they think in such specific time period.I loved Viggo's performance, he brought just a right dose of humor and seriousness to this role. It was pleasure watching him.Also, great performance by Mahershala, and so important messages delivered by his character.This is one of the best films nominated for this year's Oscar. Definitely worth watching, especially during holidays."
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2021,9/10,"Once during the promotion of a movie, I heard a movie director saying something like this, ""A movie is like a canvas where every cast makes their own mark, and it becomes a masterpiece only if everyone does his/her part fully.""
I found Green Book like so. It tells us a story of such a time, where a minor within a minority fights for his place in an overtly prejudiced and supremacist society, and of another contemporary man whose life turns upside down, at least emotionally, only within two short months."
GREEN BOOK,21 January 2019,8/10,"This is a movie of this time. It is funny, heartwarming, sad and hard. It touches on the racial problems of this time, but with a smile and hope.

GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,8/10,"GREEN BOOK follows a Viggo Mortenson a man who has a simple life and a loving wife.
One day, he gets a job to drive a pianoist, Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) (Moonlight, True Detective)
They both form a special bond and deeply connect, even though they at times fight with each other.
The movie deals with racism in the south in a very interesting way.
Dr. Shirley is racially profiled and treated harshly by others, due to the color of his skin, what is beautiful is that Viggo accepts him for who he is, and does not judge him.
The movie isn't sad, heartbreaking, it's beautiful, most movies about subject matters such as racism tend to be sad and hard to watch, however, Green Book avoids that.
It's an easy to watch movie that deals with racism, and it's not sad!"
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2020,10/10,"This movie made me laugh, cry, and angry. This was seamlessly done and I the bond between Villalonga and Shirley was so real. I am glad that I finally watched this and wish that I had sooner."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,10/10,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film... and I cried. I already knew both these actors are very talented but holy WOW they blew me away in this. Their chemistry is so good and I hope they both win their Oscars. I really hated Viggo's character Tony at first but he redeemed himself by the end, and what a positive message to send: fight hate and prejudice with love and loyalty. Tony became loyal to this man because of experiences he never realized could affect him. His face when he hears Doc play for the first time... priceless. He decides to respect his friend's humanity first and foremost because we ALL have a choice to be decent human beings. It's a really wonderful change for anyone to make. I can't wait to purchase this movie and watch it again!"

GREEN BOOK,2 December 2019,9/10,"Green Book is a very important movie! Tony Lip, a bouncer in 1962, is hired to drive pianist Don Shirley on a tour through the Deep South in the days when African Americans, forced to find alternate accommodations and services due to segregation laws below the Mason-Dixon Line, relied on a guide called The Negro Motorist Green Book.I didn't know anything before watching the movie, I knew I had been nominated for an Oscar and had Mahershala Ali, and what I saw was an indescribable surprise.The two main characters Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley lived respectively by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are very interesting and even if you are not interested in them at first, they get deeper and more interesting with each scene.The humor in this movie is excellent, it does not compromise the tension and in some scenes I would even say it increases, I had not realized that the director of this movie was Peter Farrelly, who wrote dumb and dumber and There's Something About Mary, two films that I personally find hilarious.The cinematography here is wonderful, the shots taken by car are beautiful, making good use of the landscapes along with the contrast of the blue car.On the racial issue I found it very well posed, with some dialogs at the end that are arguably expository but I understand why they exist. Peter Farrelly here can capture small racist gestures that you can do everyday and not even realize.The movie is amazing and I see nothing of it that can take your 10. 10/10"

GREEN BOOK,24 December 2020,2/10,"This has to be one of the most driest, stalest scripts I have ever seen put on screen. Saying that this film is underwhelming is an understatement. The story is incredibly dull, and redundant, the acting was really pale, The filmmaking aspects were nonexistent and/or unspecial. All of these elements combing to make the most dullest, watered down films of the 2010s let alone 2018. The fact this won best picture was astounding, but this being an incredibly boring, insignificant film about racism its not too surprising the academy would pick this as the most ""important film of 2018"".I doubt this film will ever be talked about again other than ""what not to do with your script"". I know This review itself is probably insignificant but, really I'm appalled and impressed by the relentless bore this film brings on. I just needed to get my thoughts out before I start burning buildings, and worshipping Satan.2/10"
GREEN BOOK,18 September 2021,8/10,"Good:
Mahershala's Don Shirley character is super interesting. He starts socially distant and watching a tough but lovable Tony Lip(Viggo Mortensen's character) slowly crack his personality was entertaining as heck. Equal parts heartfelt and humorous.Not so good:How do they both get thrown in jail without Don finding out Tony has a gun on him?Don's Cadillac is beautiful, but it has dents down the side. Maybe no one else noticed but that but it drove me nuts.Gay/straight historical fabrication aside Don's random one night stand was at odds with the rest of his character. It broke my sense of reality for the rest of the movie. It felt like they just had to throw that in to check the LGBTQ box I guess it worked."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2020,9/10,"Green book provided drama, sadness and laughter. A well worth watching movie. A beautiful story of friendship and the ability to change ones thinking. It also introduced me to the phenomenal music of Don Shirley! I would recommend this movie without hesitation. A must see"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,,"Average film that is contrived and riddled with cringe-inducing clichés and stereotypes. An unauthentic movie that attempts to whitewash the topic of racism and the experiences of those who endured it to make it more palatable. Though I suppose such filmmaking shouldn't come as a suprise from the director of drivel such as the 2007 remake of 'The Heartbreak Kid' and Hall Pass and who's idea of ""a joke"" was to repeatedly flash people on his film sets."

The film has some deep nuances but moves along a generally proven track of sentimental lines. Somewhat a tale of two minorities - the other Italian. Still wholesome good drama. A surprise turn from this famously comedy director. In addition, pretty relevant in today's times. #BLM"
GREEN BOOK,7 August 2021,10/10,"Absolutely wonderful acting, music, love, and rue friendship standing triumphant against horrible prejudice and racism. Leaves me hopeful. 10 stars is not enough."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,9/10,Amazing movie based on a true story. A well deserved Oscar for Best Picture.
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"First of all let me say there is very little wrong with this film. It's true rating is about a 9/10 but it's underrated atm so I've given it a 10 for now. The story is one that we might have heard again and again and may come across as cliche, but guess what, the vast majority of what happened actually happened.I can see numerous reviews here attacking the writing with one user claiming that Shirley's apartment is ridiculous, however the real Don Shirley did have an apartment above Carnegie hall. Attacks on Mortensen playing a 'caricature' Italian american, Tony Lip was the definition. He actually was in the sopranos as well as the Godfather and Goodfellas, so it's no cliche and he did not over-act. Some people just love to hate and it's a shame because the real story behind this film is incredibly uplifting and the acting is brilliant. Ali's delivery is emotional and felt honest."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2021,10/10,"I regret the fact that I wasn't aware of this exceptionally beautiful movie for so long. The story telling, the rhythm, and the way the friendship of Don and Tony evolves is engaging to say the least.I'm glad I watched this movie; perhaps one for my collection. If you haven't till now then don't waste time and give it a watch. You'll love it too..."
GREEN BOOK,29 July 2020,4/10,Seriously don't understand how it ends up getting an oscar. For what?!
GREEN BOOK,3 November 2019,10/10,"It had the right balance of things. From the start to the end, very consistent."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"I have no words.
See it for yourself and you will find a hidden gem."
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,7/10,"Thinking about this movie being a biography nd a comedy is in itself a crazy combination. Me in my full conscious can't be so practical then this man's life is, common, hez a funny guy nd he lived that way forever, practical nd successful. Unlike all other comedy movies this one uses clean humor, throughout the movie I heard no bad words except a poorly misanalysis (as it turns out) about women of a specific state.hahap.s:-Kiss children for me."
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2019,10/10,"This has to be the best movie I have seen this year, acting was exceptional by all, everyone should see this movie. I certainly can understand why it was the best movies of the year."
GREEN BOOK,10 July 2019,9/10,"Viggo has better acting role and play then Ali...but, oh well, these days Oscars are handed after different criterias apparently..."
GREEN BOOK,1 October 2018,9/10,"It's frightening to think how far we came (past tense) and how far we've regressed when it comes to something like social equality. Many people would agree that Western, perhaps even Global culture has been regressing when it comes to acceptance and racial relations.To say that Green Book, a story about racial relations and acceptance (or lack thereof) is strangely topical, is also an oversimplification. What might be more strange however, isn't the timing of the film's release, or the fact that a story taking place in early 1960's America is contemporary, is the fact that the latest cinematic voice, the newest artist to reintroduce concepts like love and acceptance (concepts Mortensen said are ""lost track of a lot these days"" in the Q & A session after my TIFF screening of the film) ...is Peter Farrelly. Yes, that Peter Farrelly; the one who countless times teamed up with his brother to bring us trendy comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber, Me Myself & Irene, and There's Something About Mary.Green Book follows the story of a working class Italian-American, Tony Lip (Viggo Moretensen) who, after losing work as a bouncer, finds himself working for Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American classical pianist on tour through the deep South of 1960's America. The two are the archetypal odd-couple, with Dr. Shirley being scholarly, fastidious and composed and Tony being what would seem to be an Italian-American cinematic stereotype; tough, loud, and brash.While we may not associate either of the Farrelly brothers with drama, audiences lately haven't associated them with comedy either. Recent releases such as Dumb & Dumber To, The Three Stooges, Hall Pass, even as far back as Fever Pitch had neither audiences nor critics waiting for the next Farrelly project. That changed for me personally when I discovered Green Book, and discovered that not only is Peter turning to more dramatic subject matter, but that his brother isn't a part of the project at all. ""My answer was always 'when it happens'. I never planned what was going to be next, it was just a thing the universe brought you, dropped in your lap, it would be like planning when you're going to fall in love, you never know when it's going to happen"" Farrelly told the audience at TIFF that he didn't actively seek out this project, it came up very organically, and that when he heard co-writer Brian Hayes Currie talk about the film, he knew it was a 'home-run' idea.He might be right. About everything. The fact that this idea came his way and just felt, the timing, his background; this film would not be the same without Farrelly's approach. That may seem self-explanatory, but what I'm addressing is the fact that this film needed the touch of a comedic filmmaker, or at least this specific comedic filmmaker. Within he and his brothers' specific niche of comedy, there was something that was always enjoyable about it, even if the comedy itself, was not. They knew about human connection. The Farrelly brothers always, without fail, had a shmaltzy moment of love, one way or another. Even when dealing with Lloyd and Harry in Dumb & Dumber, when dealing with caricatures of human beings, there is a bond there, there is a love. So imagine if suddenly Peter Farrelly starting taking things seriously? When a filmmaker understands sentiment and human connection, then it's not such a stretch to make the jump to drama.Farrelly's influence on the mood of the film is fairly obvious. He's never been a subtle filmmaker, and the film does lack significant drama. After my viewing of the film I wouldn't even categorize it as a drama, because, while there may be hurdles the characters have to overcome, it seems to be a very light-hearted story. Arguably, the most lighthearted version of an extremely heavy subject matter. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop, dramatically speaking, but nothing too heavy ever came. Every time there is something even remotely dramatic, the two characters get out of it with relative ease. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but some might see this as too lighthearted, and not truly dealing with the reality of racial segregation and prejudice. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, as it's the tone of the film all three writers and Farrelly were going for, but considering the subject matter, this may actually anger audience members. The title Green Book refers to a 'travel guide' of sorts for African-Americans of that time. Realistically though, it was more of a 'survival-guide', as it informed those families where it was safe to travel, what restaurants they were permitted to eat in, and the 'colored only' locations to lodge. For many families, the Green Book has significant personal meaning.What I am suggesting, is that is merely subtext, despite what they chose to be the title. The story is really about our shared humanity despite differences, and while these characters do reinforce some stereotypes, it shatters others. Mahershala and Mortensen create characters that are part caricature, part inspiration, but regardless of how you view them, it works. The two are so well-balanced, it's difficult to say if either of them is truly the lead. That's of the utmost importance, as this unlikely friendship is what inspired the film and drives the story.I never feel like I am watching Mahershala Ali acting, as... to be honest... I don't really know who Mahershala Ali is. (That is a testament to his acting, not a comment on the fact he and I don't hang out in the same social circles). However, his role as Dr. Shirley is drastically different than anything I've seen him do before. His sense of who the character is, his mannerisms, his diction, even his inner thought process become clear through Ali's performance. Since this is a more comedic film in tone, I have to also compliment Ali's sense of timing. The character is reserved for the majority of the film, and being a straight man in a comedic duo is not easy, but Ali finds a brilliant balance of drama and comedy. It's another performance, that while perhaps not award worthy, he will assuredly be remembered for. Green Book will also be remembered. The balance it finds within small sub-genres of cinema is carefully crafted; part road-trip buddy movie, part period piece, part social commentary, but all enjoyable. It may not spark serious conversation between audience members. It certainly won't solve the social inequality and hatred that plagues many parts of the world still to this day. It does, however, serve as a reminder of the core concepts it successfully portrays. Mortensen when addressing the crowd put it best: ""There's something very profound there that we lose track of. These days, we lose track of it a lot. And that is anybody has the right to understand or appreciate other people... you can respect each other ...you can listen to each other.""So if you'll indulge Mortensen's teachings, listen to me... go see Green Book."
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,9/10,"I know this movie won awards, but it just didn't seem appealing. I figured it was a new age, reverse, Driving Miss Daisy. Well I'll tell you what, this movie has more soul than anything I've seen in quite sometime.Don't judge a book by its cover just like you shouldn't judge a person by the color of their skin.The world needed this and I'm glad that it's getting all the recognition it is, because it deserves every bit of it."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2019,10/10,"A must see movie. Absolutely brilliant . Fantastic performances by the two leading characters
Great script brilliantly shot superb soundtrack Starting to run out of superlatives now.Oh based on a true story that created a life long friendship between two polar opposite personalities from different backgrounds and cultures
Do not hesitate just go see it.
Enjoy!"
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2019,9/10,A tour de force by the two leads. Mahersala routinely transitioned from pompous elitist to vulnerable loner in the same take while Mortensen played against type and nailed the Bronx - almost wise guy - character to a T. The script while strumming the emotional chords avoided taking too many liberties which resulted in an exceedingly good film
GREEN BOOK,9 February 2019,10/10,"This film is just perfect. the story, the characters, the humor is fantastic. I was so hooked on this film i was never bored. the characters are charming, and spending an entire road trip left me oddly sad it was over. i will definitely buy this, and i recommend it without hesitation to go see. it would be a disservice to not see it."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,9/10,Story and performance was amazing. Refreshing and I didn't expect nothing less from Vigo but Marahalla is suprise. Hard time had lots different heroes that we didn't now for them. That is why this story is so important!
GREEN BOOK,7 December 2018,9/10,"I was disappointed that this movie isn't doing well at the box office but after seeing it I understand why, and knowing that it's based on a true story. People don't like to be reminded of the difficult past, the discrimination and prejudice that our country has suffered in the Deep South many years ago, and still exists in some places today. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially seeing the dynamic between the two primary characters, Tony and Dr. Shirley, and given some of the awkward and challenging scenes. Both actors deserve Oscars, and this is a must-see movie for all ages of adults."
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2018,10/10,"Rich period flavor. Immersive, totally believable acting by the two leads. Mahershala Ali's portrayal of Dr. Shirley's loneliness, and his determined, quiet nobility despite crushing indignities, touched my heart. I think I'll go back to the theater soon to see it again. Just an excellent job all around."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,10/10,"Excellent. Okay more than one word. At first I passed this up, thinking nah, not really that interesting sounding. But I am sure glad I decided to give it another chance. I don't consider myself a movie critic by any means just an average joe who really liked this film. It's a funny, and sometimes heartbreaking film that is all around just good. I am really glad i saw this."
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,9/10,"Let me try to explain.This is a difficult subject to handle. One of the most difficult ones in our time. But In my opinion the film was too one dimensional while handling the other main character and rather too cheeky at couple of times.For example, from the beginning Tony Lip was portrayed as a person with prejudices. But as soon as he started to work with Doc Shirley he was nothing but a good person with good deeds. Change was too rapid and unrealistic. In my opinion they should have let Tony Lip be more edgy with the prejudices he had at least a little longer.The christmas scene in the end was so sweet and predictable that they shoud have let it out, even if it did happen in the real life. It was so cheeky that it made me puke pink marshmallows.But, like I said In the beginning I have mixed feelings with all of this. I realize that with this time and age we need cheekiness and pink marshmallows. This movie has a great story, actors are superb and it made me laugh many times.Still, I am not sure which is the best way to deliver Doc Shirley's message.Time will tell."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2019,1/10,It's so racist towards white people i can't belive no one talks about it. If it was other way around would be all over media . America is degrading and people afraid to say something not to come out racist.
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,Great movie. Excellent performances from the lead actors and is very realistic and thought provoking. Some of the subtle ways in which racism permeates society are shown very precisely. It would really open your eyes on American history as it relates to race. It has some good comedy and good drama. Very well balanced movie. I absolutely enjoyed it.
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,9/10,"""Green Book"" relies on its writing and excellent performances by its leads to carry it through. What a concept. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali absolutely nail the evolution of their relationship as two polar opposites show us how the differences are exactly the same. ""Green"" is in the dead centre of the spectrum and this film effectively takes you through it. It laughs at stereotypes and deals with shameful things from the past. It reminds us how far things have come and how far they still have to go. It leaves us with a poignant message that It's not about fitting in where you belong but more about belonging where you fit in. Green Book is.both a timely and timeless commentary on the condition of the human condition"
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2019,8/10,"It was very good watching two very diferent minds learning and comprending each other to become a better person. In the end, a feel just joy."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,4/10,"Good film when you ignore the blinding historical discrepancies and the overarching white saviour trope.
Ali was the strongest actor of the bunch and sometimes you couldn't tell if he was in character or just fed up with the film itself and honestly, mood.
The soundtrack outside of the actual music was generic at best and outright annoying at worst, mainly towards the end of the film.
When their road trip is ending it kinda takes a weird tonal shift and starts to feel like a hallmark Christmas movie, I understand that it is Christmas within the timeline and they wanted a nice heartwarming ending but it felt forced.
The film tries hard to be a feel good movie but ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth, Had potential and would be better if it were in the hands of a black director and writers who actually consulted dr Shirley's family instead of just Tony's son."
GREEN BOOK,31 July 2019,10/10,"Many other people have written great things about this film. I need add nothing, except watch it all costs.
I liked it so much, I went to the cinema again the following week to see it again."
GREEN BOOK,12 July 2019,8/10,Good movie with really strong performances from the two lead actors. Good music too and I learned something about The Don Shirley Trio that I had never heard about before.
GREEN BOOK,17 September 2020,10/10,"Its a beautiful movie full of comedy,drama and you really won't get bored for a second! I watched a lot of movies and this is from all of them my favorite one! So if you didn't see it do me a little a favor and watch it right now!"
GREEN BOOK,8 April 2020,9/10,"My husband and I kept turning to each other and saying ""This is seriously good"". Well written, well acted, just a great time! Must watch."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,8/10,Didn't even know this movie existed until today and what a discovery it was! Brilliant storytelling. The movie is 150+ minutes long but never will it wear you down. A feel good movie which will definitely get you a couple of times. Very well acted and exquisitely directed. Recommended.
GREEN BOOK,17 April 2020,8/10,"I haven't seen such a comfortable film for a long time. The kernel, of course, is a platitude, but in this set pattern, can be so delicate and natural multi-dimensional presentation, is quite good. The two actors are really nice"
GREEN BOOK,26 December 2020,10/10,"I'm so glad I watched this, this is a very good heartwarming film which I recommend highly.
The two main lead actors are a perfect choice and share a on screen chemistry which is endearing when it calls for and comical and amusing at just the right times to keep you spell bound.
Viggo Mortensen is so convincing as a overweight Italian bodyguard with sense of humor and a deep love for his family. And Mahershala Ali plays his role (and the piano) so well you really like the two characters in what should be a boring film that consists 90% of these two characters sitting in a car.
The journey isn't just a physical journey across a dangerous part of the US for a black man in the 60's, its also an evolution of both the characters outlook on life. They open new insights and possibilities to each other they'd never been close to revealing in themselves in the past and it really binds them in a friendship which holds true. In a way they both have skill sets that compliment each other, you have the Street smart Italian guy and the righteous courteous and kind Dr Shirley, they're both able to teach and nurture each other, and help each other fulfil their goal. Some of the racism the Dr had to endure was beyond anything we see today and shows what great courage he had in doing this tour of the deep south.
The storyline is well scripted, well thought out and excellent cast and acted. The pacing was sometimes slow, but otherwise this is a must see film and I highly recommend."
GREEN BOOK,15 November 2020,8/10,"Racial discrimination is still here all over the world. ""Green Book"" just illuminate such a horrible situation and the way it gets all of this is impressive. On plot, it is properly concise and detailed, it's how a biography goes.
The movie is excellent because it comes to ""change"". From Doc. Shirley bending down to enjoy fried chicken, to Tony respecting Doc. not for payment but for friendship. From police come to find trouble, to a gentle ""Your tire is flat"" ""Merry Christmas"".
Everyone of us should put down discrimination, for all god's children are born equal. Racial segregation happened, and it's still happening. But not just for that, interactions among people is what counts either. And, with a happy ending, it sheds a light on the road for humanity equality. It deserves to be a ""Great"" movie.With all these deep stuff, in my humble opinion, should be one of the greatest in my list. 9*"
GREEN BOOK,31 May 2021,10/10,This movie is such a masterpiece of perfection and brilliant performances!!! Loved it!! Must watch movie!!!
GREEN BOOK,8 October 2021,8/10,It's just a road trip but what compelling drama with the backdrop of racism in the South.
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,9/10,"High praise for the performers (side note: Viggo Mortensen, a superior actor, may be endangering his health in cutting or putting on weight in various roles) and the director. To people who don't like ""Green Book"": it's a movie, and a story can be entertaining and meaningful without being a lecture. Two quick points: a. I'd vote for Mahershala Ali to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- superior work in developing a complicated character -- gifted, eccentric, idealistic, ambivalent -- and for ultimately being successful in creating pathos and admiration for the character in the audience. b. To highlight one of many excellent scenes (you'll know when you see the film): one of the best ways to fight racism is for the decent person in the room to have the guts not to deliver a sermon but to just tell the fool in the room to knock it off and to damn well watch-your-rear mean it."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,9/10,"First, this is a great Christmas movie, but a little more on that latter.
Second, this is a buddy movie! One that consists of the two people who could not be more different.
Third, this is a VERY funny movie and there in lies its strength.
Sadly, the TV preview makes one think this is a movies of prejudice and discrimination the south in the 1960's. But it's about a white average Joe and a cultured black man. who help each other become more well rounded and better human beings overall.
It reminds us of the segregated south and it's evils (alas too much of which still remains) but it does it almost surreptitiously. It makes it personal, so we can understand it better.
However, without this aspect it would still be a good movie, but with it, it makes it great.
While the acting of the two leads could. not be better don't overlook the performance of Linda Cardellini.
before As for it being a Christmas movie, Christmas is about family, friends and peace on earth good will to men, See it. You'll see exactly what I mean."
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2019,10/10,"A very strong contender for the Oscars, Green Book is a touching and eye-opening story about two men's unlikely friendship at the very unlikely time. On the surface it may be seen as remarkable struggle by an African-American pianist against racism in the deep South in 1962 as well as his friendship with a working-class white man. Thanks to tour de force performances by the two leads, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, director Farrelly avoids cliches on discrimination and instead provokes some universal hints on polarization, alienation and discrimination under the disguise of tolerance in modern times. As Don Shirley beautifully yet sadly talks about sense of belonging, Green Book makes me think about new versions of green book approach (i.e. adapted forms of discrimination) remains in the minds of people -- the US or elsewhere. By the same token, the world cannot be a better place until we all learn the value of coexistence and understanding as opposed to othering and polarizing. I really hope Ali and Mortensen get Oscar this year."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2020,9/10,"This movie was terrific. Great story about friendship and helping strangers. Of course some saw it as something com'me Different but that's the cost you pay for being so woke.Terrific acting, story, locations and the music is spectacular. Highly recommended"
GREEN BOOK,7 October 2019,10/10,"Felt compelled to write this.Besides the superb acting, the script is very witty, the scenery beautifully juxtopositioned against the darkness of society and the intertwining story lines are as complex as you want to make them.How friendships develop ... the breaking down of barriers ... not judging books by their covers ... being true to yourself ... commitment ... moral high ground ... take your pick!If you watch no other film ... watch this."
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,9/10,"I enjoyed every minuet of it.
All cast did britty great job , the directing and the cenery was created sooooo beautifully ."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,9/10,"I have been waiting for years to see a movie like this one. So much to talk about from the aspect and angles, social, political, racial from all angles and perspective. Great to reflect on how far we evolved but also how far we are to be where we should be as a society. Amazing acting, production is superb and the story line even based on the true story us flawless. Thank you so much to deliver such a piece of real cinema."
GREEN BOOK,7 December 2018,9/10,"What a great gift of a Christmas movie and more! In this time of division, anger and hatred, this picture offered hope and a look at how people can overcome their differences and bigotries. What makes it even better is that it's based on true events. The script was exceptional and the editing moved the storyline along seamlessly. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were pitch perfect in their respective roles. Oscar worthy movie and performances. I would urge anyone who would like a positive and inspiring experience to go see this movie. So rare these days."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,9/10,Just go and watch this movie. You will not regret it.
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2020,8/10,I dont know wy it took my two years to see this movie although i had always heared the best remakrs.This movi is a true jem - although for 80% of the movie its the two main protagonists thhat interact they manage to convey their selfs and the backgrounds they come from. Their gradual get to know each other abd hhow cultures merge along with the understanding of one each other is superb especially when it is contradicted by the prejudiced behhaviour.Cinematograpy is stunning as well - a very wel diirected movieIts a must watch
GREEN BOOK,24 December 2019,10/10,I only write reviews on movies when I feel they truly earn it and this movie truly earned it. A movie of true friendship not bond by a cruel society. Not everything has to be or turn out negative in this world and this movie just goes to show that. Truly a great movie and a must watch!!!
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,"Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and tells the true story of Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen, an Italian-American bouncer who becomes a driver and bodyguard for Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, which was set in 1962.Viggo Mortensen played a lot of roles in the past and has become one of the most well known actors in the film industry. At this point of his career, it's a pleasure to see him in a role that his character was written. Tony Vallelonga was part charismatic, part vulgar, and part funny. His character becomes very well rounded as his relationship with Don Shirley grows deeper as the film progresses, while giving his best performance yet.As for Mahershala Ali, who has been great in Moonlight, has shown to be greater in this film. He plays Don Shirley, a renowned pianist who is very conflicted and incomplete. He encounters different forms of discrimination against him and his fellow race during their whole trip with Tony. He tries to belong to be accepted by the ""civilized"" society he struggles to interact with. A society where he is only respected when on stage and becoming demoralized as he steps off, leaving him sympathetic and compelling to the audience, along with Ali's very powerful performance.The chemistry between the two characters are no doubt the heart of the film, almost becoming a buddy film in a good way. The screenplay throughout balances the humor and the heavy moments perfectly, making scene between scene flow better with no dragging nor pacing issues. It's mainstream approach also makes it more accessible to the public, paired with amusing dialogue between each characters from Tony to Shirley, to his wife, and others. They also incorporate very well written characters as audiences will know about their inner struggles, especially with Shirley.The underlying themes may be obvious, but to the extent of having heavy subject matter and making it digestable for all audiences with the use of humor, some light and some dark. The events accurately depicts the intention of the message of the film and still be relevant to today's times, considering it's set in the 1960's.This film has great performances, great writing, and great chemistry between the two main characters. It is one of those films where you forget you're watching one and it becomes an experience. It's Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay win at the 91st Academy Awards is well deserved by everyone who worked on this masterpiece. This is a movie everyone should see in regards to the reality of our world today.-Yman Dayawon"
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2019,,"This was such a well done film. It had everything one could hope to get from a movie going experience. A dramatic masterpiece that will pull at your heart strings and even provide a few laughs along the way. The performances are Oscar worthy. The art and set design are so authentic given this is a period piece, that was a challenge I'm sure. I just cant find too many faults with this movie. The fact that its based on a true story just makes it that much more powerful."
GREEN BOOK,21 March 2019,10/10,"God, I love every second of this movie. This movie was so well written I just can't describe this on own words. Doctor 'a black man' who face so much discrimination that I guess no one in this world should've face it. The chemistry between the driver 'a white man' and the doctor, it was so well written, SPOILERS AHEAD.Tony - Your music touches the heart doc, but how did you maintain this with such insanity.
Doctor - Tony, it's simple you only win when you maintain your dignity, you'll never win with your hands, dignity prevails everywhere and that's what I'm good at it.
Tony - You're unbelievable, doc.
This movie teaches us something very important ""We're not white enough or We're not black enough, We're humans."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,"Green Book, winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture (which is i in my opinion totally deserved) is a celebration of life & friendship itself.
The movie is really great and funny at once.
It's packed with a lot of funny scenes but the movie will also be in your head for quite a long time.The star in this film is obviously Viggo Mortensen. (For sure 98%)
The way he is playing a (quite not smart) food minded Italian-American is making this movie really funny and without exception one of his best role's he has ever played.
My most funniest scene is when someone offers Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) a snack, he's tasting it, grabs a napkin from the plate the waiter is holding, spitting it out on the napkin and puts the napkin with the snack and all of his slime in it back on the plate.
I seriously laughed in tears when that scene came on.If you haven't seen this movie, go now while it's still in theaters.
YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,9/10,"In the 91st Oscar Award Nominated for best Picture and also for Best Film Editing Green Book is my movie of the year 2018 ,its enjoy-ability comes almost completely from its starring performances from an excellent Viggo Mortensen which is my most favorite actor & also nominated for best Leading Roll and Mahershala Ali for the best supporting roll both are imbue their roles with precision and pathos. They find nuance within their familiar types individually and share a spirited chemistry with each other. They are a joy to watch together from start to finish, even though you can tell from the beginning exactly how specific moments between them are going to play out by the end"
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2019,10/10,"Ali and Mortensen both deserve Oscars for their performances is this wonderful, funny, sad & insightful movie!!"
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2020,10/10,"Mahershala Ali, played the role beyond great, how it captured the sensitivity, grace and impetus of Dr. Shirley it was gratifying to see ... I meant it!
Viggo did it perfectly too, even Linda Cardellini gives her the character a soul.
GREAT STORY, GREAT ACTORS, GREAT MOVIE!
I hope everyone enjoys this movie as much as I did.
Definitively gets in on the list of movies you must to watch before you die."
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,8/10,"Really enjoyed this film, worth a watch & great chemistry on screen by the Ali & Mort. Nice story, simple but clean and moving."
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,"Viggo Mortensen had me chomping very slowly and quietly on my popcorn and buncha crunch so I wouldn't miss a word.My wife and I danced in our seats during the Piano at the Bar scene.A thoughtful, romantic thrill ride; journey of understanding ending with a tender embrace."
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,9/10,"Director Peter Farrelly was truly fortunate for landing such incredible actors to play such incredible characters in this film. Ali plays Dr. Don Shirley, a black, classical musician who is starting a musical excursion into the deep South. Mortensen, mob-tied Italian bodyguard named Tony Lip (they called him Tony ""Lip"" because he couldn't shut up), is hired to be Shirley's protection as he tours and performs in an area of the country notorious for racism and bigotry.
The contrast between Shirley and Tony is organically comical. It also naturally leads to endless possibilities for character depth and development, which Farrelly took full advantage of in his exceptional screenplay."
GREEN BOOK,13 April 2020,10/10,You dont unusually get to see a movie like this. The affect both characters had on each other. The reality of that time I got to see. Such beautiful acting by both of the characters. It is definitely in my top 3 movies. Such a beautiful movie. Totally loved it.
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,8/10,"Love these types of movies, although heartbreaking in parts, nice buddy movie"
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,10/10,"Brilliant! Absolutely fantastic. I will tell you why you should NOT miss this brilliant movie.
I haven't laughed as much in years. Actually I cried and laughed at the same time through the whole movie. .
I would compare this movie to great films on my top list like ""The Green Mile"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Forest Gump"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Schindler's List"", ""The Color Purple"" (and just between you and me ""Sound of Music"" - I know you won't tell anybody that I like that film it is my little/BIG secret).
Viggo Mortensen is the ***STAR ***of this movie and the performance of Mahershala Ali is also excellent.
The simple uneducated, street-smart, rough but honest and kind-hearted character of Tony Lip is so brilliantly made alive by Viggo Mortensen that it is probably one of the best performance in the history of movies.
If Viggo Mortensen won't get the Oscar for his performance it will bee a scandal.
10 / 10 - Don't miss it :-)"
GREEN BOOK,8 September 2019,4/10,Roma should've won. Not as awful as I expected but definitely nowhere being a good film.35
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,10/10,Funny and sad in places...but a very very good film
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,8/10,"Recently my father asked me ""is this film about some book that is also green?"". I replied with a smile, ""Not exactly, dad.""
The book, of course, is present in the film and plays an important role (this is a collection of hotels and restaurants names where African-American travelers could stop), but the story revolves around two characters - a talented African-American pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American bouncer driver (Viggo Mortenesen), who travel together around the states where one main character is supposed to give concerts and the second one monitors the safety of his boss.
I really liked the atmosphere of the 60s, clothes, cars, music, characters in the film. The dialogues are written ironically and at the same time filled with meaning for the viewer.
The film that you watch without stopping, although it is far from a blockbuster; the film, where behind a light comedy lies a deep meaning. The green book isn't a picture of slavery, although the theme of ""racism"" is acutely felt here. This is a film about honesty, humanity, true friendship and mutual help between people."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,4/10,"History shows that what makes people better is their education and not their skin color. While spend it on monotonous trips. Obviously, this film took relevance due to the current political agenda that is handled in the USA."
GREEN BOOK,22 September 2019,9/10,"Started out a bit slow but understood it was an effort to show the way life was during the 60s. Once the road trip began, the drama and comedy kicked in and I was hooked. So good, I may watch it again. Unfortunately, it's not a movie I can let my mother see because of the language which is a shame!!"
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,8/10,"This movie is amazing in every way. I didn't expect anything when I went to the cinema. While I was sitting there I laughed so loudly and had so much fun.
But it also made me so sad, there is so many part of this movie that mad me cry. All though it made me so mad as well. I didn't get mad at the movie, I got mat at humanity. That we are so hateful against each other and that we can't except that all of us are different.
An amazing movie with a great story behind it.
A lot of humour and deep thoughts.
Worth to see."
GREEN BOOK,3 May 2019,8/10,"This film was breathtaking! I couldn't breath when it was sad, when it was ugly, when it was violent, when it was touching when it was funny! What a great film! What a sad but great story! 2 amazing men who changed their individual worlds and then the ugly world if only by watching this film!"
GREEN BOOK,11 June 2019,10/10,Amazing movie both played well sometimes happy sometimes struggle sometimes frustration hope love all in one
GREEN BOOK,31 May 2020,10/10,Decided to watch this about 2 years after it came out after a recommendation and was over the moon I decided to watch it. Moving story that makes you laugh and cry at the same time
GREEN BOOK,5 September 2019,10/10,"'It takes courage to change people's hearts.' - Oleg (Green Book)'You never win with violence. You only win when you maintain your dignity.' - Don Shirley (Green Book)'The world's full of lonely people afraid to make the first move.' - Tony Lip (Green Book).And i liked these part of conversations after Don Shirley and Tony leaved police station:Dr. Don Shirley: You shouldn't have hit him.
Tony Lip: I didn't like the way he was treating you, making you stand out in the rain like that.
Dr. Don Shirley: Please, you hit him because of what he called you. I've had to endure that kind of talk my entire life, you should be able to take it for at least one night.
Tony Lip: What, I can't get mad at that stuff that he was saying because I ain't black? Christ, I'm blacker than you.
Dr. Don Shirley: Excuse me?
Tony Lip: You don't know s**t about your own people, what they eat, how they talk, how they live. You don't even know who Little Richard is.
Dr. Don Shirley: Oh, so knowing who Little Richard is makes you blacker than me? Oh, Tony, I wish you could hear yourself sometimes, you wouldn't talk so d**n much.
Tony Lip: Buls**t! I know exactly who I am. I'm the guy who lived in the same neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life, with my mother, my father, my brother, and now my wife and kids. That's it, that's who I am. I'm the as****e who has to hustle every godd**n day to put food out on table. You, Mr. Big Shot, you live on top of a castle traveling around the world doing concerts for rich people. I live on the streets, you sit on a throne. So, yeah, my world is way more blacker than yours!Dr. Don Shirley: Pull over.
Tony Lip: What?
Dr. Don Shirley: Pull over.
Tony Lip: I ain't pulling over!
Dr. Don Shirley: Stop the car, Tony!
(Tony stops the car and Don gets out and starts walking in the rain)
Tony Lip: What? What are you doing?! Doc? Doc, what the hell are you doing? Doc, get back in the car!
Dr. Don Shirley: Yes, I live in a castle! Tony. Alone! And rich white people pay me to play piano for them, because it makes them feel cultured. But as soon as I step off that stage, I go right back to being just another n****r to them. Because that is their true culture. And I suffer that slight alone, because I'm not accepted by my own people, because I'm not like them either! So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am ?!"
GREEN BOOK,22 May 2020,8/10,"Movie tells a lot.
it's a diversion in Peter Farrelly's directing style where he has shot the 60s by giving it a charming look. Mahershala Ali's performance really worth an oscar.
Saying about the Academy Awards there were lot good movies with this
but this movie really warms our heart.
There were many good scenes. The one I loved was Ali's Face when the driver throws out plastic glass of drink.
that was well expressed"
GREEN BOOK,5 October 2020,10/10,"First of all, great story. Second of all, well played by the actors. Really gets you thinking and very touching. This was everything I want from a good movie."
GREEN BOOK,8 June 2020,8/10,"I never thought that in 2018 I would be surprised by any film. But it happened and I'm thrilled to watch it! To be honest, I watched this movie 3 times and each time I discovered something new. The actors who played the main characters are selected just fine, and the plot and camerawork deserve separate praise. The film is based on real events, but it doesn't seem heavy. On the contrary, the film is lightweight but at the same time thought-provoking. If you like good humor, jazz, classical music and stories about true friendship - you must watch this movie!"
GREEN BOOK,7 May 2020,8/10,"A nice feel to the movie about two men from different cultures, facing different challenges and how their relationship benefits them both. Decent pacing, good characters, and based on a true story, so that makes it a little more intriguing."
GREEN BOOK,11 May 2021,10/10,Basically i don't review but this movie impressed me to write down here first of all there is no lagging i started loving watching this movie from the start to the end it was one of my good hollywood movie I've seen ever i bet you don't ever miss this movie extraordinary level worth watchable one...
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2021,10/10,"Story,cast,acting everything is just amazing. Movies like Green Book teach us how to live in today's world."
GREEN BOOK,12 July 2021,8/10,"An uncommon roadtrip through the southern part of America? Now that got me excited and heightened the expectations! - expectations that were executed perfectly!During the introduction of the characters, I got so into Viggo Mortsensen's acting I knew I were in for a good ride. A good ride through the streets of the south with a fried chicken, not so salty, but elegantly with knives and forks.Don Shirley's representation was indeed purposely made irritating for the viewer at first with his nit picking. However, this dragged on to be the best way to bond these two main characters together. With to different minds relatively open for new opportunities - in the long run.And oh my I've got to mention how many times Peter Farrelly surprised me through his writing. There were several scenes I expected one thing and got something completely different. Some might come off unnecessary, but they do build up the tension of both your emotions as a viewer and the character-development/bonds. This guy just knows how to create a well-written story. And I love it!"
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,9/10,"Worthy of Oscar nominations for both Actors.Really enjoyed this 'road' movie - a movie about race, a movie about friendship, a movie that captures the early 60s in America so well. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali work so well together - and the cinematography is just amazing to behold. To say more would be to risk spoilers but i strongly recommend this film"
GREEN BOOK,28 October 2018,10/10,"I was fortunate enough to see this at a Directors Guild Screening last night. Wow!! Characters, dialogue, sets, costumes, cars..... really transported me to an era I had not experienced. I was sad when the movie ended... the mark of a great film. The scene with the fried chicken in the car was priceless. I could watch it 1000 times.I sense oscar nods for Mahershala Ali, Viggo Mortensen, art department, costumes, writer(s) and director. Absolutely amazing..... Do not hesisitate to see this!!!"
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,8/10,"It's a really great movie. The story of friendship between the film's stars reminded me of the French-made ""The Intouchables"". This movie is traced to a true story and the performance of the leading actors."
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2019,10/10,I thought this movie would be boring. Well I'm glad that I was wrong. I really loved the acting of both the main characters really top notch! The story telling and deep life lessons are enough to make you feel all the emotions ! Holy smokes everyone needs to see this movie.
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book is simply the year 2018 movie saviour... since it was a year suffering from a big lack of oscar material movies, dealing with serious issues and showing perfect dialogues and performances. So no worries Green Book got it all, a feel good, music themed, drama comedy road trip movie, that will surely stand as a futur cult classic. Hands down!"
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,9/10,I've been wanting to watch this movie for some time now. I'm glad I didn't miss out and finally watched it.Just watch it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. The only way you won't is if your heart is already dead.
GREEN BOOK,25 August 2020,8/10,"It was one of the best drama movies I've seen, but it also had some good comedy scenes. It can be said that this is one of the best films to fight racism"
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,5/10,"The simple story of a uptight black classical pianist traveling through the deep south with an Italian American Stereotype to discover and entertain more deep south stereotypes from the very rich land owning southerners to the usual rednecks. On the way there journey they learn about each other and themselves to find some middle ground between each other. In these Hollywood period pieces, you normally get the 'prejudice is everywhere even in ourselves' cliche. I think this movie could have used more originality in this subject matter. Jack Kenedy even phones in at one point which I'm not sure if that's based on real events or agenda setting. This movie is somewhere between watchable and just underwhelming."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a very long time. I cannot begin to explain how extraordinary are the performances of Vigo M, and Mahershala A. Their on screen chemistry is so palpable that it truly makes you feel what their characters are going through.
I am beyond pleased they are nominated for an Oscar but most importantly that this story has been told."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,10/10,"This film moves you from the start, pouring humanity at every scene. Well written, well acted, and historically so relevant and so timely. It's a great piece to remind us of the demons of racism and intolerance that plagued this America then and that still today shows its ugly head. This is Oscar material."
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,9/10,"I have to admit I was sceptical when it started, but when it finished... its one of my favourite films now, and the fact it's based on a true story, it highlights how horrible things were in the past and how far we have come with some hilarious moments that had the whole screen laughing! Loved this and it's extremely well acted out by all. Would highly recommend it when it comes out!"
GREEN BOOK,29 April 2019,10/10,"A beautifully written and filmed real life drama. The portrayal of two people from completely backgrounds coming together on this journey, and the way they come across social and personal barriers and overcome them, is just beautiful.
Mahershala Ali & Viggo Mortensen did a great job here, also I had no idea of Tony Lip's history and that this was same man who went on to play Carmine snr in The Sopranos, this man lived a colourful life.
The scene at the end of the movie brought a tear to my eye, and that's coming from me, who as Tony Soprano would say, am a Strong Silent type , like Gary Cooper!"
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,10/10,"I loved this movie. And yes, I have read the articles about Shirley's family not being pleased. I'm not sure where the truth resides in that issue. But I felt so good throughout this film, and especially at the ending. I wanted to hug both guys. They helped each other become better humans. And Mortensen and Ali were so different but their performances were equally wonderful. (Except for Tony's food scenes, I mean really? And he had such a classy wife.). Oh well, I LOVED it!"
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2019,10/10,"A classic , supurb performance by both actors, audiences should, stop , open their hearts and watch their performances"
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,10/10,What I enjoyed mostly about this film is the onscreen interaction between V. Mortenson and M. Ali it was natural and funny.
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2019,8/10,"Really good movie, with good acting of the main roles plus based on real life."
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2018,9/10,"From the trailer I thought this movie could be a little bit cliche or too predictable, but the movie is really good and captivating. Great perfomances from the main characters and a story that will teach and move you.Watch the movie, you will not regret!"
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2021,10/10,"Just beautiful in every way.
The actors did an amazing job."
GREEN BOOK,21 January 2019,8/10,"A true story about two men becoming friends through the relationship of employer-employee didn't disappoint again. In both movies, one main problem or ""disability"" is being conquered with the help of, well literally, driver.
Viggo Mortensen's acting and transformation is above all expectations and is really to be enjoyed on whole another level.
This movie is all you want it to be to spend a great time."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2021,10/10,"This movie is amazing with its plot and its headliners. When I watched this movie, I felt very strange and upset to see this kinda racism exists in this world. Everybody needs to watch this movie and learn about one of the most important virtuoso in the world and his life story."
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,10/10,"Green Book is based upon a true story, and one that's important for most people to view. It's regarding race relations the history of discrimination purely based upon a person's color, and not their contributions to their own community, but to society as a whole. This film was beautifully written, directed, and acted. And while I was able to laugh in parts, I found it more drama than comedy. I strongly encourage more people to view this to fully comprehend what our past has allowed white people to do to those who aren't the same race or ethnicity."
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,9/10,"Both Lead actors give great performances in this humorous, charming, interesting and modest film.
Many times throughout the film I was waiting for an over the top, unrealistic display of the characters morals. I am very glad that this never happened, great credit to the Director for allowing the smaller moments to carry the film. In doing so you are given time to think about all these moments and what they mean to you and the characters. These characters evolve through the film as they both learn about themselves and each other. Again not shown with grand gestures but with small changes, just how the main theme of Racism needed to be changed and still does even to this day.
The modesty of the film sets itself apart from other films of its type. It doesn't feel the need to shove its important themes down in your face but hope you have the openness to acknowledge them.
Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are well worth the watch and both deserving of award nominations as well as the Director Peter Farrelly.
A lovely film that has it all."
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,10/10,"I'm constantly on the lookout for a movie that deserves a 10 Star rating and am also constantly annoyed by the number that fall short of a perfect score because of deep seated bigotry.Green Book is very well written, directed and acted out during in a very difficult period in American history.Wow, if the American people could actually see how stupid they look despite being beautiful, caring people at heart. How different the world would be !!Hello, Green Book, you made it and you made a mark. Well done 😘"
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,,Everything is well directed and acted. It's a privilege to watch this kind of movies. Definitely one of the best movies of all time. That's why this is the best motion picture of 2018. Really this is a great one.
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,9/10,"Good in all aspects. The plot is smooth. The casting did a wonderful job. Most importantly, this is a very smart movie.They put in right amount of conflicts and keep the movie a comedy, which makes the issue could be easily taken in. We would think about it, discuss it, or work hard to solve it, but first we need to recognize the issue.
Overall, it was very enjoyable to watch. Could be a good family movie."
GREEN BOOK,12 April 2019,10/10,"That was the best movie I've watched recently. I was so surprised to see the peppers attitude in those days. The gradual change of how the hero think about coloured people was so impressive. The problem captured in this movie is difficult, but the whole story is heart-warming, and interesting.
I really enjoyed this movie! It is worth watching at the theatre."
GREEN BOOK,5 August 2019,10/10,A piece of masterwork. And Viggo Mortensen is briiliant as ususal.
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,7/10,"It's typically the kind of movie that you are well aware of what times have you been situated in. Upon hearing mint julep, I couldn't help holding my thoughts back to the movie. They directly went for Carol. And the toilet stuff is just the topic of the Help.
Maybe I expected too much of this movie. That's how I ended up looking at it as just so-so. But it's not bad. It's indeed enlightful. Only if I learnt more about classical music, I could jave enjoyed it better."
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2020,10/10,"Absolutely fantastic movie, you can end of the story"
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,8/10,Never thought black man would be treat like that back to the day. Nice story.
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,8/10,"A brilliantly written story, taking themes of racism, social class and so much more, and turning it on his head. Such a great design of polar opposite characters, who in turn, are both opposite and indicative of their stereotypes. A real sense of realisation, especially in the case of Viggo's character. Brilliant."
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2020,9/10,"I wasn't expecting to like this film.. However I enjoyed every minute.. Expected the ending, however left me more educated.. Emotional and a warm glow.... I'm just glad that the world has changed for the better.. Loved all the characters involved.. Highly recommended viewing"
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"I created an account on IMDB only to write this review.
As the title state, this is the best movie i've seen in a long time.
Great acting and great story line with the right amount of humor as well."
GREEN BOOK,18 September 2018,9/10,"I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. 
 Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. 
 Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken.
Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. 
I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives.
I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward."
GREEN BOOK,4 July 2019,10/10,"This is a very good-looking movie that gives people an idea of the history of that era. Ali's performance is really wonderful, Oscar's best supporting actor is well deserved."
GREEN BOOK,3 May 2019,8/10,"There have been many movies made that address the past issues of race and segregation. But none hit the cord of humanity and the soul as this one does. It can be summed up this way: ""They started out to change the world, and in the process they found themselves.""
One of the new best movies out there. My compliments to all who were involved in the orchestration of this masterpiece."

GREEN BOOK,14 December 2020,9/10,"A successful story, a successful adaptation. it didn't smell of any ads. It's not like some cliché movies you can understand. I watched with pleasure."
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2020,10/10,"A story you didn't know you needed to hear. Amazing acting between the two leads, they act with their heart and soul."
GREEN BOOK,19 May 2020,10/10,Viggo is pretty much a stamp for a good film and this is no exception. The subject matter may have been done many times before but this is a while new angle and delightful story telling
GREEN BOOK,13 December 2020,10/10,"This was a great movie from start to bottom, I can definitely see why it won oscars!"
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2020,10/10,"Even after the freedom of slaves by the 13th amendment, still the black people in america were not living well. they had to face sever discrimination. This movie points out the dark colors of the white peoples minds in treating black people. Even though they in some cases became higher in class than them in education, skill, qualification. Yet the skin of their color made white people think they cannot sit with us, they are inferior, they cannot come to our homes, they cannot eat with us. it is a journey of two minds learning from each other. Knowing each other made them point out their faults and both tried to change those faults and became a new person. this movie will make you feel like you are on a journey of souls and emotion and discovery and ofcourse, history. definitely worth watching"
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2021,10/10,"A extremly beautiful based-on-real events movie, instead of spoling the movie, i will rather just tell you that this is a must watch movie and that your wasting your time reading reviews instead of watching it"
GREEN BOOK,19 May 2020,8/10,"There are some differences from the best Oscars in the past. The whole film story runs through this ""green book"" journey with a relaxed and witty atmosphere. The two protagonists of the story have different skin colors and different personalities. My dear friend has extraordinary significance in the social background at that time. Making friends is a process of seeking common ground while reserving differences. The story also tells us a lot of life philosophy. Objectively speaking, ""Green Book"" is worth seeing!"
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2021,10/10,Amazingly feel good movie. So glad I watched it. Can compare it with Shawshank Redemption (friendship part).
GREEN BOOK,25 June 2020,9/10,"The film has been very critical of racism, and I fell in love with it and told everyone to watch it once."
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2019,,"Great film and fantastic cast!If you like films like ""The Butler"" and ""The Help"" - then look no further.Based on a true story about the road trip that two unlikely characters take together that are world's apart yet the distance of that trip brings them closer together in ways one would not think possible. It has spunk, humor, great lines and dynamics that some films do not quite capture.Not one to be missed!"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2021,10/10,"Mahershala's best film, very well acted. The fact it was based on a true story made it even better watching. Mind was blown when I realised viggo was from lord of the Rs"
GREEN BOOK,18 April 2020,10/10,"I don't wanna go into story, it is better to explore it yourself. This is one of rare movies which I have watched and after the watching I was ready to watch it again... And again... And again... Real gem of movie, with realistic acting, perfect story, everything is perfect.
One important thing, watch movie carefully and remember what you see, there will be at least 15 scenes where you are awarded for remembering some little scene with scene who refers to scene before. Really good!
And the feeling of the movie? It has hard times, but with good intelligent laughs, and when the movie finish you are happy for that experience. Real masterpiece!"
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2019,10/10,"After watching Green Book, I understand why Green Book won Oscar Best Picture: it's a great story about discrimination, the human condition & true friendship!Congratulation to Green Book!"
GREEN BOOK,5 April 2019,10/10,Heart warming story of friendship. The story draws you in and captivated you.
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,9/10,"Such a great movie with fantastic actors Viggo Mortensen and Marhershala Ali who brought so much to this true story about two men from totally opposite sides of the cultural spectrum take a two month road trip together to the south where they both were out of their perspective culture zones. Although they didn't ""walk in each other's shoes,"" they walked close enough and through enough for each to change their perspectives of the other and to learn something from one another; ultimately becoming life long friends. Although there were exaggerations in personality portrayal of both main characters as well as others, they were good for a laugh and emphasized, within the length of a movie, the transitions made in two months.
We both loved this movie! It is a crowd pleaser, winning many people's choice awards at film festivals. It wins ours!"
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2019,10/10,"Movie that I have seen for a while that has actors with 100% perfect acting specially Viggo.
Movie contains with regular life of colored people and their social issues. How people were treated by white people earlier.
Best movie watched after hidden figures described or shows us about the diversity.
Thanks Peter Farrelly to make a absolute touching movie."
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,8/10,"A beautiful and well-written movie, with strong messages.
It gets you to think, and that is the best cause one film should have.
You will treat your loved ones much better after this one, especially because you will surround yourself with people who are basiclly kind to others and that's all that matters."
GREEN BOOK,9 January 2019,7/10,"Of course, it is a good movie embracing beautiful music, good imagery, good acting, etc. But it is still a slow-running road movie whose storyline can be expected well from the beginning.Can Green Book be a bit overrated?"
GREEN BOOK,21 December 2018,,"Green Book is a very typical film by how you see it, a poor working class Italian is paid to drive a rich black classically trained piano player around the deep south of the USA while it is still normal with racism.
But the movie knows that it's a cliché, and it constantly rewards you for guessing right and makes you smile when it takes a turn you didn't see coming.The movie is serious in how it is played out and that is what makes it a good comedy to me. The jokes are mostly referring to what happened before.If you have grown up a little rough you can get the character of Tony and his ways, ""It isn't stealing if the rock lies on the ground."" and even if you don't get it I think you would come to like him by the end.
The same goes for Shirley who starts off being very aloof and hard to like because he appears so snobby but by the end he shows off a side where you finally understand him to a whole new point and you are happy to see how they end up treating one another.The racism in the movie feels realistic in that not everyone is a redneck, they are just set in their ways and most people don't go out of their ways to be racist and even when they get angry it is because they have been wronged most of the time.
To me this movies way of treating racism is the best I have seen in a very long time because it didn't take sides and it wasn't about racism but it always came back to it. Just like taxes and death, back in those days you needed a handbook to know where to be safe and the movie really pulls that aspect off.The music in this movie is incredible and I found myself tapping along with the music in one way or another, the classical, the radio and the bar music.
It had soul and it felt good.!!Spoilers!!
There was a scene in the movie which sum up the movie in a very simple way where Tony tells Shirley that he is blacker than Shirley because he knows the culture, grew up on the streets and is a worker having to constantly work to pay for his family. It really puts it into perspective that things are not all about skin color, race or where you grew up, it is all a part of you and you are not less black because you are rich, and you're not more happy because you are rich neither. It all comes down to everything that makes you, You. That you can relate to anyone if you only talk to them for a while.
""Because I am human nothing human is alien to me."""
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,10/10,One of best christmas movie ever and show me what is love mean and also I have no words.
GREEN BOOK,26 May 2021,10/10,Amazing what a great pleasure to watch Viggo and ali fine acting fine in every way.
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,9/10,"Just seen Green Book at a Secret Unlimited screening at my local Cineworld.
Wow...what a beautifully shot and performed movie. The two leading actors, Viggo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali were brilliant.
I had no idea what to expect. I was more than pleasantly surprised.
Highly recommended viewing"
GREEN BOOK,4 May 2019,8/10,"This is a great movie to watch at home. It brought tears to my eyes.
Growing up as a military brat and in the Deep South at this time period, I didn't have any idea what racial issues were.
We had black maids because they were affordable. I went to an all white segregated school when I was 7 years old under George Wallis' governorship and didn't know any different at the time.
This movie is real!!"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,Great movie with an excellent storyline. Well acted and great music to guide you along the journey with the two main characters. Based on a true story that deserved to be told .Highly Recommended.
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,9/10,"This is a hugely enjoyable movie that shows how far race relations in America has come and perhaps also how far it still has to go, told with a good storyline, simple plot device (the road trip) but most of all with really sympathetic lead characters. Two opposites in NY life, Tony Lip, the working class Italian nightclub bouncer from the Bronx ( Viggo Mortensen) and the world class African American pianist Dr Don Shirley ( Mahershala Ali) who lived in a flat above Carnegie Hall, team up for a tour down South. Based on a true story, the road trip shows us that opposite characters can learn humanity and civil understanding of another's world viewpoint from each other in an entertaining and humourous way, and survive the dangers, prejudices and stark reality of life in the Deep South in 1962. Go see it with an open heart and mind and you will be entertained and educated as you enjoy this tale of two men's journey towards mutual understanding."
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,10/10,"So moving, so thought provoking, great acting, everyone on the theater loved it."
GREEN BOOK,12 May 2019,10/10,This was a beautiful film. The acting was stellar.
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2020,6/10,"It goes through not only the geography of the United States, but also the history of the United States, and it goes through the American society of that time. Maybe the director doesn't want to be nostalgic, the movie is full of American symbols. This is for americans. No wonder they got a high rating."
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,10/10,"Well I was dubious to know if it really is something worth of Best Picture this year. Then I had already read several articles on Academy playing safe, being biased etc. about 'Green book'. But me & my wife still were interested & decided to give it a watch for ourselves. It turned out to be one of the best movie experiences we had.This movie is lovely. Viggo Mortensen a working-class Italian-American bouncer cum Driver is outstanding. We liked him so much that we believe he should probably have won Best Actor. But yeah Rami Malek has gone through several transformations and literally lived Freddie Mercury on screen so no complains. Mahershala Ali as an African-American classical pianist is so convincing, you feel as if this role was meant for only him. No wonder he won his 2nd Oscar this year.The screenplay is apt. The 2 hours plus run time felt gone without realizing. The friendship that these two main characters develop on the journey is such a joy to watch. So, the scenes with injustices makes you disturbed on what life that would have been in those times."
GREEN BOOK,21 December 2019,10/10,"Great Christmas flic, of which we were unaware, until we ran across it on Showtime just before Christmas 2019. Especially, liked ""Tony"" - who would have fit right in to ""The Soprano Familiy.""You will love it! Capisce?"
GREEN BOOK,12 May 2019,8/10,"Now I know why this movie won the Oscar. It truly deserves it. Had the most satisfying 2 hours watching this hell of a Journey. I got his feeling of true satisfaction which I get only after I have been throughly captivated by the experience. Everything was perfect. I don not mean to add any spoilers but whoever reads this review I would like to just one thing ""DO YOURSELF A FOVOUR AND JUST SEE THIS GEM OF A MOVIE."" You won't regret it. Peace!!"
GREEN BOOK,17 June 2019,10/10,"Entertains while telling a story based on a real relationship. Acting was superb, story felt true to life. Recommended."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"I saw the picture and it's a good movie. Not an outstanding motion picture, but good solid work."
GREEN BOOK,2 June 2019,9/10,"An excellent, true story of two brilliant characters, constantly learning off one-another in a time, not so long ago, where matters weren't easy.
Beautifully written screenplay, mixed with scenic shots of superb sets and sights, finessed by two great actors, who constantly kept me keen.In whole, a perfect example of a great film and story, with lessons every step of the way. Perfection."
GREEN BOOK,4 May 2019,3/10,"How did this unoriginal snoozer win best picture? A movie like this hinges on character development, and these characters were poorly developed. Someone took a true story and crammed it into a cookie-cutter film about an unlikely pair and the racist south of the 1960s. You gotta do better than that, Hollywood. And the reviewers rating this anything better than a 6 need to go watch some good films. You can start with Driving Miss Daisy."
GREEN BOOK,12 April 2019,9/10,"It isn't slow. It isn't boring.It is funny. It is well scripted. It has good character development. It has all the good story stuff.Don't expect no Kaboom or Kapow. Expect only LOVE and growth!Watch it so that you can go around saying ""I watched a darn good movie""Cheerio"
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,10/10,"Just returned from seeing this movie. Having not heard if these real life characters before, I didn't know what to expect. The lead actors are brilliantly played by viggo Mortensen and Merhershala Ali. There characters were so believable and were portrayed with such heart. If you're looking for a feel good movie go and see it."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,10/10,"There are movies which touch you, make you
feel.
Forrest Gump, Life is Beautiful, Good Will
Hunting, The Pursuit of Happyness, etc.Such is this movie 'Green Book'.
I'm big time fan of Mahershala Ali right since
House of Cards to True Detective and he never
fails to amaze.
But this movie. It had been in my watchlist for
months but when he got the Oscar for best
supporting actor and the movie itself got the
best movie title I thought why not take out
some time and it did lived up to the
expectations!
Whoever is reading this, I don't know what kind
of motion cinema you prefer but this is
something you must watch, it's not just a
movie, it's a lesson in itself."
GREEN BOOK,16 January 2020,8/10,"This movie is interesting in many ways. The one that appeals to me the most is the movie challenges many of our conventional perceptions - A white driver working for a black boss, a white man with limited exposure to cultured language and social skill against a black man with much more exposure, a black man with more exposure to Western music and culture than American black music and culture, etc.
Good plot! Good acting! Good cinematography! What more can one expect from a movie?"
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,Absolutely love everything about this amazing movie.
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,10/10,"I didn't know much about this movie, didn't know what it is about, all I knew, that Viggo Mortensen is not my favorite actor. :S
BUT He was really brilliant in this role (even if he's not Italian... :D ), the story was not ""overpushed"", or forced, but nicely showed two different world's meeting. Every kind of people can learn from each other, if opened enough ( even if the circumstances makes them), and nothing is just white or black (or ""half-black"", or ""half-white""...). Absolutely worth to watch this movie, and I really-really enjoyed the happy end, because it easily could end with something very very sad incidence... BUT DID NOT!"
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,10/10,"I really can't add to the superlatives given by others here. This is simply the best movie that I've seen this year. I've given it a ten star review but would really like to have reduced that by half a star because of the inclusion of one scene (YMCA), the subject of that wasn't hinted at before, and wasn't expounded on after. Was Don gay? Who cares and what purpose in the movie was served by the suggestion that he was?I will add the half star back by giving a shout out to David Tinsley who supplied the movie's cars. Period correct, with minor exceptions, and lending an air of authenticity to the film.One minor point that was not explained was what happened to the rest of the trio after their final gig? Did they stay in the south or did they make it home (wherever that was) by Christmas. They did play a minor roll in the story but still, I hate loose ends."
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,10/10,Fantastic movie. Great acting and story. Don't we just want to be entertained?
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2018,10/10,I loved this movie. I hesitated going because I didn't want to see a depressing movie about racial inequality. But I went and I absolutely LOVED it!. It is funny. The character development is superb. The storyline is great. The acting is great. Everything about this movie is exceptional.
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,8/10,A movie that mainstream Hollywood isn't talking about. A wonderful story. Phenomenaly acted. Definite feel good movie.
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"""Green Book"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. the storie is outstanding and the actors are the best. I really enjoyed watching this movie. Other oscar nominees are long boring movies but this one kept me watching, I want to see more."
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,10/10,"I predict a few oscars and nominations for this film, excellent in every aspect. Viggo Mortensen deserves an Oscar for his brilliant performance."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2020,10/10,What do we do with bones ? Great movie great acting . No reason to not see this movie .
GREEN BOOK,30 June 2019,7/10,"This film taken this story from real so you can guess what is going to happen in the ending but instead, wish I could see more stunning end than that.
Anyway I'm suggesting this film to everyone cause of this is shows us how was place the world when a couple of years ago and we should have take a lesson from that."
GREEN BOOK,2 December 2018,10/10,"GREEN BOOK (2018) ""A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South."" (Source: IMDB.com) I could not have said it better. I saw it yesterday and I loved it. I would not have recognized Viggo Mortensen if I didn't see his name advertised. Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali star. Great film inspired by a true story. I checked it out. It is."
GREEN BOOK,16 January 2019,9/10,"Can't help but give it a 9/10. So heartwarming, with such talented actors! A masterpiece of new times."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2021,8/10,"I finally watched it, 3 years after it came out.., so good, had a smile on my face all the time, great film, it definitely deserves the awards it got!"
GREEN BOOK,20 April 2019,9/10,"A very wonderful film, I saw him yesterday and I am ready to watch it for the second time, the duo mastered the acting and I was very impressed by ', I hope to see them in another film"
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,9/10,"You know that feeling when you see that a movie is based on a real story? The feeling that youre about to watch something great, that you will make a connection with the story and the carathers, this movie does it all. A movie will never replicate what the racism and opression was, but it can show us how difficult it was to make a simple relationship between different cultures. Im glad i watched this and i could learn and put into perspective a reallity that sometimes we take for granted."
GREEN BOOK,2 December 2018,7/10,"Protagonist are caricatures of themselves. Performances are overrated and way over the top. Entertaining movie, better on DVD or on demand"
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2019,9/10,"The script could have been a bit more smooth but the film has a really good heart. I feel some of the criticism it's received on its handling of racism has been a bit harsh and feel its heart is in the right place. This is a joyous, feel good film with a few flaws."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,10/10,It was a great movie. Actually one of my most favourite movies of all time. Now I see why Mahershala Ali won a lot of awards including the Oscar.
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,4/10,"Driving Ms Daisy role reversal. Even won best picture for some ungodly reason, in a year with Roma The Favourite and Blackkklansman. A revolutionary picture where a white man has to teach a black man how to be black. Vigo Mortenson is just a goomba, a ridiculous Italian stereotype. Mahershala elevates the bones of the script to something slightly better. Over all, Oscar bait of the highest order, the fact that any one of the old white academy voters were tricked into voting for this forgettable movie is beyond me."
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2018,9/10,"The previews did not draw me to this movie; I went unwillingly, but I was absolutely delight ed. The journey of a gifted concert pianist and a Bronx strong man delivers a snap shot in time of the South , just as Steinbeck did with his 60s book, Travels with Charlie. For both men, the trip is a journey of self-discovery. For the audience, it is a movie filled with the social past, but also filled with plenty of humor which will have you laughing right out loud. I loved it!"
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"I missed this in cinemas due to the narrow release window. Finally got to see it tonight. Made me smile ear to ear this one, and I had no idea I was laughing until I did.This whole cast was perfect, acting, perfect, writing, perfect, everything just perfect.
Will put on the shelf next to The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption.
It's just that good."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,9/10,"This film was constructed very well, and the plot moves along beautifully. The chemistry of Viggo and Mahershala shines through. Highly recommend this film, and would not be surprised to see it win a few Oscars in February."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,9/10,"Excellent relationship between the characters, a good script that knows how to work well the timeline and various situations that arise and are resolved as the story progresses. So we have an execelente road movie that has everything to be chosen as the best movie of the year at the Oscars. And of course Mahershala Ali deserves to win the Oscar for best supporting actor."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2019,10/10,"Viggo and Mahershala come together for one of the best movies of 2018 that I have had the privilege of watching, a touching story of acceptance, friendship, food, and music"
GREEN BOOK,14 April 2019,10/10,"Great movie, it's one of those stories that will change your life, acting is in another level, fantastic conversations. Just left me stunned."
GREEN BOOK,6 October 2019,10/10,"I know nothing is perfect but this movie comes close. The chemistry between Tony and the 'Doc' feels absolutely real, their humour is subtle yet extremely effective. After googling Mahershala Ali and finding out he was a rapper I couldn't help but find it funny, his portrayal of his character is brilliant. Loved it."
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2019,8/10,Green Book is an excellent film. It is about a working-class Italian-American bouncer who becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South. Viggo Mortensen and Marshershala Ali give fantastic performances. The script is well written. Peter Farrelly did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor and drama. Green Book is a must see.
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2019,8/10,"Overall, this is just a great film to watch. Even though the story is very obvious, the actors are great, the camera work is great and you are into the film from start to finish. I'm glad it was nominated for several oscars and I'm glad it won some. A nice film for a Sunday night."
GREEN BOOK,8 June 2019,10/10,Enjoyed every second of the movie. Had a few tears too.
GREEN BOOK,31 July 2019,6/10,"Here's the thing - this was a fairly enjoyable film to watch. That said, I think it's attempt at telling a progressive story about diversity and acceptance misses the mark. It feel to me more like a movie to help make non people of colour feel good about the ""progress we've made"" as a society. It's still a black man's story through the lens of a white man. It still has the black man giving in and coming back to the white man at the end. It certainly illustrates overcoming prejudice but, I don't feel like this portrayal goes much further than that."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2020,10/10,"First of all, any movie about the 1950s or 60s is the bomb, as far as I'm concerned. The story line was intriguing and the actors delivered. Loved it!"
GREEN BOOK,15 September 2020,8/10,"I have no justifiable reason as to why I've not watched this movie until today so don't make the same mistake. This was an absolutely delightful movie from begin to end with a bit of predictably but that's okay. Two incredible performances by the male leads, both deserving the accolades they received."
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2020,10/10,A very good drama that brings subjects like racism and prejudice in a respectful and interesting way.Watched 2 times and want to watch again.
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2020,8/10,"""Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one.""The year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact.Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.The contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!On the whole, the film ""Green Book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.(88/100)"
GREEN BOOK,9 April 2020,10/10,"One of the best pictures with great acting skills, scriptwriting and also lots of humor, it is mind-blowing, good and realistic. The movie has shown the real meaning of friendship. Hollywood should definitely focus on making more movies like this. True story movie showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does. This movie has it all. It is worth watching again and again."
GREEN BOOK,21 May 2020,8/10,"A great story is buoyed by fabulous acting, some terrific situational drama, and just the right amount of hilarious malapropisms. GB is comical and heartbreaking, occasionally in the same moment. It perpetuates certain stereotypes while turning others on their head, all the while showing a humanity that inherently lies underneath them all."
GREEN BOOK,8 April 2020,10/10,"Among the best films I've ever seen, both funny and emotional.. highly recomend to watch.
One of a kind."
GREEN BOOK,12 June 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed it. Not a great deal happens, but it's well filmed, well written, well acted and emotionally satisfying as the relationship develops between the two odd couple leads. And its sadly still poignant and relevant in our times."
GREEN BOOK,8 August 2020,10/10,"Black and white brown, we are all human beings so many have to act towards this movie!!"
GREEN BOOK,25 September 2020,9/10,"I saw this at the movies and loved it. I watched it again on Foxtel and loved it. Great cast, director and love that it's based on a true story which is what makes it more special."
GREEN BOOK,10 October 2020,10/10,Regardless of your skin colour this film just proves that people can be friends and support each other throughout the hard times and the good times.
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2020,9/10,So glad this one best picture!!!! really great cast. A great history lesson.
GREEN BOOK,13 November 2021,9/10,"That is the second time I have watched 'Green Book' and the second time I shed a tear over it. That is an incredible film of a marvellous story of a rare friendship during rough and unpleasant times in America that charms and makes the viewer immerse in it fully. 'Green Book' raises an important issue of American society - segregation - the sin they are destined to atone for even until now. That is a dark spot in US history, and there have been a number of films depicting it in their own manner. And so does 'Green Book'. Maybe not in a perfect way, but we have to bear in mind that this is a mainstream movie for the global audience, therefore made in a way to be comprehensible by virtually everyone. The film, inspired by the true story, narrates us about two men, Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga and Dr. Don Shirley, played by Viggo Mortensen Mahershala Ali respectively. Tony happens to be an unquestionable racist at the beginning of the film and considerably uncomfortable being a servant to anyone. Being temporarily out-of-work, he is hired as both a driver and bodyguard to accompany Shirley and his white bandmates on a tour to the American South, which was still segregated in 1962 - the year when the story is set. By following their trip, we observe all the insanity of then segregation policies.The American civil rights movement marked a pivotal change in US history with the aim to end racial discrimination and segregation. This movement is renowned for its nonviolent means of achieving its goals. It all manifested in the form of protests, civil disobedience, and boycotts. This nonviolence can also be traced in the 'Green Book'. During the film, we find out Dr. Don Shirley's real motivation for going on tour to the American South. By sacrificing his comfort and royalties for playing at Carnegie Hall, he chooses to play smaller concerts in a significantly segregated part of the US for less cash to fulfill his deep desire - to show people that it is individuality that matters and not the color of the skin. That is his contribution to the American civil rights movement. There have been, however, some violent attempts, namely riots in black ghettos across the US. Hundreds of rioters were killed and that was a sign that this method was not effective. Subsequently, it was decided that voting was the most efficient way to align the rights of different ethnicities. And it is still used to date as the most important democratic principle for equality.'Green Book' proves why movies and any kinds of art that deal with social problems are essential to us. It's a powerful way to communicate important ideas and problems we face as human beings in our complicated world with a troublesome history. I enjoyed every moment of this film. It's a captivating and thought-provoking piece of art that will not leave anyone indifferent."
GREEN BOOK,10 April 2021,10/10,My favourite movie and has been since I watched it in 2018. It has a great blend of showcasing the harrowing racism and the journey through and with it that occurred and sadly stills occurs but still has many comedic moments. This is done perfectly by a great cast.
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,10/10,"Both Viggo Mortensen and Ali's performances were Oscar-worthy. The character arcs are superb with the initially down-to-earth, uneducated Italian descent escort of effete, world famous pianist Don Shirley not only forming a fast friendship, but taking that friendship to another level in the motel scene, as evidenced by Viggo's final statement to his wife upon his return home.The music, comedy and drama are all excellent. Not to be missed, especially by the Academy Awards."
GREEN BOOK,31 October 2019,6/10,"Boring and unmeaningful movie for the masses. Multiple scenes are very obvious and the whole movie is built on stereotypes. The story (or how it is depicted here) is quite ordinary. There's maybe one scene that puts light on the real problem. No other insights or complexity, thus the movie is too long. You can watch the first 30 mins and you are able to tell the whole story.
Very bad and absolutely not comparable to 12 years as slave or other movies on the subject."
GREEN BOOK,15 September 2019,6/10,"This is a feel-good film which sadly happens to be (oh surprise) factually inaccurate, resting on shaky foundations, things made-up or bluntly 'lies'. In a well-to-proven formula, Hollywood took a character, thisted some facts, some added, some removed, and there's such an uplifting story that even the greatest cynics feel good. It's a gold standard fell-good film. Don't ya like a f...lickin' KFC? Never mind the content..."
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,9/10,"Congratulations !!!I simply loved it. Everything is given in its dose.Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali play extraordinary. You put yourself into the shoes of both of them. You love each although they are opposite characters. I think it is the success of the director, writers, film editors and of course the actors.Music is the bonus.At this stage the movie raised in my Oscars listing to the top."
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2020,9/10,Even though i know just a little bit of the racism in USA it is like a fist in my stomach seeing this movie. Then it's showing not very much of it. Maybe this movie should be included in all school education in USA?
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,10/10,"This is a great movie. Very poignant and for me, emotional, yet very funny. It is a story about how two people from very different backgrounds begin to connect as human beings. The vehicle used is an eight week auto trip from NYC to the Deep South in 1962. Don't miss it. Totally engaging and enjoyable."
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,10/10,"I want to thank everyone who worked on this wonderful film. It was my favorite
movie of 2018. The performances of Viggo and Mahershala were over the top! I have seen all Viggo Mortensen films and am a huge fan, I hope FINALLY he gets the acknowledgement he deserves and wins his first OSCAR!! He has had so many incredible performances in the past 10 years and has until now been ignored. Again I loved this movie, from the wonderful musical score to the heart felt script.
A gem of a movie!"
GREEN BOOK,14 October 2019,10/10,"A more amourous performance by Viggo Mortensen, A perfect yet amicable Mahershali Ali. Touching dialogues which make a nice drama though it is Biographical. Viggo Mortensen fits the role perfectly and is seriously an Oscar-worthy performance though he missed this time. Most wouldn't know that the Green Book existed, If Peter Farrelly didn't come up with this very idea by Writing, Directing and Producing. Most interesting scenes are in the middle of the picture. A must watch-film of 2018."
GREEN BOOK,6 May 2019,8/10,"It has details, and tells a good story, but it's only skin deep."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,7/10,"This is the true strory of two people who come from a totally different background but even show, they get to know it's other, like each other and in the end become longlife friends. The white guy, played brilliantly by the actor Viggo Mortensen, is a really macho, anti-negro, american italian catholic who earns his familly's living doing petit crime jobs for the italian mobsters. The black guy is a bisexual, highly educated pianist who performs workdwide and decides to take on the hard task of performing at the racist South States of USA. He needs a bodyguard for that job and during the journey they discover each others personality and sterotypes, they change the way that they were used to see the world and finally become inseperable. We' ve seen this kind of moovies many times before and the message is always the same. Don't judge other people by the colour of their skin or by their education or by whatever. Despite the banallity of the message, it seems that our world has not learnt its lesson yet and a repetition is necessary. Besides, the performances of both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, are excellent. So it's a 7/10 for me and maybe an oscar for best supporting actor for Ali whose transfiguration from film to film is unbelievable."
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,10/10,"The movie contains all elements to be called masterpiece: amazing actors, entertaining and deep scenario and good directing! I haven't been exited from a movie since very long time. It must be in everyone's watchlist."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,7/10,"This is a tale of a working-class Italian American driver - Tony (played by Viggo Mortensen), hired by a celebrated African-American pianist - Don,played Mahershala Ali. Tony is seen to be prejudiced and politically incorrect while Don seeks to refine his language and behavior, projecting his superiority. But both men have something to teach each other, as Tony tries to chip away Don's quixotic nature, which is a poor and potentially fatal fit for the Apartheid system of the South in the 1960s. Particularly memorable is a brief scene of Don, in his suit, staring out at the plantation filled with African American workers.Tony and Don get through many problems, some of them self-inflicted. They solve the problems in their own ways, although Don keeps emphasising his idealist spirit while Tony prefers to solve his problems in a quick and dirty way.
By Christmas, the pair return back to New York, after their experiences have changed them. Despite all his wealth, Don is often lonely while Tony is willing to welcome him like a brother, overcoming his past prejudices."
GREEN BOOK,27 July 2019,10/10,"I went to see this film with no real expectations and was absolutely taken aback by it. A true story of two people who became unlikely friends and dealt with, among other things racism, prejudice and homophobia.When it won the Oscar for Best Picture, I was jumping round my living room. A well deserved bunch of awards for Mahershala Ali, but the real star of this film is Viggo Mortensen. His portrayal of Tony The Lip is one of the greatest modern performances you will ever see. How he never won Best Actor at the Golden Globes, SAG, BAFTAS or Oscars is one of the biggest miscarriages in all awards history.I highly recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favour and spare 2 hours."
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,6/10,"I really can't believe this film won the Oscar for the best picture of the year.. it's almost disappointing.. yes sure it was a decent movie with good acting (Vigo was amazing, the other actor was just ok for me) but.. so many ""buts"", concerning the clichés, the thematology which was pretty much ""old"", the predictable plot and the main message about racism and accepting each other etc, which was presented in a rather shallow and simplified way.. it's a no from me"
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,8/10,"The chemistry between our two protagonists was a joy to behold, as both are very different men from first glance but they soon learn a lot about each other and discover they are much similar than they ever imagined. This is due in part to the excellent performances of the actors, the script, a compelling true-life story that is handled very well by the filmmaker.Overall a heart-warming film that hits the right note."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,"""The whole story is about love... it's about loving each other despite our differences and finding out the truth about who we are; we're the same people.""
These are the words of Director Peter Farrelly upon accepting the movie's well deserved Best Picture Academy Award. Despite all the controversy about the film at the moment I must say I have enjoyed it. Spike Lee and other not-so-enthusiasts set aside, Green Book is the perfect metaphor; a symbol of pacifism and interracial respect that we should all take into personal account.African-American piano virtuoso Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Italian-American Tony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) face a fair share of injustice and discrimination as they travel together through Southern USA, encountering all sorts of people types and scenarios that they must work together to resolve. Ali's character is a reserved, unspoken type with a pacifistic approach to the dilemmas the pair find themselves in, with Tony being quite the polar opposite. But at the end of the day, the two are safe from trouble and on their way to the next location. As the film moves on, we watch the pair get to know each other and respect each other for their own differences, a rather satisfying feeling if you ask me. A picture is painted of the way things were in the early 1960s and it could not be more accurate.I think that most of the controversy originated from the fact that Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga never got the revenge that some cinemagoers were expecting. Green Book is not a story of zeal but that of pacifism. And even if you don't personally agree with the story's message, the excellent job the movie did at presenting their perspective must be appreciated. For I do not believe a movie should be judged in regards to one's own personal prejudice or anecdotal experience.Mortensen and Ali both played out their characters perfectly, and accompanied by 2019's Best Original Screenplay, the film was already set for big results. I doubt I will forget this wonderful film anytime soon, I would rather remember it as the iconic masterpiece it is. And to the rest of us it can be a reminder that even in 2019, there still are decent and authentic movies being made."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,10/10,"Definitely worth the Oscar as movie of the year, amazing story, great humor, very very good actors the connection between the actors is magnificent, Viggo deserves a Oscar too for his acting, go see it now not tomorrow"
GREEN BOOK,8 December 2018,9/10,"The best movie I've seen in 2018. Interesting and moving, every little detail in the movie was just about right. Already watched two times in two weeks (and didn't get bored at all).The premieres are in December but I do think it should be shown to public before Christmas as it's indeed a very Christmassy movie!"
GREEN BOOK,1 June 2019,9/10,The movie gets really creative in putting you right in the shoes of the persona. The acting was close to flawless. I personally do not enjoy race related drama but this was a solid exception. Lovely
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,9/10,"So, I've seen plenty of people being disappointed with this movie, claiming it doesn't handle the ""racial issues"" in a serious way.Perhaps, that's part of the reason why I really enjoyed it. Not every movie about racial issues need to be like 12 Years A Slave or American History X. A more light-hearted story could be equally effective to deliver its message.However, what made me love this movie the most comes down to the fantastic performances by both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who share great chemistry in every scene they're in. Something about their interaction with each other strikes me so sincerely. They develop nicely throughout the story as they face so many hardships together and the ending left a small tear in my eye.I'm not sure if Green Book will win the ""Best Original Screenplay"" category at the Oscars as I feel the competition is very strong (especially with ""The Favourite"" being in there), but I really feel like it deserved its nomination and the dialogue between Vallelonga and Shirley really brought out the best from their characters in a humorous way. The audience at my cinema had plenty of big laughs throughout the movie.For the technical side of things, this movie isn't that special; cinematography, editing, costumes, sets are all fine but nothing outstanding. But it doesn't matter too much as the script and acting performances is really what should be enjoyed in this one.
If you get a chance to see it, make sure you do! It's really entertaining from start to end!"
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,10/10,I was having a not particularly good day. Saw this trailer a few days ago and on the off chance checked my local cinema to see if anything new was on. I was very pleased to see this was there. Excellent film. This really made me feel so much better and completely changed my mood and make me feel good about life again. Beautiful film.I am so tired of the garbage being spewed out and this was a breath of fresh air. I love movies like this.
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book successfully carries out the most sublime function of cinema, which is to put a reality under the screen, in order that such a premise changes or expands the observer's circumstances, placing it in a new perspective. Therefore, the long is a work that should be appreciated by all because of its subtlety and importance placed through art."
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2021,10/10,"Must have seen this 2 dozen times at least. It's our go-to movie. The movie sends a great message on how we as people are all the same in the end,.. and that there are still some good people out there."
GREEN BOOK,22 April 2020,10/10,"Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are an excellent duo. A beautiful, powerful and hugely funny film about racism, Dr Shirley's journey and his friendship that built overtime with Tony Lip.The second time I saw this film was with a friend and the audience applauded at the end and this was in the cinema!"
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,"I wish I'd seen this movie before the Oscar's.
It is by far the best I've seen in its category.
The story just finally, after loads of senseless movies, makes sense.
From the very best perspective and you can almost feel what the guys are doing to do.
Nice job on the finest details. I liked that they were polished and not left untouched.
Liked the jokes, the wallet thing and KFC too.For me it was gripping and I totally felt the situation in which Tony and Dr. Shirley were in.
Nice arc of the story.
One thing I quite disliked about the film was the end of it. It was strange and things happened too fast in my opinion.Good job on that. No matter what, certainly one of my favorites from now."
GREEN BOOK,24 April 2019,10/10,"Green Book (2018)My Rating - 10/10
(This rating system refers to how many stars I would give on IMDb)""So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am I?""Oh beautiful, BEAUTIFUL film.Inspired by true events, Green Book tells the story on the tour of a black pianist who hires a white man as his driver. With the help of mostly from the nicely done character building, amazingly superb screenplay and rock solid performances, Green Book manages to grab the audience on topics about friendship, road trip and the racism in America in the 60's.This totally deserved the Oscar on best screenplay. Just amazing. Every single dialogue was so interesting. That chemistry between Mortensen and Ali, and their performances were really beautiful and sometimes emotional to watch. Even managed to bring tears to my eyes. Such a fine piece of work.Yet, That Best Picture award should have gone to Roma!"
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,9/10,"The MOVIE of 2018, Definately! So much tallent and finesse in every aspect."
GREEN BOOK,26 November 2018,10/10,This is a fantastic movie. Parts will make you laugh out loud. Other part will make you tear up. Cast could have not been better. Great chemistry between all involved. You will not regret seeing it. Worth every penny.
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2019,10/10,"Very Realistic, accurate, True film. Really was a great movie. Won many oscars and was well deserved. Best movie Ive seen in awhile. Great acting and great characters and writing. A movie for everyone."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,3/10,"Cant believe this cliched, regressive movie that caricaturized Don Shirley got Best Picture"
GREEN BOOK,9 February 2019,9/10,"That Linda Cardellini as Delores was absolutely luminous and very real and touching in every scene she was in. Her welcoming hug of Shirley, after the stunned Italian family funny reaction, I found wonderful, perfect and believable. I agree with many other excellent reviews, the lead actors perfect, music great, story right on, although when I first heard the theme expected it might be trite. The only scene I felt a little artificial was the black bar scene near the end, but they kind of got away with it anyway. Yes, stereotypical reactions of southern life, but I suspect fairly well depicted when we see what still remains today. Totally enjoyable film. Excellent nuanced performances by both leads."
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2019,8/10,"This film takes place in the 1960's. It examines the controversy of Black discrimination in a very unique way. Vigo Mortensen plays ""Tonylip"". A tough and rough bouncer at the Copa in New York city. He takes a temporary job as a bodyguard / driver for an up and coming concert pianist as he embarks on a tour of the deep south. Needless to say these two individuals could not be more different having come from two contrasting worlds. Thrown together they learn to appreciate one another and the life lessons each brings to eachother. There re more than a few laughs and many moments to ponder and reflect. All in all I highly recommend this film as something of substance. Excellently written and cast, a very good watch . PS the very last line of the movie made me laugh at myself. Tony's wife thanks Dr. Shirley for helping Tony with the ""Lettuce "" ( cash income). It took a few seconds to dawn on me she was saying "" Letters"" with a bronx accent ."
GREEN BOOK,1 April 2019,10/10,"Great movie, well directed, and heartwarming. You will love this movie and it is an instant classic"
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,9/10,The movie was good and even with all the controversy about the Drs family being unhappy with the film. I still walked away captivated by the relationship that was developed between the two main characters.
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2019,9/10,"I watched Bohemian Rhapsody first and kept wondering what could this movie possibly have to get an oscar for the best film.
This movie will leave you with a sense of completeness unlike most movies.Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali did a great job and I honestly don't think anyone would have done thesee two roles better than them.The first half however seemed slow to me.Whilst,the second half kept me wondering what would come next.Also one or two changes in the script would've made this a masterpiece.However,do watch if you haven't already and the ending is sure to make you smile."
GREEN BOOK,10 August 2021,10/10,"This movie stole my heart!!! ("": watched it with the family we cried we laughed at the same time.Become on of my fav movies 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Masterpiece."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2018,10/10,"The two leads are both amazing across and make there characters fun and likable. also that give a sense of relatability,"
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,9/10,"Went to see this movie with my husband and two good friends, and we all thought it was great! The acting by Mortensen and Ali is outstanding, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The performances are authentic and the directing is well paced. The costumes, sets, score ... everything was really well done. Based on a true story, Green Book is moving, funny, thought provoking, and, in the end, a heart warming story of friendship and family-the one you're born with and the one you make along the road."
GREEN BOOK,26 December 2018,8/10,A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"Emotional drama, with stellar performances by both the protagonists. Best movie I have seen in 2019"
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,8/10,"The story is very good, the film is very smooth and entertaining, but Viggo Mortensen absolutely skyrockets the whole film with his performance. He sounds true, his acts true and original and after this movie, i am trule convinced that he is one of the most underrated actors in his generation."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,4/10,"I watch movies to simulate my mind to think and to be entertained. First of all, I don't want to hear about politics in movies so leave it out. This is full of it and in turn made it to be a shallow film. It's in the past get over it and maybe you could make a movie with watching. Secondly, this is not a new plot. In fact, stop kicking the horse. Acting was good, but please be creative and will your in stories if you're capable. If not, go bad groceries at the Piggly Wiggly. The plot was incredibly weak and boring. I do give props to the actors, however. In closing, you can polish a turd all you want, but it's still a turd."
GREEN BOOK,23 January 2019,9/10,"Golden book.. Amazing movie that shows how bad and how divine this world can be. Two, soo different People meet in between, and make the world a better place by loving, understanding and forgiving them selves and others.Important things never changed in our society, still in 2019 the same issues are troubling us, as in the movie that is decades ago. Thank God, some souls take care For the balance in this universe. But my description can not be understood until you enjoy the movie. I hope you like it..!"
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2019,10/10,Give this one an oscar. Totally outstanding. The very best of this year everybody have to give this masterpiece a good look
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,10/10,Have some snacks and get yourself ready for some hours of joy and of course happy memories for years ahead
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,1/10,"The whole point of this ""woke"" waste of time is to somehow put together a story where the white guy is an uneducated, racist thug, whereas the black guy is a cultivated, intelligent musician... Take those legos and make a space shuttle out of that.
It's bad, all around. Badly acted, badly scripted, full of cliches and veeery slow. Scenes are set up over and over again to make us understand how racist this one is, and how cultivated the other is. Oooook, thanks ! We get it !
Mortensen would probably give a better performanse as an amoeba than an Italian tough guy. And by the way, Italians are represented here as a Saturday Night Live version of the Sopranos... but really not funny. For a ""woke"" movie, they'll certainly offend the Italians.
Do not watch this movie."
GREEN BOOK,15 October 2019,10/10,"Great plot. Great actors
Thoroughly suggest, the story gives a great insight what happened in the 60's. The growing connection between the protagonists was heartwarming. And I will suggest this film to everyone. It was great."
GREEN BOOK,2 December 2018,10/10,"I enjoyed the movie a lot so fun
funny and interesting really nice
10 point because is original true history great actors its perfect to this season to christmas eve"
GREEN BOOK,12 February 2019,9/10,"The guy that played the Italian made me laugh so hard that is the only reason i am giving it a high score. As a film it was about a 6 or 7 but the driver was hilarious! He is a star. The movie itself touched on the horrible racism in the deep South in the 60s its very sad. But the film is nothing new...driving miss dasy, the help and so on did it better but this film was good easpecly becouse of the Danish actor i was sure he was a real Italian."
GREEN BOOK,31 January 2019,10/10,To be Honest.. Amazing Movie.. Giving a great sample as a human being .. Top Notch👑👑
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,10/10,"It's fast paced, intriguing and makes us question human mind and the idea of love. It hooks us to the screen, because we want to know more. Whether Joe has redeeming qualities? What kind of lover he is? What other things is he willing to do for her? How far will he go? These questions impel us forward."
GREEN BOOK,26 May 2020,7/10,"It is the best movie I had ever seen in my life in the ""biography"" genre. Actor's play is wonderful, as well as the transfer of color of those times in America."
GREEN BOOK,12 June 2019,9/10,This is a great story they have comedy and drama. They go through a lot in this movie but through it all they stick together
GREEN BOOK,11 March 2019,8/10,"This movie shows friendship is beyond racism, caste and religions . The bonding between Tony and doctor Shirley shows that how Africans have overcome racism in United States of America and respect they gained from Americans in past four decades. This movie dialogues are very much lucid and communication between Shirley and tony were so much of mixed emotions. A must watchable film."
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2019,8/10,Green book is an amazing movie not only about racism in the south and in the time of segregation but it so also a movie of how someone from a poor background makes an excellent relationship with someone very sophisticated. Tony lip played by Viggo Mortensen is a bouncer who worked at the copa un New York City. He is an Italian American who has some problems with people of color. As he is confronted with a job working for a black man he tries to do his best despite his views. It is an amazing movie about a irregular friendship confronting racism on their Roadtrip.
GREEN BOOK,27 March 2019,9/10,"Not Really too much to say other than completely worth a watch. The score is great, The Actors are great, its funny without ruining the tension or making the drama any less meaningful.I Give it only 9/10 instead of a perfect score because it did lack some lasting power, unfortunately I think this movie will be more or less forgotten in a years time.But a glowing recommendation!"
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2019,10/10,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish and I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to anyone. 10/10 for me

Fantastic and 10/10 from me as this is the first time I ever write a review. Enjoy with great attention to detail."

GREEN BOOK,7 November 2021,5/10,"Good movie, good acting and good writing. And a current topic in today's society and no matter how much the cancel culture wants to it can't be erased from history nor should it.

GREEN BOOK,7 December 2020,10/10,"This movie is one of those kinds that makes you a better human being. Watch it, nothing more needs to be said. A top 10 movie of all time from my part.

GREEN BOOK,15 June 2021,10/10,I've seen my fair share of biographies and this one is by far the best. The chemistry between Mortenson and Ali is unsurpassed. Highly recommended.
GREEN BOOK,1 October 2020,10/10,"When I watched this for the first time, it really changed my life. Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Lip and Mahershala Ali plays Don Shirley and they are such brilliant actors and they really gave the best performance I've ever seen.PG-13 For Frequent Moderate Language"
GREEN BOOK,4 July 2021,10/10,"My hesitation is unwarranted. This film is captured in a time where equality, justice, and race were so isolated from the everyday conversation; So, when it appears the outcome invokes a pleasure for living in the here and now. The film creates an atmosphere of curiosity and exploring the pass in a way that puts you right in the driver's seat."

The goal that he make this trip is to propagate the people in the country to welcome the Blackman in their society. In part of his duo tony lip he try to protect him in many time that the black man was attack from the people. By the first tony lip don't believe in don cherly so much but when he see this man sacrifice to the people around his trip. This film has inspired from the book. ""The Negro Motorist Green Book"" which is the story about the social life in the past. It has so many racism and inequality. I think this movie is the good massage to the world to care about this issue and it will be disappear in the future."

Excellent true story with a great message to share...."

GREEN BOOK,9 February 2019,7/10,"I enjoyed this movie, although it's a bit slow in parts. Cringeworthy in parts due to blatant discrimination, some excellent performances by the 2 main leads & equally good....almost better is Dolores, the wife. Could have packed a bit more punch, I think."

If you are willing to understand this and blend with others, we each other can cancel out all---if not most---of the bad to make this a good world. Separation is not the answer. Separation is the problem we need to answer with blending. This is the most important insight remained with me after watching this movie."
GREEN BOOK,5 November 2020,10/10,"I rank this movie up there with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. It is funny how the best movies are smilar in some ways. A true feelgood movie perfect for the whole family. Great acting, relevant story, warmth and companionship. See it, it is mandatory."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,1/10,"I knew this would win the awards. People these days seem to want to produce and watch movies that help us to focus on the division in this country. I'm not sure what showing movies like this hopes to accomplish. I feel that everything is trying to get us to hate each other. I think it would be like showing the native Americans movies about the thing we did to them, the atrocities we committed. I know we need to keep from making mistakes again in the future, maybe that's what this is about. I would love to challenge Hollywood to make some movies that try to accomplish a sense of unity in this nation. I would love to see that. Somehow stop trying to divide us by race, religion or sexuality. Maybe stop us from focusing on what we don't have in common, and focus on what we do have in common. Just my thoughts.
I thought the movie was slow, and not realistic in it's portrayal of the south. Not inaccurate, just didn't seem realistic. I don't feel the writers and directors have lived in the south for any amount of time."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,10/10,Touched on so many relative issues. Acting was superb. Best movie I've seen in quite some time.
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,10/10,The chemistry between the main characters are amazing and the character development was equally amazing. I couldn't stop smiling after the movie!
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,8/10,"I went to the theater thinking this was fiction. Wrong. It's a darn good film with superb acting by Viggo Mortenson (Tony Lip) and Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley). The interplay between the obnxious Italian bouncer (Tony Lip) and the stuffy black vitruoso brought chuckles, was thought provoking, and didn't just demonize the white guy. It showed both men's humanity and obvious flaws, and if it didn't make racism/segregation seem horrid, it didn't make it look nice. After playing to standing ovations, the good doctor still had to use the outhouse and drive to the colored cafe to eat.This movie has been lambasted by the PC crowd as too soft on racism (debatable) and too much from the Italian's viewpoint - true, but why is that a crime?. I suspect their real gripe is that Whitey made this film. Well, they can gripe, but most like the movie, and rightfully so."
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,10/10,"As soon as I finished this movie, I claimed to my family members that this movie will win Oscars in the Best Picture category.
Perfect performances by Viggo and Mahershala Ali.
This film has shown two main points that how whites are behaving with colored from South to North and 2nd the understanding of human physchology by the lead cast.
The music of this movie was also very good specially the final performance by Dr.Shirley.
Mahershala is giving the best in every other movie.This would be his one of the best . Viggo was so perfect that I did doubt that how he differently performed in LOTR.
A must watch movie for whole family member.
At the end , my message for viewers, spread love not hatred."
GREEN BOOK,8 January 2019,9/10,"Literally just finished watching this movie and could not be happier.It is an incredible story about how two men from different backgrounds subtly and not-so-subtly effect each other and the men they are.Mortensen is at his best again. He is a phenomenal actor whose body of work is based on strong dramatic performances. This was one of the few times we have had the opportunity to witness him in a truly ""character"" role. His ability to perform captivates and entrances, and you often forget that it is Viggo. While he has steep competition against Malek for the Oscar, I think that Mortensen has the best chance to take it this year among possible nominees, aside from Malek.Ali's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He is an absolutely fantastic actor with an ever-increasing background of fine films. While he is being billed as ""supporting"" for this film, without his presence in the role, this film would have not been what it is. I cannot picture anyone else speaking the lines in this movie. It was made for him, and this year's Oscar will be too.If you haven't already, prepare yourself for a fantastic journey, and watch this film as soon as you can. You won't be disappointed."
GREEN BOOK,16 January 2019,9/10,This movie was quality viewing. Acting from both stars 10/10. Well directed drama with loads of humour. Yes it has the usual racial cliches you expect from this type of movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously like the majority do. Go and enjoy you won't be let down. Should be an Oscar contender.
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2018,9/10,This a great twist on the classic buddy movie. Wife and I LOVED this film. Ali and Mortensen were fantastic. The music was a real treat as were the eccentric characters and masterful dialogue. We see a lot of movies and this is the best to come along in years. See for yourself!
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,9/10,Just watched this movie and it's fantastic. Marsherala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are both fantastic in this great film. It has a great feel good ending. Highly recommended.
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,8/10,This films carries you through a road trip with lots of humor and also you are learning how we can change our view about something. This story is quite good and performed by these great actors makes it even better. Brilliant movie.
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2018,10/10,Very enjoyable. Worth seeing. Don't miss it. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,10/10,"I live in Seoul, Korea, and because the current audience review rating for this film in the Daum Movie, Korea's version of IMDb, is 9.3, the highest among the 2018 movies, even higher than ROMA's and Shoplifters', I went to see it for myself tonight. I am super glad that I did. I was captivated from the start to finish. The movie's narrative revolves around how two people with completely disparate background, educational level, and color of skin come to understand each other and become lifelong friends, fabulously complemented with a plethora of humorous scenes and dialogues, great music of piano pieces and indelible hit songs of the 60s, and a timely and needed message in this troubled era that we should not build walls around our hearts to discriminate and hate other people who do not share same skin color, culture, or ethnicity. The movie could have become overly serious or didactic, but the director skillfully avoids the pitfalls and does not try to needlessly expand the emotional effects. I hope more people would gravitate to the magic of this movie, letting the message break the walls in their hearts."
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2020,6/10,"The first idea that came into my mind was the ironic comparison to ""The Intouchables"" starring François Cluzet and Omar Sy - with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali (""Moonlight"") just changing the roles being presented in the french comedy from 2011: In ""Green Book"" the coloured guy, Dr. Shirley, is the rich one, and the white one, Tony Lip, is his servant.But the comparison is not perfect, because the rich black gentleman, despite his wealth and relationships, is actually a victim in the early 1960 years. And this made me also think of George Floyd, whose name is currently linked to the terrible history of racial segregation in the United States, 60 years later.No, I don't consider it a really good movie. The dramaturgy of the film sometimes seems too predictable, and unfortunately the camera doesn't always deliver highlights either. But the plot, shaped by Mortensen (Oscar deserved for getting sooo fat!) and Mahershala consoles over many things.The climax of the story is reached when the black society, the music and the highly endowed artist finally come together in a jazz bar. But that's not really enough, because there is still a long way to go."
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2019,9/10,"A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people.
The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious.
While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.The story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.While the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded.
The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important."
GREEN BOOK,2 August 2021,9/10,"It was a feel good movie generally (well except the scenes where they show how racism was during the 60s). The fact that it is based on real people and events made it even better.Dialogues between Tony and The Doctor were always interesting and made me smile a lot. Especially on the first bit of the movie when Doctor speaks Russian and Tony thinks it is German, Doctor corrects him and says it was Russian. Then later on Tony is drinking with Doctor's colleagues, they raise a toast and Doctor's colleagues say 'Cheers!' in Russian,Tony assumes it is German again and says 'Danke schön.' (which means 'Thank you.' in German). Was by far my favorite scene.Also Viggo Mortensen's acting made me think of Robert De Niro. It is probably because of the Italian accent but still it was pretty good!"
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2019,8/10,"Going to keep this one short:
Green book is a lovely story of two men crossing state and personal borders and become friends. It's a story about racisme in a period of segregation, but it's told like a roadtrip movie. It has drama, it has laughs (mainly thanks to Vigo's character) and a pretty good story. Only critique that can be given is that the movie sometimes feels a bit to safe. But in the end a splendid movie."
GREEN BOOK,23 May 2020,10/10,"This could have been a mundane documentary about the life of Dr. Shirley.
Bravo to the writers who dug deeper than the facts to show us that we can become better people even when we already believe we are good people.
Tony truly thought he was a good man. Donald was full of himself, but hiding from relationships because he believed he didn't fit into any one circle.
During their eight weeks of almost constant togetherness, both men learn extraordinary things.
The most obvious being racial barriers, but more than that, they learned to view the world, and how it ticks, seeing it through each other's eyes.
Ending with a friendship that lasted the rest of their lives.
Any movie that raises awareness of love and friendship is always welcome on my television.
Each character played their parts flawlessly. Tony's wife, Donald's cello and bass players, Dr. Shirley's home assistant, Emit. They all played off of each other's brilliance to make the best movie of the year.
I was cheering from my couch for all of them for winning the Academy's Best Picture Oscar.
If you haven't seen it, please do! Your heart will melt, your eyes will be opened, you'll grow as a human. It is that moving, absolutely!"
GREEN BOOK,3 February 2019,10/10,"A must see! Brilliant acting with great, deep characters! Heart felt and warming throughout. Showed the Deep South in a cinematic way. An even more interesting film as it's based on true events."
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,10/10,Some of my favourite films have appeared on screen in the last 12 months. This is up there with them. Honestly this film has it all. Serious true story of past division and hostility among all ethnic groups overcome by love and loyalty. Great film for all the family. Leaves a warm glow in your heart.
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,7/10,"Green Book has to be one of the best well-written movies in the last ten years, from the characters to the screenplay to the powerful performances from the leads everything feels perfect."
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2019,9/10,We found the green book a nice watch. You really see the characters changing during the movie.
GREEN BOOK,4 April 2019,10/10,This is a refreshing piece of drama. It does not patronise the audience with twee narrow minded views on minority issues and ram it down your throat. The film simply allows you to follow the human journey of two characters who are set poles apart at the beginning and how they learn from one another. One of the best films I have seen in a very long time.
GREEN BOOK,12 May 2019,10/10,"Green Book is an exceptional, warm, thought-provoking masterpiece, spectacularly portrayed. A true feel-good gem amidst a sea of mediocrity."
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2020,10/10,I didn't want that 130 minutes to end. It was perfect. Great actors great feelings great scripts. It is just great.
GREEN BOOK,29 August 2019,8/10,"Very easy to watch,, Great acting ,, Great Story Line ,, top marks!!"
GREEN BOOK,16 August 2020,9/10,I'm so touched and inspired by this movie.Great movie.
GREEN BOOK,1 January 2020,8/10,"Othershipwrecks, I greatly appreciate your accurate and educated thesis on our culture and general lack of awareness. However, many writers, filmmakers and other artists have tried your logical and direct approach in laying bare the institutional and structural racism all of us European descendants both benefit from and purposefully or complacently further; an activity we suspend or deny when emotions are charged. I commend such efforts to clarify the brutality that Green Book only hints of.But we also need artistic half-measures, like Green Book, which are, indeed, a passive reminder of our racism, to provide a gentle prodding to place our racism top of mind for awhile without alienating us.Those more profoundly disturbing and accurate films haven't accomplished much more, though we both may wish they would. And they only draw a much more receptive audience. You see, most of us will avoid a direct assault on our lack of moral outrage and action. A combination of many influences must be used to alter the structural racism, if even possible.And, as we witness, will likely never succeed so long as the white minority controls most of the nations' wealth.I do not believe humans will ever trade our tribalism for homogenization; our need for visual familiarity is in our animal nature and only evolution may alter that characteristic. So, in the meantime, we must recognize our racism, promote awareness, protect each other, and strive to be better than we are.Green Book is well-written, superbly acted, and tries to provide something more than stereotypes, not well enough to get the last two stars. It is what it is."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,9/10,"Not only was the acting in Green Book phenomenal, especially when it came to the lead two actors, but the small roles of Tony's family and friends, police and those that were met along the journey really pulled together the overall effect of the film. If a film can transport me to another era in time, another situation in life, I absolutely love it. It was clear that the casting of this film was done to the best ability, and no actors or actresses were un-believable or out of place. The story arc of the characters could be considered stereotypical of similar films, however it nicely fits the story- of which I personally haven't read into the real names or happenings of. The narrative carried the actors and the actors carried the narrative, not too complicated to follow nor too shallow. Nonetheless, it was a fantastic piece of cinema comparable to cinema like Moonlight. A solid story filled with excellent performances from all actors."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2020,10/10,"I didn't expect this to be so moving, but DAMN drama with a sense of humor, who woulda thought?"
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,9/10,"We had to give viggo Mortensen another oscar!! His perofmance was very touching and real for me, i love his role in this movie"
GREEN BOOK,1 July 2019,9/10,"The movie is really good, I must admit I usually like this kind of stories which are mostly based on true events and focused on the dialogue ( although there is plenty going on), with the unlikely relationship/ friendship developing into a strong human bond.
Really enjoyable!"
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2019,10/10,"It's a journey. It's a lesson. If you want to read some book, wath the movie and brace yourself💖❤"
GREEN BOOK,16 August 2019,10/10,Amazing journey i really enjoyed every detail of this movie amazing story and really inspirational.
GREEN BOOK,1 December 2018,3/10,"Is it me, or is Viggo REALLY over-acting in this film? I found his portrayal of Tony to be a one-note caricature of a numb nutted Itailian slob. Not only that, but the whole movie was like a bad TV movie. And that description no longer holds up because it's Television (specifically cable television) where all the truly great storytelling takes place now. The writing in this film was trite at best, and overly dramatic at worst. This is the second movie starring Viggo I couldn't stand. The other film was, The History Of Violence. Not sure I will pay to see another one of his films."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"I went to watch the movie and I think it's Incredible. I loved it because it made me think about how a simple thought or a sentence can hurt someone. The story is heart warming, I almost cried, the acting is excellent, is funny without losing the dramatic part of the story and it lives a beautiful message from a great tranformation of the two main characters. Go watch it."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,9/10,"I loved the movie and enjoyed every minute of it. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both incredible to watch. Ali had a better performance comparing to his other Oscar win and seemed like he really earned it this time. Viggo's only misfortune was Rami Malek being his rival. Otherwise his acting was also Oscarworthy. I can't come up with any downside to say about the movie but I have for the Oscar win as the best picture of the year. It appears to me that an other cliche took place and a movie about race discrimination and homosexuality took the Oscar home. Maybe Green Book is the best of the best among the other movies emphasizing on similar messages, but this award will always be a shade on it as some may wonder whether it got the Oscar because it was really good or because it was an other black/gay movie. It is a pitty because this time I really watched a good one. Bohemian Rhapsody was better though (according to me of course), but who can win against these two golden tickets that never fail in the eyes of the academy, right?"
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,10/10,"Finally!!!
Finally a beautiful movie. Simply beautiful.
This film is a gift.
Now that most movies are just full of gratuitous violence, vulgarity, or simply awful, Green Book offers us an example of old style cinema. A simple but beautiful and captivating story, nicely filmed, with great dialogues, sublime acting, and great music.
Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are immense, and the chemistry between them is so perfect.
I swear that if this movie loses the Academy Award for best movie in favor of The Favourite (one of the worst movies ever made), I will lose my faith in cinema awards forever.
Magnificent film, don't miss it!"
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2019,10/10,"I watched the movie and it was a really good experience. I came to know how people were discriminated based on colour. Comedy was like really good. I would really like to watch it sometimes again. Really every single individual must stop discriminating people based on colour,as it is really a biggest sin you have ever commited and there is no forgiveness for that. Respect every human being as they are uniquely designed by the creator as he created you."
GREEN BOOK,23 June 2019,9/10,"A really enjoyable two hours worth of great character development, great story telling, and great writing. Ali continues his ascension to the top of the acting world, while Mortensen is every bit his equal. Great chemistry between the two leads."
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2019,9/10,"In fact, I am not a very great connoisseur of such films, but when you watch such pictures, you almost immediately realize that this is an Oscar nominee. I think that in this film everything is very beautifully shot and thought out. So I completely agree with the film critics. This film is worth Oscar!"
GREEN BOOK,31 March 2019,10/10,"I will not explain what is going on in the film, you can see that here on IMDB. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT! It was so refreshing to watch this film and it came to the top of my Top20 list. Script is great, acting is even better. Just beautiful!"
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2020,,"This movie gave me a feeling that I've been there before, from my social consciousness and having a familiarity with these characters. I think they were trying to hold back and still give an idea what it was like. It's not the finest but it's fine. An interesting account of an artist undergoing racial complications to put the reality in its simplicity."
GREEN BOOK,3 October 2020,10/10,"Masterpiece.
Fantastic story, makes you think how cruel people can become without even knowing the other person.
Pure joy. Loved the ending."
GREEN BOOK,8 September 2019,10/10,"Everything was just best be it acting,story, screenplay, music, Direction or anything you can ask for."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,10/10,Honestly one of the best movies I have watched this year...definitely highly recommend this movie!
GREEN BOOK,29 September 2019,8/10,"Both protagonists learn a lot from each other, and grow together. There is much more to the plot,but I won't spoil it - just really worth watching. Heartwarming and inspiring"
GREEN BOOK,14 December 2018,9/10,"What a fantastic movie! Warm, heartfelt, moving and funny - Mortensen is almost unrecognisable and he absolutely nails the character... flaws and all, and Ali (who I only recall seeing in Luke Cage previously) gives us a stand out performance and I'm hoping to see him more in the future! The film balances a difficult subject with such warmth, sincerity and depth of characters, it made me believe the relationships and feel for the characters, it made me laugh (surprisingly frequently!) but also cry... go see it!"
GREEN BOOK,15 September 2019,10/10,"I watched it last night after coming across it on the ""new movie"" list and without knowing anything about it or expecting much... and it turned out to be the best film I have seen in over a decade.Everything about this film is perfect. It has an important message about prejudice, racism, the need for tolerance and kindness in humanity and the crimes of the human race against its own kind, but this is delivered in a way which achieves less of an acrimonious, sickening and shameful history lesson but through a heart-wrenching beautiful relationship we can all relate to through relationships of our own, and therefore it stays with you and makes you assess much better your own shortfalls, powerfully enough to inspire change in its audience.
The developing relationship between the two lead roles is nothing short of magical on screen and both play their parts with complete authenticity in into a way that you come to love their respective characters.
There are simple scenes of acts of friendship and kindness between them so beautiful they tug at your emotions and can make you laugh or cry.
The film perfectly blends it's serious message with consistantly brilliant humour and Vigo Mortensen playing ""Tony Lip"" is hilarious throughout.
The sentiment of the humour in the relationship between them over everyday things we can all relate to is just heart warming.
The film ends in such a beautiful (and maybe ""Hollywood Happy"" ...but we all need a happy ending now and then, and in this case it is both based on a true story, which is divine, and drives the underlying message of broadening narrow minds with love and understanding to those around us, home much better) way, this could make Christmas-time cinematic history to be replayed every year.
I always say ""they never make films the way they used to anymore, the ones that can last forever that you repeat again and again""...but this film has really achieved that.
A real future classic."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,"The best film to watch in Christmas and when its end you feels really good
Thanks guys for made this beautiful emotional movie 👍"
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,9/10,"Simply Superb. Mahershala Ali is amazing, Viggo Mortensen's best role to date.... It's almost impossible to distinguish as to who is the Leading Actor and who is the Supporting one. I guess screen-time decided that one. But one could not posssibly exist without the other one."
GREEN BOOK,11 May 2019,7/10,"The main idea of this movie is being human.Color,nationality and differences does not matters. This movie was about a funny Italian family man and an alone and sad pianist's journey story.Green Book's has so many funny parts but also good and strong messages.""Every Human Are Special"""
GREEN BOOK,21 September 2018,10/10,I saw this at TIFF and loved it from beginning to end. It's a moving true story about two people who forge an unlikely friendship. Thought-provoking but never preachy.
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,10/10,"I really enjoyed this. I've seen so many films recently which are so poorly written with a bad script, over ambitious and pretentious. This is none of those.The sign of a good film? That feeling that you want to watch it all again. I felt it as soon as I left the cinema"
GREEN BOOK,14 January 2019,9/10,"Green Book has to be one of my favorite films of the year. Beautifully written and executed. The characters are likable, complex people and getting to know them is a joy. The movie covers the topic of generalization and stereotyping, one of its highlighting moments is a monologue Mahershala Ali gives, ""If I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough... what am I?"""
GREEN BOOK,21 April 2019,10/10,"Simply brilliant........ Shawshank, green mile, Jaws, ET, or any other great film!!!! Up there with the best of them. Already one of my favourites!! 😁 👏"
GREEN BOOK,3 May 2019,9/10,"Utterly charming! Both characters are portrayed beautifully with the chemistry between them in abundance. This adaptation of a true story about friendship doesn't try to rush or sensationalise the gradual turning of a heart. A lovely, simple movie boasting a sleek screenplay and featuring terrific performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Fantastic!"
GREEN BOOK,2 January 2019,10/10,"This movie was perfect in the way it was supposed to be.The humor is spot on, the chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali is excellent and their performances are truly Oscar-worthy.The drama is in no way melodramatic, it was emotional and moving"
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,10/10,Wwowowoowowowowowowowowowo 10/10 geiler film einer der besten den ich je gesehen habe
GREEN BOOK,14 September 2019,9/10,"I first watched this during a Cineworld secret screening. I originally rated it an 8. I've since changed it to a 9. Why? It's got everything you want in a movie; emotion, humour, a decent story line.When you watch this film it is heartbreakingly accurate. You laugh when you need to laugh and feel sadness and shock when needed. I absolutely love this film.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are outstanding. They play the characters so well. I literally fell in love with their friendship and connection.Its truly one of the best films I have watched and I could easily recommend it without embarrassment or guilt because I could watch it over and if you again.Love love love. It deserved all its awards."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,9/10,"Film about dignity, courage and true friendship.After more than 20 years since Peter Farrelly directorial debut with movie Dumb and Dumber, he has directed a truly masterpiece. Working throughout his career mainly with the comedy genre, Green Book has absorbed all the Farelly accumulated experience about how to make the audience laugh, but now with the help of a completely evolved type of humor - an intellectual one.In the tragicomedy as a cinema genre, a balance between the quantity and quality of humor and the dramatic part is very important and the authors of the film coped with this task with a bang.Extraordinary combination of Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, A Perfect Murder, The Road) and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, True Detective) acting duet and good story makes this film really fun to watch. The feelings and emotions of the main characters are sincere and real. Dialogues and their accompanying with body language are well thought out and felt harmonious.Colors of the film are warm and bright. Cinematography is solid but nothing special. Camera movements are calm, different angles and plans changes with the normal frequency.Green Book is highly recommended to watch and a must to watch if you like jazz, America 60s and willing to empathize with the main characters on their thorny path in the era of human-to-human violence and selfishness."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,8/10,"Despite some misgivings about what is left out (the white-washing) there is enough left in to at least get people talking about what so few will talk about. Hated, hated the fried chicken scene, didn't ring true. Otherwise, you can't help but enjoy the magnificent performances of these two leads."
GREEN BOOK,26 January 2019,10/10,"Green Book is exactly the movie we need right now. It is honest, funny, beautiful, hopeful. The 60's were recreated in every aspect of this film. I loved the dignity of Dr. Shirley and the courage of Tony Lip."
GREEN BOOK,18 February 2019,9/10,"Even if it's similar to other movies, Green Book manages to teach very valuable lessons that you thought you already knew, showing a different point of view, while being incredibly entertaining. I've laughed out loud during many parts of the film, thanks to the charming performaces of the two leading actors (Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali)."
GREEN BOOK,2 November 2019,10/10,"What a film. Inspiring, captivating and all hearts. Well written, directed and brilliantly acted.
10/10"
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2019,10/10,"I dont review films much but i watch a lot of films, this films brilliant and you will love it from start to finish."
GREEN BOOK,19 November 2018,10/10,"Funny, heartbreaking, hopeful and heartwarming. This movie has Oscar all over it, from Viggo Mortensen to Mahershali Ali to Peter Farrelly, who directed it. It's the best movie I've seen in years!! Viggo gets to play a totally different role and he's funny!"
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,9/10,"Heart warming drama. Great music that we Boomers could relate to. Tony had a foul mouth, but somehow it wasn't as hard to listen to as usual, because it fit his upbringing and culture. A good look at life for a coloured person in the 60's and just a great Friend story."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,10/10,"This movie has a little bit of everything, comedy, drama and music. I enjoyed every single part of it."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies ever, it just amazing. The story and the talking and the reality of the film was great."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2019,7/10,A beautifully constructed movie. What a performance by Viggo. I don't normally watch this type of stuff but I was moved throughout. Recommend a look.
GREEN BOOK,24 April 2019,10/10,"Really nice heartfelt story. I didn't know much about it going in, there is a genuine connection between the two men wonderfully played by Viggo and Mahershala. Peter Farrelly surprises by delivering a genuinely gripping drama from the usual comedies he makes. Highly recommend this film."
GREEN BOOK,29 May 2019,9/10,"It's been years since I have seen a Hollywood movie this good. This is how films used to be in the 80s and 90s. Simple story, great characters and ultimately heart-warmingly entertaining. What else do you want?!"
GREEN BOOK,27 June 2019,10/10,Beautiful relationship. There is history. It has everything...
GREEN BOOK,12 December 2019,9/10,"Until last weekend, as my roommate asked help for her shutdown iPhone, I had firmly believed that Netflix is used for TV episodes other than movies. Not anymore. When I was trying to save the phone through the long process of system upgrade, she warmheartedly recommended a title from movie selection. It took me almost a minute, awkward enough, to process that she was talking about a film. Nonetheless, after my finishing the tournament of repair service, I felt obliged to call it out, ""it is the end of an era, isn't it""?According to recent researches, people start to open Netflix and its counterparts on a smart TV for a decent movie. By referencing to decency, I am talking about a movie of some real-deal production, during which you'd better dress yourself up and pour a glass of wine all the way down. The boundary, as my theater teacher friend Dolores correctly points out, is determined by the manners of watching. For me, episodes are what you can go through with other stuff on hand, nonetheless movies are those you have a protocol to follow, such as the solemnities of remaining presence and concerns for context loss by taking a leak. The streaming giant is no longer associated with cheap thrill on a lazy couch, sometimes accompanied with the cheese and crackers. Sorry for your bladder, but you may have to respect some rituals to follow a movie through.The popularity of movie on streaming service, as a result, blurs the given boundary. In the good old days, the disparity can't be more significant, just as lobster and crayfish, champagne and beer, phone number on a handkerchief and sex robot deep in the cupboard. Despite some still uphold the irreplaceability of physical intercourse, the rest of demarches is increasingly meaningless, after all, we are living in a world where all are buried equal. For instance, it is increasingly risky for an elected politician to talk posh on TV, since it may detach the base of politician through the distance being created.Bearing that in mind, it won't be surprising that some audience, especially international ones, spare the first round of Green Book to Netflix. I am proud enough to claim that I belong to the fraction. Yes, I haven't watched Green Book in cinema, and yes again, I feel terrible when my people remind me of their commentaries. For a long time, despite the saved-up bow tie and tuxedo, I tend to visit cinema to pay my tribute for a movie of Oscar. Likewise, under the magic of Academy, I feel mandated to bear a particular state of mind and offer a specific form of comment. Due to the recommendation from Dolores, I feel obliged, as solemnly as Trump's presidential oath, to follow the thread and catch up with the speed.I have to confess that the experience of streaming an Oscar-winning movie at home is roughly incredible. In the age of Netflix movie-watching, all you need is a subscribed New York Times newsletter, in addition to a Netflix account for around 8 euros which is charged monthly, to trigger the curiosity. I still keep notes and highlight plots, but all being done on my tablet. The only item that associate myself with a 19-century nostalgia is a typewriter-style keyboard, which actually connects my tablets through Bluetooth. Nowadays, it costs far less than ever to pretend like a good liberal, letting alone well-informed voter.Against the background, the movie's notorious reputation is somewhat made reasonable. No doubts, it is a wonderful story of reconciliation and redemption, and moreover, epitomes the American way to humanity. The tension is primarily constructed between an unlikely pair from New York, an African American renowned artist and his Italian American valiant muscle. In time of December 1962, an epilogue for an age of turbulence and remake, they started a courageous music tour into deep south.For a moment, I am almost motivated to tears. The theme of civil rights movements repeats by my ears. Hand in hand, both characters fight their fight against various discriminative manifestations, varying from explicit exercise of segregation to implicit stereotypes arising from prejudice. Finally, the pair, seated by the Christmas dinner table, were savoring the gratification of family reunion. The whole story almost resonates the theme of American patriotism: God, family, and the beacon of freedom. By the way, it is not a joke.However, the story, all magic twists regardless, is merely too good, or too American, to be true. Despite people seldom reckon it in moment of joy, they have to come to terms with the imperfection of real life. In this regard, the redemption theme is far too mythical that most reasonable minds may feel reluctant to embrace. After all, in the early 60' America, the odds that Don Shirley mainstreams himself in the white-dominated culture is almost the same as the chances that Tony Lip survives the bullets and punches in nightclub scenes. The storyline typically fits the desire for simplification, and sometimes trespasses the safety valve, making it into oversimplification. In some scenes, it is almost similar to gauging the catering cost of ordinary families through the menu of a Michelin restaurant.I won't find it difficult to apprehend Spike Lee's anger after Oscar ceremony though. In Lee's take, Oscar merely acknowledges an exceptional figure who is capable to assimilate with mainstream. Meanwhile, the figure remains ambiguous on his stance towards the heterodoxy. In spite of these, the mainstream still tries to embark it with the tag of reconciliation, which is truly annoying. The logic behind the reconciliation reiterates a self-fulfilling prophecy; do you know why you fail? Simply because you suck. Look at Dr. Shirley, he is the one that makes it.Just as those people in need of a charismatic leader, the storyline of Green Book is built upon the moment of singularity. The character of Dr. Shirley represents an endeavor to create that singularity, after which the history of whole universe makes sense. However, for people in the age of streaming service, it is more plausible that the big bang, instead of a fictional starting point, creates all that follows. The same as most of geological event, it is ashes, rocks, and ruins that purports all the spectacular.By saying that, till today, only a few of minority can make a career that is comparable with Dr. Shirley. For the making of minority, two options are set ahead: following the successors of Malcom X who struggle to shake the establishment bottom-up, or joining the alike of Dr. King that manages to alter the system from top-down. By the way, both of them end their life in a way they have never expected. The in-your-face struggle, after all, defines how the Green Book unfolds.Or, with all that in mind, we probably demand the moment of singularity. The truth, after all, can be unaffordable, intolerable, and insufferable, and we, as human beings, just don't want to deal with it.If so, why don't we stream Green Book on Netflix, and make a joke about it?"
GREEN BOOK,19 October 2019,8/10,"Beautiful cinematography, interesting story. Great casting, I was believing this story in an authentic looking time it's based in. Really good casting. Didn't feel ever that anyone was out of place. Good performances from Ali and Mortensen. One of those flicks you can watch again and again. I want some Kentucky Fried Chicken from Kentucky!"
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2019,9/10,It was a good movie with a repetitive story but great pay ... We spent many years in slavery but learned freedom
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2019,9/10,"It was a good movie, a repetitive story but a great payoff ... We spent many years in slavery but learned the freedom to realize that we needed to think in order to live and the need for a common language to communicate had begun since the creation of the line and Then we were able to come up with a language called art all the time. Music is the best language for communication where one's personal desires are hard to come by but one can easily make up for it. Stories are a good link between All humanity and music are the best for..."
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2019,10/10,"Well played, easy going, warm, humane, touching. A slice too much Hollywood underlining sentimental, if should say critics. Good dramas are hard to find, if you like the genre this is your movie."
GREEN BOOK,9 October 2019,10/10,"The deep story, the chemistry of those character, and also Ali's performance. Great movie. I remembered when I saw this movie ""alone"" di studio in Indonesia, I appreciated so much with standing applause. Super movie ! 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
GREEN BOOK,3 November 2019,7/10,"As for me, the green book is too overestimated. The film is not bad, as for 1 viewing, but it is rather weak for the winner of the Oscar. I liked the film, but it is too overrated"
GREEN BOOK,6 December 2019,7/10,"Although the performances and the cinematography was great, I found the story a bit white-washed."
GREEN BOOK,19 December 2019,10/10,"Was watching TV, randomly turned to one of the Showtime channels and saw a 2018 movie was about to start. I figured to give it a shot. I didn't read the synopsis prior to watching.At the very beginning didn't know what to expect. Needless to say, my entire family loved the movie, every bit of it.
I can see this movie becoming one of the movies everyone must add to the bucket list!"
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2020,10/10,"I just loved it. The story, performances of the actiors, everything."
GREEN BOOK,29 March 2020,4/10,This movie whas a big let down for me. Don't trust all the 10 stars reviews. They are full of it. It's basically just two men in a car taking a trip. Nothing happens. I was expecting some twist are anything because of the good ratings. But really it's just straightforward from start to finish
GREEN BOOK,15 January 2020,10/10,"Green Book cinematography was beyond amazing. The visuals popped, and attracted me all the way till the end of the film. The film story line was great, and easy to follow. I really did enjoy the film."
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2020,8/10,"A subtle movie that makes its points with action, showing us just a glimpse of what it was like in the southern states in the 1960s. The Green Book was a real book that Negroes had to use to find out which hotels would accept them and which wouldn't. The black person, in southern states, had few rights until the landmark civil rights bills of 1964-65. This film shows us some of milder white reaction to black people. Murders, lynchings are violence of all kinds was par for the course in these states. The movie does a great job telling a true story -- one that involved a high-ranking official in the Kennedy administration to bring justice for Dr. Shirley. The soundtrack is the worst aspect of the film. Only one song, ""Slow Twistin'"" by Chubby Checker is reminiscent of 1962. If the filmmakers really wanted to set the mood for 1962 they would not have used songs from the 40s and 50s and pretended that was what Americans were listening to in 1962."
GREEN BOOK,12 May 2020,10/10,I gonna fan of your Tony Lip. What a amazing life you are lead made me so crazy. What a latter write you are love it. What a intelligence perform at every situation. And Dr. Sharli lead a expesive but unhappy mood. You have take a good lesson from him. You got pain from white people made me so upset. At last you have take the right step. You have got a new path to your life enjoy with peaple. You should contact with your brother. Love family like Tony.
GREEN BOOK,6 December 2020,10/10,"Beautiful masterpiece,I enjoyed watching this movie.It's real simple with this one,everything about this movie is perfect."
GREEN BOOK,19 June 2020,10/10,"First thing I like Inthis movie is very simple & attention taking bgm.
Second thing is the cinematography,Even though almost 60%of movie there is only Sherly&Tony lip frames are in such a amazing way it never be get bored.
In this story they try to feed who is good or who is bad which makes to think & be in world of them.
Expression of their friendship is great, because of this I love the emotions in the biopic movies.
About acters especially those main two lead roles I never noticed any acting there"
GREEN BOOK,12 August 2020,7/10,"If I'm not black enough, if I'm not white enough, if I'm not man enough, then tell me, Tony, who the hell am I?Congratulations.You are the most politically correct person."
GREEN BOOK,19 October 2019,8/10,Great performances and a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience. Recommend.
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2021,10/10,"Rarely does a film get everything right, a movie for everyone. Tackling difficult issues which seem more relevant today than ever. I love watching this unlikely pair form a real bond that transcends their cultural difference.
Be reminded there is still hope yet ."
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2021,10/10,"Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are a match made in heaven. In its political correctness, it finds moments of truth. I cried and laughed at several times. Highly recommend this masterpiece."
GREEN BOOK,28 April 2021,10/10,Perfect message for imperfect times. I hope people who don't understand what African Americans went through and continue to go through in this country can learn something informative and inspiring from this film. I know I did.
GREEN BOOK,13 July 2021,10/10,"It was the cutest, warmest and inner movie that I have watched recently. I felt firsthand the persecution of black people. Otherwise it was also quite laughed and amused."
GREEN BOOK,15 July 2021,9/10,"Great script, great acting, great movie! I hardly buy movies because there's so many that are included... but this one piqued my interest.. and was definitely worth it.... with so much junk out there- this is a gem."

GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,9/10,"This Movie was entertaining! but reminders of times of past(Jim Crow/ Green book) I totally enjoyed but I hope never to experience this in my lifetime... a reminder not to be forgotten..Mahershalalhashbaz Ali... one of the best performances I've ever seen ,brilliant and seamless ..a role of a lifetime ..perfection!"
GREEN BOOK,9 February 2019,10/10,Long time didn't watch a slow pace movie with no boredom. Well play and good chemistry.
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"My first awesome movie in 2019
everything is excellent"
GREEN BOOK,11 October 2019,7/10,I do not understand what happened in the opening scene. Who is the big shot who wants his hat guarded? Why did Tony Lip take the hat? Why did the fight start? Are these all Mafia characters? Tony throws two cups in the trash because two Black men had drank from the cups. That part I understood.
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,"The first movie I can say is ""powerful"". Must watch."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,10/10,"A wonderful funny,inspiring and brilliantly acted movie. Many highlights and points being made. Just go and see it!!!"
GREEN BOOK,3 January 2019,8/10,"Green Book is a road story, telling the relationship between a racist Italian-American bodyguard and his boss who is a famous black piano player.
Viggo Mortensen who is playing Tony Lip, the Italian bodyguard, shines as a leading actor. Tony Lip is an uneducated but a practical person. He can even eat 26 hot dogs for money or steal the gangster's precious hat and sell back to the gangster again. We see his racism in the scene he puts the glasses which black workers drank lemonade, to the garbage. He became unemployed when Copa, the nightclub he works, closed for renovation.
At that time the famous piano player Dr. Shirley (played by Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) was looking for a driver for his tour to the southern cities of USA. He needed not only a driver, but a practical man getting things done in the tour program. He was well educated, can speak at least 3 languages, but his social skills is not well developed. He hires Tony Lip and the the tour begins.
We know the director Peter Farrelly and his brother from absurd comedies like The Dumb and The Dumber or There's Something About Mary. Even though there are many scenes that we have laughed in Green Book, we cannot say that is a comedy. Peter Farrelly made a good job with blending comedy, dram, road movie and even romance.
As a summary Green Book is a very good film with solid performances. You will enjoy every minute of this 130 minutes film. One more note, the film was based on a true story. After watching the film, find some Don Shirley music from Spotify or whatever, and listen him and his trio with a glass of whiskey."
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2019,10/10,"Not a wasted word, not a wasted scene. A modern classic. Spontaneous applause at the end. Dark humour throughout that is generated from the wonderful relationship that builds between the two main characters. Wonderful."
GREEN BOOK,25 November 2018,10/10,"Far and away one of the best performances by Viggio ever. Ali played a more nuanced role but does Viggio shine in this one! I realized it was Viggio but he transformed spectacularly to be the character with his weight gain for the role, perfect accent and mannerisms of the man with his gruff but heart of gold (and then some) man. A minor surprise about the nature of Ali's Dr. Shirley was done well and was not the focus; it was the racism and loneliness of his existence and due to those factors that you slowly begin to feel deeply for this self-made, reinvented man who creates his own existence out of the world he lives in.It was much better than expected and a true story, with embellishments of course, told in a non-judgmental way as to let the viewer come to their own conclusions. One of the best movies of 2018 so far and would not be surprised to see multiple awards for this."
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,"This was an amazing, funny true story. Loved it from start yeti finish. Great acting."
GREEN BOOK,23 March 2019,4/10,"After reading brief biography of main character I was expecting a jazz filled fest adresing contemporary problems. What I got is boring road movie, completely predictable with all cheese Hollywood schemes and even more predictable ending. If it wouldn't be for Viggo's performance and fantastic job of scenographers I would give a single star to this otherwise lengthy and boring mediocre spectacle."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,10/10,I love every minutes of this movie👍the charcters are awesome eapecialy the driver and and i love the conversation of they two👍
GREEN BOOK,19 November 2018,10/10,Wanted to watch this movie when i saw the trailer. This movie is so touching and emotional. Good bonding was shown bw driver n boss. Amazing connection.
GREEN BOOK,27 December 2018,9/10,"Perfect cast

Fantastic performance from everyone

Funny and sad at the same time.Conclusion: We need more movie like this in our lifetime."
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,4/10,"Is no one giving to mention the shameless product placement? Not satisfied by simply showing the KFC bucket, lines were written extolling the virtues of this 'artery clogging' foodstuff.How did this confection warrant the Golden Globe award when it appeared to be devised to sell fried chicken? Enough is enough!"
GREEN BOOK,24 January 2019,10/10,Amazing storyline and incredibly well developed characters.
GREEN BOOK,16 December 2019,10/10,Heart wrenching and sweet and eye-opening biographical story about the way it was.
GREEN BOOK,15 October 2019,9/10,"After seeing the trailer several times at the cinema, I was not bothered if I saw this or not.
However, one weekend, as it was included in my Amazon membership, I sat down and watched it - and what a surprising little gem!!
Great acting by the 2 leading gents.
Really good film."
GREEN BOOK,13 August 2019,8/10,A very decent film but not the best film I guess. And tbe Oscar should have gone to Viggo Mortensen for his outstanding and natural performance. Well done guys.
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2021,7/10,"This is a movie about reform.A white man's journey from throwing away water glasses because two black men drank in them. To the same man inviting a black man to his Christmas dinner.This is also the story of a black man who would travel an hour and a half to use facilities and travel back to perform. To the same man refusing to perform because he would not be allowed to dine with dignity.Veracity aside, rarely do you find such a subtle combination."
GREEN BOOK,26 December 2018,8/10,"Really enjoyed this film! It's a little predictable, but utterly entertaining!"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,8/10,"This movie was surprisingly good, well worth the watch!"
GREEN BOOK,11 October 2019,10/10,Great movie based on a true story brought to life by two great actors. Must see
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,10/10,"This story of the working-class Italian-American bouncer from NYC becoming the driver of an African-American classical pianist on his trio's tour of venues through the 1960s American South is a true classic. It is a group of actors whose mastery paints a very clear painting of a terrible time in our country, yet showing how different people from totally different backgrounds can still become friends and work together to defeat evil. I rated this movie a ""10"" out of ""10""."
GREEN BOOK,4 June 2019,10/10,"I enjoyed every bits of this movie! Some parts I just find myself laughing at their jokes, I'm glad I did not read what's this movie was about and just watch it online! Being spontaneous about some movie is good, just go ahead and enjoy this! Love it till the end! :))"
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2019,6/10,"As a light-weight feel good film it works. However if you go into the cinema expecting something a bit more substantial then be prepared for disappointment. The biggest negarive for me was the fact that it is such a predictable movie. Without seeing it I could have written an accurate synopsis based soley on the premise.
Definitely overrated for the cinema but ok if you want something easy on the brain at home on a Sunday evening."
GREEN BOOK,11 December 2020,8/10,It's unbelievably shocking to see what kind of discriminations the coloured people had to endure. Very impressive movie.
GREEN BOOK,5 July 2019,9/10,"Though it's a movie inspired by true events but the screenplay was just teriffic. Excellent casting, both leads were magnificent in their respective roles.
Watched such a beautiful movie after a long time that it made me make my first ever review."
GREEN BOOK,23 August 2021,9/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, a serious underlying theme of racism in America, brought to the screen with just to the right degree of humor."

GREEN BOOK,11 April 2021,9/10,"I really enjoyed this movie, amazing acting and very emotional!"
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,10/10,"Great movie, it was well written and played with respect to the all characters. it was not a documentary.The fact that the director and all artists involved contributed to make a movie achieved the goal. We are all human beings and therefore beautifully different.Because some scenes in the movie attempted to broadened our understanding of what it means to be human, illuminates the fact that we are all different. We can not like everything in this world, nor can we be expected to always agree with the choices that our fellow man makes for his or herself.
But we can begin the task of having empathy and learn again how to love, especially because in the end that is all there is
Finely crafted work of art"

GREEN BOOK,4 January 2019,10/10,It's well protrayed and the plot is amazing. I thought it's going to be a normal boring moving but eventually my tears starts to roll out from my eyes at some point and got me smile as well.
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,9/10,"The Holidays often bring too many quality choices on our screens and all families have a hard time choosing a quality film to enjoy. As a mixed couple now in our 40's we got to check the Green Book and what a beautiful thing that was.The Director, Peter Farrelly, which is most known as one of the Farelly brothers that penned funny, yet on the offensive side of things, movies when I was coming of age, surprised me greatly here because of the engaging rhythm and subtle yet powerful approach he instilled in this particular work.It is a road trip movie, with tropes that we may expect but also with just the right amount of surprises, softness, power and explosive moments all audiences like to experience.In the political context we are living in, revisiting such a disgraceful period of the American history with such poise is actually remarkable. It could be the breath of the original story and characters we explore, it could be that we indeed learned from decades of subtle and not so subtle struggles, but this movie instead of being sanctimonious, dragging your spirit down or simply being boring gives you that elusive but so lovely feeling that the world can be right, can be funny, and certainly can still be surprising.There undoubtedly are recognizable steps found in most road trip movies present here, but the fact that you are limited spatially and morally by the external boundaries shaping the lives of the protagonists, your life, following theirs, expand in such a way that there is a real delicate pleasure found in undertaking this journey with actors portraying these imperfect characters with gusto and inspiration.The laughs are authentic, the music is a pure pleasure and the character development is genuine. It bears to talk for a moment about the beautiful recreations of the 1962 urban landscapes, the approach to costume design and the fabulous sets for the interior design giving depth to the story. It shows you how people lived and worked vividly, including how tight spaces were.It really is the kind of film you can enjoy by yourself, as a couple, with the whole family, and even your whole congregation. You would come out of it eager to take a moment to discover the soundtrack, to share the feelings of kindness and decency it inspires, and even better, to root for this little movie that could...Let's be particularly glad to know that in this day and age there are courageous souls that choose to produce, write, direct and play in movies that are willing to face history rather than discredit, malign or ignore its lessons, as well as its surreal and malicious impact on the lives of those that have no power and means to protect themselves.
We need more of those and until then let's appreciate this wonderfully engaging and satisfying movie that is the Green Book, and be thankful for Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen chemistry and skills as actors. They rocked it!"
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,8/10,I'll keep this as succinct as possible. I held off on watching this movie for a while as I get very apprehensive watching movies others rave about. I finally watched it with very low expectations and boy were those expectations crushed and toppled in the most wonderful way. A masterclass in storytelling. Loved it.
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,10/10,I am not a critic of movies but this one i really liked. I would recommend watching this.
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,10/10,"Pure gold of differences between people in our world, giving a purpose and strenght to solving all those ""small"" problems. There is a lot of things from each one of us to do in our lives but this movie reminds you to do it with respect to any difference that is oposite of what you have been tought no matter how hard it is sometimes."

GREEN BOOK,7 July 2019,9/10,This movie does not have any negative points. It introduces you so much into the story that you do not want it to end. Viggo Mortensen's performance is sublime. It is a film that makes you go through all the emotions of the human being. I cried and laughed with her.
GREEN BOOK,9 March 2019,10/10,"How can one hate this movie? man this is one of the the best thing I've ever seen in my life! Brings smile, happiness and a relaxation to us..I fell in love with is movie man !Casting is too good 👌"
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2021,10/10,"I never rate a movie with perfect score, but this one stole my heart. the resolution of the movie is the most most beautiful resolution of a movie I've ever watched. This is a story about how people can change and how to not judge people based on what the others did just because they're on the same page"
GREEN BOOK,2 March 2019,6/10,"Very dissapoiting movie. Very good actors, but the story was too cliché in my opinion. No surprise that this movie won the Oscar in these leftist social justice times. Too much victimizing. How many movies like this do we need to make?"
GREEN BOOK,21 January 2019,10/10,"This movie is just absolutely beautiful and amazing, mahershala ali with his performance, other supporting actors, just perfecttt!!!"
GREEN BOOK,9 December 2019,10/10,"One of the best movies eve.
Very good performance and music"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,8/10,"Mr Ali and Mr Mortensen were amazing ... The film was a bit predictable but it had its wonderful moments, those moments that made us remember something familiar."
GREEN BOOK,31 October 2018,10/10,"I saw this film in a preview here in Calgary.I've seen Mortensen in films before and thought he was an okay film actor. His embodiment of Tony Lip is totally immersive. I not only believe his Bronx character, but depiction of Tony's growth as a human being is remarkable to watch. I can't say enough about Ali's performance as Don Shirley. It is nuanced and impressive.Watching these two characters interact and change each other is fascinating. This isn't just another road-trip buddy movie. It is funny, it is poignant and it is a brilliantly written and crafted film.The only drawback is, you will have to wait until US Thanksgiving to see it."
GREEN BOOK,22 January 2019,3/10,"The whole time I was watching this I kept thinking of Driving Miss Daisy. I think the Academy will honor the movie because they feel guilty about all the racism that is going on in the country right now. They aren't honoring the best film of the year , just a film that makes them feel less guilty about what is going on right now."
GREEN BOOK,15 September 2018,9/10,I felt this movie was well done on all psrts. The friendship between the two made for great for a great show!
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2019,10/10,"This is my first review here and I feel that I need to write and praise this movie. The film is full of human warmth, sincerity, and shows the connection of human souls.I was touched emotionally and I cried a few times from happiness, and I must mention phenomenal music! I recommend the film to everyone because it carries a nice message and celebrates friendship and positive interpersonal qualities. My ratings big 10 *"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,10/10,"It is a movie that really touch me, it really shows the difficulties of the time, but most important, the interaction of those two actors is outstanding. Bravo!!!"
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,9/10,"Was lucky to see this at a secret unlimited screening, had no idea what it was before but was genuinely surprised just how good it was. Managed to be very funny but also show the harshness of race relations in southern America in the 1960s. The acting was brilliant and would highly recommend any fan of film to go and see."
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,It's such an amazing film and story to be told by two men of different backgrounds life . Catch of the spirit of the musicians the highs and lows What it takes to Preformed Beautiful music and also a friendship..
GREEN BOOK,6 December 2018,10/10,"Saw an advance screening of Green Book at a cineworld secret screening. The theatre was almost full no doubt anticipating Mary Poppins and people actually got up left. To those people I say ""more fool you""
This will, I have no doubt become a classic. Two complete opposites thrown together in mutual disdain form a solid bond that lasts a lifetime.
Tears, laughter, mostly at the expense of Tony Lip and his brash, working class attitude to life. Superbly acted Vigo Mortenson was brilliantly believable while Marhershala Ali portrais himself as a self absorbed, holier than thou superior but actually turns out to be equally as flawed as Tony. The KFC scene was brilliantly played as was the scene involving the jade.
Absolutely loved it, as apparently did the rest of the audience who laughed out loud as one. A young guy sat at the side of me said "" I wouldn't normally go tho see this kind of film, but I'm glad I did"" and so was I"
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"A very solid movie with stunning performances from both leading and supporting role actors. The movie keeps you attached to the screen the whole time, it contains a lot of humour, but do not get confused - it also does offer very deep and touching conversations. I was not too sure what to expect when I was entering the cinema, but , boy, oh boy! It went far beyond my expectations. The movie is a must see!"
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,9/10,"I am writing this after just finishing in seeing this great movie. It has what it takes to make a great and genius movie about true friendship between to people which, at first sight, had nothing in common.
The bronx accent of Tony Lip and the italian way of solving his problems is absolutly amazing - it reminds me of de Niro in the movie ""A Bronx story"". The music played is also something that's giving this movie the greatness it deserves - the way in which Don Shirley plays with his heart and with such perfection, gives you goose bumps.
Rasism is also put in the light, but only to show people that with courage and the right people by your side you can overcome every fear you have.
A worth watching movie, it has all the necessary ingredients."
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,9/10,"This was a really great movie, better then expected 👍🏻 Definitely needs to be watched"
GREEN BOOK,14 February 2019,9/10,A very well made film. Great acting and great characters. A really engaging story line; parts were very funny and some parts were sad.
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,9/10,Didn't plan on seeing this until it won an oscar and totally expected it to be something different than it actually is.Knowing how the previously best picture films are in their raw ways of portraying these themes I was pleasantly suprised.This film is a must see! It makes you feel good and laugh but at the same time it makes you question things.Would watch again definitely.
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2020,10/10,"This is a very good story and very touching. I swear i did not lie, tony is a man who upholds his nickname and put together by Don who is very contradictory. This is very toching to eliminate racism, omg"
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"Easy to get along, life is simple if you make it to be."
GREEN BOOK,14 September 2019,10/10,"Had no idea it was Viggo Mortensen until I saw the credits, all the time I was like who's this incredible actor I've never seen before.. just a perfect performance from both Viggo and Mahershala.
This is a very strong story, the world has come a long way from there, but unfortunately, there is still so much to do.
Great movie!"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2020,10/10,Once word to describe it 'BEAUTIFUL'..very .few of the movies are made that touches heart ....and by seeing them your heart gets pleased and full of joy..this is one of them and at the top of that list....

GREEN BOOK,24 February 2021,10/10,"Very well presented and played movie. One of the rare movies, which you can watch over, good job!"
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,10/10,"Who could've ever greenlit ""Green Book""? A (mostly) true story of two men of completely different backgrounds overcoming their own prejudices and the stifling racism of the Deep South of the early 1960s. We'll hire a Danish guy to play an Italian guy, and a guy best known for playing a political fixer and a dope dealer (in ""House of Cards"" and ""Moonlight"", respectively) to play a Jamaican-American musical genius. And we'll have one of the Farrelly brothers direct it. How could that possibly become a great movie? Well, it does- primarily through the great performances of Viggo Jorgensen and Mahershala Ali, and the nuanced directing of Peter Farrelly. It confronts the racism prevalent at the time without becoming preachy, and shows its main characters growing through contact with each other, without a complete reversal of their characters (which would've seemed phony). Oh, and the movie looks great, too- the period cars, sets, and costumes really take you back to that time period. A film festival favorite, ""Green Book"" will hopefully be appreciated by Oscar voters, too."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,9/10,Just a true joy to watch. Not overly long. No special effects. Just a truly entertaining film which when you walk out leaves you with a smile on your face. Possibly a slight tear in eye. Not because it's slushy or overly sentimental. But because you're actually seen a film the moves you . And it leaves you with an actual warm heart . Now there's not many films that can say that ! Loved it . Enough said 👍
GREEN BOOK,13 January 2019,9/10,If you get the chance to see this movie you will not be disappointed. Both leads fantastic. Script superb. A breath of fresh air and a welcome relief from the borefest Hollywood has become. I doubt I will see a better movie in 2019.
GREEN BOOK,13 March 2019,5/10,"First of all it was great movie! At the same time was funny and sad. Also,it's worth watch it, because of its message which is racism."
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book is the greatest film to hit theaters in 2018, period. From the excellent performances of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Morrison to the witty and hilarious dialogue of Nick Vallelonga and Peter Farrely, Green Book will not disappoint. At it's core is an archetypal journey about friendship, love, and understanding. Instead of just a surface level story, Green Book has the rare ability to go below the surface with a cleverly hidden hero's journey and a role reversal that sets it apart from most movies on the subject of race. Rather than a typical ""white hero"" storyline, Green Book surpasses race altogether, putting forth a narrative of understanding and an exceptional comment on the human condition."
GREEN BOOK,17 May 2020,10/10,"OMG! I feel so blessed that I watched it! Feeling so relieved, so happy, sometimes sad but still glad and grateful...I always heard of the movie, and after Oscar of course a bit more enthusiasm, and now I am just desperate why I haven/t watched it by now. So well-deserved work!! Actors, screenplay, idk everything, and of course the main issue emphasized there..all were just perfect!!
You should definitely watch it!"
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,9/10,"This movie was ""virtuoso"". That's Italian for good btw.
If you ever find yourself searching for good movies to watch, reading through review after review with no luck, just like me then give this a try.
Ignore the front cover, I skipped this once because it reminded me of Driving Miss Daisy. Don't go watching the trailer neither, I've already given too much a spoiler in my review already, so don't let anything take away from being entertained in this brilliant movie. The best I have seen from 2018.
I am sure it will relate to people of many different backgrounds.
If my review doesn't have perfect grammar, don't be judgmental. It's acceptable and coherent as an exception in regards to a review of this movie."
GREEN BOOK,21 June 2019,10/10,"Back in the 60's decade, ""Green Book"" was a term referring to a collective record of registered accommodation when one traveled, and this movie was based on real-life story of one African American genius pianist Don Shirley whose performing tours journeyed from north to south with his Italian mafia ""road manager"" Tony Lip.To the characters, it takes guts to travel deep south because of racism issues at the time and it takes much compassion to endure that 2 month-trip living out of a suitcase. So to the viewers, it of course infuses with fury to see how people practiced inhumanity and prejudice, but at the same time with so much joy to notice an endearing friendship was formed and some light of hope was sparkled at the end.A lot of mutual understanding has been transcended via the culture roots and it progressed to remind everyone again of the same longing for love and acceptance.It's a true 10 over 10 for both the script writers and the casts. No more hats off to these amazing people, mine is already on the floor."
GREEN BOOK,24 March 2021,10/10,"One of the best films I've ever seen. And totally not my wheelhouse of scifi or horror.
Great performances all round.
Being young enough and on the other side of 'the pond' I never lived at a time like this. And while I know about it being backwards et all. Seeing it played out like this was educational."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"This is a must see.
The talent that accompany this beautiful storyline is beautiful. Please watch it. So amamzing !!"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,"I just cannot stop smiling after watching this beautiful piece of art.

GREEN BOOK,22 June 2019,8/10,Viggo Mortensen is one of the best actors I've ever watched
GREEN BOOK,8 November 2018,9/10,"This movie was so shocking but historically and tragically realistic. During a period in our lives when there is so much hate being perpetuated, this movie is a great eye opener as to a very brief glimpse of the way African Americans were being treated in the eastern -midwest and South in particular.
I highly recommend this film. It is both heart warming and shocking. Don't want to spoil any of the movie for anyone.
Dr. Don Shirley was an Amazing Virtuoso. Born with a Savant talent for piano that only others could wish for. Mahershala Ali's acting and piano playing were remarkable. A must go see. Bring your teenagers. Its a great history lesson and great eye opener."

GREEN BOOK,19 April 2019,10/10,"I am learning a lot from the movie, exacting funny and simple ."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,True story. I can't find enough words to express my opinion about this exceptional. Movie. Well done...
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"Simply wonderful, makes you stop and think about people and awful judgments.."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,9/10,"Don't wait to see it. It's fun, thought-provoking and charming. Yet, it also speaks to racism and the old adage: Don't judge a book by its cover. I wouldn't be persuaded by experts who seem to think this is too light for the subject. It's respectful and speaks to the human spirit. Loved it."
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2019,8/10,Good review of the many types of racism of the 50's and 60's. Cleverly done by wrapping it together with a great story line. No wasted scenes. Moves along and makes many points.
GREEN BOOK,11 January 2019,8/10,"Funny, breezy, emotional and impactful. Great performances and screenplay. Just an enjoyable movie with a tiny bit of a message (even if it doesn't get as deep as it maybe could have)."
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2019,3/10,Couldn't watch this beyond the 50 minute mark. No chemistry between the leads and their dialogue felt scripted and forced.
GREEN BOOK,6 March 2019,9/10,"I thought it was great, with all the period scenes and cars plus the great cast and such an incredibly, sad, true story. Love it! More like this!"
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2019,9/10,Beautiful and moving thriller.Incredible chemistry between these two great actors.Highly enjoyable.
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,8/10,"If you like to watch movies for great performances, a good story, depth of emotion, and god forbid entertainment, then you will love this movie. If the makers of this movie wanted to pander to the righteousness of its critics, then they would have made a different movie. Overall, itï¿ 1/2(TM)s a great balance between the depressing reality of racism and pure entertainment."
GREEN BOOK,9 February 2019,8/10,"This movie details the relationship between pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and a bouncer named Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who is hired to drive him through the Deep South in 1962 for a two month concert tour. He is to make sure he reaches all the concert destinations and to keep him safe if any trouble should arise, and plenty does. The acting is wonderful, especially by Viggo Mortensen, who portrays an Italian from New York who is a bit rough around the edges compared to the dignified Shirley. Plenty of humor is interspersed within the poignant relationship that develops between the two men. This movie is based on a true story when segregation was the ""norm"", and the Green Book was a travel guide for African Americans that listed hotels that were available for them to stay in, which were often subpar if best. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this movie might not be for you, but if you like movies that show a piece of history and true to life heart-warming stories, then this one is for you!"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,9/10,Very sweet!I like it very much!you must have to watch it.
GREEN BOOK,17 February 2019,6/10,"The movie has a simple story, entertaining and funny, thats why in my opinion deserve 6 stars. The acting perfomance is poor in my opinion, the story is lineal and ordinary, but funny sometimes,with little jokes time to time using the contrast between a rude italian and an egocentric afroamerican, but thats all.
I respect this is based on a true story, but the movie is not so good and definitely is not a 10/10.
If you have relatives and friends who likes a movie with a easy laugh, invite them, you will have a good time."
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,10/10,"This movie got me to register on IMDB so that i can comment on its excellency!Wow! This is one of the most refreshing movies I have seen in a very long time.Based on true events and a backdrop of racism, I feel the comic side of this movie just makes you laugh throughout its entirety. Racism was and still is bad but I have learnt that through perserverance, though it may look like there is no change, you can make a difference.This will always be in my hall of fame of the best movies of my generation."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,8/10,"Probably a bit overrated for its message, yet it leaves you with a good aftertaste and you never think in line of ""ok, when will it finally end?"" in process. Hardly a comedy, the film rather feels like a couple of relaxed hours in a good company.
I had a tough time picking between 7 and 8, so is it really so close to 10? Likely not. But it stands out. Do not miss."
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,"A movie with predictable elements from themes to plot points, a very by-the-numbers film but hey, it WORKS. I enjoyed every minute and was even moved a few times.Viggo is undeniably gifted and highly underrated. There wasn't anything necessarily ""Best Actor"" worthy but the man can definitely craft a character against previous works.Mahershala scared me at first with his posh and stiff presence, much like Chiwetel Ejiofor's recent works, but I came around once I understood the character. And I really enjoyed his performance from then on. Their interactions were believable from start to finish."
GREEN BOOK,14 March 2019,8/10,"I was really surprised by this film. Great cast, fun movie. It touches on serious subjects without being too heavy about them.Viggo and Mahershala have great chemistry together.Enjoyable watch, can recommend. Just don't expect something super deep."
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,8/10,Go see it just for Viggo. He's performance is so funny and great!
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,8/10,Throughly enjoyable. An interesting twist on black and white racism.
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,8/10,"Movie has so many warm scenes, chemistry between two main characters is beautiful. Racism thematic is a bit too often nowdays but movie gets it on point. Viggo is tremendous and M. Ali played his role with his best. Perfect movie for family reunions and romantic nights. I give it 8 because movie didn't give anything new, nor from director nor from scenarist. Real rating is 8,5 (closer to 9 than 8) probably because of weak competition this year. All in all, recommendation for anyone."
GREEN BOOK,27 March 2019,10/10,"The scenes of Doc. Shirly wears beautiful suits can't be remove from my mind for a long time. In 1962, most black men still lived a hard life which was not respected by white people. Even Doc. Shirly, who was such a famous musician, couldn't eat at a gorgeos canteen and try on suits in the tailor's shop. Meeting with such bad things, he just showed his dignity to fought. Maybe he felt alone all the time, but the dignity of his character would never vanish. The happy ending like many Hoolywood movies is just as common, but it makes our heart warm."
GREEN BOOK,5 March 2019,10/10,I have never reviewed any movie before on IMDb but i made an exception for this movie as I fell in love with every element that made this movie in such a way for me to rate it 10 stars. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali portrayed their characters with such perfection and dedication. The movie had an amazing story with perfect background tunes for each of their scenes. I personally wished that the movie didn't end as I didn't feel like getting up from it. This is indeed one of 2018's best and finest films which gave me a lot of satisfaction with a really great and happy ending.I would recommend this movie to all!!!!!
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,9/10,"When we talking about discrimination ,what we talking about indeed?Just skin color?Or sexual orientation?The meaning of without discriminate is that everyone equity.Just like the Germany who appeared in the film said "" It is not only talent but also courage that changes people's ideas."""
GREEN BOOK,7 March 2019,8/10,A very safe movie. Both inspirational on the surface and heavy in its core. The wonderful performance from two talented actors are definitely adding to the completion of the movie.
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,9/10,"How an individual is seen and how he's portrayed in a movie are two different scenarios usually, but not in this case. M.Ali held up his legacy with the entourage that is followed. The rest of the movie shows critical interpretation with the modern world."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,3/10,"The green book tells a story about an upper-class black male who never eats KFC and wears fancy cloth all the time and a typical working-class Italian-American(usually if not always tall, brave, humorous, have a pretty wife and two lovely kids though a little bit racism) become to appreciate each other during the trip. Althougth i didn't see the movie through my guess is the Italian-American become a perfect man(tall, brave, humorous, have a pretty wife and two lovely kids and now unprejudiced)."
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,2/10,"What is perhaps the most telling exchange in this ode to some mystical, post-racial looking back, boy to man story is that of the Kentucky fried chicken dialogue. When Tony consternates that he is ""more black"" than Don Shirley simply because he eats fried chicken and listens to Aretha Franklin, one can only pause at the absurdity of such an utterance from a presumed first generation Italian American to a African American man presumedly steeped in the 1950s Black Liberation movement. One would have expected Mr. Shirley to take a bat to the back of Tony's head with such a disparaged and, most certainly, historically inaccurate, depiction of American society pre-Civil Rights legislation, Pre-Voting Rights legislation, and at the cusp of a radical consciousness of Black identity still forming its sensibilities for the late-20th C. Placed in the context of American Southern apartheid, with a heap of hand waving by their Northern white countrymen, to suggest a white man of any ethnicity would gladly identify as more black than a African American man in the midst of one of the violent and consequential turning points in American history is not only ludicrous but offensive. The very script contradicts itself when later Tony assaults a police man in Alabama who assailed him with an epithet that for Mr. Shirley was par for the course. If this film is allegory of where we were a half century ago and all we have to look forward to now that we have freed ourselves from America's original sin, one can only contemplate how poorly we understand our own history and our inability to reckon with the utter failure of spirit that is American racism."
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,9/10,"There was one particular scene in which Tony wiped his feet off before entering the bed with his wife. This clearly reflects an attention to detail in which the actor did his homework, and realized that low income people have a tendency to maintain a very clean and tidy bed in the presence of filth in their environment"
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2019,10/10,"I have forgotten when did i see such good movie for 2 hours almost without blinking eye. Their conversation, camera shooting everything was good. Thank you for giving us such beautiful movie. Thank you again. I will watch this movie so many times again, i know it."

GREEN BOOK,9 February 2020,10/10,I love this film and I will protect it with all my strength.
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2019,10/10,"Captivating. That is what this film was in short. It was a pure story of finding peace in one another and understanding what you once did not understand. It is not just about a driver and a pianist, it is about forming a friendship where others deemed it unfit. This movie was entertaining the entire way through and it shared a beautiful tale. I will recommend this film to anyone asking what they should watch."
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2019,10/10,"The plot of the movie is fantastic, the scene is brilliant, i wish people keep making similar movie like this again..."
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2019,10/10,"The title of the movie, Green Book, one would expect it to be a movie about romance or a chick-flick. However, Green Book is a movie about Donald (Don) Shirley, who was an African-American musician. The title of the movie itself originates from The Green Book which was published by Victor Hugo Green and his family. The book served as a guide as to which establishments served African-Americans in the segregated South. As such, it is no secret that this movie is heavily influenced by the series of events that took place in the 1960s. The movie highlighted the misfortunes faced by people of color during that time.Both protagonists were a perfect match for the movie and for each other. Shirley, portrayed by Mahershala Ali, has endured racial discrimination his whole life. In this movie, he had set out on a mission to recruit a chauffeur for his upcoming tour. The chauffeur is none other than, Tony Vallelonga (Tony Lip), portrayed by Viggo Mortensen. It is important to note that Ali is an Academy Award winner whose acting skills are quite intriguing. It is also through their opposite characters that we are able to see their contrasting ideologies. As it was hard for an African-American musician to travel around the country, all Shirley wanted to do was to perform so that he could prove his point, even though he was secretive. As the movie progresses, it is evident to see how an inevitable friendship slowly develops.Back in the day, New York City was a buzzing hub for various mafias, gangs and drug dealings. Through this movie, the ways in which ""Tony Lip"" turned down illegal offers is evidently portrayed. The bouncer turned down many opportunities, after losing his job temporarily. Thus, Lip was hired by Shirley to be his personal assistant and chauffeur. Even though the offer was turned down by Lip due to his ego, Shirley knew that losing Lip would prove to be a huge lost due to his reputation and by the way he handles situations.The way in which the movie was shot was quite amazing, to say the least. From the perspective of a viewer, it feels like you went back in time to the period where overt displays of racism were the norm in America. It is quite saddening to see the extent to which racism occurred back in the day. Unless one has lived through it and experienced the injustice first hand, one cannot fully comprehend the depths of emotional and physical abuse endured by people of color. A lot of emphasis was placed on the segregation between people of color and the whites, a significant example was that they had to stay in different hotels. By how the scene is set, one could get a glimpse as to some of the adversities faced by Shirley. One of the many examples was how difficult it was for him to go on tour."
GREEN BOOK,4 April 2019,7/10,"The movie is okay, but the message has been used before. I miss a bit of a plot twist in the movie where something really happens. The play, on the other hand, is really good."
GREEN BOOK,4 November 2019,10/10,Loved this movie. Very interesting and had some laughs in it as well
GREEN BOOK,28 April 2019,10/10,"It only took 8 weeks for Tony to change his entire outlook. Now Tony can help his family and friends change their outlook and attitude. Imagine if everyone took the time to understand and get to know each other. Before they have spent time with you, people will judge each other based on skin color, weight, clothing style, etc, before they have even heard you speak. We need to immerse ourselves in other cultures and quit being so dang sheltered. I think this movie adds fuel to that fire. Great writing!"
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2020,9/10,"I hadn't heard about this movie and picked it as a comedy to watch with my wife and twenty something daughter and her friend.
Yes it was funny, but it was also a heartwarming, tender and moving story about overcoming pregidice and racismin 1960's America. I would thoroughly recommend this movie."
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2019,8/10,"Green Book succeeds as a movie it's show a good chemistry between the actors, strong historical accuracy and a balance of laughter and tension!! It's a movie I would recommend to anyone and the ending makes you feel happy!!"
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2019,7/10,"When portraying trust, friendship, or racism in today's hybrid genres that batter the big screen, it can be difficult to lay out the perfect balance of suspense and comedy to set the right tone for any pivotal scene. Written by Nick Vallelonga and directed by Peter Farrelly, Green Book is an amusing drama released in November 2018 that steps up to the plate and delivers a solid feel-good hit for today's family audience.Set in 1962, the movie tells a story about acceptance, companionship, and racial tension that permeates the Deep South. Playing the role of New Jersey's finest family man, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga, is Viggo Mortenson. He is hired to accompany a virtuoso black piano player, Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, through a months-long musical odyssey as Dr. Shirley and his trio move from venue to venue across the country, following ""The Green Book"" to find accommodations in the still-segregated Southern states. The tour culminates in a Christmas Eve show in Birmingham, Alabama, before the duo race home in time for the holidays. The chemistry between Tony (Mortenson) and Dr. Shirley (Ali) is unparalleled in capturing their relationship as they travel together across the nation. The plot structure starts slow, but it builds decent momentum as the story takes a few murky attempts to portray the significant racism ever-present in the early '60s. Finally, the top-notch soundtrack, featuring music from the likes of The Blackwells, Timmy Shaw, and Bobby Page, is enough to keep you wrapped up in the rhythm of the moment until the next defining scene.The strongest asset of this movie comes from the ability of the all-star actors. The chemistry between Viggo and Ali is immersive and quickly becomes the highlight of every scene. The story of Tony Vallelonga begins with a man that is confident in what he knows about the world and the way it works for him. He uses his deviant skills to get favors and anything else he might need to get by. In the scene where Tony first meets Dr. Shirley, he is seated on a throne in a room of elegant taste. It quickly becomes apparent how uncomfortable Tony is at the initial idea of working for an educated, wealthy black man like Dr. Shirley. At the first venue they attend together, Dr. Shirley reveals a similar sentiment when he tells Tony that his speaking skills are unrefined and advises him to stay quiet and shorten his last name. Dr. Shirley then offers an olive branch during the scene, giving Tony spending money for incidentals and whatever else he might need. However, as they travel together, Tony still shows a misguided level of suspicion towards Shirley when he comes back to the car to get his wallet off the dash. As he walks away, his emotions show that even he understands how unnecessary his actions were. Through the movie, they grow a closer friendship with one another as they stick together through difficult times. When they first arrive in Tennessee, Tony is offered a job by some acquaintances from New York. Unaware that Shirley understands what they are saying, he agrees to meet with them. Dr. Shirley later confronts Tony about this, offering him more money and a promotion to road manager if he will stay. He declines the extra money and reveals he had no intention of leaving, showing a level of new-found appreciation for the trust and friendship that has grown between them.The biggest setback for this movie is the depth of the story. There are gray areas that leave the viewer wanting more. The PG-13 rating shows that the true issues of equality and segregation are not explored to a great depth. The plot feels shallow, and the character's motives are often unrefined. Dr. Shirley's unique personality is often manipulated into whatever role is necessary to appeal to a middle-class white audience, making it feel forced. In the scene where the duo cross into Kentucky, we get a brief glimpse of Don Shirley's troubled past and his tangled relationship with his family as he reveals a few sparse details about his failed marriage and his estranged brother. But once the attitude of the movie shifts, so does the character's motivations. We don't hear about his backstory again until the end of the movie.The movie is rife with Motown, blues, and classical music that hit all the right notes in all the right places. Swinging at the Copacabana, waltzing with masterful composers, and getting down on the gritty blues of the South all play a critical role and pull the audience right into the '60s. During the bar scene at the Orange Bird, Dr. Shirley finally drops his misconceptions about popular music of the time. He is then immediately able to connect with the people around him thanks to the music and emotion that brings them all together. By changing the notes he plays, Don Shirley finally realizes he isn't just some outcast. Instead, he has been distancing himself from people that will accept him for who he is.Even with a few bumps in the road, Green Book drives home a 7/10. It's an agreeable feel-good movie that tries to look past the heavier context and focus on moving forward through relationships and self-acceptance found in each character. The story is delivered with some exceptional cinematography and unforgettable chemistry. However, the fact that it won Best Picture in 2018 over more original movies is not something I would expect, as the story did not leave a lasting impression like other nominees in the category. While it doesn't offer up any real solutions for racial equality, Green Book still fits the bill for a solid family night movie. It's a story that is sure to entertain, even if it is just to sit back, smile, and watch an astounding performance of two grown men throwing chicken bones out of a moving car together."
GREEN BOOK,9 May 2019,9/10,"Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly and staring Vigo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali, which opened in November 2018, describes the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Vallalonga in the 1960's. In the beginning of the film, viewers watch Dr. Shirley hire Vallelonga to be his chauffer and body guard as he embarks a two month long musical tour as a pianist. Vallelonga, an Italian American man, became Dr. Shirleys chauffeur. Dr.Shirley, an African American, was a wealthy and very sophisticated man. The two men travel around the Midwest and in the deep South, while Shirley preforms music on his piano at many different places and event. As the film progresses, viewers watch the two men develop a friendship and grow closer to each other through cultural and personality differences. Greenbook is a compelling drama because of the tension between Mortenson and Ali, the cinematography, and the music and sound effects.
The tension between Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali and Tony Vallelonga, played by Vigo Mortenson is truly captivating. In a scene at the start of the film, Vallelonga and Shirley meet to interview about the job. Shirley, sitting superior in his throne wearing a white and gold gown develops a tension between him and Tony. It caught Tony off guard because it wasn't very common for an African American man to be wealthy and sophisticated. Vallelonga was middle class, racist, and extremely rough around the edges, so him and Shirley were very different people. In the middle of the film, the men stopped at a place where Vallelonga had secretly stuffed a rock into his pocket, and Shirley forced him to return the stolen rock, but he didn't. This scene indicated that Shirley was starting to figure out who Tony was, but was expecting more out of him. Toward the end of the film, Vallelonga and Shirley grew closer as they started to see through each other's differences. Eating without utensils was not an option for Shirley, however toward the end of the movie he broke through his pride and sophistication and started eating fried chicken with his hands, just like Tony. That showed that they were stating to mingle together and overcome the differences of each other. Tony stands up for Shirley throughout the movie when he is faced with discrimination along their journey. The two men developed a friendship through hard times, but also the good times too.
The cinematographers created a film that is very eye capturing. The lighting, dull and dim, throughout the movie portrayed the time period that the movie was set in. The scenes that were shot in the bars helped to create a shallow mood throughout the story because the bars were dark, smoky, and dingey. The actors wore clothing that really fit the 1960s because the women dressed in dresses and hats, while the men wore suits. The viewers really got to dive in and feel more a part of the story with small details like the old cars. Specific parts in scenes that are shot around the different towns that they went through had old classical cars, and the car that Tony chauffeured Shirley around in was an old car, but classy to them. At the end of the film, there were old photographs showed of the real people that the story was based off. Those photos helped the film become so much more alive than it already was.
The music and sounds effects are a very important part of a movie to make it more realistic. There was good music throughout the film to create moods for certain scenes. During the film, they were all out at a gathering and there was classical upbeat music while there were shots of people having a good time. When there became racial tension between Dr. Shirley and the white crowd, the music changed to a more serious tone, then stopped. The sounds effects help move along parts of the story because without them, the movie wouldn't feel realistic.
The Green Book is a feel-good movie for families to sit down and watch together as Dr. Shirley and Tonys friendship evolved over the film, to observe the cinematography, and to hear the music and sound effects that the editors placed to make the movie realistic. If you are looking for a film that is going to end with a good underlying story, then you should purchase Green Book."
GREEN BOOK,10 May 2019,10/10,"By far, the best movie i have watched in a long time."
GREEN BOOK,14 May 2019,8/10,"Sometimes even every moment we feel that we are perfect enough. We don't possess enough money, handsome enough appearance, good enough family but it is reality!"
GREEN BOOK,3 June 2019,7/10,"From the beginning you know how everything is going to go and how it is going to end. Even that, it works because of the Characters, their charm and the relationship they build. You are going to have a great time watching it."
GREEN BOOK,16 June 2019,10/10,"Green Book is a wonderful movie. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are acting fantastically. It is nice to see the development of a friendship between the two main characters Tony Lip and Don Shirley. Peter Farrelly also succeeded in subtly depicting a serious and sad topic such as racism. Despite this depressing theme, the film also has some humorous elements. Green Book unites elements of drama and comedy. It is a very warm-hearted film that absolutely convinces. It also makes you think. Green Book shows what friendship and tolerance really mean. For me, it is already the film of the year. I think it has really earned winning the Oscar for Best Picture. Green Book is for me one of the best films of all time. I can only recommend to everyone to necessarily watch this movie. It is really worth it ."
GREEN BOOK,3 July 2020,10/10,Amazing from beginning to end! Loved it! I would definitely recommend watching it with family.
GREEN BOOK,29 June 2019,10/10,"The best movie i saw in years , i didn´t think they were capable of ccoming up with good movies anymore."
GREEN BOOK,17 January 2020,10/10,Beautiful story and well played. Viggo Mortensen nailed it.
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2019,8/10,"The movie was a lovely combination between two different worlds , two different mindsets ,just some different aspects of life collapsing into one beautiful story in which some boundaries were broken such as hatred and racism ..
in this kind of movies we get to see and discover the depths and asspects of humans ,the association of different qualities in one human being -and even oppsed ones at the same time-, his ability to change to grow and his will to help or to destroy others .. i loved how none of the main charachters radically changed , they simply dived into the other's culture , got inspired and loaded some of that into his own existence into his own identity ..that's the real purpose of human intereacting indeed .. that's what makes us human ,the ability to be different to be accepted for that and be accepted as well ."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2021,10/10,"The screenplay and character development is extraordinary! Crazy, all I can say i WOW WOW WOW! <3"
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2019,8/10,I like this story. Both of them lead a different life.
GREEN BOOK,10 September 2019,10/10,"Amazing movie! This story is teaching us to appreciate, respect and be firm with our lives."
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2020,8/10,"In The 1960s an Italian guy losses his job for 8 week and has to find new work.
He is offered a job as a driver for a Doctor but soon finds out that the job is for a musician and also involves being his ""caretaker"". He gets the jobs and the two of them head out.
You are never bored watching this film, there is always either: drama, something going good, something going bad or a surprise you didn't expect.
For us viewers its like being in the car with them, and whenever Tony has bad manners or something, we feel the awkwardness Doc feels, and when Doc does something fancy Tony don't understand we feel awkwardness too.The great thing about this film is that they start out by being as far from each others personalities as they can but then later becomes very good friends and support each other. A great example is when Doc offers Tony money if there was anything he wanted or when Doc helps Tony write. Another great example is when we was told in the beginning that Doc only plays on Steinway, and then later when Tony finds out that they don't have a Steinway he gets really upset and he gets in a little fight with a crew and we now truly see why Doc wanted Tony.
When Doc drives Tony home for xmas even though Tony is the driver we really understand just how far their friendship has come.Great Film all 3 Oscars well deserved"
GREEN BOOK,26 October 2019,10/10,It's really so amazing movie that i enjoy it too much.
GREEN BOOK,1 November 2019,9/10,"With great cinematography, music and plot, Green Book gave us a lesson about humanity, friendship and racism. Show us how two people totality different can learn with each other even with his difference.This film has a very deeply context, but make us watch in a softly way, using the humor to relieve the situations. The acting of Viggo Mortensen (Tony Lip) and Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley) was very precisely and deep, we feel every emotions and bringing us close to the story.The racial question was precisely portrayed, not in a victimism way, or too emotional, but gave us a real vision about it. Even the most powerful mans were judged and discriminated because your skin. I loved it.I just can say one thing: Go and watch this, you will not regret. Forgive me if I made some mistake with the language, my English is a little bit rusted."
GREEN BOOK,8 May 2020,5/10,"Despite the fact that the film is very beautiful, tells an important story and it is just pretty good IT IS SO CHEESY AND AMERICAN I BARELY WATCHED IT"

The movie in which every second that I enjoyed. Amazing Direction Brilliant Cast Amazing cinematography."
GREEN BOOK,11 April 2020,1/10,"I loved this film. However the movie claims to be ""based on a true story"".
The problems are so serious that I had to rate it 1 star.Don Shirley was not a homosexual. And the living family of Don Shirley were not consulted in the making and writing of this film.If the film was not based on Don Shirley's life, then it would have deserved a higher rating.This is very deceptive and they have no shame in their molesting the public by using LGBT to get people in the box office and to pushing false narratives that only hurt young people not wise enough to know what is real and what isn't.Please read the comments from the family of Don Shirley who also slammed this film.Truth is essential in all things.The left doesn't care about Truth, they care about changing the culture."
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2020,9/10,"The voyage of two men of two different ethnic backgrounds unfolds the story of a life long friendship made gradually while giving us a glimpse of the state of the seggregation yhat prevailed in America.
This remarkable story of Dr. Sherly and Tony set forth to deep south America reveals that true friendship has no bounds. The true human connection is formed when two people opens up fully revealing their authentic selves, fears and vulnerabilities. What other best way to form an unexpected friendship than a road trip with a stranger!"
GREEN BOOK,20 April 2020,9/10,"Marvelous story neatly executed, both characters were brilliant. Hats off to script writter ;) YK"
GREEN BOOK,23 April 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Nothing else I can say other than it was just PERFECT.. 100/10 in my opinion.
GREEN BOOK,2 May 2020,10/10,"Beautiful story of an Italien man driving a black piano artist to his concerts through the Deep South and experiencing the problems that a black person had in the middle of the last century. But also it is a wonderful story of developing a unique friendship. A lot of shocking moments, that makes you thinking but also a lot of laughs and beautiful moments. Based on a true story."
GREEN BOOK,6 December 2018,,"This movie is fictional with a good storyline, but the family during an extensive interview stated most of the film is fabricated. Ok to see the movie, just know the story is just that a tale of lies"
GREEN BOOK,1 February 2021,10/10,If you ain't seen it you've got to watch it it's one of the kind the best of growing up in the 70's
GREEN BOOK,4 November 2020,8/10,"Green book is a story about a resilient guy called Tony Lip who eventually had to change his job due to diminishing returns. After a while he stumbled upon a new job. The job was a personal driver of an African American man Don Shirley who has earned his fortune by playing a piano. I want to remind that it was happening in New York in 1960s. The discrimination was widely-spread and working for an African American could seem shameful, but Tony ultimately got over it and he was hired for the job. At the beginning Tony was patronizing Don Shirley but when they went on a Don's concert tour, they started getting along and even became real friends.
It is obviously that Nick Vallengola (the screenwriter) tried to tackle an issue of inequality in the American society in 1960s. Initially, before hiring for the job, Tony was inclined to disregard black people. And during the tour Don Shirley encountered a discriminatory treatment from other people lots of times. But Tony has changed his mind regarding his real treatment of black people. He noticed and recognized that the problem exists in the society and it shouldn't be like this. Tony realized that people should help people regardless of the nation or race.
It reminds something, huh? It is not hard to notice that Green Book's plot is positively correlated with 1+1 movie, but with reversed situation where a black guy was hired to be a ""right hand"" of a rich white man.
I think that Tony Lip and Don Shirley both succeeded in pursuit of happiness. They both have found a real friend and derived happiness from this. It was perfectly illustrated by the final scene where Tony invited Don Shirley for a family dinner."
GREEN BOOK,4 November 2020,10/10,"At first glance, The Green Book seems like a conventional copy of 1+1. One man works for another one as personal assistant. However, all stereotypes disappear when I take into account that was an actual pathetic story about racial discrimination in postwar US that happened to virtuoso Don Shirley and ordinary hillbilly guy Tony Lip. When I watched the film I realized that the world was not socially just in 1960s. To be honest, I was absolutely shocked because we have never dealt with the same problem in Russia.
The plot is fully packed by touching moments about flagrant violation of inalienable humans' rights. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize two of them that shocked me above all. The first one happened in Kentucky. There was a special supper dedicated to a concert of Dr. Shirley. However, when he was going to use a bathroom people was not ready to share it with ""coloured"" man. The second moment took place in prison after Tony punched policemen for humiliation. I remembered the words of Dr. Shirley that dignity not physical power always prevails.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I would highly recommend it to everyone because it forces to think about our attitude to all people over the world regardless of their skin color, religion, prejudices and outlook on life. The problem of discrimination is not completely solved everywhere. To tackle it, we have to establish healthy relationship with each other, spread democracy and provide equal opportunities for everyone. As was noticed above, dignity always prevails."
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2020,,This film has made it to my top 10. I was hooked from beginning to end. Class A acting from both lead roles. This film evoked every emotion I am capable of.
GREEN BOOK,29 December 2020,9/10,"I loved this movie. My friend recommended this movie to me before watching the movie. He said you just have to watch this movie and you will be very impressed and it really is. Although the man has great talent, unfortunately, he is not valuable among people. I have 2 favorite scenes. The scene playing the piano for the first time and the scene where Tony gets out of the bar and throws a gun in the air and says ""Never hit a wad of your money at the bar"" There is a beautiful scene for me. In short, I loved this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,8/10,While I enjoyed this film. It was just a reminder how primitive backwards US was just 50 years ago and still an ongoing progression. From ignorance to racism and bad people. I'm surprised it didn't turn out to be a nightmare when people who lived the harshness in life can break a person. I felt mad at some points but the movie was rather entertaining. It was more of a feel good movie and friendship when reality is different than what people endured.
GREEN BOOK,10 October 2021,1/10,"This movie is an huge insult to every black person who ever was born and had to deal with racism in life. And every award and nomination is another insult to colored population. And everyone who liked this movie should seriously ask yourself about it. Just think about: is a movie about racism created by a white person!!! So, it's a movie about racism directed to white people don't blame themselves about racism. And the most insulting thing is win an Oscar over BlacKkKlansman. A shame."
GREEN BOOK,15 August 2021,9/10,"Wonderful true story about a friendship that develops between an African-American musical genius and his street wise uneducated White driver. Tony's empathy deepens for his ""boss"" Don as he faces the brutality of racism in the 60's Deep South. Viggo is excellent in this role as is Mahershala Ali. Great movie."
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2021,10/10,This was very lovely i watched it 3 times and everytimes gived me real good vibe
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2021,10/10,Love this movie. It's a masterpiece. Great acting. Great screenplay. EXCELLENT!❤❤❤❤❤
GREEN BOOK,2 April 2021,10/10,My wife and I just finished watching this movie for the second time. It's a really beautiful movie about friendship.One of our favorites. It will make you laugh and even cry. The acting is amazing by the two main characters. We will watch it many more times in the future!
GREEN BOOK,4 April 2021,10/10,"This story was so entertaining! I don't remember laughing out loud so many times, viggo's portrayal of his character was spot on. On a serious note, i really liked the balance of racial atrocities of this era and the quite humorous differences between the two main characters . Congratulations and thank you for this film."
GREEN BOOK,15 August 2021,9/10,"This film shows how it was, how we've moved forward - brilliantly acted from start to finish - highly recommended.Fantastic film."
GREEN BOOK,23 July 2021,10/10,"Maybe its a good reminder of how far we have come, rather than a plea for racial harmony which, by and large, is not a significant problem in this country as some would believe. Anti-semitism, on the other hand, has been a consistent and largely unaddressed issue over the last 50 years. Ill watch this as a tribute of how great America is as a govt system of the people, that was devised to right its wrongs."
GREEN BOOK,9 August 2021,10/10,"Wow why i didnt see this movie before.This movie gives you best feels
I could see this more times."
GREEN BOOK,19 September 2021,10/10,Authenticity is visible in every second of every minute. Just brilliant.
GREEN BOOK,12 November 2021,10/10,"I am a die-hard fan of films based on a true story. It's never a dull moment when you watch such movies. ""Green book"" directed by Petter Farrely is a special case for me. This is a really inspiring story. I am aware of controversy surrounding the film and I am not the one who ignores it, but the fact is that during watching ""Green book"" I felt the whole spectrum of emotions including anger, resentment, love, acceptance, respect, contempt and happiness. So it makes me consider the film as a good one.I'm not going to reveal the whole plot which contains lots of food for thought and gives rise to a big discussion about black people's rights. What really matters here, in my opinion, is the way how the relationship of Tony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga, a tough bouncer, and Don Shirley, the African-American classical pianist, is developing and black and white has nothing to do with it. Despite the differences between the two men, they casted away their biases and prejudices and develop an unexpected bond. It's always interesting to watch character transformations in movies. So this one can give you enough of it. While watching the drama you can see how all the obstacles the couple overcomes make them reevaluate their priorities. The end of the film is spiritually uplifting. The last scene that shows celebrating Christmas eve symbolizes the changes happened with two friends.I strongly recommend you watch the film. It is quite long, but it feels comfortable to watch because the plot is really gripping and apart from disturbing moments, there are some hilarious ones. I was really captivated by ""Green book"" and give it 10/10."
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2021,10/10,This movie is one of the best have seen in a while. Shows how we can all live together in harmony. The story is very captivating not too much action but will definitely get you in your feelings. Again would recommend this movie.
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2021,10/10,"I decided to see the film because it starred Viggo Mortensen. I usually watch any production where he's in it, without any kind of filter. It happens to be what, for me, is his best performance."
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"This is my first ever IMDB review and I've had this app for over 10+ years! The Greenbook is that GOOD!! I wasn't expecting to be moved by the way I did with this movie. Its has everything you could ask for. Humor, sorrow, morals, a good lesson about life and great ending! I am just so impressed with everything about this movie! Kudos to the actors, producers, writers and everyone involved in creating such a fabulous movie. It is on my top 3 movies of all time!!!"
GREEN BOOK,7 April 2021,9/10,"First, I always love to watch movies about real life events. This story is fabulous to me. I was captivated with the great acting of Viggo. He looked and sounded like a real Italian. He made me laugh so much. I watched the movie twice in a row with great joy! The relationship that is growing between those two men is what makes that movie something to really enjoy and remembered. Thank you!"
GREEN BOOK,20 March 2021,8/10,"Firstly I must say I took to long to see this strongly movie, more than I wish... the contrast it is so big, all the time, but the end, thank God!! I was so excited and don't have idea if could happen..."
GREEN BOOK,21 October 2018,10/10,"This movie has it all......it's a true story done just right. The audience clapped and clapped when the movie ended and no one got up until the last credit rolled. It's hard to believe that this was 1962 and even more frightening to think that some of the behaviors in the movie are being duplicated today in this country. It's a movie that is worth seeing again and again, it's that good and realistic."
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,7/10,"It's a good movie, very well acted and directed, and with several quite funny moments; both main actors do a great job in my opinion. But the film does not surprise you, the story is not special and you end up with a bittersweet taste. Having won so many awards, I would have expected something more memorable, with some plot twist or unexpected scene near the end."
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2021,10/10,"A perfect movie - touching, funny and serious. It really made me laugh and cry more than once. The acting is wonderful, the relationship between the two and the storyline, is also very very good if not perfect."
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,9/10,"Green book is one of those movies, that really stick into your head after days you ve watched it. The 2 main characters are so well performed, and the chemistry between them is stunning. Through this very emotional and some times ''sad'' joyrney, the film manages to give many funny moments, which results it to be an emotional rollercoaster in the end."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,10/10,"Loved every second of the movie.
This masterpiece got me with all my emotions, joy and sadness but mostly joy.
Loved the connection between those two amazing characters. Just lovely!"
GREEN BOOK,25 July 2020,10/10,"I'd never heard of the Green Book until this film was promoted in 2018. I grew up as son of a judge, who was son of a judge in rural county in NE Arkansas. Arkansas roots going back to 1873. My first short story focused on young man running away, knowing that he'd be hanged for rape that he hadn't done. Black. I know racism well both in The South and elsewhere as well. This film is perfect in every way. It offers info and insight through magnificent writing, production, direction, and acting focused on layered characters and story. Couldn't be betta'. Betta' 'n butta'. I luvit' I do. Author J.P. Cunningham"
GREEN BOOK,5 February 2020,10/10,"Don must cure Tony of his racism and ignorance and Tony's job is to cure Don of his snobbery and emotional frigidity that it goes thoroughly in the right way up to the end of film. In an initial scene, Tony puts a couple of glasses in the bin because his wife has let two black workmen drink out of them. But the level of fanatical racism this implies pretty much vanishes when Tony meets Don. So their road trip to self-discovery begins, and we hold our breath for when the white boy racists inevitably show up, or for when Shirley wishes to use the white bathroom at those grand places where he has been booked to play.

I enjoyed it every minute."

GREEN BOOK,10 December 2018,10/10,"While the road was paved with bumps and those bumps weren't & aren't easily fixed, this is such a rich faith-in-humanity-restored movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,10/10,"The actors were amazing, that much that just following the whole story by a dialogue of these two great men, is so entertaining, smart and well done that you don't feel the 2 hrs duration of the movie. You just want to applause standing up at the end."
GREEN BOOK,28 December 2018,9/10,"This is my first review posted on IMDB however I feel compelled to write a review because I loved this film so much.
Warning to bigots: you may not enjoy this film. Thankfully we don't live in the 60's any more where the vast majority of people (mostly in the South) were staunch bigots, however unfortunately there are still enough bigots out there. That's why films like this are so important to make and watch. Granted, the bigots who should watch it the most won't, but the rest of us can enjoy our evolution as human beings.
My words may seem harsh, however the film confronts racism and bigotry in its ludicrous entirety. No need to get into the plot; that should be covered extensively by the plot synopsis. Suffice it to say the walls of race are broken down unexpectedly and the result is a beautiful display of humanity when things go right (that is to say when race is trumped by dignity).
The acting is superb. This film gets 9 out of 10 because I don't feel it's the best film I've ever seen, which I think should be reserved for a perfect 10, although it is damn close. There's a lot of great movies out there and this may not be the best of all time but is absolutely fantastic."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,9/10,"It was a long time ago I saw a film this moving! Funny, warm, serious, beautiful"
GREEN BOOK,8 February 2019,10/10,This film is an absolute must see! Amazing story line with even better performances. I expected this movie to be great based on the trailer and reviews but it exceeded these expectations.
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,10/10,"I'm not one to review movies because I'm not one who can put thoughts into words easily.
My mom asked me if I wanted to see ""Green Book"" on the afternoon of the Oscars because it was nominated for Best Picture. I was so happy I went because the chemistry between the two men could be felt as the movie progressed, and the development of the relationship was amazing. Mahershala Ali is so deserving of his Oscar, as is Viggo of his nomination.
As other reviewers have said, the depiction of what life was like in the 1960s was well played as you feel disgusted at some parts, but then Tony makes you laugh with his no-nonsense view of life and Dr. Shirley's reactions to it. It's a must-see"
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,"Excellent true story, excellent acting! Both of the primary actors were phenomenal! Light humor throughout, in a story about the prejudice in the 1960's."
GREEN BOOK,10 November 2018,8/10,"Watching the friendship build between an uneducated racist white Italian and a well educated master black musician was entertaining and heart warming. And all the more poignant knowing it is based on a true story. At one point there is a discussion between the two about the wisdom of peaceful versus violent reaction to racism, a timely lesson or reminder for us all to hear in a time when an entire political party is being hijacked with extremist views (the press are our enemy, the Honduran caravan is an invasion, and ""there were good people on both sides"")."
GREEN BOOK,25 March 2019,9/10,I really loved this movie needs to be taught in american history classes.
GREEN BOOK,20 October 2019,10/10,"A wonderful movie about prejudice, friendship and values!"
GREEN BOOK,23 August 2019,8/10,There are good movies and there are bad movies. But some movies are such they are straight and simple but yet touches your heart. You dont get bored a second while watching them but you feel sad when the movie ends as you know that your wonderful journey has ended. Both lead actors have done a great acting and each and every element of the movie is properly placed. Highly recommended.
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,10/10,Really enjoyed this film; excellent from start to finish👍

GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,10/10,"Thats real cinem. True story, awesome chemistry between actors. I hope to get Oscars"
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,9/10,"Just got back from a secret screening of this movie. Never heard of it before this evening, when the title came up I had no idea what it was about. And sometimes that's the best way, no preconceptions to influence your experience.
This film is brilliant, if you get the chance to see it when it comes out on general release, go.
It's based on a true story, about an Italian American who is employed as the driver for an African American classical pianist on a tour of venues in the Deep South in 1962. A time when racial prejudice and segregation was rife, so much so, they were given a guide book of places ""coloured"" people were allowed to eat, sleep etc. And even though that sounds like it's going to be a gritty story, it was really funny too."
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,10/10,"I definitely loved this movie! It was a surprise to me because I didn't expect to see such a great story with remarkable characters. The whole movie caught my attention from start to finish. Very touching, original and deserved a oscar indeed!"
GREEN BOOK,25 October 2020,9/10,"Very good presentation of exclusion, and the fight of being different."
GREEN BOOK,21 January 2019,10/10,There is not so much to say about this movie.You should watch this.You will be impresed so much and It's so much fun to watch viggo in this role.Great acting.
GREEN BOOK,26 December 2018,10/10,"Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley.
Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses.
This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect."
GREEN BOOK,17 March 2019,10/10,"Great movie. I have not been a movie goer for a very long time, unless one really catches my attention. I am a white over 60 female from the midwest. I read a lot, so I know what the Green Book is/was.
And I saw myself in Tony, even with a black daughter in law and a (30 year) Hispanic husband. People talk about we need to ""have the conversation about race"". This movie is a great place to start."
GREEN BOOK,27 January 2019,2/10,What would happen if Oprah Winfrey made Intouchables.
GREEN BOOK,29 July 2019,10/10,"This movie is great, it has a lot of elements in it. glad I saw it"
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,10/10,"I loved each and every second of this movie, words won't do justice. Do watch."
GREEN BOOK,22 November 2018,10/10,"The acting is simply amazing. Viggo and Mahershala stun in this drama/comedy, and boy is the comedy hilarious. I was laughing the entire time! Guilt and shame also took place. How could anyone treat another human like that? The flashes of hope are what we need to remember in this film. Stand up for yourself and respect others as well! Great film, going to see it again soon."
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2018,9/10,"Heartwarming, thought provoking, and surprisingly funny movie. The lead actors gave stellar performances. One of my top favorite movies of the year!"
GREEN BOOK,18 January 2021,10/10,I love this movie! They handles the subject with such grace and humour. I enjoyed every minute and I am already searching for my next victim to see the movie with me. The victim will be gratefull.
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,10/10,"You have to see this movie.
One of the best movie I have seen in my 29 years."
GREEN BOOK,9 January 2021,10/10,I absolutely loved this movie! Stunning acting by Wiggo. A must see!!
GREEN BOOK,30 December 2019,10/10,"In the scene at the end of the tour when Tony and the two members of the trio are drinking vodka shots in the dining room where Dr. Shirley is not allowed the Russian cello player explains why Dr.Shirley plays the Deep South since it's clearly not for money. He explains that 6 years ago in 1962 Nat King Cole was touring the South and was beaten up.
That being the case it would mean the year of this movie would be 1968, not the early 60's as depicted."
GREEN BOOK,21 February 2019,8/10,Sooo good! The thematic experience was phenomenal. Would recommend to anoybody. The story was absolutely breathtaking.
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,10/10,There is no enough stars in rating bar for this movie!!!

GREEN BOOK,22 April 2020,10/10,"What a film. Every moment of it is enjoyable, it is funny and and it has a powerful message. I have seen it 4 times, as I asked for my friends and family to see it with me. And they have enjoyed it too. Of course. Ali and Mortensen do their job amazingly. And let's not forget about the soundtrack, what a soundtrack. I only have good thought for this film, and I recommend it to everyone. You will love it!"
GREEN BOOK,26 February 2019,10/10,I watched this movie on the back of its Oscar success. And it did not disappoint.. The story is of two opposite characters finding alignment in a troubled time. Mahershala Ali's performance is as convincing as a concert pianist as it is warm towards Viggo Mortensen's Character. Best film I have seen in 2 years!
GREEN BOOK,18 April 2019,10/10,"Fantastic movie, must see. Viggo Mortensen and Marshala Ali are breathtaking"
GREEN BOOK,10 October 2019,10/10,"The film is that good it's made me want to write my first IMDB review. I would pay to watch it again. Brought out emotions in me very few films have. Laughter, anger and sadness. When a film can make you feel these emotions along with some expected predictions gone wrong, it's a perfect film for me. There wasn't one scene that wasn't necessary. Brilliant acting, writing and directing. There is only one race, the human race. Thanks for reading. Ciao for now."
GREEN BOOK,16 January 2019,10/10,"For today, simply good! If you are looking for a movie with a plot and good story line this is the one you want to see. Real life conversations between classes, races and humanity!"
GREEN BOOK,22 February 2019,8/10,"I didn't know whether to cry or smile at the end, such an amazing drama."
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,"This is the first review i write here. Me and my wife watched this movie and we simply loved it. All about it is great - the acting and contrast between the characters and their lives, the comedy, the special natural moments that developed their understanding about the world we all live in, the importance of humanity and why we need to stand together accepting our differences. The direction and production were great, really on top! This is a movie that everyone should see! Great work! 10/10"
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"Thats i like it.;) True story about black and white relationships. Different worlds met. Well played emotions which brought me great experience.
Short: Discovering a life of understanding."
GREEN BOOK,8 October 2019,9/10,"The film is very nice. The performances are great, the subject is great, and one of the screenwriters Tony Lip: D child's story even more beautiful, however, the film in the last scene, not Tony 's family members took part. The film draws you in its own atmosphere, and Dr. When Shirley's playing the piano, you're in the lounge, or when the police stop the car, you feel like the police are shedding light on you. In some scenes one cannot hold himself. Let's break our prejudices, friends, the movie is great!"
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,10/10,"This movie is literally one, if not the best movie i've ever watched ! Simply beautiful !!"
GREEN BOOK,2 February 2019,8/10,"The good
tasteful funny. Makes you laugh and feel good about doing it.likeable emotional characters that deal with relatable worldly struggles.good acting, nice camera workThe not so good
weak plot. The movie depicts a moment in main characters lives that is not transformative or having a significant meaning for the main characters. Nevertheless it was an enjoyable watch."
GREEN BOOK,16 December 2018,10/10,Amazing movie. Moving and meaningful. Beautifully portrayed perfection. Wonderful and touching.
GREEN BOOK,19 October 2019,10/10,"This movie is must see. No wonder that the film is in the main top 250 IMBD, and it has three Oscars. The actors are outstanding, the screenplay is wonderful. There are three majior subjects concerned in that movie, first is racial segregation, the second is the gap in cultural level between the main characters and the last, but not least is the friendship, overall the movie is genious. The jokes in the movie are smart, clever and funny, I laugh out loud,especially on Vigo Motensen's russian. In conclusion, the movie si entertaining, funny and it's worth the price. Thumb's UP."
GREEN BOOK,23 November 2018,6/10,"Right off the bat I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.the cinematography was beautiful with such rich color pallets. The score was wonderful and set the tone very well. Lastly the acting was incredible. Viggo and Ali shined in their roles and did a great job at portraying their characters.That said, in my mind the movie was nothing special. It was all very predictable and had a very similar feel to many other civil rights movies in which a black man and a white man start off the movie with a reluctant relationship and slowly warm up to each other as they begin to appreciate their similarities and eachothers troubles and eventually defy all social norms and become good friends. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have become friends because you can't rewrite history and this movie was based on a true story. I just wish that story telling was a bit more ambitious and delved into some of the ideas deeper rather thank making a well made but otherwise mediocre civil rights movie."
GREEN BOOK,26 March 2019,9/10,Movies is worth a watch .. You learn a lot and it is like a breeze
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2020,10/10,"Only got one thing to say!!! Watch it! If you want an fun friday night, this movie is absolutly one for you! You will feel fellings like happy, sad and angery, but that is a good thing 😁"
GREEN BOOK,23 June 2019,10/10,This movie is really good. It's realistic and has an amazing story.
GREEN BOOK,5 September 2020,10/10,It's the true life story with all the details perfectly described and reflected. Funny but with a taste sadness for the racism and unequal treatment of the black people. I enjoyed from the first minute until the last. Highly recommended!
GREEN BOOK,7 July 2020,10/10,Just watch this film 🎥 👌 😀 😍 👍 🎥 👌 😀 😍 👍 🎥 👌 😀 😍 🎥 👌 👍 👌 👍 👌
GREEN BOOK,21 November 2018,9/10,"You should definitely look out for this movie when Oscar season hits. It's a great look at racism in 1960s, showing the true story Doctor Donald Shirley (Ali), an African-American virtuoso, who is driven in the Deep South by Tony Valelonga (Mortensen), an Italian nightclub bodyguard/family man. Both give stellar performances and play off each other with perfect chemistry. The movie does a fantastic job of showing the sad truths of America in the 60s, while remaining not too preachy."
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2018,6/10,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the film....almost.
Did not realize until viewing that this true story of overcoming prejudice and segregation
comes at the expense of a cartoon version of the Italian goombah stereotype.In portraying the message of overcoming ignorance with dignity, the film doesn't practice what it preaches.
The Italian characters are forced to play in their own version of blackface."
GREEN BOOK,7 July 2019,5/10,"I am not surprised that nobody has mentioned the actual Green Book they used on the trip. Nobody knows about it and this movie didn't help them learn. The title was extremely misleading. It promised something it didn't even try to deliver. It's more about Don Shirley's tour in the south with Tony serving as his driver and bodyguard, basically. It was NOT about the Green Book. It missed the whole point. What an excellent opportunity to share what the Green Book was all about. Instead, they grazed over the purpose of that valuable book! With the violence they showed, they could have had later scenes with them wishing they'd consulted the book first, or learning what a sundown town was AFTER they went through the experience.While the movie seemed to try showing how harsh the times were (and did a fairly good job), it seemed too bent on fixing it with a counterbalance somewhere else. I think there should have been more concern about following the ""rules"" of The South--once they realized they existed, so they could stay out of trouble. Instead, they treated the situations almost as if they were just odd instances of racism.With all that said, it was easy for me to know what was coming in many cases, but it was a very enjoyable movie, and the end--the last phrase spoken--was PERFECT.I penalized the movie 5 stars for having a misleading title (which was very important in this situation), and I gave the movie 5 stars for being enjoyable."
GREEN BOOK,11 December 2018,9/10,"Synopsis:I loved that this was a real story.Though setup in a familiar buddy copy style with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the film is funny, poignant, upsetting, and fantastic all at once, driven largely by the strength of the performances and screenplay.If you like good acting or true stories, you should go see this."
GREEN BOOK,24 November 2018,10/10,Great movie a not-to-be-missed movie! Absolutely excellent acting storyline characters all great!!
GREEN BOOK,5 December 2018,10/10,"Watched it in UK as one of the Cineworlds secret screening, didn't know what's the movie about at the start and I refused to google. Turns out to be a great movie, very touching, reminded us about the history, expressed the fact in this day and age the kind of racism and homophobia we've seen in the 60s still exists are just simply not acceptable. Great movie"
GREEN BOOK,2 October 2020,10/10,"Centered around Don Shirley's tours in the Deep South States, this motion picture follow the interaction of two completely opposing characters, the well-educated, soft spoken and mannered Dr Shirley and his bodyguard, driver Tony Vallelonga. This kind of movies usually rely on the interaction between the main characters, and, in this case, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver nothing short of perfection. Throughout the movie, you can see them evolving to adapt to the other, while creating numerous cases of situational comedy.
Shirley's motivation behind these tours was to show, through his art, that race is not correlated with intelligence and class. It is also showcased how racism can leave deep wounds even to a well accomplished person, who ends up feeling an outcast.
This movie manages to have multiple strong messages without shoving them into your face, which makes it good both for the moments when you are looking for meaning in a movie and for the nights when you want to watch a movie before going to bed. It is definitely a must see."
GREEN BOOK,6 January 2019,10/10,"Good story, great movie from begin till end!! Good players and nice acting work and!!"

GREEN BOOK,6 September 2019,10/10,It's a great story I didn't know it was based on a true story that made much more interesting
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,9/10,Definitely deserve my 9-star evaluation for the inspiring story and exquisite acting.
GREEN BOOK,7 January 2019,10/10,"I loved this movie for its portrayal of our society outside the urban areas and the treatment of minorities. However, while it has humorous moments, I cannot understand calling it a comedy! I hate when a movie has this designation and the audience thinks it obligatory to guffaw at things that are ironic or smile worthy. breaking the mood and the atmosphere for other, more sophisticated viewers."
GREEN BOOK,22 March 2019,10/10,With out a doubt one of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. Really funny and well preformed all they way by all the actors.
GREEN BOOK,8 January 2019,10/10,"In 2018, the year filled with barely average crowdpleasers and blockbusters, it is hard to find a truly moving movie experience, one that doesn't make you seek the picture's redeeming qualities, instead offering a clean experience based on simplicity and great character arcs and performances.Without paying much attention to the filmmakers' prior work, I was surprised by Green Book and charmed by its simplistic but masterfully crafted story and tone. It is hard for moviegoers not to get fed up with overly simplified and dumbed down narratives; however, Green Book proves that a complex story isn't a prerequisite for a well-made movie. The narrative is very well structured, the main story arc is the journey, the tour across the Deep South and the bonding of two apparently very different people with very different worldviews. Each scene is meaningful as it introduces a new element to the narrative, or gives a satisfying and positive conclusion to a previously presented problem. The movie is well-paced and each scene is perfectly self-contained, but it adds to the main arc of the characters' journey. It never focuses on one particular encounter for too long, but it never feels rushed.The two main characters are extraordinary. Tony (Mortensen) is easily understood and it doesn't take much screen time for him to sink in. We meet the man through his habits and the way that he talks, thinks and interacts with the world. The best kind of characterisation isn't done by putting the characters in dramatic situations and offering them difficult choices; it is better to let the viewers observe them in everyday situations. Ali's character Don is far more complex at first, which makes sense in the narrative as he is the exact opposite of Tony. Even though he observes the world from above, he rarely seems cruel or egocentric. His goal is to change the world's view of his people by the courageous act of doing the tour in a part of America where coloured people aren't as welcome. Even though his behaviour is highly sophisticated, he learns the joy of letting go of his routines and narrowminded beliefs. The discovery of newfound freedom brings him positivity and eventually the cure to his self-inflicted loneliness. Being different or deeming oneself better than others isn't a permanent solution to one's social position. The problem is deepened even further by racial stereotypes, as he proves that coloured people shouldn't have been treated as those of lesser value. He both stands up to segregation and develops understanding for the people he considers his own. After the two-hour long journey, Tony accepts Don as no different than his own people and resolves his inner conflict of racial acceptance showing that he's also grown as a person.Recently/In the intervening years, racial discrimination has become a progressively more present subject. Most movies tend to show the most brutal sides of racism and hardships of the lives of coloured people. Green Book doesn't force us to feel sorry for them; it helps us understand the pain and disgrace discrimination inflicts on an outstanding individual as well as on the entirety of people. It isn't brutal, but humiliating and unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable. The important theme is present in a lighthearted manner, but it still sinks in deep and provokes thought.Green Book is visually fantastic as it maintains a simple aesthetic and the visuals of the 60s without becoming overly stylized or too raw and bland. The score is fitting, and the piano pieces are as unique as they are described in the story. Overall it's some of the best movie experiences if not the best of 2018, and I would recommend it to both quality movie lovers and people seeking a simple smart comedy with a heartwarming tone and message."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"Just wonderful, it's nice to feel uplifted by a film for a change."
GREEN BOOK,16 May 2020,10/10,"This is the kind of film that stays with you for a long time, it has a calm and serene vibe that keeps you hooked and takes you to a very calm place.
The acting is real, the bond between the leads is phenomenal..
Emotional, funny & mesmerizing - all in one !!"
GREEN BOOK,4 February 2019,9/10,"Just sit down and see this movie.
A good story, containing multiple layers and told in a beautiful way. The acting is very well done by both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. I'm not going to spoil anything, but if you see the trailer, you pretty much have a good idea of the tone and feel of the movie.If you're a true movie fan, or if you're just tired of pixels beeing thrown at your face for 2 hours, go and see it immediately. The movie will stick with you and it will make an impact, one way or another."
GREEN BOOK,18 November 2019,10/10,This is a wonderful movie. Splendid. I really enjoyed this movie.
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,10/10,"Despite ongoing term finals at university, many of my friends are watching this movie and talking about it (some of them watched it multiple times; some even called it one of their favorites). All those buzz got my hopes up and I started to expect a masterpiece, and I was not disappointed. It felt like looking through a timeless window at a broken society clinging to false traditions. There were funny moments, and also moments which would motivate anyone. I would keep two such motivational quotes forever fresh in my mind. I believe anyone watching this film would find their own favorites.Nick Vallelonga did a good job with the script. I looked him up and found some stories regarding his apology for an old Islamophobic tweet. If everyone gives up their ego and tries a little more to banish all hatred / prejudice, a few years later, even 2019 would feel like a dark past. For which, the motivations derived from this film, I believe, can work as magic. Yes, I agree that genius is not enough, that it takes courage to win hearts. Yes, I also realise that the world is full of lonely people waiting for someone else to take the first move. We have to act out of friendship and love without waiting for the other party to do it firdt. We have to be courageous enough to stand up for ourselves, and to share our genius in such a manner that it breaks the walls that isolate us. Life is too small to stay in our own islands, afraid to take action to reduce distances. And for that, we have to forsake arrogance or violence, for temper tantrum will only cost us our loss - to win, we have to protect our dignity and stay civil even in the face of unjust humiliation.Now, without spoiling much, I would like to analyze a couple scenes. If you are reading this, thanks a lot for reading a review brain-dumped by a humble being. Please stop reading right now if you haven't watched the movie yet.The KFC scene was humorous and heart-warming. The best part was that Dr. Shirley made Tony drive back and pick up the plastic cup he had thrown up, showing that littering should not be tolerated. Mother earth deserves all the care we can give her - and she deserves more than that - she deserves action; the thought is not the only thing that matters in this case. I thought that this is it, but I had to brace myself for more - since it's a long ride, and we have just started.Also, during the return drive, a cop followed their car. This scene was important. It showed that the police are not the bad guys - no particular group ( profession, race, gender, religion, etc. ) can be incriminated by the act of some of them. If we keep hating entire groups for some people's fault, we'll end up hating the entire humanity, and it's not worth it, for love brings life, and hatred takes it away."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,10/10,"This movie deserves 100 stars. Fantastic story, excellent acting."
GREEN BOOK,14 April 2019,10/10,"This movie is a piece of art, i loved it.I recomend it.The scenes ,the actors,the inside jokes are just perfect."
GREEN BOOK,29 November 2018,1/10,White-washed view of what this would've really been like with two stereotypes as the primary roles.
GREEN BOOK,7 December 2018,10/10,"Very much entertained with this great movie, one of the best I have seen in a while
Thank you for this unforgettable movie xxx"
GREEN BOOK,30 March 2019,10/10,"Amazing movie, funny , sad , brilliant!
Best movie I saw in the last 5 years
It is highly recommended!"
GREEN BOOK,3 December 2021,4/10,"This movie is more theatre than a movie, if you like that go for it but if your fan of realistic movies, skip this one. I found it hard to get through every minute as it was far from reality, quite the disappointment."
GREEN BOOK,5 January 2019,10/10,This movie is simply a breath of fresh air. Amazing
GREEN BOOK,28 November 2018,10/10,"Excellent movie. Touches so many of of our current national issues. Comedy,pathos et all. Must see for all."
GREEN BOOK,3 April 2019,6/10,"The main theme is apperently about racism, and what afro-americans had to deal with in the 60's. But somehow, this movie portraits what the white man, Tony, had to sacrifice on Shirley's behalf."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,7/10,"Theme may be used before, but still, this movie has great actors and good story, worth seeing."
GREEN BOOK,8 January 2019,,We watch movies in search of movies like this. It is outstanding!
GREEN BOOK,29 September 2020,10/10,"Fair dinkum, I loved this movie. This is the sort of movie that deserves to be seen in a cinema as a shared experience with three hundred other people rather than alone with my cat. The sheer joy of the ending had me standing to my feet and crying. Brilliantly written, directed and acted."
GREEN BOOK,31 December 2018,10/10,"Done to perfection,from a guy like me, growing up In the streets of the Bronx, going to the Copacabana, NY in the 60's, the Peppermint Lounge, Roundtable, seeing Little Richard, Bobby Rtdell, Fats Domino, it's all in the ""green book"", it's a hoot, especially if you love Italians and a home cooked Xmas Italian meal....
Run to see, it's a gift you will talk about for a long time!"
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,9/10,"Green Book was an amazing movie. The acting, storyline, and overall story captivated me in many ways. The Oscar wins were so deserved."
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,3/10,"They keep trying to redempt the white guy the whole movie. Also funny how a Nick Vallelonga's tweet came up supporting Trump and Muslims banishment, even though the star of his movie is Mahershala, a Muslim. By the way, Mahershala is one of the few good things about the movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 January 2019,10/10,Great actors with a wonderful script ! It was so nice and enjoyable to see people at their best and not their worst!
GREEN BOOK,6 February 2019,10/10,You know when you want to watch some good movie and you play a movie and then you want to jump from your body out and screem out loud how great movie is and how you feel happy and happy and happy!!!!! That is how this movie makes you! THANK YOU FOR THIS STORY!!!!
GREEN BOOK,12 January 2019,10/10,"This movie is absolut stunning!
😍😍😍😍I loved it"
GREEN BOOK,16 February 2019,,"A wonderful story, exquisitely told and brought to life, highlighting the importance and magnitude of the simple act of kindness. Uplifting and powerful and a film I won't ever forget."
GREEN BOOK,12 December 2018,10/10,"Deserves to be Academy award nominated as best film of the year. Spectacular plot and superb acting. A reversal of ""Driving Miss Daisy"". You cannot miss this movie."
GREEN BOOK,30 January 2019,10/10,"This movie is really amazing! Story with a full of possitive fight for the negativities of the people. Motivatied one wich making push up in behavior, education and the most importent mind Love it❣ going to watch again"
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2019,10/10,"Green Book is proof that there is still hope for Hollywood after all. Through Scorsese-like storytelling, the film explores the good and the bad of the '60s in America. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver captivating performances. A true must-see film, hopefully it will dominate the award season."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"A great perfomance, it is an entertaining and funny movie. Good job!"
GREEN BOOK,31 August 2019,10/10,This movie simply made me cry and laugh at the same time.
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,2/10,"Slow ponderous cliche of a film..I thought mortesen who is one of my favorite actors of all time, totally miscast.. His accent was from no Italian Bronx nieghbourhood..He looked like he trying to act Italian not be Italian..The family was again a cliche of actors from central castingUltimately for such an important message in a passage of history it was boring and utterly predictable"
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,10/10,"The movie was amazing, it touched my feelings and make me laugh a lot, is soft and easy to watch and enjoy"
GREEN BOOK,16 March 2019,9/10,Not very often do you come across a movie that is so well written and well cast. I enjoyed every moment of The Green Book and hated to see it end. This movie makes you feel and makes you think. I truly enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it hifhly.
GREEN BOOK,10 December 2020,10/10,"I can't express how much this movie means.At first when I saw the cover picture I though that it was gonna be a boring movie about two friends in the road, but u was wrong. This movie covers on so make aspects whose value we sometimes forget. It touches the theme of race in a very impressive way; it it hard and real which creates an impact on the viewer, bit also subtle and discrete which makes it a factor you learn not to avoid. It shows that oppression is a human thing by this i mean that unlike other movies that show racism and/or colorism, this one makes you see it deeper.that oppression can be done by anyone to anyone and at the same time that pattern are sometimes broken and that some things can only be unexpected. This movie taught me about dignity, something i had long forgotten about as rarely hear the word. It reminded me that like don shirley i should stand for myself and that that action has a value that speaks higher than other things. With tears in my eyes i finished watching the movie, the ending shows the true gestures of friendships and it is a reminder that there is good people there, it is really impressive to see don shirley out himself out there with the risk of being hurt time after times, in that regard i can only look up to him for I like most people lack that courage in the heart. To finalize, please give this movie a chance, you will not regret it, thank you for reading."
GREEN BOOK,18 September 2019,9/10,"Emotions will rise up from deep in your gut and swell in your heart as you follow the story of a famous black concert pianist, one who oozes culture and dignity with every move he makes and word he speaks. Paired with a lowly educated tough-guy Italian-American driver, you have the perfect multi-layered juxtaposition as they make their way on a concert tour in the deep south of the early sixties.Neither come away unchanged.Nor will the viewer if they're paying the least bit of attention.The thing to remember is it's based on a true story. Well worth watching!"
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,10/10,I never write reviews but this movie was amazing. I haven't seen a good movie in the theaters in awhile so this was refreshing. I loved it. Definitely my favorite movie
GREEN BOOK,23 February 2019,10/10,The film was fantastic. Probably the best film I've watched in a while.
GREEN BOOK,5 June 2021,10/10,"I would place this film in my top 10 movies I've ever watched. It's funny, touching, and at times dramatic. A film everyone should watch especially teens who may have some wrongful views about people of different color. The acting was superb and the story itself even better."
GREEN BOOK,27 March 2019,9/10,Seems to be historical inaccuracies near end where Oleg character states that 6 years previously in 1966 Ray Charles was assaulted in Memphis. That would mean the tour took place in 1972 which would make it difficult for Robert Kennedy to get them released from jail as he was assassinated in 1968.
GREEN BOOK,7 February 2020,10/10,Breath taking story from start to the ens. One of the best story plots and actings i have ever seen. Filled with emotions! Must seen!
GREEN BOOK,7 September 2021,8/10,"Green Book is undoubtedly a great movie with powerful themes of racism, friendship, identity and love. The film examines the history of racism in America, showing the ways that institutions and people can think they are progressive when they are in fact holding onto racist and bigoted beliefs. The film also seeks to show and pick apart different preconceptions and stereotypes about race; for instance, Tony is surprised to hear that Don does not know popular black music of the era, nor has he ever had fried chicken, a stereotypically black food item.The film does a great job at showing the juxtaposition of the two leads. Having the white character act more stereotypically 'black' and vice versa to an intersting dynamic between the two which makes the story a lot more entertaining. The friendship feels really genuine and earned and I ultimately finished the movie feeling really satisfied."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2019,3/10,Nothing special. I didn't like it at all. Very boring movie.
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,"It really made my day after watching this movie. It made me know there is indeed a real friendship in this world, very inspiring movie. Good one, I laughed, I cried, I got sad, I felt amazing while watching this movie."
GREEN BOOK,10 July 2019,10/10,"I really enjoyed this movie. This story was very powerful, from the writing, the casting, the cinematography, to the overall message of never making assumptions about someone and their talent and abilities based on what they look like. Mahershala does a very transformative job in this piano-playing star role."
GREEN BOOK,4 December 2018,9/10,Great movie loved how both actors did a great job. Recommend to watch. Love how the friendship starts.
GREEN BOOK,3 March 2019,10/10,The movie is really good and u just keep glued to it . The portrayal is outstanding
GREEN BOOK,20 January 2019,8/10,"Loved this movie with its easy charm. Both leads are excellent, Ali as the snooty classical musician who holds Mortensen, pitch perfect New York Italian family-man, to very high standards as his role-reversal driver. It's the US in the early 1960's, they travel through the deep South, so plenty of racially-generated material. Brilliant dialogue, the friendship is nicely developed."
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2021,8/10,"For its humanistic, anti-racialist message-the elementary notion that white and black people can get along-Green Book has been well received by audiences."
GREEN BOOK,2 April 2019,9/10,"We had so much fun watching this movie.
Great actors, and very interesting story about bad times in the US.
I recommend this movie, must see!"
GREEN BOOK,15 March 2019,10/10,Hands down one of the best movies i've seen this year and it on all honesty deserves 100% an Oscar. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen both deserves Oscar for this excellent movie good job.
GREEN BOOK,19 January 2020,10/10,"This is, to say the least, the best movie I have seen in a long while!"
GREEN BOOK,20 June 2019,9/10,"I loved the movie
great story , well written , spectacular actors
amazing night spent with that movie
highly recommended movie ............"
GREEN BOOK,18 January 2019,8/10,"This is not a typical road movie, funny in parts, hard to accept in others.Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken. Viggo Mortensen brilliant performance."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,10/10,"What the world needs now! Human beings who inspire, simply by their experiences a colorful, musical and beautiful world.
Which movie parts are really good? All of them !!!!"
GREEN BOOK,28 June 2019,10/10,"Great story both the wife and I were thoroughly entertained. Writing, directing and acting all excellent."
GREEN BOOK,28 January 2019,10/10,"This film was great from the start, a high standard of acting acted well depicted. I would highly recommend 👍"
GREEN BOOK,12 March 2019,9/10,"A pure enjoyable funny movie, not a comedy, but amusing to see
Great chemistry from the Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the contrast of their characters were really visible. Tough guy Tony whose horizon was broadened by Dr. Shirley at the same time Dr. Shirley learns to be a more lose. It shows growth on both characters, that both people can learn from each other no matter how different they are."
GREEN BOOK,10 February 2019,8/10,"Wow! In this age of special effects and CGI heavy superhero films, it's a relief to know Hollywood is still capable of producing a heartwarming, heartbreaking film! Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of stereotypically Italian Tony seemed a little cheesey and clichéd to begin with, but he grew on me. Mahershala Ali gave an absolutely mind blowing acting performance! If he is not at least nominated for an academy award for his portrayal of Dr. Don Shirley then something is seriously wrong with the Oscar's screening process!"
GREEN BOOK,11 February 2019,7/10,"A film with Poignant, evocative and challenging moments, marred only by a couple of elements that were a little trite. It wasn't necessary to include a 'not all cops' plot point, or to add the more jolting comedy elements. I'm not sure how the 'Tittsburgh' joke made it through the editing process, but it's undeniable that the performances from Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen make Green Book well worth a watch."
GREEN BOOK,1 March 2019,9/10,"""The world is full of lonely people waiting to make the first move."""
GREEN BOOK,15 February 2019,9/10,"A great story about the relationship between race and race, race and individual. The background of the story is the eve of civil rights movements."
GREEN BOOK,10 March 2019,9/10,A feel good movie and thought provoking. It enables the viewer to realize the life of an individual who already has achieved all the game and glory in life but still lacks content in his life. And also how a person changes his perspective over a long journey.
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,10/10,"One of my favorite films! A pleasure to watch from beginning to end. Amazing actors, very well written script and a beautiful story. Great depth and comedy. I was smiling the entire time. It should win best picture and Mortensen for best actor. His character was simply the best- hilarious personality and mannerisms. Much to think about and take away from this film. I loved it, and wish Hollywood made more like this one."
GREEN BOOK,19 February 2019,10/10,Loved this one! Would recomend this one for everyone that's older than 10 years old.
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,10/10,"An exciting film. Translated by the talent of the main actors, making each scene an invitation to let us be and appreciate .."
GREEN BOOK,19 March 2019,10/10,This movie has to be one of the best I have seen in the recent past. The subtle direction with extraordinary acting with it's wonderful story line will surely touch audiences of all ages emotionally.
GREEN BOOK,20 February 2019,9/10,"An amazing movie, Being based on true story makes it more and more amazing."
GREEN BOOK,24 February 2019,8/10,"I will start by saying there was some brilliant acting however - a lot of historical inaccuracies.Dr Don Shirley was very active in the civil rights movement and actually marched with Dr King at SelmaHe knew lots of black Jazz musicians and they were friends . He knew Duke Ellington can't get more black than him.He was not estranged from his family. He had three brothers also all Drs - (one medical or maybe two) and they talked all the time.He came from an upper class family who are of Jamaica descent, there is no way he saw Tony as anything but his employee, saw straight through that one as soon as the film started. Though I'm sure they had a mutual respect for one another.I guess creativity is part of what the movie industry does, but it would have been nice if some more of it actually paralleled his life.Also, the green book could have been explored more since that was the title of the film and it was very important, providing lists of safe, welcoming, nice accommodations, also overlooked in the film.I begining to sound like a film critic. Still enjoyed it though but I feel they missed a chance to educate."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,,I admit I haven't seen the movie but the plot description sounds exactly like Flugelman's Cochise movie.
GREEN BOOK,27 February 2019,8/10,"One of the best movies, I've seen lately! Give it a try, you won't regret later in life."
GREEN BOOK,4 March 2019,7/10,"Green Book is a well-directed movie with great acting not only in the main characters but in my opinion it is lacking some detail and therefore depth in the story. While addressing the on going race issue (as such an important topic especially nowadays) it would have been nice to see the focus on Dr.Shirley and his very moving & mysterious character instead of giving too many (unnecessary) details about Tony-the white guy. To me, this makes the movie less credible in the way that it attempts to address the racial issue but appears to be making some mistakes in that agenda itself.
Nevertheless and as I said, it is a good movie about great persons."
GREEN BOOK,25 February 2019,10/10,"An amazing true story film showing that the color, race, cast does not define anyone's morality, knowledge or behavior.
The story is about a Black America pianist and composer who travels to the south of American in 60's with his Italian-american friend.
Writer, director and producer nailed every aspect of this biography.
Marvelous performance from entire crew not to forget Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were terrific in this movie.
Overall the movie is incredible a perfect combination of Drama and Comedy."
GREEN BOOK,18 March 2019,10/10,One of the greatest movie that i had the chance to see.
GREEN BOOK,8 March 2019,10/10,"Just to keep this review short, i'll jump straight to the point. An authentic atmosphere, beautifully developed characters, a storyline that lacks gaps and just fluidly and smoothly develops throughout the movie. As some, who doesn't particular find any sexually related humor, anything but funny, this movie was able to not only put a smile on my face, but rather laugh out loud. Although, themes like segregation and racism are being touched (i guess it would be inevitably considering the time that the story is being told in and our main character), the overall movie remains light and funny.
If you sick and tired of pictures constantly manifesting violence and gore, just give this one a try. Life is not always the way we think about it, even back in the days, where hate was winning over love, some people managed to find a light at the end of the tunnel."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,10/10,"The reason why I gave this masterpiece 10 stars is for many reasons. Viggo, Aragon. His portrayal of a man from The Bronx was perfect. Mr Ali, such an honour to watch him act. Supporting actor at the Oscars. Wow. The message, the hate and love. I bought my new lady tickets to watch this not knowing anything other than Mr Suportting Actor and Aragon was in it. What an absolute treat."
GREEN BOOK,28 February 2019,9/10,"This movie has it all, marvellous acting, an interesting story, a little bit of history, humor, seriousness when needed and overall leaves you with a feeling of warmth and satisfaction. I especially liked the way the relationship between the two main characters was portraited, it was very realistic."
