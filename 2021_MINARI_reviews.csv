MINARI,7 October 2021,5/10,"MINARI is a film that won all the plaudits but failed to engage with me as a viewer; I found it really didn't have much to say for itself, which explains the abrupt ending. It's just a simple slice-of-life story with not much in the way of character arcs. The film explores a Korean family striving to make a go of things in 1980s Arkansas, and is well acted throughout by the entire cast - Will Patton is a particular scene-stealer - with a lot of weighty dialogue and small conflict between the characters. Other than that, I found it quite average."
MINARI,1 September 2021,8/10,"It's 1983. Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to rural Arkansas where the father dreams of growing Korean vegetables and grab a piece of the American dream. His wife has massive doubts. The couple works hard sexing chicks. Their son has heart problems. The wife's mother arrives to take care of the kids. The family is befriended by religious fanatic Paul. It's a struggle on many fronts.It's the classic immigrant struggle and it's as compelling as ever. It feels real. It feels personal. It just feels. It's a movie with all the feelings. It's funny, sad, intense, and light-hearted. All the performances are great and they all feel real."
MINARI,12 August 2021,6/10,"""Minari"" is an American movie that was released in 2020 already, but because of the pandemic, it took until fairly recently for the film to get here to the middle of Europe, so I could finally enjoy it on a big screen. Well, enjoy slightly under half of it I could say because this was when the showing had to be stopped because of heavy rainfall, but I managed to finish the film at home. It stays under the two-hour mark, but still a fairly long film overall. The key cast is relatively small, basically the people you see on the photo here (plus the grandmother), even if the daughter does not have that much screen time either, at least the boy is more at the center of it all story-wise. But I will get to that a little later. The writer and director here is Lee Isaac Chung. Many think of him as a newcomer, but this is not really the case. He is neither particularly young nor lacking experience. More of a massive breakthrough for him with this movie because it reached way more attention than everything else he did before, probably even than everything else take taken together. Barely anybody had heard his name before this year you could say. His movie here was really one of the biggest awards players all season winning over 100 awards and being nominated (without winning) for another over 200. Massive amount. The biggest win was maybe the Oscar for supporting actress Yuh-Jung Youn and also some of the other awards she took home. The actress started her career 50 years ago, so nice anniversary with the movie that also turned her into a star internationally. Asian audiences may know her very well, even if approximately one film per year is not that much. Back to director Chung, he may roots similar to the characters in here, but he was born in America, this movie takes place entirely in America and there are also always segments in the English language. Which is why it did not contend at the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Feature. Might have been a tougher category for the Danish entry otherwise.As for the cast, I already mentioned one protagonist by name, but there are others. About Yeri Han (the mother) and Noel Cho (the daughter) I cannot say too much. However, the little boy is played by Alan S. Kim and he was even nominated for a BAFTA. Debatable if he is supporting, but it's an ensemble cast performance you could say. The BAFTAs certainly loved that little movie. Kim also has lots of screen time here and in the end even gets a little, maybe slightly rushed-inclusion linked to his health that has not been elaborated on before. And of course I must mention Steven Yeun. His success story from playing a rather beta character on The Walking Dead into becoming really the one cast member that managed the by far most successful big screen character is nothing short of impressive. His Oscar nomination here, even with some precursor attention, came as a but of a surprise and same is true about Chung's nomination for directing. But back to Yeun, I am not sure if I think he gives one of the best five mal leading performances of the year, probably not, but he definitely has his moments. The scene when he talks to the boy about what happens to male chickens was really nicely handled. Also his struggles in terms of leading his family in a new country were nicely portrayed. This includes the conflicts between him and his wife, but also other scenes like when he is about to punish his son for a little prank he pulled on his grandmother. He strives to be the head of the family and a leader, but maybe it's not really in his genes. Also how he dealt with new people, new cultures, new traditions was an interesting watch. I must of course mention the fella who carries the cross out there. Yep, the American countryside is still really religious. And surely was back then. This film is set in the 1980s as we find out for example through a mention that Reagan is PotUS. But as for Yeun, I probably would have preferred him being nominated for Burning (Beoning), but it's okay. Walking Dead fans can be happy too with him coming back for an episode, so seems as if he did not forget about his first successes, even if he acted a long time before that already.The movie basically uses some solid formulas. It is never really in your face or too over-the-top, but a quiet character study for the most part and usually quietly convincing. The one big exception is the massive fire near the end, which really poses a threat to everybody. But even there the family sticks together and everybody adds their own share of support, so they somehow make it out not just alive, but even stronger. This includes the parents, but also the grandparents and the children too. A lot of the film is about socializing. They show us how the father bonds with a new slightly nerdy colleague or how the mother makes a potential new friend at her chicken sexing profession. I never really thought about that too much. A job I would hate to make. You're basically playing God with chickens' lives. But I guess somebody has to do it. Then there is the boy making friends with one of the local boys. The latter still looks at him in a confused way earlier that you cannot be sure if he sees him as a potential friend or really dislikes him, but in general the family is accepted in a friendly way by everybody. Like there's two big American ladies there too and on one occasion they talk about how cute they find the tiny slim Asian woman. Of course, you could see some racism in that as well, but this is not the film's objective. Probably because it is about Asian immigrants and not African Americans. With the latter, it feels as if they always have to get in something like that and make powerful statements on tolerance or show evil fascists, otherwise a film cannot be complete. Well, I am glad they did not with this film here. There's enough other quality stuff elaborated on. Take for example the argument between the parents near the end when it comes to their shared (or not shared) future and what impact the situation in the new country has on their love relationship too. But yeah with the local boy we also realize he is harmless when the Asian boy suggests he wants to sleep over with his new friend. Or when the man's colleague is around to have dinner with the Asian family and everybody is super nice and friendly. This is not a film about racism or anything. Thank God.Then we have Yuh-Jung Youn. Talked about her early on already and while I am not sure if she was really Oscar-deserving, I think she really made her mark with this film. Early on, she gets in some nicer and lighter moments, but towards the end, it is also a serious role. Like we see her immediately after her stroke how she is lying there on the ground and it is heartbreaking to see her unable to speak. Or how she is disabled eventually and cannot move her arm, but still tries all she can to help her family. Help her daughter for example with doing the housework. And also sad how what she does eventually results in the fire. But there is no blame or talk about how they want to send her into a retirement home or something. On the contrary: The pretty much last line is about how the old woman chose a good spot to plant the minari. So the film is named after an Asian plant. I guess this final scene is also a key reason why the movie is named like that and you could certainly make a connection and see the place where the minari is rooted now is closely linked to where the family is rooted now and that they belong there and that also the mother decided to stay with her man. It's okay. I could have thought of other, potentially better titles, but this one fits too. Kinda fitting that the German long title even includes the German terms for ""roots"". So yeah, back to the grandmother character: It was a bit unsure if she would live in the end, but she does and they did not make the film really depressing. Still her health is deteriorating, but the son's health is getting better with his heart irregularity, so definitely a feel-good moment when the doctor informs them about it. One this movie needed maybe as well. But the boy and the grandmother also bring some food-good essence earlier. He clearly does not like her, even says so explicitly on one occasion and the pee prank is pretty telling too, but she has a good heart and forgives him quickly and does not want him to be beaten. He is also a little cheeky one with how he gets a rod that could never hurt him in any way or also how his father is so over the moon about hos smart he is or how he makes a little pee joke after the scene when he bonds with his grandmy finally when she says how strong he is.Of course, the clashing of Asian and American culture was also funny here and there. Be it talking about obese people (luckily, they did not try to deliver a fat-shaming message here, but it was all harmless) or the aforementioned religion inclusion or the old lady watching American wrestling and thinking it was all real (of course, in her country it is very real. I could say sumo, but that is more of a Japanese tingey than Korean). It's a smart and interesting movie and character study or I could say characters study because everybody gets sufficient screen time and elaboration and the attention to detail is also good. Soundtrack, i.e. Score, is also nice and I am not surprised it got nominated for an Oscar. Another multiculti inclusion if I look at the composer's name. So yeah, basically really nothing wrong with this film at all. Still I must say I also cannot really include it into my biggest favorites from 2020 and something was missing from that. There was not really a moment where I felt that the film had a chance to get a 4 out of 5 from me unfortunately, so I definitely think it is a bit overrated and the awards were also exaggerated. But luckily, there were also no moments when I thought I could give out a negative recommendation. It succeeds from beginning to end."
MINARI,8 April 2021,6/10,"In many ways Minari is a throwback to the farming dramas of the mid 1980s. Films such as Country, The River and Places in the Heart showing the harsh realities of rural life.Minari has for its protagonists a Korean immigrant family.Set in the 1980s. Jacob (Steven Yeun) has brought his family from California to Arkansas.Sick and tired of his menial job that will lead him to nowhere. He dreams of growing Korean vegetables for the expanding Korean market.His wife Monica (Yeri Han) though is horrified by the move. She liked California and now finds herself living in a mobile home. Their son David has a heart murmur and the closest hospital is a hour's drive away.The children settle down and even make friends. However this new life brings tensions between Jacob and the increasingly unhappy Monica.Pretty soon Monica's mother Soonja comes to live with them as she could look after the kids. It is Soonja who takes the kids to plant some Minari seeds near the creek. It is a type of herb.Monica gets a job in a local chicken factory which is similar to the job she was doing in California.Jacob finds that farming life is not easy. Especially the water he needs to grow his plants which has eaten up his money.Minari is mainly in Korean. The few English speaking characters include Paul (Will Patton) a devout Christian who works on the farm and has his own cross to bear.The success of the Korean film Parasite has helped garner Minari critical success. Director Lee Isaac Chung has been nominated for a best director and screenwriting Oscar for his semi autobiographical story.It explores the immigrant dreams of a better life and hard work. Jacob and Monica seem to integrate with the local Arkansas community as they are Christians who regularly go to church.The presence of the children allows Chung to bring humour and playfulness to the film. Grandma Soonja likes the mountain water that the kids like to drink. It is Mountain Dew.Minari is an understated and poignant film. It does not go for easy histrionics to create false drama. The performances feel natural.However Chung leaves the film a little too open ended. Despite all the tribulations it is grandmother's Minari to the rescue."
MINARI,17 July 2021,9/10,"Korean dramas generally revolve around families. And this one is no different. Even if it plays in America - the majority of the movie is in Korean. You do get quite a bit of english in this too. If you are or know of people who migrated to the country you live in, you will be familiar (no pun intended) with the fact that especially the kids will mix their native language with the language/land they live in.So while the movie does not make a big deal out of it, this and many other things are just there. Subtle and really well woven into the story. The ground work - you could call it that. Overall the family drama works well and it seems like someone knows what a family like this had to go through. A lot of drama, a lot of pain ... and a lot of obstacles to overcome ... but the roots remain ..."
MINARI,10 April 2021,8/10,"This is a poignant tale of a Korean family pursuing the American dream by working a large tract of farmland in the state of Arkansas by way of California. The life of the parents on the West Coast was hampered by work as chicken sexers, something I never heard of before but makes sense if you think about it. The females are separated to lay eggs, while the males are sorted for meat, though in the story it sounds like the males are discarded as being useless. More on this later.The most unusual and entertaining character here is the old grandma (Yuh-Jung Youn) who joins her daughter's family once they've settled into their trailer. It takes some time for the young son David (Alan S. Kim) to warm up to his grandmother, who takes pleasure in drinking water from the mountains (Mountain Dew!) and watching pro wrestlers pound each other on TV. David's offer of a cup of mountain water to grandma is the film's best humorous moment.The dichotomy in the marriage between Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) Yi is quite evident. Jacob is the eternal optimist in regard to establishing himself as a successful farmer of Korean vegetables, while Monica is a fatalist, not only regarding the outcome with the farm, but also relative to son David's health. I thought it somewhat fatalistic for her to suggest her son to pray to see heaven; it felt like she was preparing him for his death because of a heart condition. Fortunately grandma stepped in with sage advice to help David reorient his thinking on that. The local doctor the Yi's take David to offers further good news by stating that his heart is mending, with guidance that said ""Whatever it is you're doing, don't change a thing"". That almost felt like a rejection of Monica's negativity toward living the life of a chicken sexer and farmer's wife.Unfortunately, a tragedy that occurs due to the grandma's own infirmity, causes a near total loss of the farm's first crop. The closing scene of Jacob discovering the location of the minari patch that grandma started with a few seeds suggests the rebuilding of their family life all over again, though that outcome is left to the imagination of the viewer. One must weigh Jacob's positive, forward looking attitude against his wife's tendency toward inevitable failure. My own sense is that they stay and make a go of it all over again.Now, as to the job of chicken sexing. As often happens, when confronted with something new and odd, I'll do some research, and it turns out you can go on line and take a free test to find out if chicken sexer is one of your top career matches. A not too shabby sixty thousand dollars a year is possible, but on the flip side, it would be hard to come up with a more boring and tedious job than standing all day and separating baby chicks into different colored containers. The world record for a chicken sexer currently stands at 1,682 in an hour, though personally, I don't think that's possible myself, but I've never done it. By this time you probably think I'm making all this up, but you can check it out for yourself with an internet search. Watch the movie first though."
MINARI,19 April 2021,7/10,"I heard the title for this American made Korean language film a number of times when it received multiple nominations during Awards Season, so I was looking forward to watching it. Basically, set in 1983, the Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to their new farm in rural Arkansas, where father and husband Jacob (Oscar nominated Steven Yeun) hopes to grow Korean fruits and vegetables to sell to vendors in Dallas. His first decision is to dig a well for a natural source of water. He enlists the help of eccentric local man and Korean War veteran Paul (Will Patton). While Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, his wife Monica (Yeri Han) is disappointed and worries about their son David (BAFTA nominated Alan S. Kim). He suffers from a heart condition and is frequently told not to run. Jacob and Monica also find work separating chicks from male to female at the nearby hatchery. The couple have constant arguments about their situation, with David and his sister Anne (Noel Cho) eavesdropping. The couple arrange for Monica's mother Soonja (Oscar and BAFTA winning Yuh-Jung Youn) to travel from South Korea to help look after the children during the day. David is forced to share a room with her grandmother, who he hardly knows. He avoids her because she does not conform to being a conventional grandmother, often being rude, but she tries to adjust to life in America and bond with the children. The well that Jacob dug runs dry. Jacob is reluctant to pay for water services, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into further difficulties, including a Dallas vendor cancelling their order at the last minute. But he perseveres despite Monica's telling him she wishes to return to California. This strains their marriage closer to the breaking point. Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes the children to plant minari seeds by the river. She tells them that minari is a most resilient and useful plant and predicts plentiful growth. Minari is a weed-like vegetable thrive in tough circumstances and flourishes in its second season after dying and being reborn. David finally begins to warm to his grandmother after she teaches him card games, bandages his wounds, and helps him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, saying that he is stronger than they think. Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke, she survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech. Jacob, Monica, Anne, and David travel to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor to sell Jacob's produce. They learn that David's heart condition has dramatically improved, and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer. But Jacob indirectly admits to Monica that the success of his crops is more important to him than the stability of their family. Following an emotional argument, the two silently agree to separate. In their absence, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. Eventually, the fire gets out of control, but the couple decide to save each other, leaving the barn to burn. A distraught and confused Soon-ja begins to wander off into the distance. Anne and David call for her to come back, but she does not respond. David sprints after her, she takes his hand, and the grandchildren lead her back home. The family fall asleep on the floor, exhausted from the night before. Above them, Soon-ja is awake, in a chair, watching them sleep with a subdued expression on her face. Sometime later, Jacob and Monica are with the water diviner who finds a spot for a well. They intend to stay on the farm and place a marker stone to signify this. Jacob and David then head to the river to harvest the minari, which had grown successfully, with Jacob noting how good a spot their grandmother picked to plant them. Also starring Scott Haze as Billy, and Eric Starkey as Randy Boomer. The performances of Yeun as the man who believes in the Americna Dream, Youn as the wily grandmother and young Kim as the sensitive little boy are all terrific. It is a semi-autobiographical story seen almost entirely from the point-of-view of a child, it has the moments of tragedy and sentimentality, but the bond with the boy and his grandmother and witty and warm, the farming element is interesting, and it is an authentic insight about the struggles of a family, a charming and worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Director for Lee Isaac Chung, Best Original Screenplay for Lee Isaac Chung, and Best Original Score for Emile Mosseri, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film Not in the English Language, Best Director, Original Score, and Best Casting, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!"
MINARI,18 July 2021,,"If this had been about Italian immigrants it might have been called ""Parsley"". If about Central American immigrants, maybe ""Cilantro."" The title is a reference to Minari seeds grandma brought from South Korean and plants near a stream.Based on a certain amount of hype, my wife and I were expecting a bit more from this movie. It is based on the recollections of a man and his boyhood experiences in the 1980s, as a first generation American and his immigrant family. They had settled first in California but moved to Arkansas, into a trailer home, to establish their farm. They survive initially by sexting chicken hatchlings, only the females make good-tasting chickens. There are some family problems and rough spots with the farm. When the movie ends there is no definite conclusion, we don't know if grandma's health improves or even if the farm is successful.So while we enjoyed it enough it isn't the kind we might re-watch. On DVD from our public library."
MINARI,15 August 2021,8/10,"After having nightmares after watching Parasite, it was a relief for my mom to watch something more subtle a drama as Minari. A story of a Korean immigrant family moving from California to Arkansas because the father wants to build his farm there, we see them struggle to build a new life and later on, coping with a grandma who's quite funny initially when dealing with her grandson but something happens later on that...well, watch the film. By the way, the actress that played the grandma, Yuh-Jung Youn, derserved her Oscar win for that role! So in summation, Mom and I enjoyed Minari."
MINARI,5 April 2021,,"It is an engaging story about harsh realities faced by immigrants. It is sad, and makes your heart sink."
MINARI,13 August 2021,9/10,"First off, this movie is subtitled; but don't let that make you miss this movie. A Korean family living in California in the 1980s moves to Arkansas for the rich soil. Patriarch of the family Jacob (Steven Yeun) wants more than life to be a farmer. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) and children have experienced culture shock and disappointment as they try to get accustomed with the ""hillbilly"" form of life..Husband and wife get jobs ""sexing"" young chickens, because the males are considered worthless. Jacob spends every spare moment trying to grow the biggest garden possible. Be on the watch for Alan S. Kim, who plays young David.Let me stop to not spoil this wonderful film. Beautiful scenery and characters build before your eyes."
MINARI,9 June 2021,7/10,"I have to say that I got far more from my second screening of this than I did from my first. The story centres around a Korean family who emigrate to Arkansas in Ronald Reagan's United States and attempt to make a go of things. In itself, the story is nothing especially innovative - what does resonate, though, is the way in which the entire family are portrayed by director Lee Isaac Chung as a unit. Although it is ""Jacob"" (Steven Yeun) who is the breadwinner, the story thoughtfully develops the characters of the young son - and star of the film for me - ""David"" (Alan Kim) and of his own mother ""Soonja"" (Oscar winning Yuh-Jung Youn), and we are soon immersed in their efforts to conform to their new environment without surrendering their own cultural and familial identities. It draws heavily on language - there is little English spoken and that works well. It gives an English speaking audience a sense of the bewilderment experienced by those in a society who do not all speak the native language, and so we, here, share a sense of how they (largely only speaking Korean) had to fit in on a societal as well as physical level. It's especially potent as the underlying premiss of hard work, decency and to a certain extent, mundanity, must ring true for so many of America's original founding-fathers who arrived in a new land full of hope, opportunity and apprehension. On the downside, it is a little too long - at times it succeeds too well in illustrating their daily lives as we might experience our own, and that isn't always that interesting, but the ensemble - both Korean and local - work well together, and both the young Kim and the sparing appearances of his grandmother provide us with delightful performances that deliver both humour and affection. Perhaps it doesn't need a big screen - but it's another example of carefully and creatively crafted Korean cinema that is well worth a watch."
MINARI,15 May 2021,6/10,"In the 1980s, a Korean family move to Arkansas. They've just bought a plot of land with the aim of starting a vegetable farm. Things will be tough but they're determined to make it work. However, not everyone in the family is completely onboard with the idea.A film that I wanted to like more than I ultimately did. The plot is original and interesting, the characters are engaging, the performances are great and there are some wonderful lighter moments.However, it doesn't quite hit the mark. With much of the film feeling like set up, I was waiting for the big ending. This didn't come, with the film fizzling out rather than ending on a high.Towards the end there's also a fair amount of melodrama, especially a relationship drama that seems to come out of nowhere and radically shift the focus and outcome of the film.Maybe it was just that I was hoping for a different ending.Ultimately, okay but not brilliant."
MINARI,12 July 2021,7/10,"Have to admit I was hoping for more from this acclaimed and Oscar-winning film.It's like the Academy had the chance to recognize an Asian-driven film in last year's ""The Farewell,"" botched it, and then decided that it would lavish praise on whatever the next Asian-driven movie was, no matter whether or not it deserved it. And it's not like ""Minari"" is lacking in merits. It's just that it feels formulaic in a way ""The Farewell"" didn't, and it doesn't feel as urgent as that other movie.The movie is largely autobiographical, so the director and screenwriter, Lee Isaac Chung, was mostly sticking to what he knows first hand. Fine with me. But that means a film set decades ago that lacks substantial dramatic conflict. It positions itself early on as a film about the immigrant experience and what it feels like to be a stranger in a strange land. But the Korean family at the film's center is pretty much accepted by the rural Arkansas community they choose as their adopted home and the main conflict transitions into a domestic drama revolving around a wife who gets frustrated at her husband's dogged pursuit of a dream that leaves the family scrounging. True to life events, maybe, but less interesting. Throw in the young child who's pampered and needs to learn that he's tougher than he thinks he is and the irascible grandma who teaches him that lesson, and you've got something it feels like we've seen many times before.The grandmother is played by Yuh Jung Youn, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. The film also scored nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Steven Yeun as the dreamer), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Original Score.""Minari"" is a solidly enough crafted film, but I found myself to be -- and I usually hate using this word -- a little bit bored by it.Grade: B+"
MINARI,12 February 2021,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""The American Dream"" could actually be labeled 'The Human Dream'. The idea of being part of a loving and supportive family, while achieving a bit of societal success and living comfortably and safely in a home one can call their own, is a dream that bears no boundaries, gender, or skin color. This autobiographical film from writer-director Lee Isaac Chung is centered on his childhood recollections of his family move to rural Arkansas to start a farm.It's the 1980s and this Korean immigrant family has packed up to leave their dead-end California life to begin anew on a 50 acre parcel in Arkansas. Father Jacob (Steven Yeun, ""The Walking Dead"") has a dream of cultivating Korean vegetables to fill the demand from an increasing Korean populace. Mother Monica (Yeri Han) sees less dream and more nightmare as they drive far from a city and pull up to a tattered mobile home (""it has wheels""). Their young son David (Alan S Kim) has health concerns from a closely monitored heart murmur, and is constantly being ordered to ""don't run, David!"" David's older sister Anne (Noel Cho) is mature and smart for her age, and acts as his life guide.Monica and Jacob take jobs at a local hatchery to support the family while the farm is developed. The hatchery job is exactly what they escaped from in California, so Monica sees their situation as worse, not better ... foreseeing failure on the farm. A heartfelt argument leads to compromise and Monica's mother Soonja (Yuh-jung Youn) comes to live with them. As David notes, she's not a ""normal grandmother"". Rather than bake cookies, she freely spews profanity and quite enjoys the ""water from mountains"" (Mountain Dew) amidst her practical jokes at the expense of others. In other words, she's a hoot!Jacob accepts the offer of help from Paul (longtime favorite character actor Will Patton), a local evangelical Christian who praises Jesus frequently, and has an unusual Sunday ritual. The two men manage to cultivate the crops, yet run in to many obstacles along the way. But Chung's film is clever in that the real core is family dynamics. Grandma's planting of fast-growing minari herb in the creek bed acts as a metaphor for the plight of this family. Each member finds their way, and it's clearly stronger as a unit than broken.This is such a beautiful film with a gentle story grounded in realism. These people talk and act like a family, and the pressures they face are real. Racism in the south is never dwelled upon, but the struggles of a changing citizenry is faced by all. Emile Mosseri's score is unusual, but fits perfectly, while Lachlan Milne's cinematography at times reminds of Terrence Malick, possibly due to the setting. Filmmaker Chung has created a tender, relatable film and the cast performs superbly. The result will strike an emotional chord for many.

MINARI,25 February 2021,10/10,"After the great hidden gems I found at the Birmingham (online) Cine-Excess film festival last year,I decided to pre-order a number of screenings/streams taking place for the first major UK movie festival of 2021: The Glasgow Film Festival. leading to me seeing the opening film.View on the film:Returning to fiction film making, the impact co-directing the documentary I Have Seen My Last Born (2015) had on writer/director Lee Isaac Chung is one that comes prominently across, via planting the camera at the child's height of David,with Chung & cinematographer of the TV show Stranger Things, Lachlan Milne having it look upwards when David confronts the disapproval of the family,for his misbehaviour.Opening the gates to the new plot of land the family own, Chung takes inspiration from the Western genre,with beautifully composed shots of the bright skyline, lighting the fresh green foods Jacob and Paul plant under the roasting sun.Displaying the tension in the roots of the family, Chung holds back from the big emotional close-up, to instead eye distorted side views,bringing out a raw, intimate atmosphere to listening in on the family arguments.Inspired by his childhood growing up on a small farm in rural Lincoln, Arkansas, the screenplay by Chung brilliantly grows the coming of age David experiences, with the push-pull struggle of the family (an outstanding ensemble cast of Alan S. Kim,Yeri Han,Steven Yeun,Youn Yuh-jung and Will Patton) trying to remain together,whilst attempting to grow The American Dream.Igniting an emotional punch of a ending, Chung puts out the flames of disagreement between David, his aunt Soon-ja and husband/wife David & Monica with a poetic final scene, where from out of the flames they have battled through, the family discover green shoots."
MINARI,3 January 2021,7/10,"This immigrant experience movie is fairly interesting. It's not a groundbreaking movie although the protagonists are different but it's watchable because you want to see what happens to them. The family has some sympathetic characters. Grandma is memorable. And the boy is funny and acts well. As they set up their lives in a rural Arkansas farm, there is a pioneer feel about struggles in the frontier. Hardships like water and the toll on health feel real and are nicely unexaggerated. When good things happen it feels great too.The different thing here is it's a Korean family instead of WIld West settlers. They look like city folk too. It's also in the 1980s not in the 1880s which makes it interesting as a fairly modern day pioneer feel. Farming ain't easy.The ending feels a bit lacking in resolution. Are they going to prevail and succeed? It's irritating.that after all that you are left pondering.This movie is good for what it is but there isn't a lot to it. No way in the league of Parasite."
MINARI,9 February 2021,,"Even though Minari is set in the '80's as a Korean-American family resettles from California, it could be '21 so real is its depiction of the
challenges beset them. Writer-director Lee Isaac is himself a hero for showing these estimable ramblers trying to achieve the American dream while retaining their Asian heritage.The legacies of immigration are many and deep. Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) with their two children and grandma are quietly working the land to grow vegetables and gently soothing each other when things don't go as hoped. In episodic fashion, we are visitors to their farm, watching as Juan searches for water with the help of kindly, eccentric neighbor Paul (Well Patton).Not only does farming serve to cause tension between Jacob and Monica, she can see the failures to come and hope they move again, back to California. In a way, Chung has drawn his principals closer to the dream than many of us realize considering those going West only to turn back because of the California cost in economic and emotional terms.The vagaries of their Arkansas occupation are best exemplified in little David (Alan S. Kim) and grandma Soonia (Youn Yuh-jung). David warms to grandma after a time, and grandma relaxes in to fight her own battles with old age. She gives him courage while he gives her love, and their enduring live through catastrophe represents the love everyone else must share in order to survive.Minari, a hearty plant the survives anywhere, is also an emblem of the daunting task for the family to tame the South. Chung has fashioned a small Oscar-worthy drama, whose languid pace and uncluttered mise en scene may disguise the hardships beneath.Yet, he also reveals the formula for eventual success:
""Remember what we said when we got married? That we'd move to America and save each other?"" Jacob to MonicaThe salvation is--love."
MINARI,6 July 2021,10/10,"""Minari"" is one heartfelt touching family drama of love and wisdom as a viewer sees how being together grows a family strong no matter what kind of cards are dealt their way. Set in the early 80's a Korean American family has moved from the hustle and hassle world of California to the rural south to an Arkansas farm for a chance at the American dream, as new roots of goals and life have been planted. Jacob(the good Steven Yeun) and Monica(Yeri Han) want to break from their 9 to 5 life of working at a chicken factory so Jacob invest in the earth and land and equipment to start planting seeds to grow harvest so he can become a fine farmer. Their two small kids David(Alan S. Kim who's so cute) and Anne(Noel Cho) have to adjust to a new school and life that involves church too. And things do twist and spin even more when their stubborn and go against the grain rule breaking grandmother Soonja(Yuh-Jung-Youn) arrives. Grandma is loving and caring though and she brings a little seed of magic and hope to the Arkansas farm! Challenges and ups and downs are common still thru it all this picture shows that at home if a family has love, togetherness, with hard work and determination they will last no matter what happens. Overall wonderful film that one will love watching as they see a strong masterful family."
MINARI,16 April 2021,8/10,"""Unhurriedly Lee fuses a timeless, lyrical appreciation of the story's loci, Emile Mosseri's evocative score is the icing on the cake, with his oriental intimism that conscientiously outlines the close-knit family's challenges and clashes in pursuit of a new life as what the patriarch intends. Out of the box, you can see and relate to Monica's grievance, she is deprived of her say-so in the big decision and blind-sided by Jacob to live in the sticks. Her sufferance wears thin as she gets wise that their new start might be a fiasco, it reaches the boiling point when Jacob would rather give up their family than moving back to the city. Han, for my money, is the unsung heroine here, a suffering wife is such a corny role to inhabit, but she remains consistently compelling, Monica's interiority has the most drastic turnabout, which Han registers pellucidly through her unflinching strength and finesses, juggling between the roles of a mother, a wife and a daughter, she is the one who holds the household together.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks."
MINARI,17 April 2021,7/10,"'Minari', the autobiographical film written and directed in 2020 by the American filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung, a son of Korean immigrants, has some beautiful moments and quite a lot of cinematic qualities. It is an immigrants story, one of the millions of episodes that have built throughout history the complex mosaic of the American nation and history. It is also a family drama evoking episodes related to the economic adaptation and the overcoming of the psychological and cultural barriers that so many immigrant families have faced and are facing. It's a good film that deserves to be watched, but which also has weaker points related to the lack of epic breath and character development, with too many aspects within the limit of the predictable. The amount - exaggerated in my opinion - of awards and nominations with which this film was overwhelmed seems to me to be more related to the specific moment the American film industry goes through and to the ensemble of the productions offered to the public this year which is so different of the previous ones.The story in 'Minari' takes place in the '80s. Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) move to Arkansas from California, where they spent their early - not very successful - years as immigrants. They bought a piece of land that may be fertile, with only a caravan on it, and began to work hard to achieve their dream of growing Korean vegetables in the heart of the United States. Meanwhile, in order to meet ends they take day jobs in a chicken farm. They have two children, a teenage daughter and a younger boy who has heart problems, and after a while they are joined by Monica's mother. Economic pressures and social isolation are beginning to make their effects felt on family life and the relationship between the two. Neighbours are not necessarily hostile to them, maybe just indifferent, maybe just clumsy in approaching them and creating social ties despite language and culture barriers. I will not go into more details about the story so as not to rob the future viewers' pleasure. Placing the story of the film almost four decades ago, screenwriter and director Lee Isaac Chung avoids comments and direct references to the current situation of immigrants, specifically those coming from Asia, and the way they are received and integrated into America today. I am sure that the spectators will make the connections themselves, and those who have gone through the experiences of emigration will recognise many of the situations and attitudes.What I liked? 'Minari' is beautifully filmed and illustrated musically and excellently acted. Aside from the two lead actors who finely portray the dynamics of the relationship between the two spouses, I can't help but mention Will Patton, one of those American actors whom I recognise from dozens of supporting roles and who I hope will he someday get s a leading role up to his obvious talent. Here Patton plays the role of Jacob's partner, a man with a big heart, who carries his cross, literally, at certain moments. The film is mostly spoken in Korean, and this choice, far from being a gimmick or an attempt to fill a quota imposed by Hollywood, gives the film authenticity. My family is also one of immigrants in a foreign language country, and this is exactly what our linguistic mixture between the languages of the old and the new homeland looks like. Family issues related to economic pressures and intergenerational conflicts, and relationships with neighbours, including prejudices and naiveties, as well as the role played by the church in bringing newcomers closer to the community, are sensitively portrayed. What I liked less? The film has emotion, but lacks narrative consistency. The sincerity and simplicity of the approach works well at times, but falls into melodrama at some other moments. For this reason, the scenes in which children are involved, which often save films and raise the emotional level, seem at some instances melodramatic here. The qualities of 'Minari' are exactly the reasons that take it out of the category of films that collect many Academy Awards, but given that we are in an unusual year (also) for cinema, who knows?"
MINARI,6 May 2021,8/10,"I loved how Minari shows us a unique immigrant experience, one that doesn't rely on a lot of the usual things we see in this kind of film. We feel the family's otherness, but at the same time, they aren't subjected to hatred or racism; in fact, it's the opposite. It's a story of struggle in so many ways though - the hard life of making a farm work in rural Arkansas of all places, of keeping a marriage together despite goals shifting over time, and dealing with serious health issues in the young and old. At the same time, director Lee Isaac Chung is wonderfully restrained in how he presents this story. The relationship the little boy (Alan Kim) has with his grandmother (Youn Yuh-jung) is funny and touching as it evolves, but it's never cloying. There is great authenticity in these characters, and in scenes like the cruel chick sorting of the poultry industry. Loved the performances from the cast as well, with Steven Yeun standing out for me. Just a lovely film, and it's nice to see all of the recognition it got."
MINARI,25 May 2021,8/10,"""Minari"" is an exceptionally well-made picture especially for being somewhat simplistic in its depiction of a farm family. The pleasant imagery and music works in a Terrence Malick-light sort of way, although there's not always enough here to contemplate to earn such languid lyricism--largely comprised of bromides on the American Dream, the Nation of Immigrants and some tilted balance between reason and spirituality. Even the pseudoscience of dowsing for well water is strangely celebrated. That's not something I care to bother thinking about during wistful compositions of 1980s rural Arkansas, let alone a man dragging a cross along a gravel road on Sundays. There are better parts here, though. The acting in uniformly good, including an Oscar-nominated performance from Steven Yeun (perhaps best known for leaving ""The Walking Dead"" TV series before it really got bad) and an Oscar-winning one from Youn Yuh-jung as an amusing grandma. The most interesting aspect I find in ""Minari,"" however, might be its rather symbolic treatment of masculinity. It's also what greatly separates it from the last foreign-language movie to receive awards attention and that was a semi-autobiographical nostalgia trip on the filmmaker's boyhood, ""Roma"" (2018), which was more focused on female rearing of children.Motifs for all four of the classical elements revolve around masculinity: air, earth, fire and water. Tornados, farm dirt, groundwater wells and even urine, for which one might also consider that ""mountain water."" It's just intriguing symmetry that the picture begins and ends with the threat of burning males. Early on there's the burning of male chicks from the parents' sexing side hustle, for which the boy asks his father on his cigarette break about the factory's smoke. He's advised to make himself useful lest he face the fate of the cockerels, who neither lay eggs nor are desired for eating. And, later, we have the father running into a burning structure in a desperate act to preserve his upwardly-socially-mobile breadwinning. In the meantime, the boy's masculinity is depicted as veering constantly between being initiated and threatened. His father teaches him something about farming, and another dad insists that he help his with the farm, as well, and there's even the chewing tobacco. On the other hand, the farm might fail and the mother might leave the father for the feminized city. He's the younger sibling of an older sister, and he must share a room after the grandmother moves in to unbalance the household's equal gender ratio. He's not allowed to run because his heart might give out. He's called ""pretty"" instead of ""good looking."" Heck, grandma even mocks his bedwetting by repeating that his penis is broken. Surprisingly emasculating stuff for a movie about a child. I'll resist the urge to fall back on my film theory education by getting overly psychanalytical about all this, but it's rather asking for it.I also won't get into detail regarding it, but it also goes to a point some have made regarding the desexualized stereotype of Asian male characters, perhaps in conjunction with the hyper-sexualization of female ones. A documentary I recently saw, ""Hollywood Chinese"" (2007), that included interviews from the likes of BD Wong on playing such demasculized or feminized characters. To cite another film I (re)visited not long ago, the cook in ""King Kong"" (1933) would be a specific example--a character that at one point even imagines himself in the role occupied by Fay Wray. Certainly, Yeun has done well do play against this type.Ultimately, this prevalent male-centric fear of emasculation is balanced partly by a couple strong female characters: the mother and the grandmother. In their own ways, they may ultimately rescue the men and their manhood, whether running into the fire beside them or literalizing taking the piss out of them. Note the final shot, too; it's of father and son, but look at the feminized space with which their masculinity has come to a compromise. Not just the American dream, the merging of American and Korean culture, religion and science, but also a balance of female and male."
MINARI,26 February 2021,,"An arresting, intimate & bittersweet portrait of an immigrant South Korean family striving for their version of American dream in 1980s Arkansas, Minari is a story of family & assimilation that's as powerful as it is personal and as heartwarming as it is heartrending. Crafted with affection, steered with gentleness, and strengthened by wholesome performances from its cast, it is one of the better films of 2020.Written & directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the inspiration behind the story is derived from his own childhood & upbringing but it will resonate with most viewers, for a lot many people will find it exquisitely capturing the snippets of their own lives in this tragic & heartfelt drama. Lee keeps the plot simple, doesn't try to overdo any aspect, and wonderfully balances the ebb & flow of character drama & emotional beats.The tender cinematography & evocative score bring in more warmth & resonance, the relationships are curated with such care & compassion that each interaction is engrossing, and additional richness is provided by its outstanding cast who render their characters with fine delicacy, with Youn Yuh-jung & Alan Kim impressing the most in their respective roles of the family's oldest & youngest. Youn is a riot, and steals her scenes with ease.Overall, Minari makes for an amusing, affecting & awe-inspiring slice of immigrant experience, and benefits immensely from Lee's deft writing, composed direction & nuanced storytelling. Shot in sun-kissed location, unfolding at a relaxed pace, and expertly transposed from script to screen by its talented cast, the film is honest in its emotions, elegant in its execution, and is worthy of all the praise & accolades it has garnered so far. Highly recommended."
MINARI,17 May 2021,8/10,"Even if you've never been a Korean immigrant farmer in the 1980s, Minari is still very relatable. It's a beautiful slice-of-life drama that focuses on the family experience, with engaging performances from the entire cast. This film could have easily turned cynical or become melodramatic, but instead it sows the seeds of realism and allows the story to grow naturally. And even though the ending feels a little abrupt, I still enjoyed the journey Minari took me on."
MINARI,3 May 2021,7/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Minari"" (2020) was a good movie. Great acting, descent story, good music, good pacing and good sense of location. I liked many things in it, but i think at the end of the day 6 Oscar nominations were a bit to much for this movie. And it actually got one for acting. You can throw a rock at me if Glenn Close wasn't worth it more, or even Olivia Colman. But i guess diversity now is more important then art.Anyway, overall - ""Minari"" is a good movie, but its not that great given the kudos it got. I think the ending kinda felt a bit to empty for me. It just kinda didn't lead that much to anything. Its a descent movie to see it once."
MINARI,2 March 2021,7/10,"Drama movie, both on the acting and filmographic production. its a family story about korean immigrants trying to settle somewhere else than california. its sickness running in the family which without insurance costs a lot of money. its long working days and the logistical problems with childrens care is immens.so they import grandma from korea, to help...but will its solve the problems???its a small cast bilingual survival drama, where the sad moments are leveled with happy ones, the main cast does a fine job and the rites and customs are so very korean...women slapping husbands and different culture make this 2020 made 1980's drama a watchable piece for those who are patient and loves movies without a great bling, or dingdong as was the great amussement in this family.so brace yourselves for a brad pitt produced american korean drama that will be watched and discussed, is it good or is it phenomenal, the grumpy old man goes somewhere inbetween, and gives a seven of elleven with a recommend."
MINARI,29 November 2021,9/10,"Lots of ambiance of sounds, beautiful scenery and astonishing acting in Korean and English! Steven Yuan is riveting I knew him best as Glenn in The Walking Dead, great to see him flourish quite well. Minari is focused on a family that moves towards the wilderness that grow, adapt together and build onward. I love the little boy he's excellent throughout especially with what he eats or says. I'm glad this was praised so much definitely deserves it!"
MINARI,13 April 2021,8/10,"""Minari"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a Korean-American family going to rural Arkansas in 1980's to start growing a farm with Korean vegetables and fruit. Their goal is to create a big farm and live the American Dream but they have to struggle in order to succeed.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very interesting plot that combined very well drama with comedy. The direction which was made by Lee Isaac Chung who is also the writer, it was very good and he presented very well his main characters, their dreams and their fears, something that created a bond between the characters and the audience, and we could relate to them. The interpretation of Yuh-Jung Youn who played as Soonja was simply amazing and her interpretation gave a whole different touch in the movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Steven Yeun's who played as Jacob, Yeri Han's who played as Monica and Alan S. Kim's who played as David. Finally, I have to say that ""Minari"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
MINARI,28 February 2021,7/10,"A film that is very likely to appear heavily at the upcoming 2021 Oscar ceremony, Lee Isaac Chung's heartfelt slice of life drama that is based in part around his own family experiences is a lovely little tale that is likely to capture the hearts of many viewers who bare witness to its simple charms, even if this is a film that never escalates into something grand and utterly unforgettable.Produced by Brad Pitt's heavy hitting production company Plan B and starring hugely impressive Walking Dead alumni Steven Yeun (proving that Burning was no fluke), Minari focuses its tight gaze on Yeun's Jacob and his wife Monica's experience's moving to the rural surrounds of Arkansas in the United States as they aim to make a living farming the lands, all the while dealing with their two young children and Monica's card loving grandmother Soonja (a scene stealing and hopefully soon to be Oscar nominated Yuh-jung Youn).The film is content too keep the attention solely on Jacob and Monica as they navigate their way through Jacob's dream of graduating from chicken sorting facilities too being a man providing for his family through the sweat of his own brow and despite what the marketing/trailers may make you think Minari is about, it's certainly not a typical feel good fish out of water family drama as Chung refuses to shy away from the harsh realities of such dreams that can be shattered and broken in an instant.Filled with ample drama and incident heavy moments, the greatest downside to Minari is the fact that there never feels like a real driving force is present in the film.Jacob and Monica are likable but we never fully get to understand what drives them or makes them tick and the films plot can at times get bogged down in repetitive moments rather than creating new or unexpected ones and its a shame that what we end up getting narratively isn't as engaging as it could've been, especially as the films rather subdued end game plays out.What is wholly impressive and captivating throughout is a string of awards worthy turns.Steven Yuen is understated but rock solid as Jacob while Yuh-jung Youn as Soonja is a joy to watch. It's in these small moments of beautiful performing, Chung's humanly centered direction and the magical score of Emile Mosseri that Minari shines in a way that will undoubtedly inspire some viewers while leaving others enjoying their time but not installing in them any long lasting memories of a family trying their best to unlock the American dream.Final Say -Well-shot, performed and captured, Minari is a pleasant slice of life diversion but a lack of inspired narrative choices or moments of an unforgettable nature hold this lovingly staged awards darling back from greatness.3 1/2 untypical grandmothers out of 5"
MINARI,28 April 2021,8/10,"Minari (2020) :
Brief Review -A Classic Korean Drama. Minari breaks the stereotype Methods of Family Films with subtle work on characterisations. I have been reading so much about Minari from last few weeks which includes mixed reviews too. Now after watching it i can say that, some people who understood the subtle meaning of those mediocre scenes have given it extremely positive reviews. On the other side, rest of people who carried high expectations after reading those former ones didn't actually understand the subtle methods used by the director. I was quite moved by the narrative and storytelling so you can count me in those former fellas who gave postive review (not extremely) even though it's little slow at the beginning. The idea is to understand every character even if it looks simple because that's what makes it highly realistic. Cause you wouldn't see highly dramatic character with unheard conflicts and terrible struggles every time in real life, right? So, basically you have to understand the simplicity because that's where the subtle meaning is hidden and if you're looking for dramatic proportions then sorry Minari is not made for you. The plot follows a family of South Korean immigrants who try to make it in the rural United States during the 1980s. It shows every angle of common family from male character's struggle to make big on his own to female character's reluctance over it to children finding it tough to get along with new people around to relationship issues. Like i said, it is a slow film but by the time it finishes its narrative it provides all answers that why those mediocre looking scenes were there when the film looked slow and why it was important to show it that way. All the actors have done a great job, the screenplay has few laughs here and there and subtle emotions at the end and the direction of Chung is classy. Overall, a Classic drama far away from dramatic notions and stereotype filmmaking.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest."
MINARI,23 March 2021,8/10,"How beautiful, American production with Korean ingredients, perfect, sensitive, simple, intense, affectionate and fun ... but Oscar for best film a little overrated ... It's cute, based slightly on the life of director Lee Isaac Chung, and the little girl deserved an Oscar nomination along with her grandmother, but her parents... But I hope for awards for the film..."
MINARI,6 January 2021,9/10,Minari is a great Korean family drama that showcases life of immigrants that are trying to suceed in their new land and to make something new and sucesful in their lifes.Im not gonna lie i was connected to characters more then i thought that i will be and i was with them in every moment of a film and i understand every decision they were making being there good or bad.Acting was also one of best from previous year expecely from young boy.Minari is a film with a story that hits every deep feeling inside you
MINARI,20 February 2021,8/10,"""Minari"" (2020 release; 115 min.) brings the story of the Yi family. As the movie opens, the Yi family is approaching their new home in Arkansas, a mobile home on a remote farm stretch, having moved away from California. Steven and Monica take a job at the nearby hatchery. We hear a reference to President Reagan so we realize the movie takes place in the early/mid 80s. Monica is not happy with the overall situation but Steven is eager to realize his long-held dream of having his own 50 acre garden, or is it a farm? ""Garden, farm, what's the difference?"", he moans. Meanwhile their young children Anne and David have their own adjustments to make in this new life... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from from American-Korean writer-director Lee Isaac Chung. Here he brings us a semi-autobiographical retelling of his upbringing as a Korean immigrant family in rural Arkansas. The film touches on many aspects: the ""fish out of water"" aspect of a Korean family in tight-knit and evangelical Arkansas, the struggles to stay afloat economically, the dreams of Jacob to have his own business away from the hatchery, etc. Chung brings it all in an effective and deeply personal and moving way. The film is helped tremendously by the lead performances of Steven Yeun (as Jacob) and Han Ye-ri (as Monica). Will Patton plays Paul, the deeply religious guy who becomes an unlikely friend and business partner. Please note that Brad Pitt serves as Executive Producer. Last but not least, the film features a beautiful musical score, courtesy of up-and-coming composer Emile Mosseri. ""Minari"" has already racked up a bunch of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and I'm going on record that it will also get a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nomination.""Minari"" premiered at last year's Sundance film festival, yes, over a year ago, to immediate critical acclaim I might add. This weekend the movie was finally released in select theaters before moving on to Hulu and other streaming services. I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater. The rest of the 16 screen Cinemark movieplex resembled a ghost town as well. I honestly don't understand how these theaters can operate like this on a profitable basis. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for an effective and moving foreign family relationship drama as it tries to find its way in 1980s America, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
MINARI,12 April 2021,7/10,"In previous years where a foreign language film has been nominated for Best Picture I have tended to absolutely love the film. 'Amour' and 'Parasite' are the two that immediately come to mind. So I was excited for 'Minari' going in. It also helps that I adore Korean films. Perhaps I set my expectations a little high I'm sorry to say. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Minari' but I certainly wasn't in love with it.Steven Yeun and Yuh-Jung Youn have been nominated for Academy Awards in the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress roles respectively. Yeun was good but never blew me away. There were some subtle nuances to his performance which I really appreciated, however it wasn't a particularly memorable performance. Youn on the other hand was extremely memorable. In fact she was the highlight of the entire film. She was equal parts hilarious and heart-breaking. She was the soul of the film and I could easily see her taking home the award.This was a film I wanted so badly to like. I kept trying to connect with the story and the characters but it was very difficult. Youn's character was amazing, however when she wasn't in the scenes things fell very flat. I could appreciate what they were going for and the approach they were taking, but it just didn't resonate with me for whatever reason. That's not to say I didn't have a good time with it, it just didn't live up to the high expectations I had set for it."
MINARI,3 March 2021,8/10,"A Korean family move to rural Arkansas with their children, a small boy and girl. They work at a chicken processing plant while living in a mobile home. Grandma comes to live with them to care for the kids. Jacob decides to farm his land by growing Korean vegetables to sell at market. The family struggles to make ends meet and the children actors are so believable that the film sometimes has the feel of a documentary. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung has made a movie which is deeply moving. It is the best foreign language film of the year."
MINARI,2 February 2021,8/10,"8/10 - thanks in large part to a stellar cast (including the young actors) and dedicated direction, this film is a delight"
MINARI,5 April 2021,8/10,"This film has been gaining large acclaim with 6 Oscar Nominations and it has now become available in The UK and today I watched Minari and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees A Korean family more to Arkansas and attempt to start a new life.Main Character
Steven Yeun became a big deal for his role as Glen on The Walking Dead but since leaving that role he has had a few roles but nothing breakout until Minari. He is fantastic in this film, he delivers such a strong performance that hits many different emotions and Yeun does a great job in making this an interesting character and he totally deserves his Oscar Nomination.Supporting Characters
Yeri Han plays his wife in this film and she is also fantastic. They have such a great dynamic together, her character plays an important role in the film and the love but also conflict between the two characters is really effective in making them an interesting couple. Experienced actor Will Patton plays the family friend and he is good, I mean his character is crazy but it works well and makes him feel really different to the other characters but also shows how these completely different people can become friends. You know this film is really well acted because the two young children are also really good and especially the young boy play a crucial part of the plot and they do it really well. But for me the star of the film was the Grandmother played by Yuh-Jung Youn, she also got an Oscar nomination and it is well deserved. She is so funny in this film and provides some much needed laughs and comic relief but there is plenty of heart to her role and her relationship with her grandson is possibly the most effective part of the film for me.Story
The story is effective, it works well in showing how these outsiders to the community learns to adapt to their new environment and how it can affect a family from the grandmother to the young children. The personal relationships between the characters is really well acted and really well realised in this really well written and well acted film. But, this film is just lacking a bit of punch and speed about it. This film has an issue with its pacing and it does affect the story, it just feels like the film takes its time which works for certain aspects but I just need a bit more to keep me more interested in the film I am watching.Script
This script is brilliant, the balance of humour and drama is here in abundance and it is really well handled. I though Parasite did this really well this year and with this being a Korean film too it seems like these directors, screenwriters and actors know how to deliver on a great script.Style
The film looks fantastic, the backdrops of the film are great with Arkansas looking really good and shot really well. But as I mentioned above this film has a pacing issue, it just feels way longer then it is and this holds it back a bit as despite things being well done, it just finds it a bit difficult to always keep your attention.Overall
Overall, Minari is a great film. This film is really well acted and looks great, it is slower paced but is effective with its storytelling and I would recommend giving this is a shot especially if you are okay with subtitles."
MINARI,29 March 2021,10/10,"This film joins a long line of media that takes on immigrants assimilating into American culture. The Jungle, House of Sand and Fog, American Tale, Once Upon a Time in America, Brooklyn etc. Etc. All come to mind. This one stands apart both because it is centered on a Korean family and because it takes place in a rural area. (Jacob is fairly ""American"" in his distaste for cities). The film is a low-key intimate story that functions as a coming of age tale and a portrait of a family trying to make it. It is wonderfully observed-each member of the Yi family feels like a person you could meet. The grandmother-Soon-ja-especially is a striking character both because of the writing and the wonderful Youn Yuh-jung.The film has a quiet power to much of the proceedings-the emotional heft sneaks up on you; some it doesn't hit until long after the movie is over. The film is open ended in most of its plot threads-i.e. Does the family make it? Stay together?-but it has a completeness to it that slice of life films do. Chung-as writer and director-has a clear vision that makes it to the screen. This has the complexities and failings of the American experience. The film might be in Korean but it is rooted in a big part of what makes this country what it is-immigration."
MINARI,26 September 2021,6/10,"The story of a Korean family who move to rural USA in the 1980s to farm and sell Korean vegetables. The couples marriage is a little shaken, in part because of the move whilst their son has a potentially life threatening heart disease. They are later joined by the children's eccentric but loving grandmother.A small, often very slow drama which brings you in close to the difficulties facing the family, both in the farming project they have set themselves and the difficulties of the marriage - he the focussed hard working farmer, she putting family first including care of her son and the importance to her of her church. What is so clever here is that there are no typical nasty, racist neighbours, no melodramatic shouting matches and no over the top danger to the family scenes. Instead the problems seem real and are realistically depicted with great compassion and occasional good humour. As the grandma, the Oscar winning turn from Youn Yuh-jung adds a needed element of humour and pace which is somewhat at odds with the rest of the film, but it would probably have failed without it. A gentle experience when you're in the mood for such things."
MINARI,8 June 2021,9/10,I am very lucky to have watched this movie because it introduced me to Lee Isaac Chung. I haven't felt lucky to have watched a movie for a long time. I missed this feeling. I don't even care about the awards the movie won or was nominated for. It's not a measure of quality for me either. The movie made me feel things again that I thought I had forgotten. That's the only thing that matters.
MINARI,10 April 2021,7/10,"Yet another slice of life gem like Nomadland. The cinematography is pretty, portrayal of wildlife is decent. Yea, it's just another of those slow life films and I like it for that."
MINARI,20 January 2021,8/10,"This movie is such an incredibly moving and empathetic portrait of Korean-American family in search of their own American Dream. It's compassionately told, intimate drama filled with moments of innocence, pure joy and incredible sadness."
MINARI,24 January 2021,6/10,Feel like it's a story of 3rd generation of immigrants and it recalls from memories when they are young. It's full of emotion and traditional values of Asian family from this movie. It's not commercial kinda so don't expect big dramatic scene. Treat it as seeing how the immigrants in 80s life in a new country.
MINARI,17 March 2021,8/10,"Although by its end, it does prove to be a bit uneven, Minari is a very grounded, very nostalgic, and personal view of life in America- and at times the most beautiful looking movie of the year. Arguably what makes this film so great is its cinematography. It isn't just that we are shown so much pretty scenery from the countryside of Arkansas, but it also feels as if we are there, breathing in the country air, and running through the tall bright green grass. I relate to many things the Yi's went through throughout the film, growing up in the middle class, never being able to afford a 'house,' and other complex social issues and confrontations that come from that sort of life. Its representation of all the topics it deals with proves to not only be relatable and heartwarming, but also incredibly honest and anything but forced. The film has several good performances, most notably Youn Yuh-Jung who plays the Grandma in the film, as well as young actor Alan S. Kim, Steven Yeun, and the eccentric Will Patton. The film does seem to trail on quite a bit in the final third of the film, feeling over dramatic and somber because it feels like the story could have gone nowhere else. It feels as if the writers found themselves in a corner, but eventually, we make it to the ending itself, which is again incredibly sweet. In the end, Minari is far from the best picture of the year, but it's a thought provoking and important film nevertheless.
My Rating: 8.5/10"
MINARI,31 March 2021,8/10,"Minari follows a Korea family that move to an Arkansas farm in search of their own American Dream. The demographics change completely with the arrival of their funny , foul-mouthed, but incredibly loving grandmother who is brilliantly played by Youn Yuh-Jung but the star of the show for me is the little boy David played by Alan S Kim . A superb performance from someone so young .What I like about this film is although these people are Korean it could be anybody's family story .The mother and father fight over everyday things while bringing up their two children the best they can.Things go wrong and things go right but despite everything nearly falling apart they realise that they have each other and that family is the most important thing .Although its not really a comedy , I laughed out loud quite a few times , mainly at the Grandmother and grandsons comments but also at the mannerisms of Paul , the religious farm hand , played by Will Patton .I've seen many Korean films now ( I'm not sure this fits in that category ? ) and all have been fascinating and enjoyable and Minari is absolutely no different."
MINARI,27 July 2021,10/10,"Minari is a phenomenal drama about the struggles of starting a new life that's emotional, heartwarming and breathtakingly beautiful whilst also being earnest and funny. Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, Alan Kim, Noel Katie Cho and Yuh-Jung Youn are all perfect. Lee Isaac Chung's direction is incredible, it's extremely well filmed and consistently visually stunning. It's extremely well paced and the music by Emile Mosseri is amazing."
MINARI,17 January 2021,8/10,"IN BRIEF: A good movie with strong performances about one family's adaptation to a rural American way of life.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Achieving the American Dream is the end goal for Jacob, his wife Monica, and his family as they travel to rural Arkansas to start a farm. Jacob's daily obsession with his farm seriously affects his marriage as Monica tries to hold the family together and begins to resent her husband's new business venture. As they adjust to American customs, enter Soonja, a quirky grandma who causes further complications to Jacob's plan for success.Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. this autobiographic film is a personal project that has received many accolades and spots on numerous best film lists this year. While I enjoyed the film, I was slightly underwhelmed due to a meandering script and some pacing issues. The film starts off well as we follow this family's attempt to rise above poverty level and still remain a united clan. The overall story holds your interest, but failed to connect this reviewer emotionally with the Yi family and their plight. One expects direct consequences from some of the characters questionable actions, but they never surface in the narrative which addled me a bit. (Why add these plot complications into your story without following thru?)The quartet of actors is excellent. Steven Yuen is the proud and determined patriarch and Yeri Han is her steadfast wife. Their relationship is at war due to economic hardships and the failing health of their son. Both actors deliver strong work. Alan Kim plays David and he gives a wonderful natural performance that all but steals the movie. Noel Cho is fine as his caring sister Anne. But the main catalyst in this tale is the transported grandma and nanny. Yuh-Jung Youn is this character and her colorful foul-mouth character is at odds with most of the family members, especially David who takes an instant dislike to her. It is a showy role, but Ms. Youn breathes real life into this slightly clichéd role. Also adding some more interest is Paul (a winning Will Patton), a devout and slightly crazed local who befriends Jacob and tends the farm with him.The plot takes some surprising dramatic detours and builds to a strong conclusion. Like the Asian plant that entitles this movie, Minari is a well-made serving of domestic drama that celebrates the importance of family and tells its tale with much loving care. (GRADE: B)"
MINARI,12 February 2021,10/10,"Minari, a semi-autobiographical and earnest portrayal of an immigrant family, written and directed by Isaac Lee Chung, tugs at viewers' heartstrings and is surely a 2021 must-watch. The incredible starring cast, intricate storyline, poignant background score and perfectly punctuated cinematography all combine to make this Korean and English feature a beautiful masterpiece.The name of the film, Minari, is another name for Korean watercress, which is key to the plotline. When the story begins the Yi family had immigrated to the U.S. from Korea years ago; Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Ye-Ri Han), parents to David (Alan Kim) and Anne (Noel Cho), are chicken sexers by profession. The family moves from California to the Ozarks for new opportunities. Specifically, Arkansas, where they are greeted by their new yet run-down mobile home and by Paul, an eccentric evangelist. As they settle into their new home, problems in the family begin to set in. In the name of bringing back a bit of the family spirit, Monica invites her mother, Soonja (Yuh-Jung Youn), to come and stay with them. The foul-mouthed, cards-playing, yet adorable halmeoni (grandma in Korean) arrives and totally shakes things up, bonding with the grandkids over growing minari, playing cards, and watching wrestling. When tragedy strikes, though, the family is put through a resilience test like never before.Lee Isaac Chung took inspiration from his own childhood growing up on his parents' plot of land to create this film; it's personal, and it shows. This film is a ""the summer when everything changed"" type of story . Steven Yeun is, as always, masterful in encapsulating the minimal emotions and laconic speech of his character. Veteran Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn is my other favorite in this film; her character's feisty-yet-lovable grandma persona truly fits. She's an unwavering icon of the South Korean film industry and her experience shows. Also, the cinematography team for Minari, as well as the editing team, have worked meticulously to create a seamless viewing experience that accentuates emotions, waits for just long enough to switch scenes, and adds the perfect level of drama to every scene. Minari as a whole makes it feel like you're peeking into the Yi family's life-it's breathtaking.The Sundance Award-winning film Minari is a priceless portrait of resilience within family, of sticking together even through the hardest times, and of enjoying the smallest things in life. Minari has some mild language and there are certain religious elements that parents should watch out for.I give Minari 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults.

MINARI,24 October 2020,7/10,"Uplifting tale of Korean immigrants in USA. Underscores the role of parents/grandparents from an Asian perspective, respecting their contributions. As a film, it does not offer much. The only negative/confusing/nonscientific message--initially preferring common-sense over water-divining (or dowsing) and then later reversing that view. If the film was shot in Oklahoma, why does the script and the introduction by the child actor talk of Arkansas? The Sundance Jury evidently loved the tale and bestowed their award. The film is competing at the Denver film festival. Definitely a good independent film, with actor Brad Pitt as a producer."
MINARI,25 April 2021,,"Nominated for 6 Oscars (2021) in a field of equally lauded offering, this story of struggle, family and dreams is a winner. The story is unique yet classic, the performances are well articulated (Yuh-Jung Youn is phenomenal in her role), the struggle is real and the character arcs are poignant. I was once told I was stingy with my 10s, but this Oscar's Best Picture category is filled with them, even though they are all very different from each other. I give this film a 10 (captivating) out of 10. {Drama}"
MINARI,13 May 2021,8/10,"Minari is the story of a Korean-American family (the Yis) that moves to an Arkansas farm pursuing their own American Dream in the '80s. Things change completely with the arrival of their obnoxious, but incredibly caring grandmother (Youn Yuh-jung, the Academy Award well-deserved!). A semi-autobiographical account of writer-director Lee Isaac Chung's childhood, Minari feels authentic with carefully etched lead characters that emotionally connect with us. Han Ye-ri's Rain Song plays right from the first shot - we see a pair of curious eyes in David (Alan Kim) - setting the tone for the events to follow.Han Ye-ri also plays the character of Monica who hasn't fully bought into her husband Jacob's idea of moving away from California to live (and thrive) on a farm. She doesn't see the appeal in it, especially with David having a heart condition and hospitals being far away. Jacob (Steven Yeun) is hell-bent on proving that his decision was right, and is particularly optimistic about his farming choices. The children Anne and David accompany their parents to work at a nearby hatchery but are tired of seeing them constantly at loggerheads with each other over whose choices make more sense. Monica's belief that love trumps money in any scenario is something that Jacob struggles to relate to.Effortlessly tender writing fuels Minari. The entry of Soon-ja (the grandmother) adds so much to the film. The situational humour will make you laugh out loud (at least on a couple of occasions); the initial uneasy dynamic between grandson and grandmother is entertaining as well as thought-provoking. Soon-ja is foul-mouthed, watches tv at home in men's underwear, can't do most things regular grannies do and is trying to settle into her newfound environs. But David soon gets bowled over by her affection, and her little life lessons leave lasting impressions on him.The titular Minari is the name of an edible plant - one that the granny grows around the creek - a discernible metaphor that implies ""bloom where you are planted"". The climax is moving but I've seen many being unhappy about the film's closure - Lee Isaac Chung doesn't want viewers to think that the family is in dire straits, without hope. He also doesn't want his audiences to think that everything is fine in the end either. This story (of struggles and joys) is bound to continue in our heads."
MINARI,14 April 2021,3/10,"MinariI just cannot understand how we could have yet another rambling incoherent movie that says nothing. The first thing you learn as a script writer is ""all drama is the compression of reality over conflict"" but here we just had the incessant banality of everyday life and this was served up as entertainment.We had no compression, just a record of walking, breathing, looking, eating and sleeping. We had little or no character development and no character made any sort of emotional journey.I cannot believe the basic characteristic of Korean culture is misery, blame and retribution but that is all we were shown!The contrived nature of so much was absurd for example when granny was well she did nothing, but following a stroke she wanted to do everything. Monica played by Yeri Han did a series of blank expressions that conveyed nothing it was shocking acting.My final condemnation lays with this movie failing to arrive at any profound thought or postulate any depth at all. Families need to stick together, farms need water, life is a struggle, this is all so trite and unremarkable. Lastly it was all so derivative from far more thought provoking movies.The cinematography was comprehensive but panning shots and natural beauty make a natural history documentary and not a movie.I give this 3 out of 10, skip this rubbish as watching paint dry is more interesting!We had the shocking fraud of Roma and now this tripe, if anyone is suggesting Minari represents excellence in film is out of their minds and to award it an Oscar for anything other than cinematography does damage to the reputation of the film industry at a time when it's stories become ever more powerful. They must hang their heads in shame those that fraudulently promote this movie way above its true worth when it is obviously a turkey!"

MINARI,21 April 2021,,"At it's core, MINARI is a simple story of the American dream. A young nuclear immigrant family comes to the U. S. to seek a better life. And, what could better represent Americana than owning a farm? Director Lee Isaac Chung depicts that dream, but doesn't romanticize it, for he knows that the ideal, even when successful, comes through hard work, patience and perseverance.The Yi family has moved from Korea and has settled in a rural Arkansas town in the 1980s. Jacob (Steven Yeun) is a proud, determined father with a strong wife Monica (Yeri Han) and two young children, David (Alan Kim) and Anne (Noel Cho). Their home on the farm is a mere trailer (""it has wheels!"" the kids remark). It isn't a great start and the parents supplement their income by working at a local chicken coop. Soon additions to the nuclear family are an uber religious farmhand, Paul (Will Patton; gloriously loopy) and Grandma (Yuh-Jung Youn).Chung, who also wrote the script, isn't interested in melodrama, rather ,MINARI is an accumulation of details. The anecdotes of daily life. There is a story building, but, it's never in a hurry to announce itself. While the Yi family certainly stand out in ""hicksville"", their heritage never becomes the focal point. It just is. There are health issues and the ever-present struggles of farm life, but, again, they are just part of the landscape of life.The movie wouldn't work if the cast weren't up to the spare screenplay. Yeun is a steely force and Han matches him moment by moment leading up to a climactic scene between the pair. The kids are adorable in ways beyond the normal film-tyke sort of way. But, it is Youn who becomes the heart that binds not just the family, but, the movie itself. She and young David come up with a song when harvesting some Minari (a wild edible plant) and the key lyric is ""Wonderful, wonderful"" - an appropriate description of Granny.MINARI is a sweet slice of life movie, which may be a bit slow, but, it's lovely mood piece (which makes the slightly melodramatic climax stand out that much more). The acting and care which Chung brings to it, make it a warm and worthy one.Nominated for 6 Oscars including Picture, Director & Screenwriter (Chung), Yeun and Youn. And, for Emile Musseri's pleasant score."
MINARI,27 May 2021,5/10,"There was nothing wrong with Minari. It's a watchable film about a Korean family trying to make a living in the US outside of the original jobs they came to do when they arrived here. I can commend it because it's a film set in the 1980s that didn't feel the need to constantly scream that it took place in that time, and it didn't have the exaggerated Hollywood style of the 80s that often annoys me. I also appreciated that the grandmother wasn't what I expected, and added a different element to the family dynamic. If only the plot as a whole was as unique and interesting as some of those minor choices they made in the movie. Sadly, aside from these small things that I liked, the movie as a whole was a bit bland. I wasn't blown away by anything in the film, and found the ending horribly dissatisfying. I chuckled a few times, and was never annoyed, but I kept hoping for something more to the story. I didn't particularly need another movie to teach me that ""farming is hard."" Minari is a decent film, but far from one of my favorites of the year."
MINARI,18 May 2021,4/10,"I went in fully aware that this is usually not my type of movie and it wasn't likely to wow me. But from all the hype, award nominations, and solid cast I was hoping to be gladly surprised. I wasn't. This is exactly what I thought it would be: uneventful, slightly predictable, slow and boring. There are some good moments but there are too few of them for me to say I enjoyed this movie."
MINARI,14 November 2021,9/10,"In the early 1980s, a young Korean-American immigrant family has just moved from California to an Arkansas plot of land where father Jacob (Stephen Yuen) hopes to run a successful farm despite many risks and challenges.Director-writer Lee Isaac Chung has created a beautiful lyrical film based on his own childhood. At first, it seems the early scenes are a build-up to a stunning finale. Yet, those early scenes have a special depth on their own. Their varying moments and situations (hardship, fun, conflict, resolution) on family life and childhood can easily cause the viewer to recall similar recollections at the gut level. And yes, the finale truly is stunning.Despite Jacob's ambitions, his wife Monica (Han Ye-ri) is apprehensive about the risks Jacob is taking. Their conflict is universal and timeless: is it worth it to take risks for a better life financially or should one play it safe even if this means a lower ""station in life""? To the film's credit, both sides are given equal weight with no pat conclusions.Another credit to the film is in its depictions of rural people in Arkansas. While folks from the Deep South are often depicted as stupid, nasty rednecks in other stories, ""Minari"" doesn't go there which is a pleasant surprise.The quintet of actors making up the family do a great job individually and as an ensemble. In addition to Yuen and Han, the cast includes Noel Kate Cho as the pre-teen daughter, Alan Kim as her younger brother, and Youn Yuh-jung as the maternal grandmother (and multiple award winner for the film) who moves in with the family to care for the children while both parents are at work. - dbamateurcriticA film worthy of all its praise and accolades.RATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Lee Isaac Chung."
MINARI,11 May 2021,8/10,"One has to wonder if last year's Best Picture, Parasite (2019), helped pave the way for Minari (2020). While both are quite different films, the acceptance of South Korean cinema has been a long time coming. However, one thing both films share is their sense of foreshadowing. The subtle phrasings and actions of the characters seem inconsequential at first but evolve into hard-hitting plot points as the movie progresses. These story beats hit hard even with a relatively simple plot and left me emotionally devastated with each twist and turn.Set in 1980s America, Minari speaks into the evolution (or, some would say, death) of the American Dream. The belief that anyone from anywhere can come to this land of opportunity and make a living doing what they want to do is the strongest in the immigrants who came here hoping to capitalize on the United States' freedom. But, unfortunately, it's not as easy as finding an empty field and successfully starting a farm. Just when you think the Yi family can catch a break, something else breaks. Hardship rears its ugly head with every setback, pushing the dream just out of reach every time.The core of Minari is in the family unit, which includes bringing Grandma Soon-ja (Youn Yuh-jung) in to help. And while she is by far the best character in the film, it's only because she plays off the children so well. My only qualm with Minari is its portrayal of Christians, even though I've come to accept that these stereotypes are the norm for people of the faith. In the end, though, Minari is about perseverance and grit, two qualities we could stand to have more of in this modern society.An examination of the American Dream through an immigrant family's struggles, I give Minari 4.0 stars out of 5."
MINARI,25 April 2021,10/10,"Minari tells the story of a Korean family namely, Jacob(Steven Yeun), Monica(Yeri Han), their son David(Alan S. Kim) & their daughter Anne(Noel Cho). They start a farm in Arkansas, in the 1980s.Minari is an awe-inspiring film. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung has given us a movie filled with comedic & emotional moments, that leaves you feeling happy, in the end. This film is about the everlasting love of family. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Steven Yeun is fantastic as Jacob. Yeri Han is brilliant as Monica. Yeun & Han share this effortless chemistry, in all their scenes together. Alan S. Kim is adorable & outstanding as David. Noel Cho is phenomenal as Anne. Both Kim & Cho have knocked it out of the park, in their acting debut. Yuh-Jung Youn is spectacular as Soonja. The supporting cast is superb. Minari deserves all the awards love coming its way. One of my favorite Oscar nominees of 2021. Watch it, as soon as possible!"
MINARI,4 April 2021,7/10,"With it's 6 Oscar nominations (including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor), the drama MINARI has become a touchstone of films with Asian (or Asian-American) roots.And...it is worthy of these accolades - and this place in history - for MINARI is a warm-hearted, loving look at a Korean-American family trying to make it's way in the world in 1980's Arkansas.Written and Directed in Oscar Nominated fashion (for both categories), Lee Isaac Chung presents a realistic American family looking to forge a new living while still remaining true to their cultural roots.Steve Yeun (THE WALKING DEAD) is Oscar nominated for his lead role of Jacob, who moves his family to Arkansas in the hopes to start a farm that specializes in Korean food. Yeun's performance is earnest and sincere and I am happy for him that this performance is nominated. The rest of the family unit is strong - with the stand out being Yuh-Jung Youn as the Grandmother. She brings the most interesting and nuanced character to the screen and I wouldn't be surprised if she pulls the upset and wins the Oscar for Supporting Actress. Finally, veteran character Actor Will Patton is a spark of energy as a local who helps Jacob on the farm.And...that, ultimately, is the problem with this film. Writer/Director Chung spends most of his time creating the atmosphere and the characters, He fails to realize that there really is no compelling event to drive the plot forward. It's a ""fine"" slice-of-life film and one that is enjoyable to watch with a strong, charismatic cast, but nothing really happens and that, finally, is a problem.This is most certainly a deserving Oscar nominated film - especially in these pandemic times - with big budget Blockbuster films pushed to the sidelines, this type of quiet film is thrust to the forefront - and good for them and I'm glad that the spotlight is shining on this film. I just wish there was more plot and a more compelling reason to watch this film.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
MINARI,20 January 2021,10/10,"And that really bites! I love this guy, and though I don't know exactly what he was trying to tell me at the end it felt really profound and plucked at my heartstrings , I love his idea of family and how he juxtaposes functional with dysfunctional and blends the two so that we get a more interesting outlook on the family nucleus so much so that soon our interests are piqued at a fever pitch and intrigue is born! I loved it! I love the lil' boy , Asian Boy he was so nice!"
MINARI,11 May 2021,5/10,"The film feels like it drags on and on. The acting is good. But I only watched it all the way through because it was, i suppose, critically acclaimed. But I wasn't wowed nor can I say we really know this family by the end of the film. I am disappointed."
MINARI,23 April 2021,9/10,"In ""Minari"", a struggling Korean immigrant family - the Yi's led by Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) - leave California for Arkansas farmland to seek a better life. While employed sexing chicks at a factory, Jacob dreams of farming the land on which they live to improve their lives. But will his obsession for this dream stand between him and his family?The tale is told through the eyes of young David (Alan S. Kim), who is struggling with a hole in the heart and doubts about his mortality. The arrival of Monica's mother (Yuh-Jung Youn) is resented by David, but the woman is wise (as well as foul mouthed) and perhaps the pair will eventually learn to respect one another?Positives:
Gloriously bucolic cinematography (by Lachlan Milne) frames an engrossing story of an immigrant family striving for the American dream. The fact that it is semi-biographical for the writer/director Lee Isaac Chung (also Oscar nominated for both) makes it all the more fascinating.All of the leading cast work fabulously as an ensemble. Steven Yeun and Yuh-Jung Youn have all the Oscar nomination glory (with Youn as the Grandmother odds-on to win the Supporting Actress award on Sunday). But Yeri Han is also great and the film wouldn't work unless the two child actors (Alan Kim and Noel Cho) delivered, which they do in spades.The music, by Emile Mosseri, is strikingly good and - deservedly - also Oscar nominated.Negatives:
The ending. Now, I'm all for leaving things in a thoughtful way, allowing the viewer to ponder on things. But this ending was a little too obscure for me. You need to understand (with thanks to this article) that the vegetable Minari purifies (water), grows in unfavourable soils and only really thrives in its second season. Now, forgive me for not being 'up' on my Korean plant botany, but this was too much of a leap for me. For the uninitiated (I assume 95% of the audience) the ending will feel abrupt and unsatisfying.Summary Thoughts on ""Minari"":
Having watched ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and ""Minari"" on consecutive nights, I was struck by the unexpected parallels between the films (over and above the Yi's calling themselves ""Hillbillies""). Both feature a dysfunctional family (though less so here). And both also feature a lead character, from an impoverished background, trying to better themselves and follow the 'American dream'. And front and centre is the growing relationship between a young boy and their grandmother.But there the similarities end. For I just loved the simplicity of the story-telling in ""Minari"". No fancy flashbacks and disjointed timeline here. And a sense that you were really in on the journey of both Jacob and his farm and of the relationship between David and his Grandma.This was heading at one point for a 10 star rating for me. But - for me anyway - the obscurity of the ending left me with a ""WTF"" feeling. So I've tempered my rating. Still a great film though, and recommended.(For the full graphical review, please check out the post on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
MINARI,22 May 2021,7/10,"Review By Kamal KMinari is a beautiful family drama written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Infact, the storyline was inspired from Lee Isaac Chung's own life experiences back in early 1980s with the Korean immigrants family who lived tin Arkansas village. The film opens with a migrant Korean family moving from California to the green side of America near Arkansas to start their life by farming Korean vegetables. Steven Yean play the American Dream Father- Jacob Yi, Yeri Han play the role of Monica- A skeptical wife who is not happy with husband's decision. Alan. S. Kim and Noel Cho play the roles of loving kids as David and Anne. The life of this story and film has to be the grandmother Soon-ja played by Academy award winner Youn Yuh Jung who won the best supporting artist for this film. She basically come from Korea with some money and Minari seeds to take care the kids especially the 7 year old David who is undergoing a minor heart problem.Minari is basically an ordinary story of a struggling family who tries to live the American dream life. But what makes it a masterpiece is the way the characters are sketched and how they connected together when they encounter tough time in their struggling life. Director Lee beautifully show the family dynamics and differences in chasing their dream. There is always a rift between Jacob and Monica from the beginning which is impacting the harmony of family with their endless fights. However, towards the end when there is a crisis and life threat, both of them join hands instantly to rebuild the family which was brillantly portrayed in the climax through a single shot.The relationship between the Korean Grandma and American born David is gracefully narrated like a poem. Initially, David finds her Grandma as a misfit for the family but their love blossom slowly while sorting out their differences. Undoubtedly, the best part of the film can be experienced when both of them appear on screen. The Minari seeds is basically used as a metaphor to show how life is so simple but how we make it complicated with our unfair expectations. The conversation about this message was beautifully shown on screen with a poetic touch.The film has a different perspective when we relate the story through each character. For instance, Father of the family has a genuine expectation of being a successful farmer whereas the Mother holds the root of the family structure and take care the sick boy and daughter. The kids are actually neutral and not able to take sides of their parents. However, all these differences are sorted out with a surprising twist at the end which is heartbreaking but director justified the climax with the life of the Minari plants.The major portion of the film was filmed in natural lighting and you will not find a flaw in a single shot. The wide angle shots of the sun rise and the green farm land is visually appealing and mesmerizing. Kudos to the writer director for sketching some awesome poetic lines to describe the art of living. All the dialogues between Grandma and David is very effective to bring out the core theme of the film.Overall, Minari is well crafted masterpiece which portrays the different shades of family dynamics. The film is slow paced but you need to absorb each character frame by frame to experience an exhilarating family drama."
MINARI,28 July 2021,8/10,"Korean cinema is undergoing somewhat of a renaissance in the past decade with release after release being critically acclaimed.I can think of films like Snowpiercer, Parasite and The Handmaiden.In Minari it has a heartwarming tale of Korean immigrants living the American dream somewhat.Originally settled in a California city environment a family move to a plot of land in Arkansas to set up a farm growing vegetables for Korean immigrants.The film starts of slow but don't let that deter you it turns into a great tale and has interesting characters including a family dynamic that develops including the addition of an older mother in law for a bit of light relief.The ending is a bit of a tragedy really however it epitomizes the struggles of the main character Jacob (Steven Yeun) throughout the story.Director Lee Isaac Cheung deserves plaudits for this film. In such a depressing cinematic environment in 2020-21 the film rightly got award recognition being up for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.In a year of few releases I can categorically say that Minari is a delightful release."
MINARI,12 March 2021,4/10,"If you want my honest review this is a boring film. Just seemed a little lazy with no resolution. This movie was obviously wrongly categorized, it's an American movie!!! Brad Pitt is executive producer.. It's over-hyped & not a masterpiece like Parasite. Director/writer has skill (and in making good talent/actors shine), and perhaps his future films could be better and more deserving. Migrants in, it's boring stuff. South Korea makes some of the best. overrated movie."
MINARI,19 March 2021,10/10,"My Review- Minari-
My Rating 10/10
The Minari film posters tell us ""This is the movie we need right now "" and I'm inclined to agree with that statement.""
"" Minari ""is unusual these days in that it follows a narrative right through to the end simply and without pretentious cleverness. In a world of movies when many skip back and forth in time with multiple story lines and characters it's refreshing to just really get acquainted with a family especially a family from another culture.Minari was filmed in just 25 days in Tulsa Oklahoma at an inconceivable production cost of $2 million dollars which it had already more than doubled.
The acting of the entire cast is superb I've already awarded The Best Supporting Actress Oscar to Youn Yuh-Jung who plays Soon Jah the Grandma who's Grandson David ( Alan S. Kim ) who is also superb in his role as Jacob's son . He tells Soon Jag that ""You're not a real Grandma.because you can't bake cookies and tell stories.
Youn Yuh-Jung proves him wrong and introduces David and the audience to Minari or Korean Celery or Water Dropwort that the film gets its title and heart from.No spoilers or plot lines from me except just the outlineYearning to own a small patch of land and be more than a chicken sexer, the ambitious paterfamilias, Jacob Yi, relocates his Korean-American family, sceptical wife, Monica, and their children, David and Anne, from California to 1980s rural Arkansas, to start afresh and capture the elusive American Dream.
With this film, Steven Yeun who is cast as Jacob a Korean man with a dream becomes the first Asian-American and first person of East Asian descent to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
There are so many great acting performances and Best Films nominated this year that I really couldn't predict who or what film will win but Minari , it's star it's co Star and Director Lee Isaac Chung certainly are all worthy contenders.
Some members of The Minari cast aren't nominated but also give exceptional performances Yeri Han as Monica ,Jacob's wife who wonders how the hell did her family end up in Hillbilly Country and also Will Patton as Paul a kind hearted but crazy
Cross carrying Evangelist that works hard on Jacob's farm encouraging him not to give up and give in on his dream.
Lee Isaac Chung originally wanted to write an adaptation of My Antonia by Willa Cather but found out that Cather did not wish for people to make film adaptations of her works so he decided and inspired to make a film about his own rural upbringing.
Both Writer and director of Monaro Lee Isaac Chung wrote in the Los Angeles Times about how he came to write Minari. He was about to start teaching full time for the sake of his family and thought he would write one final script in the few months before the job began. Desperate for inspiration, he closed his eyes at his regular coffee shop and the words ""Willa Cather"" rang in his ears. Looking her up, he saw she was a novelist who wrote about life on the Great Plains, and he fell in love with her novel My Antonia. He learned that Cather initially imitated famous novelists who wrote about city life, thinking her own rural experience wouldn't be accepted. She felt unfulfilled and then wrote successful rural stories that were true to herself. She said, ""Life began for me, when I ceased to admire and began to remember."" Reflecting on this, Chung said, ""I wondered if the voice was leading me to these words, so that I would begin to trust in my own. As an exercise, I devoted an afternoon to writing my memories of childhood. I remembered our family's arrival at a single-wide trailer on an Ozark meadow and my mother's shock at learning that this would be our new home. I recalled the smell of freshly plowed soil and the way the color of it pleased my father. I remembered the creek where I threw rocks at snakes while my grandmother planted a Korean vegetable that grew without effort. With each memory, I saw my life anew, as though the clouds had shifted over a field I had seen every day. After writing 80 memories, I sketched a narrative arc with themes about family, failure and rebirth. That's how I got the idea to write 'Minari'; it began for me, when I ceased to admire and began to remember.""
Lee Isaac Chung receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Director, along with Chloé Zhao for Nomadland (2020), marks the first time two directors of East Asian descent have been nominated in the category in the history of The Academy Awards.
Go see Minari but see it in a Cinema it's an intimate film with subtitles and needs to be seen on the Giant Screen rather than reading the subtitles off a television screen and missing the impact of the film."
MINARI,20 March 2021,8/10,"Minari is an equal parts universal and humane family-centric story heartfelt immigrant story that explores the American Dream with effortless sensitivity by emphasising the necessity of strenuous labour to achieve a fulfilling livelihood, all the while emanating wholesome vibes mostly distilled from a sense of childlike wonder. I just hoped it didn't resort to melodrama at the end, as that sort of betrayed its naturalistic approach that kept the movie afloat, in the first place, from succumbing to its conventional plot.(8/10)"
MINARI,7 April 2021,6/10,"Well performed and executed. The people all appear very real and believable. So that is all wel written. But the overall story is just really slow and mundane. It's this slowburn, just like real life, and that doesn't really make it entertaining.6/10: good but quite slow and boring."
MINARI,7 April 2021,8/10,"By one unfeigned tale about an immigrant family from Korea; ""Minari"" intently showcases sacrifice, hardship & familial value more than anything. A truer delineation of the grim realities one might face in the midst of living their 'American Dream'.""Remember what we said when we got married? That we'd move to America and save each other?""Let me start off with much-deserved praise for the entire ensemble! Some exemplary work has been carried out by each member of the cast. In particular Yuh-Jung Youn as the Grandma! What an unerring act from such a legendary figure.Typically, I discuss performances in the latter part of my reviews; yet I couldn't help but make an exception here. Simply because all these enactments are unquestionably the major asset in this whole undertaking!Storywise, on top of sly humor; the comprehensive point of view has been ever so grounded! A rather practical take on what does it actually cost to make a fresh start in the United States, clearly geared towards the immigrant population!As the Screenplay appears sluggish and faineant at times, therefore; redundancy crept through in an otherwise sound narration. Suffice it to say; the pacing should have been better! My main grudge whatsoever.On a more technical note; it's been quite stupefying in simplest terms!Green valleys spread across the purview with a lone house on its wheels in the middle of nowhere. A secluded spot miles away from the urban civilization astutely depicting the exact solitariness this 'Yi' family abides by. Alongside a relatively somber Score contributing to the said cause.In brief, it may not be a perfect execution per se; but that doesn't mitigate all the underlying lessons it wants us to reflect upon. An elegant piece of work that reverberates with a humane story above all else."
MINARI,6 January 2021,8/10,"Beautiful little movie about the difficulties of a foreign family, yet already originated int he USA, starts a new life on a farm. And no the farm life itself bears the difficulties.
it is a very personal and calm film full of beautiful characters that you care from the first to the last minute. That is the biggest magic of the film, thanks to the wonderfully written screenplay which has to be one of the very bests of the year. Steven Yeun is great in the leading role of the father who tries to balance his family with his new repsonisibilities. It is a father who wants to prove his family he can succeed but gets permanently mistaken that all he Is doing is just for the wellbeing. Its a very subtle performance but Yeun understood it to the core and played it naturally. With all the praise he is receiving there is not much word of Yeri Han who was in my opinion equally good. I think she lacks the notice as she has the much less likelier character at hands but the performance and the way she shows herself off against Yeun is fantastic and definitely deserves more acclaim. The heart and soul of the film is undoubtely Alan S. Kim who is not only cute as hell but also turns into a really fantastic and adorable performance. I hope we see more of him in the future.
Another great mention goes to that lady who gave in my opinion the best performance in the film: Youn Yuh-jung. She has a character with very different facettes at hand and that undergoes a very difficult development. She is really wonderful, and from her first funny moments to her last rather deptful moments she is outstanding. Hopefully she receives that Oscar nom.
A beautiful score, great cinematography and editing round it up to a nice ""follow up"" to ""Parasite"" in regards of Hollywood's new found love with Korean cinema (although this was indeed an American production)"
MINARI,25 February 2021,8/10,"""Minari"" a drama film written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Starring Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri, it shows a poignant, often heartfelt look at one family's attempt to assimilate into their newly adopted homeland.In the 1980s, the Korean American Yi family, consisting of Jacob (Steven Yeun), his wife Monica (Han Ye-ri), and their children Anne (Noel Kate Cho) and David (Alan Kim), move out to the Arkansas countryside with the intent of starting a farm growing Korean vegetables for stores in other states. Although Jacob is confident everything will go according to plan, Monica is worried that he has taken a huge gamble with their family's future, causing them to frequently argue in front of the kids. Jacob and Monica eventually arrange to bring the latter's mother Soon-ja (Youn Yuh-jung) over from South Korea to look after Anne and David while they are busy tending to the farm and getting used to the American way of life.It seems recently there has been an influx of Asian movies and western ones by Asian filmmakers that have gained considerable mainstream attention. Such examples include ""The Farewell"", a nice little story about family tradition and moral judgement, and the Oscar winning ""Parasite"", a scathing critique on social class and structure. All of these films are successful in not only being entertaining but also in conveying how the west has accepted Asian culture alongside its own. ""Minari"" should now be added to that growing list of films as it deservedly earns such a place due to its realistic depiction of an Asian American family doing what they can to pursue their dreams. We see that despite the hardships they often face, the Yi family admirably push forward in their achieving their goals in an environment completely different to what they are used to. Most importantly, what I found so interesting is that we could easily see them as any hard working American family trying to make ends meet, regardless of their ethnicity. This is noteworthy because it is a reminder of how diverse America has become as a result of multiculturalism and that it has helped build it into the global empire it is today.I admired the minimalistic direction and production values that Lee Isaac Chung chose for this film. In doing so, he's made it feel more raw in how it depicts rural life in Arkansas, from Jacob finding water for his crops to his family interacting with the white townsfolk who have clearly never seen Asian people up close before. While the film's straightforward plot isn't anything groundbreaking, this seems like it's more about the people and situations rather than an in depth journey of self discovery. In addition to this, we see the family communicating among themselves in both their native Korean and in English, which reminded me of ""The Farewell"", where that film's protagonist would talk to her Chinese extended family in Mandarin but English to her American friends. It should also be noted that the parental characters here primarily speak Korean while the children are seen speaking English most of the time, as they are established as being the first generation born in America.All of the family members were played well by their respective actors, with both Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri being the standouts as Jacob and Monica. It makes me happy to see that Yeun is getting plenty of post-Walking Dead roles as he was one of my favourite characters on that show and his talent is being appropriately utilised. For her first American film, Han Ye-ri did a great job as well, swapping between the Korean and English languages flawlessly, especially during scenes where Monica and Jacob were arguing with each other. Special mention should also go to Youn Yuh-jung as Soon-ja, Monica's elderly mother who makes the trip from South Korea to the United States in order to help look after her grandchildren. Like Han, this is Youn's first American film and it was cute to see her interact with Anne and David in broken English as she adjusts to life in a foreign country.In the end, a film like this makes me want to see even more stories of Asian families living in western countries. This isn't necessarily because of the fish-out-of-water setting but instead from how interesting it is to see different cultures mingling with one another. Being Asian myself (I'm half Malaysian from my dad's side), it did strike a chord with me to see people similar to my own family going through situations they could very well be experiencing had they immigrated to the west. Countries like America have thrived on a variety of cultures influencing their identity, so a film like this will always be there to remind us of the important impact they have left on history.I rate it 8/10"
MINARI,4 April 2021,8/10,"Sometimes simple is captivating. Much like ""In America"" two decades ago, this film knows that a single family's story of surviving and becoming in this country is more than enough. So many scenes from this film will stick with me, just as the minari herb took root in the soil. I felt all the angst, heartbreak, and joy of this family's story. Little Alan Kim helped with that, but every performance contributed. It is so easy for small towns or immigrant families to become caricatures, but every moment here was real, human, and lasting."
MINARI,24 May 2021,9/10,"Well you can tell from the opening shots that this is going to be a joy. Beautifully shot, calming score, a nice young Korean family starting a new adventure in 1980s Arkansas. Jacob (Steven Yeun) has a dream to build a farm on the land they've bought, a 'Garden of Eden'. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) is less impressed with the trailer they'll live in and it worried how far from the city they are... and the hospitals, their young son David (Alan S. Kim) has a heart condition. Nevertheless, they've hope and seem sensible, resourceful. God I hope they're okay. It's not fancy, but uses the landscape to paint a picture of idyllic potential. Beautiful sunshine, lush earth, a family learning to enjoy it's freedom. There's tension though, both with David's health and the marriage of his parents. You'd think that maybe the arrival of Monica's mother would add to the simmering unease, but Grandma (Yuh-Jung Youn) is an absolute treasure. David, born in America is reluctant, but Grandma and her Korean traditions wins him over. In many ways it's David and his Grandma that's the central story, but it's a broad tapestry of family dynamics and social interactions. Even with Paul (Will Patton) a crazy Bible enthusiast that helps Jacob on his farm. It's sweet, charming and funny. From Paul carrying his cross on Sundays to David's instance that Soonja isn't a real Grandma because she doesn't bake cookies (but does lift money from the church collection plate). She's the spirit of adventure, a reckless abandon in her very nature. It's exactly what David needs in his life. What they all need. Family is all you need. It's not action packed, but there's real heart and drive to this. That's not easy to capture, but director Lee Issac Chung does superbly. It looks gorgeous too and the acting is fantastic right across the cast. It's not all joyful, but there's a subtlety to even the darker moments and even when things get really bad. It will make you smile, it'll make you cry. Come the end I'm beaming through the tears. It's wonderful. Truly wonderful."
MINARI,24 October 2021,4/10,"Well I really wanted to like this movie. I really really really wanted to like this movie. When the credits rolled at the end did I really like it? Not really... story was somewhat original but man it was slow going. I give the cast an ""A"" for effort but that's pretty much where it ends. Sorry but wanted more but just didn't get it. Really..."
MINARI,9 April 2021,9/10,"Ever since Minari got a very positive response from the Sundance Film Festival, I wanted to see it. Now having seen it, I can say Lee Isaac Chung is a director to look out for.Minari shows us a Korean family in the 1980s that moves to Arkansas to start a farm.With Minari, Lee Isaac Chung proves his worth as a writer and director. This is a beautiful and touching experience about family and struggle. It's a film that made me happy, laugh and hopeful throughout its story. This cast did such a brilliant job with their roles and I loved each of the characters. Steven Yeun's career is growing and growing as he delivers a fantastic performance as Jacob. Yeri Han also does a great job as Yeun's wife. The conflict built between these two characters is communicated so well through both of their performances leading to some very emotional sequences. I'm always skeptical towards child performances but I thought Alan Kim and Noel Kate Cho were great. A standout was Yuh-jung Youn as the grandma who I found really fun to watch. The bond she builds with Alan Kim's character was so heartwarming and interesting. All of these actors collectively do a great job at making this family seem real. I didn't feel like I was watching actors but rather an actual family going through trials and tribulations.Lee Isaac Chung's direction and writing is terrific. He conveys the struggle this family goes through in a beautifully quiet and subtle manner. The way he establishes conflict between certain characters and how it builds to the film's amazing climax is well executed. The cinematography is stunning and in conjunction with the score by Emile Mosseri acts like it tells the emotion and story in its own way. The score in particular stands out by creating a wholesome atmosphere to the world of Minari. My only gripe is the pacing. For most of the time I wasn't bothered by it but at points I felt the slowness.All in all, Minari is a touching and personal film from Lee Isaac Chung. I truly felt his heartfelt and hopeful story of Korean immigrants in pursuit of the American dream. It's well made and acted really well making Minari a success for Chung and A24."
MINARI,3 January 2021,8/10,"It's not my favourite movie of the year, but I wouldn't be sad if this wins BP. Unlike another big favourite (Nomadland), here I can see tension, I can see a story, I can see a direction and not just beautiful images. Unlike another favourite (Mank), here I can see passion, I can feel the warm, I can feel emotions. It's a very powerful story, a touching drama, that makes you think about choices, about family, about work, about life.It doesn't deserve 9/10 because in comparison to (for example) Parasite, I never had that sensation of WOW that I had several times watching that masterpiece. There are several movies in Asia (especially South Korea and Japan) who did it as well or better than Minari in the last years, but, as an American film, I must recognise that this is one of the best dramas in the last years. I would prefer a different ending, it felt a bit like ""is it over?"", but it's acceptable.Amazing performance by Youn Yuh-jung (please give her that supporting actress Oscar) and very good job by Steven Yeun (but I still think he was even better in Burning), Yeri Han and Will Patton. The kids did also an excellent job. Good score and good cinematography also."
MINARI,4 August 2021,8/10,"This is a great grounded film with a loveable/relatable family. The characters have been portrayed perfectly by the actors, the cinematography is a pleasure to look at, and it's solidly directed. The conflict amongst the family works to in favour of the story, followed by highs of achievement and then lows of failure, but that is how life brings out true character."
MINARI,18 January 2021,10/10,"""Remember what we said when we got married? That we'd move to America and save each other?""A24 always has that one film each year that's so incredibly moving. Last year they gave us The Farewell among the success of The Lighthouse and Midsommar. Because those two are so popular, it's hard not to ignore the fact that it's under appreciated, especially after the Oscar snubs. In a year where they haven't released much due to many scheduling changes, Minari, thankfully, doesn't fall under that circumstance. I adored Minari and all that it had to offer. The plot is fairly simple. A Korean family moves to Arkansas to start a farm in the 1980s. Sometimes it's the simplest of stories that touch our hearts the most. I love how simple of a story it is. It never feels too overbearing or trying to do more than it's capable of. Because of the simplicity, the screenplay comes off natural. It's a very honest look at a life that undergoes a brand new lifestyle. This family changes almost completely from moving from California to Arkansas. The people are different, the surroundings, just everything in general. Add in the complications of an unsatisfied marriage and a grandmother coming to live with them after them being gone for so many years, and you have a great screenplay. Lee Isaac Chung's screenplay is a must for a nomination otherwise that would be a criminal offense, just like The Farewell. Even director would be great. His direction is practically flawless in my eyes. I couldn't see anyone else tackling this story but him. It's the way he translates the tone from the screenplay to the screen that's so incredibly wonderful. I felt emotional even at times that aren't meant to be sad. There's always a connection to character and story.The acting is phenomenal from this great ensemble. The two kids, David and Anne, are really good. Never did they have a bad scene or trouble with acting. We spend more time with David and grow an extreme attachment to him. Alan S. Kim is now my favorite child actor. What's more amazing is his chemistry with Youn Yuh-jung. Youn Yuh-jung plays the grandma that we all love. Again, going back to The Farewell, Zhao Shuzhen had the lovable grandma and had a huge Oscar snub. With our pool of supporting actresses right now, I believe she is a lock and after the snub for The Farewell Last year they will do their best to make it up. She's definitely my favorite supporting actress of the year and I don't know how anyone could be disappointed. Yeri Han is significantly overlooked right now. I loved her development and point of view of everything going on. She's worried about the future and wants to keep the family together, but her husbands opposing views add to the complication. There's a couple scenes that are the perfect Oscar-bait scenes. But it seems the spotlight is being put on Steven Yeun since Youn Yuh-jung is already a lock. Steven Yeun, though campaigned in lead, feels a little more supporting, but that doesn't take away from his incredible performance. This is by far my favorite of his. His optimism of a better life throughout for sure gives the feel-good effect. He puts so much work into farming and trying to keep the family together that it's complicated for us as well. You can't choose a side. All we can do is hope for the best in the end.Technically, this is a beautiful film. The cinematography is pretty to look at. There's all these nature shots that take you into the life of the farm. The production of the 80s aesthetic is great. Even without being told that it's the 80s at any point (I believe), you can just tell, especially with the house and costumes as subtle as they can be. By far, my favorite aesthetic is Emile Mosseri's score. This is some of the best we've heard all year. Everything about it is so beautiful. Mosseri has this distinct style that I don't know how to describe. All I can say is it's unique where you haven't heard anything like it. Minari has a beautiful aesthetic across the board. It's extremely close to a perfect score, but I wanted a little more from it at a couple moments. This sort of goes back to the simplistic approach. But I just adore this film. I laughed, I cried, I felt good, I felt bad. Most importantly, I felt emotional and attached to the point that I didn't want it to end. By the way, the ending is phenomenal. I urge everyone to see Minari to experience the beauty of film. This is the best film of the year."
MINARI,18 June 2021,8/10,"Minari hits on all levels of family, dreaming, moving, success and failure, love and respect. Incredibly well written story of a Korean family trying their hand at a new life in Arkansas."
MINARI,30 June 2021,9/10,"Minari is such a beautiful film.Visually it is stunning, with every camera angle, every shot, every frame crafted with love and great attention to detail. The cinematography and direction can't be faulted. The score compliments the themes and emotional journal of the film perfectly, heightening the experience to its fullest extent as any great score should.The acting is superb. A deserved Academy Award for Youn Yuh-jung and a brilliant performance from the young actor Alan Kim as the son David. Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri as the parents of the family were superbly played, drawing you into their life and their marriage from the get go. Almost immediately you felt like knew both of them and were straight away involved in their story.The plot is so rich in emotion and drama, and is incredibly engaging. The storytelling is superb and connects you with the characters and the family in such a tight and close way.Minari is one of those films where when you finish it you need to take a breath, sit there, and let it all sink in. Fantastic."
MINARI,1 June 2021,8/10,"This is the story of a Korean family chasing the American Dream in 1980s Arkansas. The father of the family, Jacob Yi hopes to one day own a farm full of Korean produce. His wife isn't so sure of the plan. And the story unrolls as the family tries to make the dream happen. It's such a real story, full of the hopes and pains of life, especially family life.The actors playing the kids are great, the grandma is great, and the crazy religious dude (played by Will Patton, who I did not recognize!) is great! Sexing chickens as a job (turning chicks over one at a time to inspect their genitals, then sorting them by sex)! Mountain Dew as 'mountain water'! Just a good movie! It is slow at parts, and I didn't love the ending, but I totally understand why this film got so much praise! Well done!"
MINARI,24 March 2021,9/10,"'Minari' is not confined to the story of Korean immigrants, Asian immigrants, or American dream. It is dedicated to all the parents in the world who left home for a better future and who sacrificed themselves to guarantee their children 'better lives'. Everyone becomes such a fool in a foreign situation. For example, when I first came to a college in America, I could not answer simple questions any American elementary school students can such as my favorite cereal (I do not eat cereal for breakfast in Korea) or how to order food (they ask so many questions) just because it was different not because I was stupid. I could totally empathize with parents' struggles to adapt to a new setting, painfully realistic in the movie. This lack of confidence and feeling small in a new environment are universal and relatable to audience and well-represented by the actors and well-delivered to the audience.Acting in 'Minari' is just admirable. There are not much burst of emotions, but portraying different emotions in everyday life in a subtle and refined way is more difficult and realistic. Not many people contort their faces or wails with loud voices when they are sad. Some people try to hold it in and express sadness in reserved way. When Monica tells Jacob she cannot go on, their acting is so ordinary that it becomes extraordinary. At that moment, I can feel exactly how they feel, and there is no screen blocking me and them. Will Patton's performance is also exquisite addition to the family. Paul is one peculiar and bizarre character among rather familiar and quiet characters. However, somehow he manages to fit in and persuades audience I have encountered that neighbor so pure at heart but hard to understand.What I like most about Chung's directing in 'Minari' is how he uses the nature. Of course the setting is at farm, but using the nature to create certain atmosphere is another level. After the scenes with sadness or conflict, sunlight is especially emphasized, creating warmth, positivity, and hopefulness. Observing the use of the light and appreciating picturesque sight are another way of enjoying this film.Many who are accustomed to blockbusters and dramatic stories post negative reviews and claim Minari is not 'Oscar-worthy'. However, 'Minari' is the stream that looks motionless from outside but fierce and rapid inside. The swirl of emotion you feel after the movie is hard to describe, and it is a better experience than awe and excitement you feel after the film with advance technology in my opinion."
MINARI,30 April 2021,7/10,"A film about childhood, family and the korean american dream. The digferences between Korea and America is shown in a lovely way. Sadly the big bang in form of great tension is not there. Anyway a good movie. The Korean American Dream with all its faces."
MINARI,12 April 2021,9/10,"Never digs that deep into its themes or characters but from the first touches of its gorgeous score and cinematography, it's clear that its soil is rich with life. Comedy and drama (see David and Grandma's volatile relationship), spirit and mind and body (see the various farming tasks), giving and taking (see the offering plate), hope and despair (see the city visit), destruction and reconciliation (see the fire)--it all intermingles in the poignantly simple story about a family building a home.8.5/10."
MINARI,15 February 2021,10/10,"MINARI is a beautifully written film, full of images and symbols that accrue layers of meaning as the story unfolds. It is sensitively directed, lovingly photographed, compassionate and compelling. The acting ensemble is flawless. There really is nothing to dislike.
More, please."
MINARI,16 April 2021,9/10,"Minari is a quietly beautiful story of a Korean family moving to Arkansas to start up a farm. This was such a sweet and moving story, so relatable to me, not because I am an ethnic immigrant, just that it reminded me of my own family moving when I was five. Anyone who has had a childhood could probably find something to relate to here. It's not showy or flashy, it presents its story in a realistic manner that only heightens its affect. It's more concerned with characters than story. Their life is the story.Little Alan S. Kim is a huge star on the rise, a great kid actor. Yuh-jung Youn is the wacky but sweet grandma, trying so hard to be ""good grandma."" Steven Yeun is powerful as the the father trying to make a better life for his family. Will Patton is quite good as the very religious and kindly farm hand. Best of luck to Yuh-jung Youn and Steven Yeun at the Oscars, really rooting for Steven, big fan of his work on The Walking Dead for years."
MINARI,14 April 2021,7/10,"""Minari"" narrates the story of a Korean family migrated to rural America and their hardship to meet the ends against the marital discord existence confronts. In the landscape of rural America including the farms and creeks, the family grows Korean fruits and the weed ""Minari"" brought from Korea.The theme begets the family values over all, which the climax resorts to. Well, this year's Oscar contender drama is a heart felt family drama with amusing characters, brilliant performances, and mesmerizing picture frames, which you definitely want to go for again. A bit sprawling in its pace, the film deserves the undisturbed attention to appreciate its human theme.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4."
MINARI,21 August 2021,7/10,"In the latest crop of Academy Award nominees for best picture, 'Minari' stood out as a little engine that (almost) could. The feel-good family drama that follows a South Korean family to Arkansas in hopes of starting a farm is an emotional rollercoaster that hits on many different themes, from assimilation to familial bonds and identity.What really makes 'Minari' work is its cast. Led by Steven Yeun, the family at the center of the film is an underdog that must find its footing in rural America, and the actors bring this feeling of vulnerability to life. In addition to Yeun, Yeri Han, Alan S. Kim and Noel Cho all give amazing performances, but it's Soonja (Yuh-Jung Youn) who steals the show as the offbeat, wacky grandma. This portrayal earned her an Oscar for best supporting actress, which is a well-deserved honor that speaks for the success of the whole cast.But it's not just the acting that makes 'Minari' what it is. The stunning cinematography that showcases the beauty of rural America is unexpected but refreshing, and the dialogue that toggles between Korean and English is sharp and witty, especially any scenes with Soonja and her grandchildren, specifically David. The love the family has for each other is special, despite the pressures that are felt, and the climax is memorable and touching.Lee Isaac Chung should be proud of 'Minari,' as should anyone who had something to do with bringing it to life."
MINARI,18 April 2021,6/10,"I liked the plot and characters are well developed. Interactions between members of this Korean family feel believable, especially the constant conflict between Jacob and Monica, that have different aspirations in life. The grandmother contributes to increase the tension within the family, even if she never says or does something wrong. The relationship between her and the kids starts off pretty roughly, but then improve, gifting some genuine funny moments. However I think that screenwriter and director Lee Isaac Chung, did not used her full potential. She could have been much more.Despite being an American production, the movie is in Korean, with the exception of a few lines in English. I have enjoyed this choice, as it makes the film more realistic and contributes to immerse the audience more. The overall acting is good and I was actually very surprised by Alan S. Kim, that despite his young age, delivered a nice performance.The feature film feels very bland on the middle section, there are a lot of redundant scenes that lead absolutely nowhere and basically stop the flow. Then things start to get better again towards the end. I did not like at all how the whole thing wrapped. At a certain point you see that tensions between the married couple reach the point of no return, their life visions is too different and I really thought that they were going to split up. Unfortunately they decided to go with the average happy ending. A big letdown.This is an enjoyable and solid film with a good script, however it was definitely over acclaimed. The fact that it was produced by Brad Pitt and distributed by A24, doesn't make ""Minari"" a masterpiece, far from that. Beside this, I suggest to give it a watch."
MINARI,28 March 2021,4/10,"Although the film has a message which is strong for me, the film seemed to me quite weak, not to say bad."
MINARI,14 August 2021,5/10,I don't know what all the fuss is about this film. I found the story long and pointless at times. The acting was amazing but that's about it.
MINARI,30 June 2021,6/10,"Minari was a little bit of a disappoint for me. Generally, films like these usually have a meaningful message, or a meaningful ending, but Minari felt empty. It just ends abruptly as if its story had been complete when in fact it really wasn't. I can see what they were going for (something similar to the ending of No Country for Old Men), but it didn't work nearly as well.Aside from the movie feeling incomplete, it does have some good qualities. First, the film was very well produced: the cinematography, editing, pacing, the overall execution was great. The acting was top notch too, like really, really good; the emotions during the divorce scene was so well acted. But, I have to disagree with Yuh-Jung Youn's performance. I think she played the character perfectly, but her performance was certainly not award winning. The Oscar win felt forced, as if it had to win no matter how good the other performances were. So, if you're going into this movie expecting a mind-blowing performance by Yuh-Jung Youn, then prepare to be underwhelmed.Minari had a great story concept, but it ended up feeling hollow. It was very well made in almost every category, but since it's lacking a powerful ending, I'm giving it a 6. It's slightly overrated, but definitely a film worth checking out."
MINARI,2 February 2021,,"As a Chinese-American man, whose parents first arrived in Texas before moving to New York, I see a lot of my family in this film. The relationship Jacob and Monica is familiar. Along with the 80s rural setting and interaction between Monica and Soon-Ja. I too was forced to drink foul Chinese medicine soup growing up. And, I too, had a secondary caretaker - in my case an older aunt - in addition to my parents. While a lot of the elements of the film resonated with me, for me, the film didn't really come together as a cohesive, thematic whole. I'm not quite sure what question the film is asking or what answer the film is providing. Is it about Jacob's insistence on the American dream? The durability of family? The hollowness of the American dream? Despite spectacular individual elements, for me personally, the film didn't quite gel together. As a note, at times, I was distracted by the steadicam camerawork even on static shots during a conversation. Still, it was compelling to watch. Overall, a very good film."
MINARI,1 October 2021,7/10,"...Gentle slow moving film, which keeps you interested."
MINARI,14 May 2021,7/10,"Minari is a atypical migrant family drama that portrays the nuances of the struggles not only within the family and community but with their own inner selves, pictured and presented wonderfully well by director Lee Isaac Chung. The director himself grew up on a small farm in Arkansas, when his parents immigrated from Korea, so technically, Minari is a semi bio pic based on collection of a first hand experiences of the director's own life in the 80s. The movie is modest, specific and thrifty, like the lives it surveys. There's nothing small about it, though, because it operates at the true scale of life.Cinematography was adept and well handled throughout the movie. Chung used English as his medium for writing the screenplay, and the lines spoken in Korean were translated into Korean later. Editing could have been a little better had the runtime been 100-105 minutes instead of the 116 minutes run time for the final edit. Production design, costumes, makeup and music was completely decent. Almost all the actors played their parts very well, with Will Patton springing a good surprise with a terrific performance in a supporting role.Overall, Minari is, Sensitively written and acted, beautifully shot, and with a charming, sparingly used score, Minari is so engaging that it's easy to forget how radical it is. One of the great triumphs of Minari is its presentation of authentic childhood. These kids are not saints or stand-ins or mouthpieces. They are their own persons. I believe in time Minari will be a Universally loved film all around the world. 7.5 stars out of 10 for the wonderful depiction of a
finely-observed portrait of family relations and rural American values."
MINARI,10 April 2021,7/10,"'Minari' shows the immagration and assimilation into the proud United States (applies to everywhere, just to different degrees) and its culture as the burning barn that it is. Both with more subtlety it also explores societal expectations of people and the awful business of factory farming.The score is one of my favourites of the year, it's very well composed and suits the scenery, but there's a big issue with it. One of the two running motifs doesn't actually serve a purpose, it's just thrown in to fill dead space; It wouldn't have been too difficult to incorporate it more purposefully either, that would have made the movie so much better than it was. The only other thing that really negatively affected my experience was the presentation of a crucial moment, it was unclear what happened for almost five minutes.Visual effects are blended seamlessly, an element of all modern(ish) movies that doesn't get addressed enough. All the performers are at the top of their game, including the children and above all the story being told is a good one. The family dynamic worked very well, especially Jacob and Monica's relationship, the most heartbreaking element of a tragic story.You could never live off hope and courage alone. To start a life it takes pragmatism, and to add a cherry to the cake to start a good life and maintain it, it takes a whole lot of luck."
MINARI,3 May 2021,7/10,"Sorry this took so long for me to get to, deadlines and all that.In a lot of ways, this was Mank all over again for me, because it's really well acted, really well shot, some really well written scenes, and really well directed, but I couldn't get myself to care about any of it. Only unlike with Mank, this time I'm the weirdo for thinking that.The soundtrack was pretty great, and there's certainly some scenes that gave me genuine laughs, but I don't know, it just didn't really do it for me.I guess I might as well talk about the Oscars to pad this out a bit, soooooo...here we go (also I didn't see any of the documentaries or short films and really have no opinion on the makeup or costume categories, but Feels Good Man didn't even get a nomination so that category can just not exist basically)Best original screenplay - wouldn't really have been upset with any of these winning but Promising Young Woman taking it was a pleasant surprise, I honestly didn't think it would get anything.Best adapted screenplay - hell yeahhhhhhh boi, The Father snagged it, although it would have been hilarious seeing Borat Subsequent Moviefilm get it for being a film that only has half a screenplay. Also Florian Zeller's hair is fabulous.Best international feature - haven't seen any of them but obviously Another Round was getting it. And Thomas Vinterberg's speech was beautiful.Supporting actor - yeah Daniel Kaluuya deserves every last shiny bit of that statue, even if he was definitely baked upon receiving it.Best director - as boring as I thought Nomadland was I'm really happy for Chloe Zhao, because this year was one where I really didn't care about who won this award, they were all good. Having Thomas Vinterberg be here for Another Round is...weird considering it wasn't up for any other big awards. Maybe he deserved it, I haven't seen the film yet.Best sound - as awesome as it is that Sound Of Metal rightfully won it, I have to wonder if it's because the sound design is actually great, or because the Academy saw a film tangentially related to music that had ""sound"" in the title and went ""yeah, that'll do.""Best animated feature - would have been nice for Wolfwalkers to get it, but ah ah ah *waggles finger* don't you understand...a Pixar film came out this year. Haven't seen either of them, but then the Academy barely ever see past Pixar's balls from deepthroating them all the time.Best visual effects - whatever the other films looked like, I'm sure Tenet deserved it, bloody hell that film's effects are mindblowing.Best supporting actress - I reeeeeeally wanted Maria Bakalova to win this one, she was incredible and it would have been an out of the box pick, but I also can't deny how great Youn Yuh-Jung was.Best production design - yep, Mank definitely deserved it. Looked amazing.Best cinematography - also Mank...um, sure I guess. Definitely films that weren't nominated that deserved it more though...Best editing - was genuinely rooting for The Trial Of The Chicago 7 to get this one, but Sound Of Metal isn't bad.Best score - haven't heard the soundtrack for Soul, but Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are amazing so I'm happy.Best song - I don't even know what the song from Judas And The Black Messiah was, but I hope we can all agree that in a just and fair world, Borat's ""Wuhan Flu"" would have mopped the floor with anything else that came out last year.Best picture - harumph. You all know what I think of Nomadland, and obviously I wanted The Father to win, but I can't possibly hate on Chloe Zhao. She's too damn nice.Best actress - yeah Frances McDormand was good, although I personally preferred Carey Mulligan.Best actor - oh Jesus Christ. Just when I was thinking that this was the least embarrassing but simultaneously most boring Oscars I'd sat through yet...what the hell were they thinking? Yes, I'm obviously happy that Anthony Hopkins won, but might I take a minute to remind you that no one, and I mean n o o n e, would have been upset with Chadwick winning? I haven't even seen Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and I wouldn't have been upset. I'd at least have understood why they gave it to him.And some stupid producer or events organiser clearly thought that they should end it on a high note after the year of Black Lives Matter and Derek Chauvin being put where he belongs (and I hope he drops the soap a few times), and then they gave it to the oldest, whitest, most previously awarded guy on the list. I wouldn't go so far as to call the award in itself racist, but after leaving Best actor for last while simultaneously acting like you are going to give it to Chadwick is, let's say, not a good look.And as if it wasn't anticlimactic enough, they wouldn't even let an 83 year old man at high risk of covid do a sodding Zoom call to accept his award, which he clearly wanted to do, but no, you have to travel all the way down to London because high quality video!I don't think it was any one person's fault, it was just the perfect storm of the events organiser being stupid, a pretty bad look after a year of anti-racism being possibly the strongest it's ever been, and the Academy being old farts that can't accept the inevitable march of technology.But goddamn it was not a good look.Anyway, that's me on the Oscars season, see you next year for another big wet load of embarrassment."
MINARI,8 June 2021,9/10,"Minari is special because it can grow anywhere and can be used for a variety of things, including healing you if you are sick. Grandma holds the key to the family's plight of struggle, which makes this film so compelling.The only person in the family who is not worried and is not living a life of trying to control everything is Grandma. Grandma simply goes with the flow. She's funny, fiesty, and has a wonderful sense of humor. Yuh-Jung Youn all but steals the limelight in this delightful film as a woman who has one motto: live and enjoy it. And stop trying to control everything.Jacob has moved his family to Arkansas to fulfill his dream: to be a farmer. He's tired of the monotonous nine-to-five job of chicken sexing (sorting chickens based on their gender). He moves the family from California and decides to take a chance on becoming a farmer of Korean vegetables.Monica, his wife, is shocked and dismayed that her husband would roll the dice on such a reckless venture, especially after she sees their new home on wheels! Grandma, of course, has more wisdom when she says, ""It has wheels. So what?""Jacob struggles to keep the family afloat financially. Monica struggles to keep the family intact. Especially their son, David, who has a heart problem. Jacob sees his wife as an obstacle to his dreams. Monica sees her husband as a man who cares more about making money than helping and being there for his family.Grandma is brought over from Korea. She tries to be an example to both Jacob and Monica. Be like Minari. Be like a plant that, when left to its own devices, is able to thrive because it does need to be controlled and looked after constantly. Jacob watches his crops like a hawk. Monica is the same with her kids, especially David.There is nothing in the world that wastes more energy than worry. Worry has absolutely no benefits whatsoever. It comes from a person's obsessive need to control things; to control that which cannot be controlled. And because control is an illusion, you can never win. Never. The secret is in surrender; in allowing things to simply be. Grandma understands this. Jacob and Monica do not.""Minari"" is one of the best films I've seen in recent years. Koreans are literally taking over the entertainment industry with deep and thought-provoking stories. They are dominating in both cinema and television. Some of the best shows and films I have seen in recent years are Korean. Unlike recent American entertainment, wrought with superficial and shallow stories bombarded with special effects that are about as interesting as watching paint dry, Korea (and many other countries too) is providing us with character and plot-driven stories. Something that American filmmakers USED to do. All Americans can do anymore is remakes and boring action films that have no depth at all.If you're looking for a delightful gem of a movie, you can't go wrong with ""Minari."""
MINARI,16 January 2021,9/10,"What a movie, you can find the relatedness and balance in every role in this family. If you see close enough, you can see each role have different intention in term of being ''part'' of the family.Great act from all of the cast. Paul make some spark that for me tbh i doesn't really get it what his role for. but somehow it make the story in the great portion of conflict.i love the cinematography, the set was perfect too. The story concept wasn't really new either, but it feel really fresh."
MINARI,25 March 2021,7/10,"Well, I won't write a bunch, the movie is pretty good. It has a really really slow pace, so that might be a problem to some. The story takes its time, and over all, it's a movie were the cinematography stands out, the image on screen is always impactful in some way.The acting is great, all of the cast really, even the kids, I think did an awesome job, and they are just immersed in the characters. The story is touching, and you can relate to most of the characters. The grandma and the kid's relationship are probably the one that evolves the most throughout. The kid actually is the heart and soul of the movie, and he manages to emote a lot, even without speaking much.There isn't much else to say I think, I believe the story has some rhymes withing itself, for sure, that I probably haven't realized because I only saw the movie once.To sum up, the movie is good, the acting is great, and the cinematography is gorgeous, it just feels a lot longer than it actually is.7,5/10"
MINARI,4 October 2021,9/10,"This movie manages to be almost perfect, with many emotions involved and an exceptional cast.The plot of this movie is the only thing that does not seem attractive to me, there is no specific story to highlight, there is no conflict to resolve, but everything else works very well and puts aside that the plot is not so attractive. The cast is excellent as well as the performances of everyone, the direction is good, the photography is beautiful, the production design is very well cared for, the costumes are amazing and the locations where it was filmed are suitable to develop the story. I like the development of the characters and how they capture the feelings of them and the pain they go through.In my opinion it is a very well made film, with a plot that is a bit owing, but it is very enjoyable for all the things that stand out."
MINARI,29 May 2021,8/10,"Minari follows the journey of the Yi family, who moves from California to a small rural area in Arkansas, in search of a better life.Much more than a comfort film, Minari manages to intelligently explore the challenges that the so-called American Dream brought to emigrants, in the midst of Ronald Reagan's (80's) governance.Family conflicts, disappointments, distrust reverted to support and friendship, all play in favor of a perfectly balanced and focused narrative.There's no references to racist or xenophobic attitudes towards minority communities (in this case, Koreans), and thankfully, because it is also necessary to told stories in which people are genuinely good, because they exist, in fact, in real life.Steven Yeun and Yeri Han are solid, but without a doubt, the Youn Yuh-jung/Alan Kim relationship is the engine of this film, without neglecting Will Patton.Minari is like a cinematographic hug, given in a late summer sundown."
MINARI,8 November 2021,6/10,"This is a total buzz kill fantastic acting but this story is lame and ungratifying, of course it won a award thats what they do give awards to boring movies like they are the only smart enough to relate to it, it sucks
no matter how you look at it."
MINARI,25 April 2021,9/10,"Minari (transl. Water Celery) is exactly the movie we need right now. A story of how togetherness and the love for family can overcome any odds no matter how insurmountable they are, Director Lee Isaac Chung has delivered an absolute gem.Youn Yuh-jung is a revelation as the stubborn grandmother, leaving you in splits in the beginning and in tears towards the end, No wonder she is the favorite to land the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Steven Yuen and Han Ye-ri excel as the constantly feuding couple, struggling to make ends meet in a new plot of land they have moved to in rural Arkansan.Alan Kim and Noel Kate Cho have our hearts from the very first shot as the cute, wisecracking children, struggling amidst the new surroundings all the while torn between their two warring parents.Set in the 1980s and partially based on the director's own childhood, Minari will take you through a whole gamut of emotions, but leave you satisfied by the end.A terrific film. A splendid watch, especially during these trying times."
MINARI,4 March 2021,10/10,"Like the acclaimed Parasite, Minari is another foreign language film worthy of praise and study. Based on director Lee Isaac Chung's experiences growing up in the 1980s, we follow a struggling Korean-American family who move from California to a small farm in rural Arkansas. With tender performances and thoughtful direction at its core, Minari is a brutally honest inspection of the American Dream and its adverse effects on family and childhood. While this type of story has been done countless times, I feel Minari will push the envelope by reaching anyone of any ethnicity and upbringing with its raw perspectives and down-to-earth balance of happiness and heartache. A remarkable slice-of-life that will certainly leave you pondering and one of 2020's best pictures."
MINARI,2 January 2021,9/10,"I really love and appreciate movies that capture aspects of life in a beautiful way and Minari is one of them. It's so simple, authentic, real, emotional and touching. It tackles the difficulties and struggles of starting a new life in a new place in a very simple and nice way. The story is very well written and the script is rich with many deep lines. Cinematography is amazing. And performances are all great. Minari is definitely one of 2020's very best movies."
MINARI,11 May 2021,,"Minari is a Korean-American film that, in its theme and in its reception, has questioned the very function of the hyphen between Korean and American. One of the gifts of the hyphenated identity is its assumption that identity isn't a zero sum game - to be more Korean, doesn't mean to be less American, and vice-versa. But that doesn't seem to be the popular sentiment."
MINARI,27 March 2021,6/10,"Here we are presented with a pleasant hard-working Korean couple who are attempting to make a good life for themselves and their children.They apparently started off doing menial jobs in California that paid cash but offered no prospects. So the father buys a piece of land in Arkansas that was going cheap because the previous (American) owner had gone bankrupt and killed himself (thus earning a reputation for being jinxed).Because of the relative rural isolation they bring over the grandma on the mother's side and she turns out to be an interesting character.But the film generates too many negative emotions for my taste. First there's the problem of water, where the local utility won't supply if they're not paid their dues - even when it's growing season.Then there's the mother's unrealistic expectations, which seem to contain a lot of urban prejudice against a rural lifestyle that is healthier for the children and culminate in unjustly accusing the father of putting work before family simply because he took the produce samples he'd brought into the hospital - where the son was having a check up on a heart condition that was clearly improving in the new environment - so they wouldn't deteriorate inside the hot car on a day of record high temperature. She didn't even acknowledge the improvement in her son's condition (since they'd moved to the country) but seemed fixated that things were going to get worse.That may have been down to knowing her mother, because despite being in recovery from a stroke, she decided to biurn the rubbish and ended up setting fire to the barn where all the produce they had just signed a sales contract for was stored, destroying the lot.The film tried to end on a positive note, with the family staying to battle on, but inevitably they were now in hoc to the bank just to keep going and farm owners all across the country know how that story goes!So I feel both sad - that good people were being dealt such a poor hand - and angry - at the system that propagates the myth that everybody can be rich and happy despite the glaring evidence to the contrary, as wealth and power are becoming as concentrated as they once were in Feudal times!"
MINARI,25 April 2021,6/10,Gives you insight into Korean family bond. The young son in movie winning all acclaim is cute in his cowboy boots and acted well. Moving to America is still not the dream as seem. Not sure this is Oscar worthy though ! H20.
MINARI,26 April 2021,1/10,"Right now I would gladly suffer through another Marvel Comics superhero movie than to have to view one more of these painfully boring Arts Projects. Get a grip HollyWeird, no one's digging your vibe!"
MINARI,12 May 2021,8/10,"I watched the multi award winning Minari on Primevideo in orig. Eng/Korean w/Eng. Subtitles.The leisurely paced narration style is like in several (good) Malayalam films and I admit to fast forwarding every now and then.The plot begins with the Yi family - a young couple with two kids, Korean American immigrants moving from California to their own plot of land in rural America where Jacob the father (Steven Yeun) intends to cultivate typical Korean vegetables to meet the demands of a niche market, and is confident he will do well in his new venture. Monica the wife (Han Ye Ri) is not so sure, and shocked to discover that their new house looks like a series of cargo containers ""on wheels"" though it seems reasonable enough (for Indian viewers) from the inside. Their little boy David (Alan S Kim) is very very cute, and mischievous, but has a congenital heart problem so the parents must keep an eye and discourage him from rough play and running around. For this reason too, Monica is uneasy about being far away from a hospital. David also has a bed wetting problem. Anna (Noel Cho) is the older sister.Jacob and Monica start work at a nearby hatchery sortinng chicks.A scruffy local Korean War veteran befriends David and starts working with him on the farm. The two kids make local friends at the community church. Monica gets her mother to join them from S. Korea to help out with the kids while the couple go to work. Grandma (Youn Yuh Jung) is helpful, jovial and affectionate but a bit too Korean for the two kids initially, especially for little David. She eventually wins him over by teaching him how to play gambling games with cards!! And encouraging him to ignore his health condition and grow strong. Grandma and David plant some Korean medicinal herbs (Minari) on the banks of a stream and she feeds him special herbal concoctions to make him grow strong.The narrative continues with the mundane, the travails, the joys, the ups and downs of life for the Yi family and where it all leads ... no Spoilers, watch for yourself even if with Fast Fwd :-)))The various relationships between the characters are well portrayed, the settings are beautiful as is the cinematography. The acting is strong especially of Grandma (YYJ) and the adorable little David.Minari is a well made, realistic film. It is however quite slow."
MINARI,23 March 2021,9/10,"After a California swing, a young Korean family in search of the American dream tries a restart in Arizona. In a green, grassy expanse. In a clunky mobile home. In the middle of nowhere.The locals are devout Bible worshippers, and though culture clashes foreshadow mayhem, ""Minari"" steers away from any such predictable plot lines and smartly focuses on the husband and wife dynamic. As quirky as the Korean family seem, it is the oddball Americans, gentle, friendly and naïve, who seem out of place.Years spent chicken sexing - looking at new hatched butts to discard the males - has Jacob yearning to live off the land. Smart, determined, driven, entrepreneurial and strong-headed, he sees opportunity whereas Monica sees hardship.To help out, they send for grandmother Soonja. This is where the movie starts to cook. A seemingly old school traditionalist, grandma brings some of her baggage (filled with a giant bag of chili powder and anchovies), but also an unexpected eccentric zest for life. One minute she is pushing an ancient medicinal broth (cooked with goat horns she eagerly boasts) on David, the youngest, and the next she is loudly revelling in some cheesy wrestling action on the fuzzy tv.Will Patton as a cross-bearing (literally - he drags a large cross on Sundays), speaking in tongues Christian hired hand who turns out to be a well, godsend, is absolutely sublime. In fact, all the performances are great, highlighted by Jacob's and Monica's dynamic survival dance.The steady build up of conflict, escalated by a run of bad luck and perhaps, poor decisions, comes to an inevitable and fiery climax. Who's standing, with whom, and where, are all questions the audience is truly vested in.
""Minari"" is sweet, tough, funny, frustrating, and one of the better films out there.hipCRANK"
MINARI,28 February 2021,8/10,"Did you know that there is a job called Chicken Sexing which consists of inspecting the butt of a chick to determine if it is male or female? You pick up a chick, check the sex and move to the next one until your shift is up. Jacob is a young Korean father who has been doing this job for 10 years and after saving up some money, he bought a farming land in rural Arkansas and moved his family there with hopes of growing Korean vegetables. He is full of optimism about the future but before he can even plant one seed, life decides that it has other plans for him and his family.Minari is an underdog story that gives joy with one hand and then slaps misfortune with the other. It shows how pursuing the American Dream can be costly both financially and personally shaking the core of the strongest families out there. After I was introduced to this cheerful and caring family, it was impossible not to root for them and their farm. The care was accompanied by constant tension as I was worried that the shaky foundation that they are building might collapse at any moment. However, it is the hope that things will eventually work out that made me want to continue watching this story.What I liked about Minari is that the film portrays the American Dream without playing the immigrant or racism cards that are so popular when it comes to creating over-the-top drama. Instead, the movie effectively shows the realistically constant struggle of a family that has it's share of troubles while adjusting to their new life regardless of where they are from. They deal with real problems and from how they are portrayed, I couldn't help but picture myself in the shoes of the father, wondering if I could have managed to keep going. While Minari is a small film in terms of scale and production; it is huge in terms of heart, realism and personal touch.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movies and TV Shows"
MINARI,11 February 2021,9/10,This is a great story about a Korean family moving to rural Arkansas in America in the early 1980's. Steven Yeun plays Jacob the father who wants to start growing crops on the farm they bought. He wants to do well for his family and live the American dream. His two young children a son and a daughter get on very well and look after each other. A third of the way into the film the grandmother joins them and moves in. She is very funny and creates some comic relief in the film. Along the way she develops a real bond with her grandson. I really loved this film the whole way through. I thought the film was very well written beautifully shot and had an amazing score. It showed in a beautiful way an immigrant family trying to live the American dream and do the best they can. I think the grandmother and Steven Yeun as the father were the standout performances. I hope this film gets many Oscar nominations it is one of the best films of 2020
MINARI,7 August 2021,9/10,"Nice film. And I was surprised by quite a few elements that were obviously carefully thought out. A young Korean family in the the 1980's, who couldn't quite make a go of it in California, moves to Arkansas to start over with a farm. They meet up with the locals, do their best to integrate with community life and gradually figure out how to do things. The wife's mother, a happy eccentric, comes to live and kick up some dust.And that's about it. Seen from their ground-level perspective, small doings like where to put a well, how to introduce their kids to school, where to sell their crops, what to do after a fire, what friends to make -- are all critical events. And it's all absorbing. I'll just mention one thing that I was totally surprised by, and it's something that DIDN'T happen: at some point I thought it was inevitable that we would have to go through uncomfortabliy watching the family confront some sort of stereotypical racism from the townspeople. But no! It never happened. They didn't exactly fit in right away, but they were accepted. The story is about just this one family and it sticks relentlessly within their point of view. Worth seeing."
MINARI,27 February 2021,9/10,"This film by director Lee Isaac Chung about a Korean family that moves to Arkansas in the 1980s in the hopes of starting a family farm is brilliantly acted and full of wonder. As they begin to adapt to their new surroundings and try to achieve stability, the family dynamic shifts with the arrival of the scrappy, eccentric grandmother (exceptionally portrayed by Youn Yuh-jung).A film with true heart and human sympathy, it is replete with wondrously subtle performances. By the end of the film, we've gotten to know the whole family and all their conflicting sensibilities and prerogatives. The overarching theme is that life can be full of surprises and bumps in the road, but also a firm reminder not to take for granted those around you.A slow-moving movie with lots of details, and full of reflections of real life experience, this might often remind you of your own situations and challenges that life produced. At the same time, it will give any outsider some insight into Korean culture and family character. Rich and rewarding, this film is strongly recommended."
MINARI,6 March 2021,9/10,"Very nice, emotional, pretty much covers the dynamic of the family going through the tough times. How the major illness of the child shapes the lives of the parents and family. The sacrifices and the decisions we choose to make. The role of the elder child. How old people can really be what we need. Also taking the supernatural theme with it. If you believe that or not that is upto you. Money is important but make sure not to lose what actually really matters, family. Our life gets tested when we have nothing but together we can pass every barrier, only together."
MINARI,14 October 2020,9/10,"This new film from A24 centers around a Korean family that immigrates to Arkansas in the 1980s to start a farm and have a new life. As can be expected from A24, it's excellent. The film largely centers around the immediate family (including their young son) and their grandmother trying to adapt to the cultural changes of both a Western and an agricultural lifestyle. Lee Isaac Chung's direction is very strong, using elegant and lush cinematography of the American heartland and a potent yet calming score.Chung's characters are likable yet complex and multi-dimensional, attempting to adapt to drastic changes in their life while still using humor and compassion. The grandmother character is especially a standout and may remind viewers of the grandmother in ""The Farewell."" The screenplay is very well-written, combining raw emotion with a lot of humor and heart. Even simple moments, such as going for walks outside, are paired with didactic yet endearing dialogue that establishes clear relationships and trust between the major characters. You really feel affection and great empathy for these characters in a way that genuinely transcends cultural lines. The screenplay's primary emphasis on the characters and their day-to-day lives rather than a view of the American Dream as a whole makes the story seem remarkably personal and slightly idiosyncratic, in the best way possible. Yet the film still serves as a powerful commentary on how immigrants are impacted by cultural perceptions of American life. One can tell that this was a very personal film for Chung, but it would also be relatable among many different audience groups. Its cultural universality will impact views around the world and endear them to the characters. Its inherent warmth creates genuine emotional power as well. The film could have used some slightly stronger coherence between the events that proceed over the course of the story, but is otherwise extremely well-made. As a poignant yet original tribute to the immigrant experience that can simultaneously charm and inform viewers, I undoubtedly and highly recommend this film. 9/10"
MINARI,15 November 2021,9/10,"Maybe a typical art movie type. I'll not say, there's complete absence of conflict. But it also doesn't have any major crisis either.Jus like sushi. One might not know if it's boiled rice, potato or actually sushi (kidding!). Anyway, this is not a bad watch. But not a must watch either.At most I could say that, you'll know a different aspect of life in America. But that too didn't took much depth and I felt like it only touched the surface.The protagonist could be argued as the son David. As he completes the movie, takes it forward and in a way it's his growth.-Spoilers-
Like, arguments in marriage is faulted and both partners argue with selfishness (or at least absence of enough context).They're migrants, but not enough outsiders.I'm sorry. I jus fail to like the movie I guess (But I don't think it's bad either)."
MINARI,3 July 2021,6/10,"It seems these days, directors or script writers have a hard time coming up with a great climax to a great start. This movie is no exception. Everything was perfect, until the last 5-10 min. I was so disappointed in the ending, this movie had so much potential of becoming a great comeback movie but I guess they didn't want to thread that somehow 'overused' road.I have to give it up for David though, it was a breath of fresh air just watching him play his role beautifully. The whole cast did well, I could care less about accent, it's the story for me and this one was great, until the very end. What a shame and let down."
MINARI,20 March 2021,8/10,"Words being used in reviews i've read so far: soft, tender, careful, touching, serene, moving, and sincere. All of those words pretty accurately describe this film. On top of an amazing story and some stunning cinematography, Minari has an gorgeous score. It deserves the Oscar for best score hands down. The score carries this film like you're riding on the back of a feather, just floating along and flowing through this beautifully told family story. Steven Yeun, who's currently nominated for best actor, is a great contender, and I would be ecstatic to see him win. Minari also gives you great performances by Alan S. Kim as Jacob, and Youn Yuh-jung as Grandma Soonja. Alan and Youn's chemistry just pops on screen and they absolutely stole the show. All in all this is up there with the best of 2020 and it deserves all the awards it has coming for it when Oscars role around. Absolutely beautiful film."
MINARI,7 May 2021,7/10,"Simply it is a drama, but what surging inside is the main stuff that have to be think about the movie. The title also symbolizes the total mood of the film and the symmetry that might be happen to Jacob and his family. Cultural comparison is one of the main idea that the movie annunciate from the beginning itself. Jacob and Monica has the trace of Korean culture in their own language and doings but their children David and Anne is completely detached from the Korean lifestyle and pattern. In one scene David talks to his Grandmother that, ""You smells like Korea"" delivers his actual state of mind. Jacob talks to David about the mind of Koreans in one scene and he says they are far better than Americans. Minari also talks about the problems associate with family where they are shifting from one place to another because of financial crisis. It is a collaboration lot of subjects which blends inside common family matters."
MINARI,10 January 2021,8/10,"Film that handle more than good the weight of the meaning of the word PURPOSE. This film is more than a film, but it is like a novel made film, made up of fragments, of pictures of life, made of excellent acting and emotions that are always well represented and well defined. Minari makes use of an excellent direction (Lee Isaac Chung), with a shot that is always well defined and with the aim, through the latter, of shooting or capturing the emotion of the moment, from the small to the macroscopic detail. Simply a film that manages to strike the soul, which invites you to reflect and which sheds light on several important themes, such as the union of the family in joyful moments and those less joyful, such as the meaning of hard work or dreams that sometimes affect the path that is gradually being lost in life and more. A noteworthy, spectacular film that will make talk about it for a long time."
MINARI,13 June 2021,5/10,"The movie is about a Korean family sick of working menial jobs and decided to start a farm instead.The mother in-law came and live with them. Things happened but nothing interesting other than an accident near the end.If you like movies about daily lives and people struggling to make a living, this may be a good movie for you. Personally I prefer something more interesting and exciting."
MINARI,5 March 2021,8/10,Why do people think it is boring? This is not some action flick. This is about a family that's struggling to keep their farm business and stay together as a family. This is a fun and engaging film.Yeah they are a dysfunctional family. At least they educate and do things to make money. They are thriving to survive. This is a character development movie.
MINARI,27 March 2021,4/10,"I really couldn't wait for this movie to end, but at least I get extra team points for forcing myself to watch it to its conclusion, I guess?I couldn't relate to the couple and I still can't work out whether this movie was supposed to be a story about success or failure, or a bit of both? Even the end was bemusing when the couple finally accepted that their relationship was no longer viable and that she had to go, which he accepted, followed by the barn burning down to finally seal what a disastrous venture it had been from the outset, which she didn't care about anyway and decided to abandon, but from nowhere, a sudden bond and re-acquaintance with love and affection once again by virtue of the billowing smoke and destructive fire.You only realize what you really had after you lose it, maybe, which could be the underlying message of this movie, but the way we got there was so meandering and dull, it made me sympathize with them for splitting up, but totally confused at the same time because of the sudden onrush of love when the relationship had literally gone up in smoke.The couple were so sexless and joyless throughout the entire movie, which made a mockery of what ultimately became a tepidly heart-wrenching call to arms to remain united, which didn't matter because there was nothing there in the first place, making absolutely no sense or being worthy of a story. At least if the couple had enjoyed each other for one second, we might have been able to grasp the final twist about people getting by through thick and thin, but because there was no joy, there was no point to any of it."
MINARI,28 March 2021,9/10,"Minari is a gorgeous movie. From its script, to its characters, to its visuals and the overall mood... It feels so at peace. Telling the story of a Korean family who try to start a farm in 1980s America, it puts on screen three generations worth of experiences, wisdom and intrigues told through the mutual bond and relationships they share with each other.Very special credit to actress Youn Yuh-jung who single handedly steals the show with her engaging and captivating performance as Grandma Soonja. Every scene of hers is what gives life to Minari as the whole thing revolves around her. Not just from within the movie, but even to us the audience, it is her who tugged on our emotions from the moment she makes her appearance and it's her we feel compelled to care about the most, and which we do without complaint.I really can't think of anything negative to say about the movie, and actually, I'm glad that I can't. Because Minari is a damn good movie that is as compelling and soulful as any could be."
MINARI,1 September 2021,9/10,"Truisms are derived from hard, sometimes crippling losses and failures. Every character here is confronted by their internalized notions about life. What is a reasonable gamble when it comes to the potential realization of a dream? What is a grandmother to a child if you had never met one? What does a realistic partnership look like? How important is faith?This is art house cinema at its best, imo. Gorgeous compositions and cinematography. Fantastic acting. A great script with matched pacing. Stakes that make sense, and with realistic follow through. Neither sensationalized nor toothless. Themes that are prescient and left of mainstream. Even more stunning in 4K HDR, of course.The only thing I was looking for is more of an arc from the eldest child. While she sort of has to come into her responsibilities, everyone else has more time and an arc that is a bit more compelling. The grandmother character and actor sure shines.Ended up liking this quite a bit more than Nomadland."
MINARI,17 March 2021,10/10,"I went into this not knowing anything about the story with an open mind. What a treat! This is one of the BEST films I've seen in a long time. It is tender, loving, heartbreaking and tough. It's got elements of all of those things and many more. The subtitles didn't bother me at all. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed them as they added another layer of authenticity to an already phenomenal tale. You will laugh but bring a few tissues as you will need them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie today. And spread the word!"
MINARI,17 July 2021,8/10,"Here we see the legendary Glenn from ""The Walking Dead"" fame flex his acting muscles, and he delivers. It's an added impressive layer that he speaks Korean throughout most of the movie. The true gem though is Youn Yun-jung portraying the unconventional smart-alecky grandmother. She steals every scene that she is in. Overall, this movie is like a series of poems, sprinkled with the obligatory tragedy as the climax, yet the ending falls flat without offering some clear resolution, and you as the viewer yearn for some sort of resolution because by the end, you are rooting for this family."
MINARI,2 March 2021,7/10,"In a nutshell, a story of the American dream told through the eyes of an immigrant family. Anybody who (whose family) moved from somewhere else, who had to deal with struggles but didn't give up could relate to it.
It's a drama, there's no plot complexity and climax and all that stuff, but it's one of those ""no matter what, life goes on"" sort of a story. If you watch stuff like that, this is for you. This is for you if you like to watch stories about a tight-knit family and family values.
And oh, Minari is a Korean herb, apparently like parsley, that is resilient enough to grow is random conditions and the plant will grow very strongly in its second season after it has died and come back. So, there you go."
MINARI,7 June 2021,7/10,The Korean family of four arrived Midwest for a dream of farming. Even water becomes a scarce resource. The came of grandma changed the life of everyone. The ending is unclear and could be better.
MINARI,5 January 2021,10/10,"America is a melting pot of many cultures from all around the world. There are so many different stories beginning, ending, or taking place in our country within the lives of people from all walks of life and nearly every corner of the world. That being said, I absolutely loved 'Minari.' It's the story of a South Korean family trying to live out their American dream in the random state of Arkansas. It shows how both parents have differing ideas of what that American dream is, as do the children (who I assume were born in the U.S.) When the grandmother joins the picture, the story takes another turn.I love the grandmother character. She's funny, straightforward, and loving. The grandmother is the glue that brings everyone back together, but she accomplishes this without intending to and in a subtle way. She brings with her many of the South Korean customs the kids are not aware of and introduces them to a Korean plant known as Minari, which serves as the secret ingredient in many Korean dishes. Minari ends up serving as the most important symbol in the story, in that just like this plant does to Korean meals and remedies, the grandma brings out the best of the family. The film ends with the father and son visiting the Minari patch the grandmother grew by a stream in the woods. I believe the ending is left up to interpretation and I like to think that the father decided to sell the Minari to retailers in the city.I have understood that the story is based on the director's personal experience and it shows. Much of the dialogue sounds very realistic, you can tell he was digging through his memories when writing this. The acting is fantastic, everyone does a great job with their roles. My personal favorite performances were from the grandma and the little boy. I think these actors complimented each other so well, you can see the gradual connection that takes place between them. Every scene between them is fantastic.I highly recommend this film. I hope to see more films like this in the near future, telling the story of those who tend to get overseen in our country. Congrats to everyone who worked on this film. Hope it gets the recognition it deserves."
MINARI,27 November 2021,8/10,"A story about a Korean Immigrant family moving from city to rural America to build a farm, pursuing the American Dream. A slow-burn, delightfully simple and subtle movie backed by fantastic performances from the whole cast and a great score by Emile Mosseri. The struggles of moving to a different place, financial difficulties, strain on marriage, the desire to achieve something, all very well showcased. But the show stealer is Yuh-Jung Youn, as the grandmother, whose relationship with her grandson, reminded me of my own precious relationship with my grandmother and deservedly won an Oscar. A great family drama."
MINARI,2 April 2021,7/10,"A Korean family seeking the American dream encounters financial and emotional misery along the way. Undoubtedly one of the best of 2020, and of this awards season.To begin with, the direction of Lee Isac Chung is so detailed and warm that it may seem slow if you see it for the first time but when you review it, those small details arrive. A script that brings out the best in all the characters and the symbolism of the plot without distractions.Luxury performances by the cast: Steven Yeun as the main character is a character who does not seem to say much but says a lot, his only purpose is capable success if you look at him at one point but in reality it is to be a model for his children, deserved his first nomination to the Oscars.Yeri Han as Monica, Yeun's wife, who accompanies her husband in making his decisions until she gets tired. She manages to say all the insecurities anyone in that place would have, her absence from awards season hurts.Alan Kim opens up as a promising young actor and gives an excellent performance as the son of this marriage, he shows a more childish perspective due to his problems but because of a culture which confronts him with his family, directly with his grandmother (Yuh -Jung Youn), this character is essential as she presents the concept of 'Minari' and which she best develops with her grandson, an unforgettable performance, with an unforgettable presence, it's nice to see her nominated for the academy awards this year.It is a film that lowers the dream to a plane of reality, with scenes of everyday life without bombardment of melodrama. Delicate and painful."
MINARI,10 April 2021,8/10,"This film overwhelms you with its simplicity and you begin to love it as the narrative unfolds slowly . It is about a Korean family struggling to stay afloat in the suburbs of an American town. Jacob ( Steven Yeun) stays with wife Monica ( Yeri Han ), daughter Anne 10, and son David 4 who has a heart condition. They are joined by grandmother ( Yuh Jung Youn) who looks after the children and who develops a strong bond with David. Jacob tries to grow vegetables for sale but faces difficulties. In addition, his relations with wife are strained since she has different ideas on how to settle in life. The family tries to develop social ties with local families by going to church. These scenes have a warmth which comes through in the film.I saw a remarkable similarity in the directing style of Lee Isaac Chung with that of Satyajit Ray, who would have been happy to see this film. The film remains unpretentious and honest, and has no commercial frills. The emotional scenes are kept correctly subdued.The film maintains a slow pace as we see the family adjusting to difficult situations and how they come out stronger each time whether it is the well drying up or canceled orders of vegetables or grandmother's sickness etc. The sadness of these scenes makes a connect with audience.The film is first rate in all departments from direction, acting, dialogue, cinematography, editing etc. It is tailor made for the award season and will definitely pick up awards."
MINARI,15 August 2021,8/10,"Wonderful, spiritual in a way. Great acting. It is what it must be for so many trying their luck for a better life in the USA."
MINARI,9 October 2021,6/10,"This minimalistic but uncompromised movie about marriage and family was a self-testament to the director's vision of creating a story of an immigrant family's complicated dilemma set in a simple setting. I mean, the movie felt like it was based on a novel or something, but the screenplay was definitely the magic formula. Steven Yeun's best performance to date felt really genuine and heartfelt without going too much. Even Alan S. Kim and the actress who played Grandma was such a delight to watch. The scenes leading to a rather disappointing ending was so intense and heartfelt."
MINARI,10 July 2021,5/10,"It is really boring movie, I don't know why people are recommending Oscar award for this crap movie, I don't like this movie at all. I have wasted watching this movie."
MINARI,4 May 2021,7/10,"Youn Yuh-jung's performance in Minari is simply dynamite as she is clearly the heart and soul of the film. Love what Minari stands for, and reminds us Asian's are resilient people who will grow and flourish wherever we go. It is also refreshing that the film never played the race card, but instead focuses on the true grit and significance of families. As we grow more attached to this likable family, the end is a little abrupt as it felt like the film was just getting into it's groove, but perhaps it is the best ending, sometimes it is better to finish off with a little imagination."
MINARI,27 April 2021,10/10,"These are the types of pieces of media that should be getting more attention.Everything in this production felt fresh and humble.Hard work really does pay off, absolutely perfect. Fully worthy of all the praise.Best Film of the year."
MINARI,13 May 2021,5/10,"I gave those 5 stars, mostly because of the music. All the rest is nothing. I saw it yesterday and already forgot what happened at the end, really. I know what's going on in final, but exactly what is the end, have no idea. Next to that, it takes too long. Perhaps, if they had thrown out some parts that were too long and unimportant, it would have been much better. Like this, it is boredom."
MINARI,3 June 2021,4/10,"Oh my, oh my! What did I just watch? What did Minari serve to me? Anything new? No! Trailer looked quite promising but the movie itself couldn't get near it's own trailer. I don't know how that happened. I was so distracted and not interested during the last 40 mins. So it lost me, lost my rating."
MINARI,21 June 2021,8/10,"Minari is a poignant, moving, and heartwarming story of a Korean immigrant family wanting to live the big American dream. The movie makes you emotionally attached to the characters through their struggles and brings out a smile from time to time. In short, Minari is a stunning portrayal of hope, faith, and family with honest performances which makes it a universal film."
MINARI,11 April 2021,7/10,"Let me start off by saying the movie is about Asian immigrants to the states and how the family starts to settle inFirstly this kinda of plot is nothing new and haven't seen before, the character of the movie just did not resonates in meSecondly the plot is something you can easily find through Cantonese drama or Korean drama which is more heartwarming.Thirdly the grand mother and David connection is the only thing that is worth mentioning and some how steals every scene she is in it.. I hope she will win the oscars for his portrayal.Finally I would say my rate the movie 6 but for the grandmother acting would rate another one star for her."
MINARI,3 March 2021,8/10,"Minari is a film that starts with a subtle mood and goes on while keeping that. It's a film that belongs to that club which let's you flow with it's pacing. Director Lee Isaac Chung presented this film on the screen in a way that is near to perfect. No cringe feeling, no urge to skip any scene, just pure entertainment for 1 hour 50 minutes straight. The performances of the actors are very well done in the whole movie. From start to finish the movie makes you think that some twisted thing is gonna happen or can happen at any time but without anything twisted the movie ends proving that it doesn't need anything twisted to sooth the mind of the audience. Overall it's a movie that almost everyone will like not just because of it's good presentation and acting but also because of the beautiful storytelling of life struggling through every day."
MINARI,30 December 2020,9/10,"Nothing remains forever except the emotionsFilm : Minari
Director : Lee Isaac Chung
Dop : Lachlan milne
Music : Emile Mosseri
Cast : Steven Yeun, Han Yeri, Alan Kim#Minari is so simple but it perfectly evokes the emotions no matter whatever problem it is, the situations which they shown in Film is so organic and it happens in everyone's life at somewhere or some stage. it isn't the story about dissolution of two people who love eachother, it is all about the resilience, exploring life, marriages and migrations, love, friendship understanding nature.#leeisaacchung set everything in a simple and surrealistic manner.It's so specific and detailed, and yet like the best stories feels universal. minari filled with many beautiful moments. Each and every moment you can easily relate to one, which brings you back to time when you were still a kid, unable to do anything anytime you see your parents growing apart. But what even more fascinating is the way lee chug controls the story and emotions of his characters. He never lets the conflicts be too melodramatic or manipulative, every conflict is a grounded.There's a scene where parents fight, two children retreat to bedroom and build a paper Planes with message ""don't fight""
here minari really shines.#stevenyeun #hanyeri so naturally displayed their emotions, perfectly carried the intense entire film like a struggling immigrants. The kid #alankim is amazing.#lachlanmilne beautyfully captured the essence of countryside fields.I'm sure it definitely going to bag few Oscar's
(Must in best picture and Director category).Before rolling to the end credits, at the closing shot you're must feel this""a warm hug from someone you've known for a long time."" !"
MINARI,17 March 2021,9/10,"Fish (run) out of water tale. A slice of life movie. Remember those?
First or second gen immigrants with rural bloodlines will empathise. Rural community in general might find it interesting and worth a look. It's not even a slow build movie, it's just slow. What a relief. To some it's boring, for me it was a goldmine. Such is life. For those adverse to elements of christianity in their movies, may I mention this is one of the rare times I've seen christianity making fun at its own expense. Oscar worthy? That doesn't concern me. Should it?"
MINARI,22 April 2021,9/10,"So far Steven Yeun is my candidate for best actor this year.Burning, Parasite and this year Minari, I'd say that we're still witnessing the golden age of the Korean cinema with these titles. This film is beautifully balanced, from the joyful moments that comes from the little details (interactions between the family members) to the melancholic moments represented by misfortune, alienation and despair. This is a picture about the American dream told through the eyes of common Korean immigrants, it explores not only the cultural transitions of the family, but it also focuses on other themes like reform, faith and hope. It celebrates family, cultural diversity and offers a new perspective to the American dream. The acting is excellent and the orchestrated score of the film fits beautifully with the simplistic and natural cinematography that gave this film a comfortable warmth.Pleasant to watch."
MINARI,15 March 2021,8/10,"A surprisingly heart warming and realistic depiction of the struggles of an immigrant family.It starts to look like award season, and continuing the trend of foreign movies making their way to the most prestigious awards we have yet another quality Korean speaking movie (an American production however) this year, this time a semi auto-biography of director Lee Isaac Chung, an American national born of South Korean immigrants.The premise of the movie is pretty simple, it depicts a Korean family of immigrants that move to the countryside of Arkansas, and their financial struggle while they try to make a living in what has been an historically rough country for immigration. The themes depicted here can be drill down to the sacrifices that are made, when it comes to a healthy family relationship versus the time spent working away, to make sure that everyone has food on the table.This is where the movie excels, the family dynamic between father, mother, their son and daughter and later the grandmother is incredibly organic and natural, it's very realistic there's no overly dramatic scenes nor lack of connection between them, it's your everyday family trying to survive in tough environment while also working hard to stick together through all the bad.
All performances are on point, special compliment to Steven Yeun, Youn Yuh-jung (the grandmother) and of course the son, Alan S.Kim - amazing!It's a touching story which seems to have come from the director's personal experience, and it has a beautiful ending, without ruining it, let's just say it shows where the real essence in life lies, and that the real gains most of the times are right in front of us, we need only to value them.
I hope it gets the recognition it deserves on the coming Oscars, and I am continuing to be glad to watch audiences slowly moving away from traditional Hollywood American movies, it's good that mainstream awards are helping build that path."
MINARI,20 May 2021,3/10,Burned trash in 2 states & never burned anything down. Need a grill cover & never overload.You compost the food.Not sure the point of this movie ?!?!What happened to the $ ???Why did grandma not cook ? Who taught the daughter to cook ?
MINARI,23 March 2021,8/10,"This American-South Korean indie film reflects memories from director Lee Isaac Chung's childhood. After manageable living conditions in California, the South Korean family of four Yi moves to rural Arkansas, where the father wants to start a farm. This decision causes tension with his wife. The two children try to distract themselves from the arguments between their parents. However, they are bored most of the time until their hitherto unknown grandmother strides into their lives.The great strength of Minari lies in its outstanding cast and their chemistry with each other. There is no clear protagonist, they all get their own storylines and experiences. Alan Kim, as the youngest son David, is already confronted with fundamental situations. He and his big sister Anne (Noel Kate Cho) have several moments where unconditional sibling love is communicated in a very simple way. This makes their bond enormously natural and real. The most profound relationship, however, is shared by David and his grandmother Soon-ja, played by the fantastic Yoon Yeo-jeong. Although they don't get up to operating temperature at first because David refuses to acknowledge Soon-ja's anti-granny ways (she doesn't cook or bake and uses swear words), the two grow closer as the film progresses. Every time they share the screen, hilarious and emotional dialogue is guaranteed. Exclusively the latter applies to Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri, who play the two parents Jacob and Monica. Although their mutual love is always palpable, they are in a continuous conflict that reaches its climax at the end. Jacob wants to leave sorting chicks behind and prove himself to his family with his own farm. Monica, on the other hand, is tired of living in a trailer and doing Jacob's bidding and is eager to give her children an adequate home. Both embody a couple that seems stable on the surface but is crumbling badly underneath.In addition to the fantastic actors, Chung Minari's direction adds the finishing touches. The script is funny, gets under the skin and gives someone the realistic picture of a family that wants to start a new and better life in the land of many opportunities. But the American dream is really only a secondary matter in Minari. Rather, Chung captures a natural and down-to-earth mood with stunning camerawork, a beautiful score and a lot of focus on the atmospheric mood. This makes the film a technical masterpiece that takes a lot of time in some scenes and therefore often seems almost still. This can sometimes seem tedious, but is completely in keeping with the overall feel of the film. While the first two acts of Minari focus on a lot of build-up and interpersonal interactions, things come to a head enormously in the last third. The film is told in a matter-of-fact way. Its inner and outer beauty makes Minari the feel-good experience of 2020!"
MINARI,15 February 2021,9/10,"With powerful acting, beautiful cinematography, and a nuanced script - MINARI is a slower paced film but each scene is filled with meaning not only in what is said but what remains unsaid, true to Asian aesthetics. The film follows the story of a Korean immigrant in America who moves his young family to start a farm in Arkansas, much to the shock of his wife, the added responsibility of his eldest daughter, and the wonder of his young son who must also learn to live with his quirky Korean grandmother who moves in with them. In turns touching, laughter-inducing, and heart-breaking, what sticks with me the most is the way it captured so honestly the struggle between pursuing ones dreams and keeping a family together.As a child of Asian-American immigrants there was so much in this film that resonated with me. The struggle of immigrants to make it in a world that is not made for them. The children of immigrants who must honor their cultural upbringing but also must negotiate living in the only country they have ever known. The savoring of special foods others may not understand. The ignorant, unintended as it may be, slights one must endure as the cultural outsider. But the film does not languish in Asian-American stereotypes and tired immigrant story troupes but subverts them by taking seriously the perspective of the immigrants portraying them in the center of their adulthood, not as aging or irrelevant but as fleshed out three dimensional characters with hopes, joys, fears, flaws, and deep disappointments.The film as a whole is not focused on race but rather on telling the story of one family of immigrants trying to make it in one corner of America. It is worth noting that the director, whose story the film is loosely based on, as well as the actor playing the father, both were entering into the story of their own immigrant fathers. As a young father myself it helped me to understand more and step into the shoes of my father who I recently lost - the struggles he likely had to endure and the fights I remember he had with my mom. Although even the film industry may not view it so, this too is a very American story, especially as a nation that is made up of immigrants."
MINARI,11 January 2021,9/10,"This film grows slowly scene by scene with the sensitivity and innocence of a child. Family, blend culture, acceptance in a new environment, old culture (parents), new culture (children), hard work...everything is there to be observed by the eyes of a little boy. Mesmerizing performance by this little boy Alan Kim."
MINARI,20 March 2021,7/10,"I wished it got something really powerful emotions carry throughout but it kind of goes flat by the end. Decent story, acting, cinematography. I liked the grandma's acting more than anyone else's. There are many such stories in India, Asia too but made on commercial angle. It might be fresh for American audience who got less tough of world cinema so hailing for Oscars. I doubt it got that Oscar worthy story or acting or cinematography to win any. But best of luck still though."
MINARI,5 January 2021,7/10,"I was a bit underwhelmed, loved the trailer which in hindsight was a bit spoilerish. The performances,cinematography, and directing are all great. However, I didn't find myself resonating with the characters or plot on an emotional level. This is arguably the main crux of the film. So overall it's a good film, but a better emotional resonance would have made it a great film."
MINARI,24 August 2021,6/10,"So no ending no beginning finishes abruptly tries too hard to be artsy , great characters great story, although nothing happened at all in the movie, it's not an action movie or a franchise it kind of just ended like there is a part 2 or something, we don't know what the heck happened with any of the characters."
MINARI,6 March 2021,8/10,"The acting is great, the directing is great, the story is well-written.
I didn't see The Father and Nomadland yet (seen everything else) and so far this movie should win best movie, screenplay and directing. Without any doubt.The movie made me smile, not once. It was just beautiful. It was simple, yet complex. Perfectly paced. If you ever wrote a script, you know how good it is.Really.. The movie just speaks for itself.Those that didn't like for some reason. I feel sorry for them. I can only think of they watched it, even though they don't like dramas. That's the only reason I can think of.(I know a person who doesn't like sci-fi at all. Not a single one. So when he has to watch one, he just hates it. No matter what. I guess the people that don't like this movie don't like dramas at all.)"
MINARI,17 March 2021,8/10,"Minari is one of the best movie of 2020, well written, performed and well shooted. The movie is about a korean family who started a farm In America, briefly and with no spoilers The movie is based on a fight between Four believes who all lived together, Christians and non religious like Paul and jacob. old generation and younger one, the grandma and David. Korean traditions and New way of life in america, and finally the conflict between Jacob with his goals and his wife who want to live the normal life.
The movie has the best script i've seen in 2020, well written and perfectly executed.
All the korean actors did a great perfomance but honestly steven(Jacob) does not deserves an oscar but I hope grandma win it, she deserves one for sure.
When you end the movie, go back 1:39:00 and see the greatness of cinema, one of the best frame in hollywood history. The two kids standing behind with there mother, while they are shadowed by their father, this scene said what will happen next. This frame said that a breakup is going to be happen soon, Jacob is closer to the camera because it's his moment and his wife is away because she is going to ruin our moment in the next scene where they talk about breaking up. And then the fire happens and end the movie."
MINARI,18 June 2021,6/10,"The film is showing how hard it is to established in USA as an immigrant korean family. It is turn between hope, effort, desperation and luck.It is not so feel good movie but something about determination and courage.Young actor Alan (David) perrformance was super and he will be a star in future.Some phases are boring and negativeness overload the film. What i think is such a movie should deserve more positive ending than it was. That is what audience expecting from such a inspirational story.Anyway movie is average but reccommended to watch if you are looking for korean family movie hit."
MINARI,26 November 2021,8/10,"Don't let the slower pace deter you. Minari offers many sweet and deeply intimate moments amidst this flawed but brave set of characters. It's a gentle movie that brushes on many hard topics such as immigration, the American Dream and race. This is the kind of film that earns the attention it gets from critics and audiences, and isn't just Oscar bait."
MINARI,17 April 2021,5/10,This movie started out with a plot then as the plot was beginning to resolve itself the movie ended. So what happens to the family? Do they stay together? Can they save the farm? Is there supposed to be a Chapter 2? If there is I won't waste my time watching it.
MINARI,4 January 2021,3/10,"It's the opposite of everything they told you it's going to be, it's not inspiring, not touching, has no plot and boring af.
If this movie is ""filled with emotions"" then i'm happy to be dead inside :)"
MINARI,10 January 2021,8/10,"An amazing family drama, telling the classic story of immigrants and that the ""American Dream"" is not how it's always seems to be. What makes this movie excellent is how much genuineness it has, coming straight from the director's life, and you could feel that beaming out of the screen."
MINARI,12 February 2021,2/10,"I'm shocked by the love this movie is receiving. We kept wanting to turn it off but kept hoping it would get better, it didnt. The only highlights here are grandma and Mr. Religious helper guy, everyone else is simply forgettable. I feel like this is going to be a hit at the awards show without any of the depth, acting or storytelling that movies like Parasite had. Bleh."
MINARI,20 February 2021,6/10,"I enjoyed the performances in this film, and it had a interesting story that kept my attention, with likeable characters. This tension of the story was built around whether the family could make a success financially of a small farm, and with learning to fit into the local culture. However, I didn't like the way that the Mother seemed to change her attitude at the end of the film, for seemingly no reason. It seemed that they were going to squeak by and sell their produce, after finding out that their son was improving physically, when there produce was ironically burnt up in a fire, just as they arrived back home to see their plans go up in smoke. The mother had been pessimistic through the whole film about their ability to be a success, and had even told the father that she was going to leave. So why then, at the end when all was lost, was she out in the field holding hands with her husband, while they were divining for water? This seemed like an out of character, feel good, tacked on ending. It didn't seem to fit with her attitude in the rest of the film , and left me with a unsatisfied feeling."
MINARI,8 May 2021,8/10,"The theme: Immigrants trying to make it in America has been much common these days both in films and books. I am reminded of Jhumpa Lahiri's ""Namesake"".It isn't easy and here in Minari shakes up a family life. Man has his dreams as a farmer in tough Arkansas. Wife wants a city life for which the family had migrated. Arrives grandma to join the family of her daughter. That further shakes up the family that is trying to pull together.The relationship of the little boy with her grandma is wonderfully pictured, first his rejection until his acceptance and love.The story moves placidly and the ripples of emotional conflict remains subdued though important.A beautifully made movie, deserves the various wins and nominations everywhere that justifies the art of movie making. East has risen in the art."
MINARI,22 April 2021,9/10,"There is no dialogue in the first scene of Minari. We just see a man driving a moving truck. A woman is following him in a station wagon, her hands clutching the steering wheel betraying someone who isn't usually the one driving. Her face is tense. They are clearly in a middle of nowhere, pretty, but nowhere. That wordless, actionless intro is perfect at setting the mood and the tone of the film. The man is Jacob (Steven Yeun) who has always dreamed of having his own farm, or, as he likes to call it, a garden. He wants to make something out of himself, something his kids could be proud of, something more than just being ""a expert chicken sexer"". I didn't even know such profession existed. So, they are moving from California to Arkansas where he bought land. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) is not exactly thrilled about the endeavor, especially when she sees that the house her husband assured her of is actually a mobile home. She is especially concerned about them being too far from any hospital - the couple's youngest child David (Alan S. Kim) has a heart defect. Jacob and Monica are Korean immigrants. But what ensues could have happened to any family, really. Yes, Jacob's plan is to raise specifically Korean vegetables to tap into the niche market of apparently sizable Korean population in the surrounding areas. And Monica's mother (Yuh-Jung Youn), plucked straight from Korea to watch the kids, plants minari seeds she brought with her by the stream. Beyond that the family's origin is the movie's rich flavor, but not the essence. There seems to be no culture clash. And what I found really hard to believe is that in this lily white rural area where the Koreans stick out like a sore thumb they are never treated like ""the others"". There was only one time that I remember when David's future best friend introduced himself by asking, ""Why is your face so flat?"" The mildly deranged man (Will Patton) whom Jacob hires as a helper is a Korean war vet, but it's mentioned only in passing. There's an advantage though to not focusing on the family's otherness. The essence here is just human. Something we can all relate to. Dreams and risks and fears that come with them. Faith - blind, weird, and one that comes from deeper understanding of life. And perhaps most importantly, relationships - not just between spouses, but between daughters and mothers, grandchildren and grandparents. The story falls apart a bit upon closer look and the ending felt abrupt to the point of being improbable. But it doesn't matter because you fall in love with every one of these characters. I can't help making a comparison with last year's Parasite, that was all dark and evil. Minari is full of light and true, genuine goodness."
MINARI,1 March 2021,6/10,"I guess Korean and Asian movie is a thing now thanks to Bong Joon-Ho and Parasite. This movie isn't anywhere close to the level of Parasite. Just saying this so people would have lower expectation.The plot itself is something all immigrant can relate. But the actual execution of the movie... I don't know who it's being presented to. It's not American audience as it has very little they can relate and it's subtitled. At least not to mass audience. It's not for Koreans as the acting other than Youn Yeo-Jung are not convincing enough. In fact, Steven Yeon's accent is distinctively 2nd generation Korean. I thought someone of his acting pedigree should've trained harder to learn how the first generation Koreans speak. Hollywood actors do it all the time when they have to be Irish or Scottish or Australian, they train with speech trainer. And then the director can't tell the difference either as he is also 2nd generation Korean.
Maybe this is presented to few film aficionados who are willing to read subtitles.And there's difference between open ended movie and movies that just leaves you hanging. This is the latter.The movie had potential to be much better. But in the end, falls short of what it could've been."
MINARI,15 March 2021,7/10,It feels good to watch it. the ending was very beautiful specially when David runs toward his grandmother to stop her. the story was nice and the music amazing. and Steve Yeun had a great performance as Jacob
MINARI,26 November 2021,10/10,"Minari is the ultimate movie about the Asian immigrant experience in (rural) America. It is authentic, heartwarming and beautifully written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Its bilingual cast is also responsible for some of the most memorable performances in recent times - culminating in well-deserved Oscar and BAFTA wins for Yuh Jong Youn. There is a lot to digest in this movie - positive racial themes assimilation, family values, survival. Ageing issues, perseverance and intercultural friendship. For my money, Minari should have won all the major awards at the Oscars this year, but it would be too much to expect the Academy to recognise two Korea-related movies in consecutive years - Parasite won last year. Notwithstanding, Minari has a special place in my heart as this was the movie that lifted me during the lowest point of the pandemic lockdown and brought a smile (and tears) to my face."
MINARI,21 January 2021,8/10,"This started out to be run of the mill story but soon became obvious as to its intent. The acting was great the use of both English and Korean added a flare for paying attention to the actual content. You need to pay close attention to each actors relationship with each other to truly feel the writers message. Normally I don't get into this style of Film, but I found myself getting more and more intent on finding the answer to the plot. I get it. Well done to all involved with this film. 👍🏻"
MINARI,2 January 2021,9/10,Every Immigrant family can relate when working very hard when sacrifices are made to build a great future for the family n kids.This beautiful family is ready for a new start. The Parent leads were amazing. Such honesty in your roles and dialogue was real.The Dad The Optomist Half Glass Full and The Mum The Realist Half Empty. The couple are on the rocks and reach boiling point.The Grandma & David scenes are the pure comedy. Anne was the superglue of the fam. Def feels with every scene after the Grandmas prayer for David.Def felt like a Christian Faith movie without the cringe affect but also felt very Pixar like with the Storyline. I personally loved the movie for the Family First values and the sacrifices we made.What I took away with the Manari was that the Nana was there Guardian Angel. Her presence changed everyone of one the family of 4 ndirectly or directly. Minari has blessed them.This movie is very similar to The Farewell in some themes. Overall big fan. Thank A24 another gem to the Collection
MINARI,12 March 2021,9/10,"This type of movie is not one which involves a lot of action scenes, violence and fights. The movie depicts the reality of life, with it's ups and downs. It's about survival, about the power to overcome every obstacle as a family, as one being. I've always loved very realistic movies and those kind of movies, with existential truths and problems, are the best yet.The level of realism depicted in the movie, the chilling atmosphere which really makes you feel like being in there, the acting and the very straightforward and easy to understand storyline, makes of ""Minari"" one of the best movies I've seen of this type. However, the movie is not the best, because I would have loved to see more emotional moments, or at least a little bit more emotional depth to the scenes which are already presented in the movie. Apart of that, the movie surely isn't a waste of time."
MINARI,9 August 2021,10/10,"...it was way past my bed time and I played it in back ground while having my late night beverage. Yet, it finished it one go.Go for it."
MINARI,8 May 2021,8/10,"My first movie back in the cinema, after 6 months of lockdown. This isn't a big spectacle with amazing vfx and big explosions and a huge budget. This is a movie about finding family and realizing what's important in life and the struggles that follow. About the little things and the focus of the characters and setting - A movie we need more than ever at this time.The cinematography is astonishing, and every shot is beautiful and thought out to illustrate the circumstances of the life of being an immigrant, trying to settle down and provide for your family. This is the American dream about creating something of your own, something for your kids, for your family.Every shot providing new information about American and Korean culture and the differences and similarities there is between the two. Giving us as viewers an insight into how it is coming from basically nothing and try to establish a living.The characters have a lot of depth with everyone feeling real with different views on life, on religion and the small things and passions. Everyone has secrets, fears and everyone uses different ways to cope with feelings, which is clearly apparent in the movie. Showing how every character cope with their new life differently and at times you feel the dread and pressure on the characters as the camera focuses in on the conversation and actions displayed on screen. The family and friends hide their emotions and hold each other back in ways they might not know, pushing each other away and pulling each other closer. These small things are not apparent to the naked eye, but is expressed or held back by the emotion they chose to show, and what we chose to show and not to is typically more dangerous than what we see visually with our eyes. Emotions are greatly illustrated and acted out on screen, and you buy every performance both the children and the elderly. You buy their character and their background from the very first shot, to the very last before the credits roll.This is a stunning movie which is technically and emotionally impactful, a movie we needed in a time of covid and quarantine. It shows the important of family and the small things even if you have your personal struggles to express yourself and tell the people closed to you what you're going through instead of letting it build up and in the having a negative impact. I'm glad this was my first movie back in the cinema, as this was truly the warmth I needed.8/10."
MINARI,20 September 2021,7/10,"Before I start this review, just for your reference I'm Korean. I started watching this movie thinking that there will much more racial (discriminatory) factors in this movie, instead the plot was focused on much more of the financial suffrage for the characters. The acting was phenomenal but I think that there were a lot of lose parts in this movie."
MINARI,29 April 2021,9/10,"Very relatable characters and story is what makes this film great. Audience can connect a lot with what is happening on screen and become emotionally engaged with it. The writing was great, perfect mix of comedic lines and dramatic arguments. The story is simple but this film looks more in depths of many elements to the family's choice of moving to a new place to start a farm."
MINARI,19 April 2021,9/10,"Beautiful and meaningful film based on an immigrant family who came to America from Korea in search of a dream to prosper their lives. They gets crumbled by obstacles when Jacob Yi tries farming. Their life gets so hard and it reaches at a point where Jacob's wife think that her husband's bond with the family is not that solid.The movie mainly talks about familial bond and how important it is for well-being of the family members. It's such a wonderful movie. I never felt any problem with the cinematography.The screenplay is pretty solid and the acting delivered by the cast is simply mesmerizing.Throughout the film the direction is really good but in the climax scene even though everything was so good but I was not able to be immersed in it. The climax was good, some minute error in delivering the feeling of the situation had occurred.Overall, the film is a must watch and it's so damn good that it can be considered as a masterpiece."
MINARI,16 June 2021,10/10,I absolutely love bed watching this film. I'm a #KDrama fanatic so it's a natural fit. But it's much more than i even expected. It's a beautiful film and the performances are exquisite. And! What a sound track! Beautiful! It's so well worth the watch. A gem for sure.
MINARI,1 July 2021,8/10,"An American production written and directed as a semi-autobiography by Lee Isaac Chung, the film follows a Korean-American family who move to rural Arkansas in the 1980s to start a farm and chase their own American dream.The story is fairly simple but it serves the film well. The family dynamic is portrayed very well and is wholesome and heart-rending in equal measure.All the cast put in great performances, and Youn Yuh-jung and Steven Yeun both rightfully earned their Best Supporting Actress and Best Actor wins and nominations respectively, but I'd like to highlight Alan S. Kim's wonderful performance as David. He brought real heart to the film and was very charming and funny. I feel he should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and I wish child actors would get more recognition for their roles.The score from Emile Mosseri was beautiful and unobtrusive and it definitely pushed Soul for Best Original Score while I also loved the bright and naturalistic cinematography. There was so much lovely, detailed attention paid to the lush greenery surrounding the farm. It really helped to complement the thematic elements of the film.Ultimately, Minari is a compelling and beautifully shot family drama led by fantastic performances from both the adult and child actors. This one will definitely be making my top 10 of the year so far."
MINARI,13 May 2021,9/10,"Beautifully written..well executed and brilliantly act...Character of David is really amazing..
Overall film last the impact after end..! Great to watch as a family film."
MINARI,12 January 2021,10/10,"This Probably Won't Leave My Head Easily As It Was An Emotional And Beautiful Korean-American Story That Truly Resonates With You. This Is Probably My First Movie Of 2021 In Other Labguage. Its Beautiful Movie, Thanks Brad Pitt For Producing Such A Masterpiece. Its Is Just A Falling Star From Sky And You Wish That It Can Real. Voila"
MINARI,25 February 2021,8/10,"A stranger family in a strange land. A movie with big heart, yet at the same time, showed you what a struggle really meant for an immigrant Korean family. It told you how religious and superstitious the Koreans might be, like the wife and, how impatient a wife would have become for a slow result of the hard working. Her life values and standards were so different from her husband, a man of dreams and never be afraid to try his best to make it come true, even there were so many obstacles and failures that might make his broke. It also told how ignorant the old generation would be.The husband role was so perfectly performed that's an Oscar level acting. The little boy was also so talented, by the smart script and the director's guidance, his performance was also an Oscar level achievement. There were moments that this movie seemed to lose the energy to go on strong, but the viewers would be very patient to let those moments passed. The ending was very inevitable and very predictable. Three females, the wife, the grandma and the daughter, somehow were not as appealing and likable as the husband/father and the little boy. All in all, this Korean movie is quite joy to watch even with a doomed sadness in the end."
MINARI,26 March 2021,1/10,"I humbly think there's something seriously wrong with the so called film critics and with the film industry in general. Minari is, by no means, a bad movie and it's certainly not an awesome one, either. It's there in the limbo of just bland, boring, hackneyed and cheesy beyond repair movies. In my 50+ years, I have watched almost every thing movies: I like almost every genre, I can sit through the slowest paced movie, I can watch mindless superhero movies. As long as the movie offers me something: a clever plot, an intelligent story, an unforseen twist, an original and creative storytelling, cool visuals, interesting characters, it makes me cry like a baby or laugh like a mad hatter. .. For me, Minari has none of the above. I'm sure that there are plenty of inmigrant stories worth of being told, but not this one. Don't be fooled by the critics and reviews that will tell you that if you do not enjoy this snorefest, it's because you are not ""getting it"", you're not smart enough or you have no idea what good filmmaking is. Masterpiece? Slice of life? Realistic? ""Roma"" is all this things, and then some. Oscar worthy? Not even close. I didn´t love ""Sound of Metal"" or ""Mank"", but those two are good movies (especially the latter). I hope that the future of filmmaking will be focused in entertain and move and amaze it's audience, and not (exclusively) in meeting political agendas and correctedness. If that is the case, I'll stick to rewatching old classics."
MINARI,18 January 2021,10/10,"Soonja is the best character of the year so far like it is incredible how moving she is, how sweet and charming, and her ability to be relatable and recognizable despite proximity to immigration being our only common link and even that to varying degrees is powerful. My friend texted me and said that her mom told her this movie was basically her life on film which was so amazing to hear so for that Lee Isaac Chung and this film's screenplay deserve much more props and I am expecting Oscar noms and wins best believe. Emile Mosseri is my favorite composer now confirmed after Kajillionaire and now this there is absolutely no competition I am streaming that man on Spotify so hard he's bout to be my number one artist next to like Lady Gaga and now Olivia Rodrigo for her Driver's License song (how 2021 of me). Sledgehammer of an emotional ending I got to clear my tear ducts mighty well and I maintain anyone whether an immigrant themselves or first generation can find someone to relate to and see multiple people they know in this film which is a testament to the craft of the story and the underlying experience we can bond over."
MINARI,9 January 2021,7/10,It seems like the director got bored after two hours and cut the movie short where he should not have to.
MINARI,27 March 2021,8/10,"Lee Isaac Chung has weaved together an incredible story that perfectly encapsulates the up and downs of a struggling but resilient family. The characters are expertly written, they each have so much depth to them and feel real. This is in part to the brilliant performances from each cast member, especially Alan Kim as David which is probably one of the best children performances I've seen. They each convey so many emotions, I laughed, smiled and cried throughout the movie. The backdrop of rural Arkansas provides a sense of warmth with it's beautiful fields which really adds to the heart-warming story. Overall this movie is a must watch that realistically portrays the pain and sadness that families experience, but also the ability to push through the hard times with the support of a loving family."
MINARI,18 February 2021,8/10,"I was really excited to watch this movies as everyone had been raving about it. It's racked up some pretty big award nominations (as of this writing, 2/18/21) and even won some ""smaller"" awards including Best Foreign Language Film, Best Supporting Actress, Movie of the Year, Best Original Score, and Best Original Screenplay.
That all being said, I was disappointed.
It's not bad, at all. It's just not GREAT.
First, it was shot beautifully. Lots of color in the Arkansas landscape. The actors are all DELIGHTFUL! Very funny and heartwarming. Lots of things at play with these Californian-Korean people in rural Arkansas. No messages, at all, though, which is a plus.
The story just doesn't seem to go anywhere.
Maybe I was expecting MORE. It's a good film, and I love seeing Steven Yuen again (Glenn, from The Walking Dead). It's probably too slow for MOST people, though I don't mind slow movies. This movie, though, was NOT among the best movies of the year.
It's good, though. (Walt D in LV 2/18/21)"
MINARI,28 January 2021,9/10,"Although I had high expectations for the film, I never imagined it was going to be this good. A story of a Korean family starting a farm in rural Arkansas during the Reagan era. Watching this family living in a trailer home, struggling to make a business out of Korean vegetables, was such an emotional experience for me. As an Asian man myself, I really wanted to go up to this family and hug them and just tell them everything will be ok. A miraculous film about the pursuit of happiness and the true bonding of a family. Also as a huge fan of Glenn in ""The Walking Dead"", it is nice to see Steven Yeun keeping up the great work. Definitely, one of the best movies of the year!"
MINARI,19 July 2021,9/10,"Gently and beautifully tells the immigrant story; the challenges, hopes and dreams. The acting is excellent. The interplay between David and his grandmother is especially sweet and illustrates both the contrast, and merging, of old and new worlds. A delightful film."
MINARI,3 May 2021,9/10,A simple story of an ordinary family. That simplicity makes this so special. It feels so natural.
MINARI,13 April 2021,5/10,"Very slow, lovely at times, decent movie being handed Oscars because that's what we do today. Okay cinematography, okay acting, some good, some bad. Nodded off multiple times. And no, it's not because I like dumb action films. Depressing ending. So disappointed in this film. I guess when there is a pandemic and not many films being released you can't be picky."
MINARI,28 August 2021,7/10,"Very good acting but the story is a bit slow
Would I see it a second time:no
I did not walk out of the cinema because of the excellent acting especially of the gran ( oscar) and the two children."
MINARI,6 January 2021,5/10,Mainly good becouse not many similar available.Diffrent people diffrent culture. Has many caring and sympatico moments.
MINARI,7 April 2021,7/10,"I watched this film sue to the awards nominations it obtained. And of course because lately I have been watching quite a few good Korean movies.This movie is a simple story that revolves around a little family who aspires to strive on a farm in a foreign land. Facing many obstacles and challenges, this family is edged at times to the corner, and even to a breaking point.A beautiful film, but not that impactful. It leaves a saddening vibe at least to my heart. It will leave you with the question "" will they find their happily ever after? Will they be ok and stick together? Will the kids grow well?"" The story just leaves you to a few scenes of new hopes for the family.A 6.8 from me to be exact."
MINARI,10 April 2021,8/10,Beautiful movie... I remembered my grandmother (vovó). But something missing at the end. Did not know Brad Pitt is an executive producer for this movie. A potential Oscar winner for 2021.
MINARI,19 January 2021,7/10,"Minari is a movie that deals with struggle of a Korean immigrant family to survive in USA.
It's one of the good draman
movies of 2020. Until I see this movie I didn't now about director Lee Isac Chung now I know that he is an son of immigrant family so may be the little boy represent the director of the movie who is also writer of the movie. Apart from Steven Yuen who plays father of family, I didn't see any other actors or actresses before but acting was very good. All the family performances were convincing so you can easily care for this family. I think it is one of the best drama movies of 2020. Anyone who wants to see a drama movie, should see this movie."
MINARI,21 February 2021,8/10,"Minari is an elegant, graceful film about a family that have moved from California to Arkansas in the hopes of a better life.Lee Isaac Chung has crafted an intimate story that has a lot of laughs and a lot of love. The film is beautifully shot and edited with a great score. The screenplay is filled with heart and gives a real voice to the story of the immigrant struggle that many will related too.Steven Yeun is brilliant as a father wanting to prove himself to his family but equally Yeri Han matches up to his subtle yet complex performance with her own nuanced portrayal of a mother wanting the best for her children.Alan S Kim is adorable as David and fan favourite Yuh-jung Youn is both heartbreaking and sidesplitting as an unconventional grandmother.I saw the film with quite a tame audience that didn't really laugh at much as the film which had me questioning my interpretation of the story as I found it ridiculously amusing at parts.I found the ending just a little abrupt and wanted a little more but then that is a sign of a good thing. You cannot have too much of it.Minari is deft and has a real dignity about it with stellar performances, technically acute with universal themes all crafted into a personal story."
MINARI,9 February 2021,8/10,"The story is one to be told and a relatable one for many Asian families immigrating in a foreign country. A lot of interesting moments and an overall good movie with a nice soundtrack. However I didn't feel the script really conveyed everything the story wanted to tell, including the meaning of Minari. I could feel the movie tried many times but didn't succeed. Steven Yuen also didn't feel right for this role, maybe he's too American to play the father. Had the potential to be much more but still a good movie"
MINARI,13 August 2021,1/10,"Despite all the awards this film got and how the critics put this into a pedestal, sorry but I don't see what they saw in this. Yes it's a good drama about the struggle being Asian in the states. It's a good story to tell but it's typical. I'm a huge fan of Korean cinema and there's so much better than this. Almost slept halfway through the movie."
MINARI,29 January 2021,5/10,"I'd say that I had relatively good expectations for this film. It was a let down.
The main reason is because the film was just so boring. I think this is probably because it didn't make me really care for many of the characters in the film.
However, I at least cared about Steven Yuen's character's ambitions, which is something I can't say about the other characters.
I'd say that the acting was good but not Oscar worthy and the directing was nothing to special. But the boring script is the main reason I didn't enjoy this film like I thought I would've."
MINARI,28 June 2021,7/10,"I did give it a 7 because of engaging characters. The story keeps you interested, but something is missing to turn this from a good film, to an excellent film."
MINARI,9 January 2021,9/10,"This movie once again proves that A24 is the most consistent studio in making great movies in Hollywood.
Minari shows all ranges of emotion and one of the few films where kids act like kids, have a family that feels authentic, especially the grandma, superbly played by Youn Yuh-jung. It further depicts how the western way of living affects people who are not born in it. It's easily one of the best movies from 2020."
MINARI,8 January 2021,9/10,"There's a lot that can be said about the multi-cultural family dynamic, the 80's backdrop, and the ""American Dream"" sentiments that encapsulate this film's themes - but I'm just impressed at how comforting this film is, despite its ending.The soundtrack is one of the best of 2020, the relationship between this kid and his grandmother is absolutely amazing, and the whole cast does a fantastic job. Definitely a film I'm looking forward to revisiting."
MINARI,10 February 2021,3/10,"A muddling movie with great potential that falls flat. Will Patton and Steven Yeun give great performances but they cannot save a plot that just drags along with no payoff. Unfortunately the movie focuses too much on the son that they want you to feel bad for because he has a heart condition but such pitty stories are tired and worn out and I just wanted those scenes to pass. The father Jacob's story had the potential to be inspiring and should have been the focus, instead they chose the childish grandmother and his abnoxious and disrespectful son. The reviews here are highly skewed towards those who see a familiarity in their own Korean families but family stories do not always make a good movie. Since I am not Korean I feel more objective in saying this was a disappointment all around and I would not watch it again. I hate moves that go from smart to dumb to depressing and then end. My rating is for the acting of the two main male characters only."
MINARI,5 May 2021,9/10,"A great film indeed. Korean cinema seldom disappoints and this film is an example of how perfect you can paint a family story without showing too much depth But that doesn't make this a simple film, it's filled with numerous moments that'd leave you in awe. A beautiful yet so strong film. Performances made this film stand above many great family drama films. Its a job well done by Chung. The only slightest problem I felt was starting. The viewer had to grip his/her claws deep down to hold it because the starting isn't that much compelling that'd hook you up."
MINARI,28 February 2021,7/10,Spectacular ensemble! Story is lightweight but weighty on performance and impression.
MINARI,23 April 2021,10/10,"Last year Parasite won Best picture and it was fair, it was great, but my heart´s favorite was Jojo Rabbit.This year is the same, tho i don´t know which film will get he oscar home i know it won´t be Minari.It´s a warm movie with little problems that end up being vey important, you create a little connection with each one of the characters.I totally recommend it to everyone."
MINARI,23 March 2021,2/10,"I really don't understand how this movie got so many Oscar nominations. Disjointed, unfocused story with no conclusion."
MINARI,8 March 2021,6/10,"Interesting Film, good acting, nice pace, possibly a good story - but we never find out due to THAT ENDING!"
MINARI,31 July 2021,7/10,"To be honest, the movie started good but couldn't end well
The ending is empty, and at some points of the movie I felt bored
I love the acting of main actor, his son and the grandma they done good job.Good movie I wished it was better, I would not recommend watching this movie because the story not complete."
MINARI,6 June 2021,6/10,"Prettily done but almost aggressively conventional. I've seen this all before, done more or less equally as well."
MINARI,26 April 2021,1/10,"It has just gotten sad to see what Hollywood is doing, but the good news is the movies of the 80s and 90s are doing great and making a huge comeback !!!"
MINARI,21 May 2021,9/10,A beautifully constructed drama . You feel for the family . As an asian most of scenes are found to be much relatable . A junction of cultures . The settling in .
MINARI,4 March 2021,8/10,"Such a beautiful, meaningful, and profound film. Lee Isaac Chung has made cinema centered on human emotions to tell us that life is good and can be better. Sometimes when the wind is devastating, we need to be like Minari; Trying our best to grow as much as we can, No matter the circumstances. Sometimes we just need to say Thank You and, at the same time, fight for making a better life. And Sometimes, when the world makes us give it a stick so it can beat us, We just need to find the thinnest and finest one. Then the pain won't be that much, and We will move on.
I really enjoyed this film; I liked it."
MINARI,19 March 2021,1/10,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. Film without any plot,music,smiles,emotions. AWEFUL"
MINARI,4 April 2021,7/10,"Many stories about the ""American dream"" are constructed around families from different social backgrounds in big urban areas, so it's very refreshing to see the hard work and the will to survive from a Korean family in the middle of rural America.Funny, beautiful, impactful, ""Minari"" is a great story about a man's determination of creating the best possible life in a very difficult time. And the score is *chef's kiss*"
MINARI,13 March 2021,7/10,"We have here a beautiful movie, certainly the best foreign one. This movie is special, prays the circle of family in a wonderful way. It's a must watch. 8/10."
MINARI,23 March 2021,6/10,"A Korean family of 4 moving to rural Arkansas to fulfil the wish of the stubborn father to becoming a farmer during the 80's.
The film is beautifully made with good acting from most of the actors, young and old.
I suppose there's only so much autobiographical story to tell about the farmer father and the struggling mother so the large portion of the film focuses on the two children and their visiting maternal grandmother.
A well executed two hour family movie but failed to leave much impression to this viewer."
MINARI,17 February 2021,9/10,"Fantastic movie. Manages to avoid all the expected clichés. Very gorgeously shot with a subtle aesthetic. Has a heartwarming quality about the characters, while also managing to gradually break your heart as it progresses.
There's no real antagonist but life itself.
And it's beautiful."
MINARI,15 January 2021,10/10,"What I liked
1. Real-life immigrant story
2. Emphasis on little details and struggles
3. Complex topics captured in wholesome manner.
5. Brilliant acting
6. Southern country setting.As Grandma said: Minari is wonderful, grows like weeds on curbs, eaten by both rich and poor, and supremely healthy. The movie felt just like that. This screenplay is a deeply intimate portrayal of an immigrant story. It has a slow country flow- which keeps the viewers soothingly involved as if we are part of the family.It touches important topics: Emotional struggles of immigrant couples, complicated relationship between 1st generation (children) and their grandparents, a family falling apart because of financial concerns, spending time with friends to solve problems at home, ignorance of white folks, Asian mindset of always-""be practical and useful"", and many more subtle details. It weaves all these details and presents us with a wholesome, sad yet hopeful story about the life of immigrants.American dream is so glorified, but this vulnerable story gives us a big reality check. As Asian myself, I could relate a lot. Thank you! :)"
MINARI,4 June 2021,7/10,"A great movie that has amazing acting, an on point story, and amazing filmmaking. I smiled throughout most of the movie for the arguments and interfamily relationships remind me of my own. There are some issues, but I definitely recommend it."
MINARI,5 August 2021,8/10,"The American dream from the Korean perspective. Nothing entirely new, but beautifully shot and strongly acted, especially Han (mother), Kim (son) and Youn (grandmother) take the cake. They made me get close to breaking up in tears several times. The plot isn't corny at all, the characters appear really ambivalent and complex and therefore authentic, with positive and problematic aspects alike, making no one entirely to blame for the situation the family finds itself in (aside from the premise that the father makes a severe life decision in the beginning without consulting his wife first). Surprisingly, racism isn't any part of the story, or at least it's very subtle for a change. This makes the family drama and the struggle between male and female family role models move more into focus. To be honest, the final moral or message the movie tries to deliver at the very abrupt ending is lost on me. But all in all it's a strong drama for fans of Korean or American movies alike."
MINARI,9 April 2021,8/10,"The ending falls a bit flat for me, I feel like they could've done more for the ending. However I still enjoyed the movie. It was funny sad and heartbreaking all at the same time. It's not something I'd watch more than once tho but I'm still glad I watched it!! The performances these actors and actresses gave were absolutely spectacular, I could really feel the emotion through such a tiny screen."
MINARI,13 May 2021,6/10,It's a Nice Movie but Overhyped . Excellent acting by everyone especially grandmother. Duration is bit long it could have 1.5 Hrs.But definitely one time watch.Final Verdict - Not at all Oscar material.
MINARI,14 March 2021,9/10,"Minari Roots Deeply Planted in Resilience of Korean Family: Written and directed by Lee Issac Chung, ""Minari"" follows the Yi family, Jacob, Monica, their 2 children Anne and David and maternal Grandmother, Korean immigrants seeking to live their dream in 1980's America, when father Jacob buys land and moves them all to rural Arkansas to start a farm and garden growing Korean vegetables for wholesale market. The struggles and challenges they face in achieving the dream creates friction, but ultimately strengthens their bond as a family. Simple, relatable story, the film is beautifully shot and the acting from the cast is flawless."
MINARI,3 April 2021,1/10,"Nothing happened in this movie, and in the most boring way possible. Slow, and dull, is how I would describe this garbage - and that's an understatement. Save your time, and avoid this waste of screen pixels. Watching paint dry is more entertaining."
MINARI,5 May 2021,1/10,"Bad movie. So boring. Yawned many times, yoon yeojung was good at acting but she was even better in Canola and numerous other korean movies. If people think this is the peak of her acting n she deserves an oscar for it, she deserves 100x oscars for all the other work she did that were way more amazing in my opinion. And as a korean american, i did not relate to minari in one bit, which is strange. Maybe director lee isaac chung had a very niche experience. O well. Idk why people could relate so well to this movie. Did not see anything i see in my own immigrant experience in the US or relationships in my family. Oh well \_ (shrug shoulder)"
MINARI,13 February 2021,9/10,"Minari is a powerful, heartfelt film that was beautifully written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Great performances all around, too. Everyone should see this film. I can't recommend it enough."
MINARI,18 March 2021,2/10,"An extremely poor drama about nothing, Korean are learning the way to win awards at festivals! Praise the Americans and show America as the Promised Land! Enough, please make cinema for cinema, not for an award! The film is full of flaws in directing, mezzanines and final editing, full of useless scenes that have no meaning at all, the roles have nothing to say and no drama is formed at all, I do not imagine any award for this film ."
MINARI,28 April 2021,10/10,"I am speechless. I'm going back and watching all the best picture nominees and this movie was amazing. The acting, writing, directing, sound design all of it. This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'd give it an 11/10 if I could."
MINARI,2 August 2021,5/10,"Brilliant acting by Steven Yeun (Jacob Yi) and Yuh-Jung Youn (Grandma Soonja) make Minari a delightful film to watch. Their performances are completely natural and draw you into the family without effort. My major complaint is the film is boring. With so much great material to work with why can't we be treated to a faster paced and more exciting experience? One of the kids has a hole in his heart and could drop dead any second; the Yi family is on the verge on bankruptcy and could break apart any second; the creepy hillbilly neighbors could decide to run them out of town any second. Yet, due to the glacial timing, we are left with a film that delivers you into a world of crushing boredom. You know you are in for a slow ride when the most exciting thing to happen in the first hour is the family's water is turned off for non-payment. At that point in the film it seems like a hugely exciting event, oh my, what will they do? The answer is they coped with it and hauled water from the nearby creek until they could get it turned back on, end of drama.I was also disappointed in the ending. What happened to the Yi family? Did they cope with their misfortune or did they go back to California or even Korea? No resolution was even hinted at, much less delivered. Good performances and a good film if you love to watch good actors do their thing, otherwise booooring!"
MINARI,25 April 2021,7/10,"Delicate, smooth and strong ... How far can a father's dream in search of the best for his children and his wife go? Is ""American dream"" ideal for them even though they are not Americans?The script does not deliver much of the story developed, it is very slow and I believe that this is one of the minimum problems in the film, it takes time to walk and when it walks insists on not delivering much. The focus of the film is on the family relationship and simply shows the day-to-day life of each one.The father has his reasons and reasons as well as the mother has her reasons too, but there is no balance between them and the family pillar that there should be ends up being disrupted by the parents themselves.A good film from the A24 studio, which never disappoints in its distributions, but to be seen only once."
MINARI,13 February 2021,9/10,"I was entranced from the first minute to the end. It's such a simple story, the story of an immigrant Korean family trying to make a living in America. It was hyper-realistic, non-preachy and non-messagey, subtle and wholesome. Wonderful cast. The grandma and the young boy stole the show.I appreciated very much that the characters spoke mostly in Korean, as immigrants would do. Congrats to the creators/ producers for not succumbing to making the movie an English speaking one."
MINARI,12 September 2021,9/10,"This is a most excellent movie about an immigrant family who came to America for a better life and did achieve it in means they would never have thought of. This is the kind of immigrants that used to come to America, they came after much paperwork and fees, they worked hard, took care of their family, did not accept any handouts from the state or federal government. They continued their old ways but accepted the new ways. Such proud people they were. I would like to have people like this live next to me, I would like to know them as friends, to honor their traditions and teach them mine. And I would like to have had a 'grandma' like that.Excellent casting and cinematography....
Watch it........... And learn from it...........
Now where can I find some ""minari"" ?"
MINARI,27 May 2021,7/10,"Discreet work.Seen in the cinema.I have to be honest, I expected more.Sublime interpretation of the grandmother!Beautiful character Alan.Otherwise it lacks consistency.Unfortunately, the focus of the whole plot is the family and the Minari.Unfortunately, however, within the family at a certain point you do not understand much what must be done.There is a lot of confusion.The Minari practically never existed.It didn't actually affect the story.I didn't understand the metaphor of the church.The type with the cross that goes to the street on Sundays.I really liked the family relationship and the dialogue gang, very original.Asian comedy is very beautiful.For the rest mediocre film and not from ""Best Picture"" Oscar ...-Antonio."
MINARI,28 April 2021,6/10,"It's only OK. If you dig a new Hollywood's fetish for Asians, then you'll love it.If you're a normal person, then you will be asking yourself what's all the buzz about a movie we've seen a thousand times.BTW. Yuh-jung You really deserved the Oscar!"
MINARI,16 May 2021,8/10,Acting was fabulous. Well written story with Symbolic ending.Beautiful film.
MINARI,30 March 2021,7/10,"Minari brings us into the lives of a Korean family living in Arkansas. They live a simple life, but are faced with all the challenges that come with trying to live a simple life. The screenplay and performance of the cast fill this movie with emotion. But it's hardly ever anything grand or amazing. The film reminds us of the importance of our family, hard work, and faith. All this with a great score make it a delightful viewing."
MINARI,24 May 2021,7/10,"Minari was a great family film that I have entertained while I was watching. It contains beautiful life lessons and illustrates the family conflicts perfectly. The film touches on the family structure very well and beautifully narrates the story. However, there are a few points I would like to mention that concerned me. Although the film begins engagingly, it loses its focus and becomes more and more monotone as it goes on. I also think that even film aims to tell about immigrants, it felt more like telling a story of a family that has some issues with each other. I know that the source of this issue is moving to America, but I think that this movie is more about family conflicts rather than immigrating somewhere and creating a new life there. Finally, the ending of the film kind of annoyed me. I believe it was too short and does not mention how did the events resolve.To conclude, I expected something that I would think more about it, on the other hand, I would still say that it is an ordinary family film that most people would enjoy watching."
MINARI,31 March 2021,7/10,"I like this movie and it's funny to watch, good acting and well developed characters. But when the movie ends, you feel that some things are not resolved. It ends and that's all."
MINARI,16 March 2021,5/10,Okay this was a good experience but I felt it was a bit too long. If it was a 100 minute film then I could recommend this to anyone
MINARI,27 March 2021,6/10,"There are some issues with this film that while a good piece of film making and assured to get some gongs at the academy awards there are some serious flaws. I found I wanted so much more from this movie. The first issue was a lack of character development beyond the time and place where the movie was set. The acting was very wooden and there was a distance between the family members with the exception of the boy and the grandma and these two hated each other at the start. This made it hard to be emotionally invested in the family and their struggles. My last issue was at the end. All though the movie I was waiting for some kind of drama or high point and this only came when the grandma burnt down the produce store, why was she burning off rubbish? Why at night? And why alone? Why was she a sick woman left on her own? So much unanswered. Then after this ""crisis"" the movie ends, in my eyes it is a cheats end, no resolution for the watcher. I understand this will have been an artistic device to make people discuss the film further but its just looked bad and made me dislike the movie. I understand there was an attempt at real life and life is always a slog and seems to lack drama, for most of us. But I'm watching a movie here guys at least give me a bit of an escape or entertain me."
MINARI,18 March 2021,10/10,I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can not recommend it more the acting is amazing and it's been quite a while since a film has taken my breath away like this one . The score fits so perfectly with the tone of the film and the pacing really allows you to get to know and understand the characters .
MINARI,4 February 2021,10/10,"It's unfortunate Golden Globes had to categorize this film as ""foreign"". In my opinion, this is the most American film of the year. Where else can you find an immigrant family leaving their homeland behind, starting from nothing, try to build a farm, learning how to assimilate with the locals while still loving their own culture? Without such a family, we'd not have the strong multicultural society that defines us today.I like this film for the fact that it focuses on hope and resolution rather than struggles and despairs. This is what the real life is all about. Unfortunate things do happen but most of the times good things will happen to people who put their heart and soul into their work. It's the journey that defines a person, not the end result and I think this movie has captured the essence well."
MINARI,12 May 2021,7/10,"""This movie is all about that.1. Relationship issues/fights between Jacob and Monica - Negativity
2. Jacob's dreams to make it big and loving to do what he knows best. His Passion
3. Monica's comparison of previous life and current life where she keeps complaining and talks of breaking up without being patient.4. David's hole in the heart
5. Anne's worry of what's going to happen
6. Grandma Soonja's remedy, helping David to do whatever he wants to and keep on inspiring him.7. Paul's strong faith in God doesn't shatter him under the toughest situations.At the end, the Minari plant just grows without much care and attention to it by outsiders.You see in Life, in your Life, you just have to let go of things we are running after day in and day out and live life more simply.Life is a wonderful experience, just cherish every moment consciously and paying attention.Stay Blessed !Rajev."
MINARI,1 May 2021,7/10,The story doesn't revolve entirely with the Farm itself and I like that. I see a real family dealing with what life brings to them every single day. It's what you can give or do for your family with honest and good intentions that makes it more special than any bad decisions and luck. The Boy made the family members connected until the very end. Grandma is a treasure.
MINARI,6 May 2021,7/10,"In the wake of Parasite's win, the world, and Americans especially are starting to welcome more films in different languages. And yet, reading these biased reviews, you can sense obvious pushback. A film about a Korean family from California moving to Arkansas to achieve the American dream is bound to create resistance.Every shot in this movie can only be described with one word. Clean. It's something that is consistent of Korean cinema, and Chung channels this perfectly. No messy or noisy shots allows the story to be the focus.The story is so simple, yet captivating. You get to see this family go through the struggles that most immigrants undergo regardless of their location. Though, I would imagine Korean-Americans would have a more connected experience watching this film.This was a much better film than Nomadland (no hate on Frances McDormand) and no one can convince me otherwise. For people who say the ending is unresolved, or empty, or lackluster, you did not understand the story. A semi-sweet ending was perfect for this moving film showing the struggles and hardship of immigrants.Ps. Pay attention to the Minari :)"
MINARI,26 May 2021,10/10,Absolutely stunning. Moved me to tears multiple times. Steven Yeun!!
MINARI,24 March 2021,6/10,"A family moves to the country to start a farm, what could go wrong?
You've seen it all before, many times only this time it's a Korean family that's the focus. Still predictable at every level only this time with subtitles.
Overlong and tedious, 6 Oscar nominations for what exactly?"
MINARI,20 March 2021,3/10,"For those of us that have come to this country in search of the ""American Dream"" while working illegal 12 or 15 hour days in the freezing cold or the scorching heat, Minari translates as a ""so what"" kind of a movie.Before you start throwing burnt egg plants and tomates, let me explain.As a movie fanatic and as a former migrant worker I have to take into account my personal experiences as well as past movies that have in more impactful ways have told a more convincing story of struggle and hope is accomplishing the American Dream.The one obvious movie that comes to mind is the 1984 movie El Norte by writer and director Gregory Nava. (We'll get back to this reference at the end of my review)While I'm thrilled to see a movie like Minari receiving substantial attention from critics and the academy award nominations, I believe political correctness is driving most of this movie's hype.The reason I'm sending this out there is the overwhelming shallow and disconnected story telling in Minari that failed to draw me in and convince me that the family's situation was unique and telling of golden nuggets of unspoken experiences. The closest the content comes to delivering anything remotely original and wise is the grandmother telling David not to throw rocks at the snake because it's better to see and know where scary things are instead of them hiding.This story needed some raw, dirty ugliness for it to grow into something believable and worthy of my empathy.It consistently failed to draw me into their world of struggle. A lot of this failure came from giving the viewer an extremely sterile existence: it was predictable, fragmented and slow.I wanted this movie to drag me through fields of pain, struggle and a dissection of cultural nuances. Instead the movie left me regretting the $19.99 rental and 1:56 minutes of non productive time.If you're looking for a better version of the struggle to reach the American Dream, watch El Norte and get ready for a life changing experience."
MINARI,14 February 2021,10/10,Excellent American family movie. Love love love.Reaches to the heart of humanity.
MINARI,14 May 2021,8/10,"I was moved by the plot and presentation of this movie. Though it's slow moving,each frame is beautiful and has something to tell us about the reality of life. It is clear from the film that the life and challenges faced by common man is almost the same everywhere...the movie is successful in rendering some strong messages like...importance & benefit of ...grandparents in the life of a child,caring of a mother,caring of a daughter,passion,hardwork,hope....everything is there ...in this simple movie... go n watch it."
MINARI,2 September 2021,8/10,"Not a fan of Korean traditional parental dynamic, don't like the crescendo or the climax, but the editing and implicit sense of humor was good enough to make me love half of this film. Love the grandma."
MINARI,30 March 2021,1/10,"This film is beyond overrated; not very good and not terribly original. Its story is virtually identical to Renoir's 1945 US film, The Southerner, and while that is not one of the celebrated Renoir films, it's still pretty good and a great deal better than this wan rip-off."
MINARI,21 March 2021,9/10,"Simple story of a modest family attempting to conquer the so-called ""American Dream"". It's not all rainbows and butterflies and this film clearly shows that.
For me, at leat Han Ye-Ri should win the oscar for best actress on a supporting role. The scene where she was crying has to be one of the best. Fantastic film and above all BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES."
MINARI,25 April 2021,1/10,"My wife and I were both unhappy about the fact that we spent two hours of our life watching this. To be honest it was probably our fault starting it expecting something in par with parasite which was definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. With those standards and expectations, this movie was a huge disappointment. We didn't feel any connection to the characters or any interest in what is to happen next. We just keep watching it as if someone's forcing us 😂"
MINARI,21 April 2021,6/10,"At this point, there have been countless movies about the American Dream. For me, the only extra thing Minari brought to the table was a Korean family. While that is essential because making it in America is much harder for immigrants and that needs to be represented on screen- and the acting was pretty good- I didn't feel like it was original and fresh enough to warrant so much critical acclaim."
MINARI,18 June 2021,3/10,"Well developed characters. This movie was a general let down. It wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly wasn't a great movie. I found it to drag on and on."
MINARI,27 April 2021,6/10,"An OK film, but in my opinion not at all worthy of all the nominations and awards received. Watchable, but slow moving to the extent of boredom. The most significant event happening near the end, but no further story development, so anti-climactic."
MINARI,21 September 2021,9/10,"This 115 minute film is about a Korean immigrant family, starting a life in Arkansas, ie back country America. Many problems come their way, but are narrated in a non-sensational way. Even so, the director keeps your eyes glued to the screen at every wonderfull shot, in combination with the excellent Korean actors and background music. Anothers strong point: most conversations are in Korean (with subtitles)."
MINARI,17 April 2021,8/10,"So, don't watch the film with the intention of it being a typical Hollywood style film with tonnes of over the top drama that hardly ever applies to real life.It's just a good, largely wholesome story about an immigrant family making a life and living in the USA. There are some really great characters in it, making it joyful to watch. The problems the family face are realistic and slower paced, much life real life.It's hard to say much more than that, I think you just have to see the film to see it's subtle beauty."
MINARI,13 June 2021,6/10,"Like Nomadland, another critically acclaimed movie from last year, Minari is a ""day in the life"" study of people in a difficult situation. Which is exactly what we don't need during the Covid pandemic.Anyone with a few years of experience knows life is difficult, challenging, and tragic. Do we need a movie to tell us this?Besides ""life is hard"" the movie tries to tell us religious people in Arkansas are backwards and crazy. In the movie, a religious fanatic speaks in tongues and casts out demons in several scenes. These acts don't ring true, and seem out of place in the movie. It does not advance the plot, or would not if the movie had a plot.All in all, and disappointing movie, given the hype. Except for the performance of Yuh-Jung Youn as the grandmother. Excellent, and only exceeded by her Academy Award acceptance speech, which was the best award speech in years."
MINARI,12 March 2021,8/10,"Not many stories are told as beautifully as this one. From the first moment we meet the family, a tight bond is built. You begin empathizing with each family member, especially as money gets tighter and Grandma arrives. Everyone is so important to the story and the fear that anything bad might happen to any of them, especially David, is constant.
It brought tears to my eyes in many scenes and there is not much more to say than this is truly one of the most (if not the most) magnificent stories told on screen in 2020. Wonderful job."
MINARI,24 January 2021,7/10,Simple and realistic story with some oscar worthy shots makes Minari one of the best of this year.
MINARI,12 October 2020,8/10,"Minari offers an encouraging and engaging view of the immigrant experience while also recognising the hardships that go alongside. Chung's naunced portrait of Family figuring out their place in the world is both small snd somehow rather grand, after it continues to win over the remaining crowds here, it'll soon be winning you over as Well."
MINARI,1 February 2020,10/10,"This will be a film talked about for a long time. The story is very powerful portrayed by fantastic acting. I could tell this story was written from the heart and was made with lots of passion. It was very easy to connect with many of the characters.No major negatives, which means everybody needs to see this film."
MINARI,31 December 2020,9/10,"Slice of life movie from A24. Very Nice!Although Korean Immigrant family story, it is universal.Even in 1980s a small farmer have to struggle make ends meet and no rewards after so much labor. There is a reference in movie of how old owner of farm blew his brains out. Too real in 3rd world countries like India where on average 20000 farmer do same every yearGrandma should be nominated for Oscar. Very Nice."
MINARI,15 March 2021,2/10,"Unfortunately I felt I wasted two hours without having fun, a movie without a story, a waste of time."
MINARI,20 April 2021,9/10,"Yup, my first review ever, and I dare to say it's a privilege to have watched Minari.I have been avoiding reading reviews and watching the trailer of this movie as I wanted to be surprised by what the experience would look like and damn.. It was the best movie experience so far in 2021.The story is well written, it is not trying to put all dramas in your face, a slow but strongly placed scene after scene, it's like watching real life in front of me. The soundtrack felt heavenly, the shot was beautifully put with the orange-ish tone, and the acting from the boy to father-mother to grandma was just too real.Going in the first few minutes, I thought it would be another classic struggle of an immigrant family-type movie; yes it is a struggle of an immigrant family but the delivery is not like one, it felt like it's everyday life, your usual family, and most importantly, shared hope and dream.It was definitely a blessing to watch the movie and I strongly recommend you to watch this as well."
MINARI,9 June 2021,5/10,"Its a good movie.But its not for me, or anyone else that are same to me.The movie is ""too festival"".I think it because the pace goes really slow,its really natural and grounded. Which gets me bored tbh hehe. The one that keeps me up is grandma. Shes so pure n fun. Great performance.But I like the ""minari"" simbolic scene at the ending. Its quite hit me. Wouldnt reccomend you if youre looking something entertaining."
MINARI,21 March 2021,9/10,"This is that rare thing, a well-balanced blend of poetic screenplay, perfect pacing, great acting and a storyline that crosses cultural and national boundaries. All parents will find something to relate to in this touching film. I have never rated a movie this highly before but I feel this one merits it. Sit back and enjoy the journey as this family seeks to find itself."
MINARI,17 March 2021,10/10,"My dad is from mexico and my mom is a latina from California, her side of the family is whitewashed and when I was 10, my grandma from my dads side came to visit us and we were so mean to her. She died before I was able to appreciate her and our culture."
MINARI,20 March 2021,10/10,A portrayal of an immigrant family trying to realize American dream in the farmland of Arkansas. The acting is so authentic that I feel like I am an invisible observer watch a family in the home. The dramatic events at the end moved my to tears.
MINARI,12 March 2021,9/10,"Minari is an exquisite family drama written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung and brought to life beautifly by an amazing cast led by Steven Yeun(Jacob) and Alan S. Kim(David). I was blown out by wonderful camera work and scenery. Every frame is so pure. It lifted this movie on another level. The story is an everyday life problem and looks abit usual at the first look. But it is nothing like that. There are so many little details that make this one so special. A cute and funny acting by the little man, the performance of the so called not real grandma and of course Steven Yeun. He talks so little but says so much. Absolutely stunning. Best male performance of the year that goes along with the best picture. A must watch!"
MINARI,23 May 2021,2/10,"A few good moments. A good story line, but it didn't deliver."
MINARI,30 April 2021,9/10,"When I first see the trailer I was really excited to watch the movie , I watched and I have the best experience and I was really fasinated .the film is so simple unless that you don't have much to explain or to spoil you need just to watch and live with them as you are a part of family and this type of movies we are really missing , minari is well written and directed , so as acting all actors did great job especially the grandma who is really funny , so Oscar worthy
I recommend to watch with your family."
MINARI,30 March 2021,10/10,Minari is not a 10/10 movie tbh. But the timing of this cannot be better so i gave it a 10. Steven Yeun has always been my favorites and i already predicted that one day he would receive a movie like this. I mean... the oscars is nothing compared to what he was given... If the stone is a wealth gap representation of parasite then minari ( water-needed plant ) is a family wealth dream symbol of Minari!
MINARI,13 October 2020,10/10,"Bruh, I am speechless... This was phenomenal film experience. This introduced me to Lee Isaac Chung's brilliance and ingenuity in filmmaking as well as his approach at conveying nuanced themes of family and acclimation through his marvelous direction and powerful screenplay that Chung wrote to keep the audience emotionally engaged.This remarkably unique story about a Korean family who embark on a new life in the countryside of Arkansas and start a farm while combating financial struggles and managing family differences plays itself out impeccably, bolstered by the breathtaking performances of Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, Alan Kim - he was so adorable, and Youn Yuh-jung, who is pretty much like Korean Meryl Streep. By the end, it becomes clear why the term Minari, which are water plants that grow mainly in East Asia countries including South Korea, is perfect for the title. There was absolutely nothing negative about this film, which means you should develop an interest in seeing this.This probably won't leave my head easily as it was an emotional and beautiful Korean-American story that truly resonates with you. I really look forward to rewatching this future. I truly hope this becomes the second Korean film after Parasite to get nominated in major award categories, especially Best Picture.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day :)"
MINARI,21 February 2021,3/10,"Halfway through the movie I realized it could end at any time and it would make no difference to the movie or the audience.When the movie did end the audience look at each and said, ""I guess it's over."" And we left the theater."
MINARI,26 November 2021,1/10,"The first hour of this movie is plain, uneventful, boring, everyday life of normal people. No drama, no laughs.I skipped the rest because it just doesn't make sense wasting time.I was attracted by the high ratings, well... what a disappointment."
MINARI,3 April 2021,6/10,"Minari is a 2021 A24 film about a Korean family moving away from the city and building a farm. Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Alan Kim, and Youn Yuth-jung play the family following the American dream in this small, quiet drama. Everything technical is on point here but the script just didn't have the punch I crave from a family drama on this level. This film definitely has something to say about the Asian experience in America, but it says it with real subtlety. Possibly too much subtlety. It's just not particularly memorable. Great performances, though."
MINARI,4 February 2021,6/10,Tragedies can make or break a family... Its upto us how we take it in our stride. Minari is the plant that even when left on its own grows it only needs good soil and close to a water source... Families are in a way of such kind.. It's need positivity and love and then allow it grow on its own trusting the instincts.
MINARI,7 June 2021,10/10,"There is so much we need to learn from others, this is the biggest teaching from this movie. We don't know what people went through and the power of the family to lean on.Despite the evident axial issues presented in the film, there are universal values that can taught through this movie."
MINARI,16 June 2021,8/10,"During the first half of the movie, it felt as if the movie was aimless and was going nowhere but all of the sudden, i found myself tearing up with the events that were being displayed. This movie excels in representing real people and the real struggles of trying to start something in a foreign land whilst trying to maintain a family."
MINARI,22 May 2021,7/10,"What impressed me is the characters are strikingly human, flawed yet lovable, weak in sone ways but strong in others. It is both tragic and hopeful, kind of like the ups and downs of life when they are a bit extreme for some. Yet it is the response of the characters to each situation that pleasantly surprises you and makes you think how you would react to it when in their shoes. Can't say it is an entertainer but definitely worth a watch and an afternoon of reflection."
MINARI,2 June 2021,3/10,Watched because I heard so many ads saying it's a great movie for this time. No it was very slow and boring. Oscar Smoscar!
MINARI,11 November 2021,7/10,Other posters have covered all the bases. I would just like to say that it was a joy to watch Will Patton play a character who is not psychotic or otherwise damaged.
MINARI,4 April 2021,10/10,"This is one that touched me in the theater but really got me on the way home. The characters were compelling and the story was riveting, but it was really after the film was over that it hit me. You will realize what family and commitment are really all about. Excellent film."
MINARI,7 November 2021,5/10,There can definitely be a better ending. It lacks clarity on many things. I liked parasite family drama better. Don't know if this is the case with only me. Actors did really well.
MINARI,21 March 2021,9/10,"This film is masterfully crafted at every level (directing, acting, cinematography, music, etc.). On the surface, it is a story of a Korean-American family in search of an American Dream. Yet, deep down, it is a quiet but relentless quest for the meaning of family, marriage, religion, and human aspirations. Ultimately, it is a profound reflection on human struggle. The result is a simple and unpretentious gem of a movie with unusual depth, warmth, and beauty. Please do not expect an emotion-packed family drama, an intense immigrant experience, or an arousing human victory. This film is very subtle and you should be prepared for it. All students and serious fans of cinematography should watch it."
MINARI,4 February 2021,9/10,"An entertaining and deeply engaging story. The pacing is great from the first scene until the credits. In terms of the Oscars, there's a strong possibility that this will sadly be overlooked/snubbed. If this did get it's deserved attention from the academy, I feel this would probably get nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography."
MINARI,2 March 2021,7/10,"Lee Isaac Chung's Minari depicts the tragedies of life and it's up and downs through this incredible story. Overall, the acting was absolutely amazing and the characters were original and relatable. The grandmother (Soonja) and David we're adorable to watch even as David struggled to understand his traditional Korean grandmother.The films depiction of the American dream was unique and my only complaint was that the movie felt slightly drawn out at some points, for example after the grandmother had a stroke. Other than that, the depictions of green grass plains showered in sunlight were beautiful and seemed to display the American dream and all its opportunity. What made this film so unique was its perception of the American dream, specifically Jacob's, of not being a great success but one that came with difficulties that broke this perception of the American dream that is had by many people who have immigrated to America. Often times our dreams can be met with great difficulties and in life we can be met with an onslaught of trouble and pain. Minari is a stunning story of pain and resilience and a family that ""learns to speak a language of its own"", as the director said. I would recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for a tender and beautiful film that reminds you of the strength a family has when united."
MINARI,19 March 2021,8/10,"Perfect movie to picture the phrase emotional rollercoaster. By the whole story I wasn't sure how to feel about specific characters. Actually I'm not sure even now, but i surely can say I'm glad i got to know their story."
MINARI,29 March 2021,8/10,"The movie is centered around the lives of Jacob Yi(parent), Monica Yi(parent), David Yi(child), Anne Yi(child) and Soon-Ja(grandmother), a korean family who just moved from California -after working there for over 10 year- to Arkansa to start anew. The father purchases some land to start a farm while the family tries to integrate into the new environment and sustain themselves. We think that this movie was for an audience of all ages, as it's able to tell the story of the American dream through each generation (The children, the parents, the grandmother). Each character has their struggles which can easily be interpreted by viewers to their own lives. We enjoyed this movie, as it had very good acting from the cast and everyone gave an impressive performance. The characters had depth and even though it ended weirdly it had its intense moments that kept it engaging. We think that this movie aims to tell 2 main themes, the first being that the ideal of the American dream is a struggle, which sometimes is forgotten about as urban areas do not really have that much exposure with the rural areas that are portrayed in the movie. The second theme aiming to tell is the story of Asian American immigrants going through the same experience of trying to build a farm from the ground up and support their children in America."
MINARI,15 March 2021,5/10,"I really wanted to like this movie. Until the very end. Maybe it's because I'm an immigrant myself, maybe because I appreciate the East Asian culture and its work integrity idealization, but wow, what a disappointment.Of course every immigrant, especially from Korea, will find similarities to their own story but this is exactly because the movie is so faceless and flat. Anything can fit.
It absolutely lacks any plot and can be told in 5 min.You see no financial struggle or hardship - the father gets the loan he needs, buys the equipment he needs and the only reason they have no water is because he was stingy and couldn't spend $250 for someone to dig a well for him (he had no issue paying $2000 for a tractor though...).
The kids and the wife wear nice clothes and they own a car. They eat well and can afford visiting a doctor.
In fact, the family of the boy who the kid gets befriended with seems, judging by the father figure, to struggle much more.You see no struggle to assimilate. One visit to the church that has no content and no continuation.absolutely no contact to any other folk of Arkansas besides the lunatic/exorcist friend who fought in Korea but it even this angle is not being developed...
What is it? Laziness? Time constraints? Budget?And why the kid has to be sick, how does it contribute to the plot? Is it a personal tribute to a personal story we don't understand?The little girl if completely forgotten. She doesn't even deserve a friend to spend some time with while the parents are away at the hospital and the boy is at his friend's... where did she go???I have no energy to talk about the struggle of the couple. It's simply embarrassing.And then the main question I have. What is this Minari??? Is it a herb they're going to sell after the other produce got burned? Is it something they're going to eat in order to survive?
Why the movie called Minari?Again. Wanted to enjoy the movie but had the awkward feeling of being ashamed for something I haven't done.
I was embarrassed for those actors and the audiences that'll praise the movie since, hey, after all, it won the Golden Globe...
Curtain!"
MINARI,5 July 2021,6/10,I wasn't sure what was the main theme of the movie. Was it a Korean family's struggle in the rural US or just the lives of blue collar workers and their entrepreneurial attempts or something else?
MINARI,28 October 2021,1/10,"That is a typical life of a typical family. Nothing intresting for us to see. A plotless movie, with nothing to teach is or excite us or keep us intrested. Until the last second I was wondering what the plot is. But then it ended. A typical marriage, a typical family, with its ups and downs. All filmed in storage rooms and trailers. Is this really what the oscars are about? A reality show?"
MINARI,28 February 2021,6/10,"Minari (""C"", which I equate here to 6/10 stars)Nice gutsy concept for portraying Asians moving to rural USA, after apparently immigrating from South Korea to the West coast a handful of years before. And the boy is cute. But otherwise, a thoroughly underwhelming movie and a ""D"" the rest of the way around. Just a thoroughly underwhelming film for way too many reasons. I personally don't think it deserves to win any major awards at the Oscars.SPOILERS AHEADBasically, I felt very little for any of the characters. The wife seems spoiled, the husband seems self-absorbed in his mission, the kids are also fairly spoiled, the grandma is a pushover.The characters are all a bit sedated, aside from a slightly fiery argument between mother and father.Some of the scenes are useless -- i.e. the scene where Will Patton's character is carrying the cross, or the scene where David is staying at his friend's house.I don't know any Asian family that would leave their stroke-stricken grandma at home alone by herself, in order to take a multi-hour road trip to the hospital.The conflict between the wife and husband at the end of the movie is a bit overdramatic, in the sense that both characters have little ability to empathize with the other.I'm Asian-American, born and raised in the midwest USA (1977), and although I'm not Korean, I felt very little emotional commitment to the film's characters. (I imagine that Koreans may feel a bit more sentimental about the movie.) Somehow it's two hours of my life that I wish I could take back."
MINARI,14 February 2021,,"This movie was a general let down.
It wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly wasn't a great movie. I found it to drag on and on.
The acting was fine but there just wasn't much of a story. Very slow progression to really result in not much at all throughout the movie.At the end, like, sure something happened but it just felt cheap and unrelated to the character progression we had seen.
I am not with the other reviewers who have rated it 9 or 10, but I'm not going to try to claim this movie was a 1, 2 or 3.
In summary it's a very average film that I just didn't find interesting. Probably wouldn't recommend it."
MINARI,30 August 2021,7/10,"I found ""Minari"" to be a beautiful and touching film about a family who try to settle from Korea to the rural US. Despite its tragic theme, the story is surprisingly lighthearted and entertaining -- partly because it is mostly told through the eyes of the young son (who may be thought of as the director's alter ego)."
MINARI,26 October 2021,9/10,"What a great movie about a Korean family coming to the USA! I enjoyed the performance of the Grandma, she was fantastic, and I can see why she won an Oscar for her role!"
MINARI,30 March 2021,,"Acting is brilliant but the text and scenario is missing and characters are unbalanced. None of these needs to be perfect if it's a personal story which as I understand, Minari is which begs the question, why this cinematography?You can't shoot a personal, intimate story with this kind of an impersonal cinematography. The space was wasted.I was waiting for this film, disappointed."
MINARI,16 May 2021,9/10,"This is a fantastic movie, which grip viewers with great story telling and strong emotion. The story is beautiful pictures and show strong emotional connect between relationships. Beautiful Movie - Must watch!!"
MINARI,5 January 2021,8/10,"Minari is such a heartwarming story. The cast is great, especially Youn Yuh-jung who steals every scene she's in. The cool, funny and smart grandmother I've always wanted to have.
I hope her performance would be recognized by the Academy because she is brilliant!"
MINARI,7 May 2021,1/10,So slow and boring. Don't let the high rating fools you this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
MINARI,27 March 2021,7/10,"The movie was OK on average, but I just don't think it deserves an Oscar. There was some impressive acting, especially grandma and the little boy. However, I think that the plot was so ordinary and drama was not that convincing for me because of the way that it treats the subject."
MINARI,2 December 2021,7/10,"I think this script has three perspectives.(A) Stories of immigration hardships.(B) Christian / Western perspectives.(C) Confucian /Oriental perspectives.The script, which is a mixture of (A)(B)(C) perspectives, ends in ""Family unity"".Awesome elaborate script!!This wonderful simple script have also metaphors and symbols which not easy to understand.I suppose some cinephiles will challenge analyze this film desperately.I guess one of the reason why I couldn't be moved by this film is I am the one of them.I tried to analyze this film and exhausted so I couldn't concentrate on the main story.In the end, I felt this script is a bit too artificial."
MINARI,16 March 2021,8/10,"Not a movie that can be appreciated from everyone. If you like action, complicated plot and movies full of events stay away from here, this is not a movie for you. But if you want to go deeper, to learn about different cultures, if you're able appreciate the little things and details and the beautiful picture this movie has then welcome, you'll enjoy it. It's a movie for your soul."
MINARI,15 April 2021,8/10,"Asian films are another thing. I liked the way the topic was discussed in relation to immigrants from Korea in the US. Good performances, mainly from father(Steven Yeun) and grandmother(Yoon Yeo-jeong). The ending leaves everything open for a second film !? I would love it !!!"
MINARI,24 May 2021,1/10,"Incomplete story, didn't liked the ending.A

A."
MINARI,19 July 2021,8/10,"It's amazing how many characters have been shown and developed in the movie. We can observe how relationships between the wife and husband are changing while are trying to settle down in the USA, how a boy is getting used to the grandmother who is coming from a country he has never been to, how a sister is caring about her brother. It's not a typical movie about the migration, the family is not complaining about their hard life in new country and they are not afraid of difficulties - they are trying to find their place there and everyone is doing it in their own way."
MINARI,29 August 2021,8/10,"Many people who have reviewed this movie have already mentioned the ending, and I do not disagree with what they are saying. The movie doesn't concluded and they left some loose ends regarding the state of the family.Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie. I think the actors did really well and as I mentioned on my review for ""Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure,"" I gravitate towards stories about the American Dream. The tone and pacing was definitely different than most movies nowadays, but I think it helped the movie. P. S. I really hope the grandmother gets better if they do a sequel. :'("
MINARI,17 April 2021,7/10,"It was a really good movie, talking about the struggles of immigrants in the US trying to make a life for themselves. But, what was with that sudden ending?I get the point that they came together as a family after the fire, but they could have given us a little taste of what happens next."
MINARI,12 May 2021,3/10,Highly overrated. Complete waste of time. Story doesn't go anywhere at all.
MINARI,6 February 2021,7/10,"So I watched the film with my family (all Korean immigrants) and we empathized and laughed about some of the things portrayed of the protagonist and his family's life. I personally thought it fell a bit short on the acting and the plot, but nonetheless a good feel-good movie. However, one thing I can't help but feel are its parallels to Hillbilly Elegy which came out in Fall to initially just horrid reviews by critics alike in spite of the actual reviews from the audience, much of whom were moved by, and highly praised the film and its performers, that is, without forcing politics into the equation. I'm beginning to wish critics and audience members alike would resist the urge to side with everything that would make them seem more ""woke"" and quit deriving unfounded hypotheses about some political statements that aren't inherent in a film."
MINARI,7 May 2021,9/10,"In telling a story based loosely on his own childhood memories, Lee Isaac Chung has wrought a film that carries on a conversation throughout between the plight of a Korean family seeking security of a variety of sorts and a foreign culture that both supports and challenges them. If you watch the film without being aware of the conversation, you may find the story uninspiring and the ending disappointing.The message Chung conveys by the end of the movie is quite straightforward: no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. Sometimes, hope comes in the form of a surprising medical diagnosis; and sometimes, it comes through a bunch of seeds that, having been planted, seem to take care of themselves until their produce is needed.Let the story unfold; and pay attention to the Anglo characters and their interactions with the Korean protagonists. Their relationships are not incidental to the story Chung so richly offers us, even as brief as a number of them might be."
MINARI,14 March 2021,1/10,With no point to the ending. I had to suffer through two hours of reading subtitles to figure that out
MINARI,22 March 2021,9/10,"This was the first film I watched in a movie theater since last March and it was a good choice. Layered and rich, it is a truly universal story told with restraint and a balanced hand. Full shout out to both the child actors in the film, especially Alan Kim, the weight of the film hung on him and he delivered.
Yes, it is slowly paced but life itself is slowly paced and the story moves along enough to break your heart at just the right time. The strength and magic of familial love is hard enough to express in real life and this is a love letter to all the families that deal with that struggle. Hang in there the payoff is more than worth it."
MINARI,14 April 2021,5/10,"I went in expecting some drama or thought provoking scenes but there really isn't any.It is really just plain and.. slow. Story line is draggy and don't seem to go anywhere. When it finally did, it ended rather abruptly, I hope there isn't going to be a part 2 because this ain't the type of movies for that.What's good however is the cinematography.The little boy turned out to be the entire movie's scene stealer ironically."
MINARI,4 May 2021,10/10,"I can't understand the bad and average views. This movie was perfection, from the acting to the directing to the natural flowing narrative. Honestly probably my favourite movie from this year and would have loved for it to get best picture. It was perfect from beginning to end; and the ending could not have gone better. As a family trying to start over after their misgivings and mistakes, I honestly cant see how better this could have ended. Just Bliss a24 you've done it again."
MINARI,24 March 2021,8/10,The visuals and score are beautiful. It's relatable for families who have moved to a foreign country and is authentic in showing the dynamics and struggles of those who do. It's a simple story that is told in a subtle but beautiful way. I like that the film manages to show viewers each family members' perspectives subtly. Steven Yeun might just have a connection to sheds that burn.
MINARI,25 April 2021,5/10,"Growing up in the eyes of a Korean-American, I enjoyed this show. However, with my American lenses, it was just average. How does this film even get a nomination from the Oscars? Only reason is diversity and not quality of any film. They are cheapening the awards!True equal opportunity is not discriminating a person or film from getting to the top. BUT....it should be true quality and not affirmative action to have the best man win!"
MINARI,26 February 2021,9/10,What a moving Film loved every aspect of it ! I truly laughed out my life ! It wins the Best picture at the oscars
MINARI,21 July 2021,9/10,"Here is a movie that we all need to watch ,
And its not just about a family or koreans its about tragical challenges of life and the sad part : we could be any of this people."
MINARI,15 May 2021,9/10,I liked the simplicity of the story which makes its different from other script.
MINARI,25 May 2021,9/10,"Lee Isaac Chug's Minari introduces us perfectly into the life of a Korean family in 1980s Arkansas. The development of the characters throughout the film as well as the subtle humour placed throughout, makes the familial issues seem all the more impactful. On top of this, Chung's directing is sublime, allowing viewers to take in every inch of the Arkansas environment. Minari builds on the idea of the American Dream and the struggle for the many Asian Americans faced as they immigrated to the United States. It manages to touch on the struggle to live a simple life and how difficult it can be to reach financial and emotional satisfaction.Reading about Minari, it would be assumed that an Asian family in a place like Arkansas in the 1980s would face systemic issues. However, the film only touches slightly on racism, even to the point where it is portrayed to the audience as a very minor problem (the least of their worries). I think Chung's choice to remain solely focused on the familial struggles is clever and unique.I believe the ending of the film is satisfying, contrary to popular belief. Yes, there are open-ends, but I believe Chung's decision to leave the film somewhat ambiguous, poses an everlasting question to the viewer about how immigrants made a living."
MINARI,2 January 2021,8/10,"The kid didn't have to dream of going to heaven, because the grandmom was an angel and the place where the angel was in heaven.
The actress who played the grandmother's role was really good."
MINARI,3 March 2021,9/10,This movie deserves a lot more attention than what it has received so far. Sou heartwarming and engaging story. It had me in tears and laughing throughout.
MINARI,4 April 2021,6/10,I don't understand why Steven Youn was nominated for his acting in this movie. The kids and grandma are the ones who really filled the screen.
MINARI,4 April 2021,1/10,I think the screenplay and plot are bad and dont make any interesting scenes for audience.this film is so boring also.
MINARI,8 April 2021,6/10,"The Minari movie is about a Korean family migrated to US. The family's father buys a farm to raise Korean food but the mother doesn't like this idea because she wants to live in city centre due to her son's health conditions. After some time, Grandmother comes to the farm but little David(little son) doesn't like her because she couldn't correspond his expectations. The typical grand mother in David's mind is an American grandmother who is baking cookies and takes care of her grandchildren(this part implies the assimilation). Grandmother plants a plant called Minari far away from the farm. At the end of the movie because of an accident caused by grandmother, the whole plants burned except from Minaris.It was a little bit slow for me and I was little bit bored. However, I learned that there are a lot of implications in the movie that I couldn't recognize while I was watching. I have to add that I was surprised so much times and I couldn't foresee what will happen. It was beyond my expectations. So, I can recommend this movie to see a new approach and to enhance your consciousness about family and assimilation."
MINARI,27 April 2021,9/10,A film worth watching. Heartfelt immigrant story. Loved this!
MINARI,17 May 2021,9/10,All the emotional scenes we could relate and much more to know in real life through this movie main core. And definitely the direction and casting are really appropriated.
MINARI,18 June 2021,7/10,"Minari is a really well depicted story of a new immigrant settling in rural part of United States, and the family struggle can even relate to people with different culture upbringings or education background as everyone encounter those personal struggles at some point of life. The later half was way more dramatic and entertaining than first half and I really hope the big events can be shifted earlier so we get to see more of the main characters interaction and feelings towards each other after that. Ms. Youn outshines everyone in this film and is most essential part of getting this film the acclaim it deserves, but overall this is a very well written story(only if the dramatically parts be hinted more or shifted earlier then it would be more entertaining and less slow-tempo and keep audience interested)."
MINARI,6 July 2021,1/10,"I kept thinking ""give it 30 more minutes, maybe something will happen and it will get better."" Nope. I picked it out at the Redbox for movie night based on the reviews and my family told me I lost movie picking privileges after renting this dud. The grandma is the best character but she's not enough to make it entertaining."
MINARI,3 May 2021,6/10,"The characters in Minari are well defined and all the actors deliver solid performances.All they need is a decent story.There are a few points of possible interest (a strained marriage, a smattering of religion, one or two underdeveloped friendships and the relationship between grandma and grandson) but they're really all sub-plots - not enough to hold the interest of the audience."
MINARI,27 June 2021,5/10,"With all the acclaim and awards I had high hopes going in but was completely underwhelmed. I was hoping for a Growth of the Soil type epic feel goodfest.but was disappointed at every turn. The only ""message"" I took away was 'Women are impossible to please."" which is awful, I know.. If you make the mistake of watching this movie, tell if you get anything different..."
MINARI,23 August 2021,8/10,A slow burn movie about life. Just the way I like it.
MINARI,31 March 2021,8/10,"I found this movie to be beautifully done...until the ending, which to me was lazy after the detailed nuances of this family's life.You truly felt their despair, and the complexity of being an immigrant family just trying to fit in, and still be themselves.Great character development, superb acting (especially by Granny and the male lead), a story that quietly draws you in with the reality and pain of day to day life.Tension was apparent, drama was rising and noticeable, but an unsatisfying finish for a family I was rooting for, in many different ways.I'm glad to see a movie like this made, and do recommend it. I just wish the ending had been more fleshed out to match the tone and storyline of the entire movie."
MINARI,10 April 2021,5/10,"The movie tone is warm, cute and so so. But the end very sad and nothing."
MINARI,24 May 2021,9/10,"Minari is a delightful film about a Korean family moving to Arkansas to start a farm. The characters are the standout of this film with amazing performances from Steven Yeun, Alan S. Kim and Yuh-Jung Youn in particular.As the film goes on the family encounter many different problems from the wife not sharing the husbands dream of living on a farm, all the way to racism and the children not fitting in at church. Even though a lot of the film is serious, there are also many funny scenes often between Alan S. Kim's character and the Grandma played by Yuh-Jung Youn.As well as the slow, but captivating story, the film also looks great showing off the beautiful American countryside that this family has moved into."
MINARI,2 June 2021,10/10,"Endearing characters, gorgeous cinematography, and a strong script make Minari a nearly perfect film!"
MINARI,27 February 2021,9/10,"Loved basically everything about this film: cast, story, music, and cinematography were stellar, just absolutely top notch. We ventured out to our local theater solely to see this movie, and so happy we did: tears, suspense, tons of heart, near-and-far culture, along with a healthy dose of laugh-out-loud moments. Oscar material for sure, or there's no justice in this world. (Brad Pitt involved as producer which only makes me think even more highly of his work and ability.)"
MINARI,9 April 2021,1/10,Michael Scott once said : I don't hate it ; I just don't like it at all .
MINARI,30 August 2021,7/10,"Its interesting to me how jacob behave upon conflicts with his wife, it shows how a good man behave like.A few subtle scene of how jacob teach his kid, treat his wife,The family resilience in my opinion rely o jacob as a father."
MINARI,28 March 2021,10/10,"Minari, directed by Lee Isaac Chung- a film that reflects his own story set in the rural backdrop of Arkansas. Needless to say, it is one of the best films I've watched in long which speaks about the very essence of what it's like to be around people that will never betray you regardless of circumstances that changes, of how hope never gets 'cancelled', to keep the faith and a gentle reminder that you got to live life one step at a time.It is truly heart-warming and its rather a story with many elements that can be found relatable universally. How a once considered catalyst (David's grandmother) was in fact a blessing in disguise is absolutely brilliant to notice. But she changes the dynamic of the house when she join forces with her grandkids.'The American Dream' and a phase where many immigrants were recruited all over the world to take up jobs that others scorned has also been spoken about through this film. Also, brilliant and strong acting by each and everyone in the film- Steven Yeun, Han Ye-Ri, Youn Yuh-Jung, Alan Kim, Noel Cho, Will Patton etc.In short, a beautiful screenplay and vision of the director and a heart- touching soundtrack which conveys every emotions that cannot be expressed in words. A must watch film, hands down. Really looking forward to seeing more from the person I cherish to call an inspiration- Lee Isaac Chung."
MINARI,23 May 2021,1/10,"We struggled through 2 hrs of this movie waiting to see what all the hype was about. Sadly, we didn't manage to find it. The movie ending was like an unfinished sentence. We need to watch a real movie to get our minds back to normal."
MINARI,9 September 2021,6/10,"Too many loose ends at the end. Did the farmer and his wife stay together, did they sell the minari plant etc. I loved the acting but the grandmother was a stretch. The wife was too negative so she gets an A for acting if that was her portrayal objective."
MINARI,20 February 2021,3/10,Overrated worn out film not transcendental like a Bergman or Kurosawa not street and plot full like Scorsese. Utter boring if you want to spend 2 hours of an annoying child and a childish grandma be my guest. Cinema is ruined due to political correctness most reviews are from woke folks that think anything foreign is the next big thing. Hell I even enjoyed Parasite to the max and many Korean films but this one is just plain the plot lacked the depth the meaning is too direct no place for the viewer to think or ask everything is shown to us the only positive is a scene where the father is smoking in the farm I liked the shot other than that the whole film is just beyond mediocre and I would not be surprised if this gets awards due to political correctness that has ruined real cinema of yesteryear.
MINARI,5 February 2021,7/10,"Personally, the plot is too simple, not entertaining enough. cinematically, the visual content, have wonderful shots, with an awesome use of the natural light, and an awesome use of the colors in shot.now, talking bout the plot of the movie, i think that David and his grandma carry the movie to a higher hierarchy at the next probably nominations on best picture oscars 2021.whatever, korean cinema is taking a very important protagonism in this world."
MINARI,23 May 2021,9/10,"Minari is such a beautiful, heart warming story of a family trying to realise the ""American Dream"".It starts off with a family of four, a couple and their two kids. Alan Kim as David is this cute little boy who is trying to make sense of what is happening around him, while trying to have his own fun. Noel Cho as Anne, David's sister, is the responsible sister trying to take care of her younger brother. Anne's character is a bit limited. Talking of the couple, Steven Yeun as Jacob, is trying to build his farm in the middle of nowhere and that comes at a cost of his family. While his intentions are good and noble, he doesn't know when he has crossed a line and due to which his family has to suffer. Yeri Han as Monica, David's wife, is at the burnt of her husband's actions.Yuh-Jung Youn as Soonja, or ""Grandma"", is Monica's mom, who comes to stay with the family to help them out with the kids. Her atypical grandma-grandchild relationship with David is a joy to watch. The relationship progresses throughout the story. Will Patton as Paul, the worker on the farm, has given a powerful performance which normally goes unnoticed.Minari is in fact the perfect movie for the times we live in. At the very end, the movie closes with a subtle message. Things might not happen as you might have planned, but perhaps you will find more meaning and happiness in things that you haven't given due attention and still have worked out by themselves. The message can mean different things to different people and that is why I feel this is a movie for the masses."
MINARI,25 April 2021,4/10,Just boring. A lot of random information together. No profound story.
MINARI,8 February 2021,8/10,Everyone of them does their job so properly..From the start to the end perfect 95 minutes spends with the dramatic change of their lives..
MINARI,7 June 2021,9/10,This movie reflects a cruel hard world a migrant may face. It's so truthful..
MINARI,14 October 2020,10/10,"Minari is an absolute must-see. Charming, beautiful, and moving."
MINARI,5 May 2021,9/10,"I watched Minari because of Youn Yuh-Jung's multiple awards for the role of Grandma Soonja. The acknowledgement of her acting skills overseas (as the K-dramas refer to countries outside of South Korea) is a tremendous accomplishment for a senior citizen veteran actor. Lee Isaac Chung was shortsighted in listing Youn in the credits as ""With Youn Yuh-Jung"". She was given second-to-last billing in the opening credits. She should have received third billing, because of her status in Korean entertainment industry and her contributions to the plot.Minari is a run of the mill Korean movie set overseas. David and Grandma become the focal point in the story. It is a story of a family embarking on a new life in the Midwest, and experiencing the culture shock and struggles of surviving in a new environment.The reunion of Soonja and Monica triggered a memory of my deceased Mom, and I broke down and cried. I cannot remember watching any movie that brought out that emotion or reaction.Spoiler: Soonja had a stroke. Unfortunately, the family left her alone on the farm, and went on a road trip. Soonja decided to burn some garbage, that resulted in a fire. Monica was shortsighted in thinking that her 72-ish mother was capable of looking after herself, some days after her stroke. The parents should have left the daughter at home, to keep an eye on the grandma.Youn Yuh-Jung's acting as the stroke victim was very realistic. I can understand why her acting performance appealed to western audiences, and earned many accolades. Fortunately, the movie ended abruptly, without a death in the family, because I would have broken down and cried for hours."
MINARI,11 January 2021,7/10,"Visually stunning, the performances are good, but the emotional scenes did not resonate with me as much as i thought it would. a simple story about family and faith, in oneself and others. the kid was really good. dialogue was nice but they shouldve dragged out the emotional scenes. i guess that would be my only issue with the movie. emotional but not really.its nice, not great but not bad"
MINARI,14 May 2021,8/10,Actually I love it . The characters are played well . I like the story line because how the relationship between the family is established.I like the character of David and soonja.
MINARI,14 March 2021,3/10,Perhaps this film will be successful due to the political argument inserted in it. But the script is flawed and manipulates with clichés
MINARI,5 March 2021,8/10,"It's a great movie to watch. It sets a comfortable mood, maybe because the setting is in the country or something more deeper?I think what made it so comfortable is that it affects all of us. How we dream big for our family, how we cling and depend to them everytime but most importantly how money takes a huge impact on the relationship and sometimes make the family pushed at almost in the brink of collapse"
MINARI,5 August 2021,1/10,"Shot beautifully and decent performances, but this movie glorifies bad luck and sorrow as if they are the only things we should expect in life. The wife and husband are the most flat, moronic characters I've seen in a long time. They probably deserve their own predicaments, but the consequences felt too accidental. I refuse to explain myself, otherwise I'll have to spoil the movie, which I don't want to do to convince you to forget about this totally forgetful film. Go watch Parasite. Much better and powerful."
MINARI,9 March 2021,6/10,The movie is shot well and the score is quite pleasant. The acting is pretty good but the story is meh. Theres no conclusions to anything. There is telling an open ended story and leaving the audience hanging and this will leave you hanging. Theres constant back and forth between the husband and wife that I guess gets worked out but you'll never find out how. They are so poor they can't afford water but can afford to pay water stick man at the end. Its a rather dry script and quite over-rated. I'm a massive fan of asian films and this was just meh.
MINARI,29 March 2021,9/10,"I don't see Korean movies. I saw Parasite last year and it was great. Then I found it-Minari.Though I don't know why this is the title of the movie but I enjoyed it very very much. Slow paced but quite enjoyable. The acting was superb, even the younger one was great. I highly recommended this movie."
MINARI,13 May 2021,7/10,"Having seen this movie, I decided to write my first review. I felt compelled to share my emotions after finishing it. So there it goes.The pace of the movie starts slow but gains momentum as the family is facing multiple challenges in their new lives. It is quite fascinating to see what a family can go through as someone who did not had the same struggles. The script is very realistic and has a great cinematography. Not to mention the acting. The characters are so well played that you cannot get bored during any part of the film. The story kept my attention throughout the movie and I couldn't tell the time.As it is being criticized, the story has a loose end. That's the only reason I could not rate it an 8. However, I still enjoyed the movie very much and I think it was beautiful. It is full of emotions and the story is very touching. In the end the kid reminds the family and us of the good part of life in all its hardships..."
MINARI,31 March 2021,2/10,"I found this movie so slow moving. Nothing happens, not an interesting plot and not much of an ending. Overall, pretty boring. I read other reviews and I'm shocked that people claim to really like this movie."
MINARI,12 April 2021,1/10,"I'm from Thailand, and too moving to another country in mid 80s to start a new life, so I thought I could relate somewhat to this film and excited to watch it. 10 minutes into the movie expecting something to happen, 20 minutes past, still waiting, 30 minutes, 40 minutes past, still nothing much happens. I'm really, really bored at this point and can no longer sit through it, didn't bother to find out what happens at the end. What an uninspiring film. What with the high score ratings?"
MINARI,21 April 2021,9/10,Deep stuff. Good film that everybody should watch. God bless the USA!
MINARI,25 April 2021,2/10,The storyline is overly sad and anyone with an average critical point of view would not think that this movie would compete for best picture. Move on to other options.
MINARI,9 May 2021,3/10,The tempo is horribly slow from the beginning hinting lack of storyline. The movie is straight out from old Asian B/W film which keeps kicking the unfortunate in the groin when they're down. I really don't see any exciting acting in the cast nor any depth. I suggest spending 1hr45 doing something more entertaining instead.
MINARI,14 May 2021,10/10,"I created an IMDB account just to have a chance to write a review and share how much I loved that movie. It was beyond beautiful, I loved everything about it. Apparently this is isn't the case for everybody, which is fair. But definitely give it a try. This is hands down one of my favourite movies of all time."
MINARI,18 May 2021,10/10,A family drama on reel looking so much real..A wonderful feeling while watching this movie.
MINARI,18 May 2021,9/10,"This movie is incredibly directed and and the emotions people have expressed that is spectacularIn some parts it actually touches the heart , and make people thing , that this all happened in the daily lives of peopleExcellent movie."
MINARI,24 May 2021,6/10,"Hello from India, we liked this family drama which reminds us how our grand parents also struggled to make our life better..good old times."
MINARI,2 June 2021,5/10,"There are many great korean movies like ""Parasite"", ""Old boy"", ""A taxi driver"", ""I saw the devil"", ""The man from nowhere"" to name a few. Minari is not even close to that level. The acting is ok but that's about it. The story is boring with one of the worst ending in cinema. You can't even call it good cinema as it's not entertaining, doesn't grip you, it's simply uninspiring. What's next ? The american plumber who came to Russia and couldn't fix the leaks? Don't fall for the awards and reviews as i did.If you want to watch a good 2020 movie about a couple facing actual challenges that is inspiring, entertaining and based on real events watch ""Soorarai Pottru""."
MINARI,14 June 2021,,They erroneously used a mahindra tractor that looked well used in the 80's mahindra started making tractors 🚜 in 1983 and started importing to the US in1994.
MINARI,29 July 2021,1/10,"A very stupid and silly movie
A story without a story, just a waste of time
The photography is good and the acting is good as well , but i don't think it deserve all the buzz around it."
MINARI,28 February 2021,1/10,I'm a korean American. This was one of the worst slow paced I've ever seen in my life. Not worth watching at all
MINARI,21 November 2021,5/10,"If you are expecting a conclusion to the story, don't waste your time watching this movie. Good character building and actors, especially the children."
MINARI,2 February 2021,9/10,"Immigrants can relate to this movie on a deeper level. To leave your homeland and come to a foreign country, not knowing the language, and perhaps starting all over again, trying to preserve your culture while adapting to the new one... It's every immigrant struggle. Steven Yeun's acting was phenomenal. The entire ensemble cast was tugging at my heart strings the entire time. Each one has their own perspective in their own challenges they had to grapple with. Very well done film. Don't be discouraged by the subtitles because you will deprive yourself of your fantastic film."
MINARI,8 March 2021,10/10,Fantastic movie. Incredible cast dynamic. I love the beauty and how it's tells a truly American tale.
MINARI,13 March 2021,9/10,Makes you appreciate your family just a bit more. A true American story. From laughter to tears and everything in between. Very moving and sweet.
MINARI,30 March 2021,,"This is the first review I'm ever writing, so please bear with me. The story is very fascinating. The plot in itself is very simple, it's just the story of a Korean family that moves to some rural area in the us to start a farm. There's the parents, two children and the grandma. It was very interesting to get an insight on the Korean culture and it gives a very interesting overlook in the clash against the American cultures which the children have started to adopt as their own. The cinematography is very fascinating and makes the viewer feel like he's a part of the family. There are very happy moments and not so happy ones, but in the struggles and joyous moments the family gets through, you will be glued to the screen."
MINARI,20 June 2021,8/10,"The movie itself was outstanding.We found the subtitles to be frustrating though. The video provided English subtitles, but only for English dialogue, which does not help much unless you are hearing impaired.There were no English subtitles for the Korean dialogue. So, about 40% of the movie dialogue was unintelligible to me."
MINARI,5 May 2021,9/10,Minari is a wonderful movie. A true reflection of what families can go through with minimum resources.
MINARI,29 March 2021,10/10,"Lee Isaac Chung floored me with this intimate, commanding, almost Shakespearean story. His service and dedication to all his characters' storylines was masterful, woven with love and levity. This movie will steal your heart if you let it. So, what are you waiting for?"
MINARI,30 April 2021,7/10,"I liked the movie. It made me happy with them, and sad when they were sad as well. The ""weed"", Minari, thrives only at it's second season, under any kind of failed soil. Its an interesting analogy of migration and the second chance the family got after the fire."
MINARI,11 May 2021,1/10,"It's Overhyped to the moon. Just like their Dishes most of thr movies got no Spice, no taste just a bland mess.There's no story ,no script just a korean 🇰🇷Guy with his Family trying to build a Farm in USA 🇺🇸 .you watched it like something interesting is about to happen but no. It drags for 2 hrs and in the end the wife is going away for a better life. But the husband insisted on Staying and stupid Grandma burns🔥 the entire farm while burning Garbage . 🗑that's it 😜 and this is the movie nominated for Oscars🤣😂👍🏻"
MINARI,27 February 2021,8/10,"Great performances by all actors, especially by the little boy. Very realistic and moving."
MINARI,16 March 2021,9/10,"I feel like a lot of films are for fun, entertainment, and bliss. Then there are movies in a special category that touch the soul. Minari does just that. The first act of the film makes you curious as to why things are happening the way they are. However, the 2nd and 3rd make you realize the importance of the first. I think that ties in with the message of the story.There are scenes in this film that portray small moments that make the characters the way they are. Scenes where callbacks make you feel a surge of emotion. Minari takes less is more to a new level with very few locations. Our lead protagonist Jacob (Steven Yeun) is obsessed with making his farm successful as well. Towards the end of the film something happens that leads to the biggest theme of the film to me. Acceptance.The movie is a drama but truly adds a new lens to life. Many people have suffered tragedy and loss in the past year. I think its important that people watch this and see the themes at hand. That beyond all trauma, pain, and suffering its makes you realize why it was all important in the first place. I highly recommend anyone who reads this watch it you wont regret it."
MINARI,27 March 2021,1/10,"Boring, normal story and not useful at all.I wonder why it has 6 Oscar nominations!!How come guys!!"
MINARI,28 March 2021,9/10,"This movie touched me...I can't really put my finger on why it did, but the acting from Yeri Han, Steven Yeun and Yuh-jung Youn is absolutely increadible.And to not mention the cinematography would be a sin, Lachlan Milne makes every single scene noticable.And the music... the music!Emile Mosseri is just absolutely wonderful..."
MINARI,29 May 2021,10/10,"I love when I can get entrenched in a movie. But most movies don't have all the elements that it takes for that to happen: a unique storyline, a main cast where every character is essential and every actor carries a big load. Check and check! Also appealing was there was no bells and whistles to distract and detract from the story. Loved this movie! Been a Steven Yeun fan since ""Walking Dead"". He was great. Alan S. Kim deserved an Oscar consideration too!"
MINARI,27 February 2021,9/10,"It's surprisingly good. Actually, not just good... It was great. Great if you appreciate a minor amount of patience to gather insight on the characters' relationships with each other (small equalling 15-20 minutes at most - not in a dull, ""how much longer"" type of way). It had some laughs and had some single tear drops here and there but overall - heart felt for Koreans, whites, southerners, etc. = A film for all hearts (no pun intended).Its a meaningful story that helps you realize what's truly important to you - even if you didn't know it at the time."
MINARI,31 March 2020,9/10,"Most films that score high on my personal rating system include a moment where I'm compelled to pay attention. A moment where I say, ""I'm in, let's go"". One of the first scenes in Minari is of Jacob telling his young son that a man needs to find his place in the world where he can be useful. This is said as they watch the ashes of young roosters rising from an incinerator at a chicken farm. ""I'm in.""Minari told a story I hadn't heard before. This is likely because it was written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, whose own life was loosely portrayed in David- the young boy who watched the chickens burn with his dad. It's a story about a young Korean family who moves to Arkansas to start over. After a bumpy start, Grandma moves in. I won't say anything more about the plot, as not to spoil its uniqueness. More than most films about the American immigrant experience, this story is not just about the resilience of the immigrant, but the resilience of family. This is shown through its titular image, the Korean herb minari, an herb that is distinctly Korean and is able to thrive wherever it is planted.It's an immigrant story through and through. I was excited to see that the film was done mostly in Korean, with only maybe 25% in English, further challenging western audiences to explore non-English films. The score, composed by Emile Mosseri (the same guy who composed the heartbreaking score for The Last Black Man in San Fransisco) captured this same theme with skill. The score was incredibly stylized, featuring an unmistakably western and eastern blend of musicality that I had never heard before. The music in Minari was a feature in itself, adding its own feeling to the story that could not be expressed in a screenplay alone. The screenplay, by the way, was a masterpiece that worked seamlessly with the score.Perhaps my favorite part of the film was that I had no idea where it was going, and that's a good thing. I was able to pick up on key themes of the story, but not once did I find myself waiting for the next checkpoint of a cookie cutter narrative. Nor did I feel lost at any point. Rather, Chung had early on in the film earned my trust as a story teller.Of all of the performances in the film, the standout was Yuh-Jung Youn who played Soonja the Grandmother. This is certainly the kind of performance I would anticipate being nominated for an Oscar. Hopefully we won't see another snub like we saw with Shuzhen Zhao last year in The Farewell. What made her performance so memorable was that most of her screen time was opposite seven-year-old Alan Kim. Kim was another of the brightest spots in the film. When the movie opened on Kim in the back seat of the car, the audience response was immediate affection. Kim was a natural. Stephen Yeun and Yeri Han also gave outstanding performances, making this one of the strongest cast ensembles I've seen in a very long time.I hope Minari goes on to receive the critical attention it deserves, after winning the two biggest awards at Sundance. I'll be campaigning for it all the way up to award season next year."
MINARI,19 April 2021,1/10,No. Horrible. Awful. Terrible. Could have been great. Great opportunities for a fantastic story. I suspect the great writers that started writing the screenplay all passed away halfway through and t no one even tried to finish the story. I hung in there expecting them to tie it together. But no. The writers just drop you off on the middle of a field work nothing but bad bad events with no closure at all. Totally a waste of time.
