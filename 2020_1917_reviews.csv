1917,10 April 2020,9/10,"I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched ""1917"" because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned."
1917,13 April 2021,10/10,"There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, 'Spectre' is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman's score for 'Road to Perdition' is a favourite.'1917' was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019's year's best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for '1917' is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).First and foremost, '1917' is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins' cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. '1917' benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.Overall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10."
1917,28 December 2020,6/10,"Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes."
1917,13 March 2020,8/10,"Lance Corporals Blake and Schofield are given an urgent message by General Erinmore to deliver to a cut-off unit to stop a planned attack. They travel across abandoned German positions and across German lines facing many dangers.This is directed by Sam Mendes with cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. It's a faux continuous shot. It's masterfully filmed. The tension is more limited until the action starts. It tries to raise the emotional content after the plane crash. It would work better if Blake starts as the main character. It could have been a great shock. That's what this movie lacks. It doesn't have the bite of great twists and turns other than the great resolution. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally filmed war action movie and that it is worth every penny."
1917,5 August 2020,10/10,"Shades of Apocalypse Now. This film is a flawless integration of music, tension, cinematography, and an allegorical story. There are physical and intellectual labyrinths that this poor soldier must meander through. The two men are the usual cannon fodder used to manage a nearly hopeless task. When one is lost, the other cannot hold back. There are many close calls which teach us that at times one must chuck aside fear and endure. The trenches of World War I were like mazes, with death running through them. I have a hard time with war movies. I think this film will be remembered as we move forward in time."
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me."
1917,22 January 2020,6/10,"""1917"" is a new movie, an American/British co-production from 2019, that was directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and he is also one of the two writers in charge of the script here, which is definitely not usual at all because this is his very first writing credit and this really makes me say: ""Why oh why Sam did you not start penning film scripts earlier?"" The outcome is really good and after seeing it, I am not too surprised that it is one of the big players this awards season and really took ceremonies by storm lately the way it won Best Drama at the Golden Globes, in what was definitely considered an upset. And won the PGA Award not much later. So you can probably say that this is the film to beat at the Oscars, even if Tarantino is also still in a good spot and I must say even if I liked this film here, I like Tarantino's work still a bit more. I still think it is better than Scorsese's newest as well as the overrated Parasite. But we talked about that one on another occasion.Now let me say a bit about these almost two hours we have here. The number in the title is of course a reference to the year 1917, during which World War I was still taking place, so this is a war movie from beginning to end and that makes it even more surprising that I really liked it you can say because this is perhaps my least favorite genre. So if you enjoy war-themed movies you will like this one even more. Then again, seeing all the horror, it is probably more of an anti-war film than a war movie by definition, just like Apocalypse Now for example. The cast includes some big names, but at the center of it all there are two young actors in the first half, and one of them in the second half and both are no big names. So a similar approach to Nolan's (overrated) Dunkirk, but even there the famous actors (like Hardy) had more screen time. The somewhat big names here are Firth (early on) and Cumberbatch (at the end) and maybe you will recognize Andrew Scott too, who is part of it early on. Or Mark Strong. Firth I liked. He usually plays sensitive characters, but he can pull off ""tough"" as well. Cumberbatch I just cannot see as a gritty soldier, especially not as the one who commands a unit, come on. Then again I don't think too highly of him as an actor anyway. Scott and Strong were fine.Now a few words, however, on the two young actors at the center here. They really deserve to be mentioned because they did a fine job. The one who is really in it from beginning to end reminded me physically of the young Andreas Lust and I cannot imagine I am the only German/Austrian who thought so. Anyway, this film is (a bit like Birdman) one shot basically from beginning to end. The action just blacks out in those moments when one character is unconscious or otherwise the camera moves away from the characters and this way they could have made it work. Of course, this was not all recorded in 2 hours and then it's a wrap. But it feels that way and that is why it is a success. It is so nicely written, I said that before, but it deserves to be said again. There are many very good moments that show how much attention to detail is included in this film. Just pay attention to how the guys are joking about trying to do a parody of a superior officer, but our hero just sits there with a really sad face expression due to what happened a little earlier. Or also this refers for example to the frame that includes how the older from the two sits in the grass next to a tree very early on and then also after the film when his big mission is over and he managed to warn the batallion. Or the mouse/rat scene with the animal falling down and running away and this way causing the explosion. Now that was really one of the most tense moments of the film, also how one character saves the other's life after that.Or not much later when we have the scene with the German pilot and his knife and he actually stabs one of the two and kills him before getting shot himself and this was such a shocking moment when you realize the kind-hearted boy from the two, who loves telling stories and who has a brother he loves very much and who has a mother/family that owns a garden etc., is actually about to die because you thought it is his mission to save his brother and everybody else in his batallion, but nope: It is the other who moves to the center of it all consequently and if you take a look at how he questions the entire mission after almost being killed and asks his friend why oh why did he pick him, there was some slight foreshadowing you can say. Oh well, I say that now. When the other kid was killed (in what was even a tragically altruist death because he, unlike the final one central character who just wanted to let him die, tried to save the enemy soldier's life and got attacked immediately afterwards), I did not think about it like that at all, so it is also a very surprising movie. Anyway, the one central character finally accepted the difficult task as we see when he pushed the other soldiers to really get the car moving out of the mud. Unfortunately, this was also the last scene of the film that really really impressed me and when he leaves this group, it gets a bit worse (or not as good anymore as everything before that I would say). Probably it is just personal taste, but the scenes with the French woman and child as well as all the German soldiers did not do that much for me sadly, even if they were technically flawless. There is no denying there. Also let me say that in these parts they nicely elaborated on the man vs. man (1v1) component and that was definitely executed convincingly, most of all the scene with one soldier who fires at our hero from far above.It stays a tense movie for sure, it just goes one step back from great to good I would say and then there is Cumberbatch too, which is not helping. Okay he is not bad or anything, but everything/everybody else is just better. Let me put it like that. So sadly, when eventually he meets his late buddy's brother, who is alive and well, it was not as emotional for me as it could have been. Nonetheless, I want to say again that there are so many quality moments that are also informative like when we find out why the Germans killed the cows or that there are soldiers in the British army with all kinds of ethnicities and colors and that made them strong too because the Germans (obviously with their take on race) do not have that. Two more things I want to mention are the really really good soundtrack and it would be nice if that one wins the Oscar and not the one from Joker and the second thing is the high-level cinematography. Roger Deakins. Do I need to say more? Glad that he does not have to wait for his second Oscar as long as for his first. He is safe for the win really. Finally, a few words on the two young men again. I think it has been a while since I saw a better example of friendship in film with how they interact and support each other and even save each other at times. And how of course the main character's journey was not only to save his comrades, but also to fulfill his friend's last wish and with that I do not only mean the letter to the mother.But even in the face of all that, we should not forget that our hero has his own fate and family and does not only exist to fulfill the fallen's last wish(es). We see that with the photos at the very end and the wish written on them. Also much better this way really than maybe them coming up with a romance story with the French girl or so. The film did not need that. But it needed their inclusion and we see that even with all the soldiers dying, there were also so so many casualties in the simple population (away from the military branch), such as probably also the baby's mother. Tragedy wherever you look. Every corpse you see, no matter which side he fought on or if he fought on any at all, had their own story. This film is really important because it reminds us of the cruelties of war and we should try all we can to make sure these times will stay a thing of the past for as long as mankind exists. And at the same time it tells us a captivating story about those affected by it all. I can only say I liked this one much more than ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", films that have been considered classics for a long time, so even if you (like myself) are not too much into war movies, you should check it out, preferrably on the big screen at your local theater. There are so many scenes that are far more effective there (like the rat/mouse scene for example) than on a laptop/television screen. Go for it. Don't miss out. Great job by Mendes and everybody else!"
1917,23 January 2020,6/10,"Sam Mendes has made a technically bravura film which looks like one long take. Something he experimented with at the beginning of his James Bond movie, Spectre.Made by Dreamworks, the company's first shot for the Best Picture Oscar was Saving Private Ryan in 1998.The story is about two soldiers in World War One. Their mission is to make their way across no man's land, the abandoned German lines and reach the advancing Allied troops. They have to deliver a message ordering them not to attack as they are walking into a trap set by the Germans who want to give the impression that they are retreating.One of the soldiers has good reason to take this perilous mission. His brother is part of the Allied group and is in danger. Therefore the story owes a nod to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Impressively photographed by Roger Deakins, it sets out to show the dirty horrors of trench warfare. The story though is slight and gets lost with the style of filmmaking that Mendes has employed.I thought it lacked the verve of Peter Weir's Gallipoli, a film which I kept thinking off when I watched 1917. This might be the reason that although it went into the Oscars as a frontrunner, it lost out on the main prizes."
1917,10 February 2020,7/10,"In April, 1917, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are assigned to cross a no man's land and a German line to deliver a message from General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) calling off an attack to the German front. The military intelligence had concluded that the Germans have prepared a mortal trap that will kill one thousand and six hundred soldiers including Blake's big brother Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden). Will they succeed in their journey?""1917"" is a good war movie but overrated with the nomination to the Oscar. The masterpiece ""Paths of Glory"" is also based on a World War I drama and is better and better, but was not nominated to the Oscar. ""Joyeux Noël"" that is also better than ""1917"" at least was nominated to the Oscar. ""1917"" has good direction, performances, sets and special effects and is also worthwhile watching. But not with the expectation of an Oscar nominated film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""1917"""
1917,16 August 2020,,"This is an impressive bit of filmmaking, and it won 3 Oscars for just that - however the areas of the wins are quite telling and fit with my experience of watching it. The wins were all technical in nature, which is fitting because 1917 is a film that very much impresses on its delivery first, and its content a reasonably distant second. It is sort of understandable, because the central plot is about rushed forward motion, and this does mean limited opportunity for the film is flesh out its characters and scenario. It does have a go at it, and does reasonably well, but mostly this aspect is a weakness.In terms of tension and thrills, it does well at its best, producing many good set-pieces through the run-time. The downside of this is that sustained periods without big moments, or engaging smaller drama, do give an up/down feeling to the pace of delivery. Broadly though, it flows well and takes the viewer along with it. Main reason though was the technical delivery. I am a sucker for a ""single-shot"" delivery, so I was already open to loving this film on that basis alone. Okay it is not one single take so much as a series of takes (longest of which is 8 minutes), but this is still hugely impressive and it gives the film the sense of movement and momentum that the narrative benefits from. Cinematography, lighting, sound, editing, effects - all the technical aspects come together impressively and it enough to carry the film over the weaknesses in other areas. The cast occasionally distract by virtue of their fame, but mostly they work well, and the two young leads sell their situations well.Overall though, I still ended the film thinking about the technical aspects than I was about the characters or the film as a whole - which isn't a good situation. When I watched The Irishman, I quickly stopped noticing the de-aging technology and just got into the film; however here the same didn't happen consistently - I found I was broken out of the film and was focused on the camera movement, editing etc."
1917,6 January 2020,6/10,"Two corporals set out across no man's land in WWI to deliver a message to a company to not attack, that it is a trap. One of the corporals has a brother in the group. This is a long drawn out story of two guys trying to make their way through France.I was not as excited about the two man war play as much as the Golden Globes. Oh, BTW war is ""last man standing"" so there is your theme that wasn't worth two hours of gun fire.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
1917,13 February 2020,10/10,"I haven't seen Parasite yet, all I can say is that it must be fantastic, to have beaten this to The Oscar for best movie. The story is incredible, intense, moving, and of course a piece of reality. The raw human emotions is perfectly captured, the Cinema watched in silence, you could tell the audience were captivated.A cinematic Masterpiece, it looks incredible, a lavish, visual treat, the production values are outstanding, it looks and sounds terrific.. There are many moments from this movie that will live with me for a long time. The performances are outstanding, I wouldn't pick out a singular one, they are all terrific.War films are becoming a favourite genre of mine, Dunkirk from a few years ago, and now 1917.If you see one film this year, watch this, it is phenomenal. 10/10"
1917,31 March 2020,10/10,"You never know - usually it is not good for anything. Especially when it comes to single man missions. And this has the backdrop of real war (written all over it). And it also has the one shot movie - you know when there is no visible cut and according to the filmmaker there wasn't any? I mean there is one moment where we go completely dark, so ... and there is always a possibility to cut. But they swear they didn't do it here, so let's take that at face value.The effects are great, the cinematography was a shoe in for the Academy Award ... and it won. Not a surprise. Having said that, there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Masterfully played (especially if you think about how many takes it probably took to do this) and great production values. This is a masterpiece, no matter if the subject matter is your thing or not"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Impressively filmed, the movie's staging, set design, lighting, cinematography and choreographed action sequences are all top notch and deserving of recognition. I should mention the soundtrack as well, which complements the story as two young soldiers progress their way through No Man's land to deliver an urgent message to a distant unit that faces annihilation. The film makers wisely selected two relatively lesser know actors for the film's protagonists so that celebrity wouldn't get in the way of the story. I was somewhat surprised that Dean-Charles Chapman, portraying Lance Corporal Blake, didn't make it to the end of the movie. His death before mid-picture left Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) the unenviable task of making his way alone across enemy held territory to complete an almost impossible mission. Among a number of astonishing scenes, I was most impressed with the German plane crash that came within inches of claiming the lives of both men. Though the picture claims it's status as being filmed in one continuous tracking shot, there appear at least one or two instances where that might not have been the case, one in particular being quite obvious, even if masked rather well. Even so, the technique may very well earn Sam Mendes the Best Directing Oscar, along with Cinematography and Production Design. The trenches and battleground scenes are particularly impressive, especially near the finale in which the British unit prepares for it's assault. In any case, the picture stands as a worthy achievement in film making, and is especially recommended."
1917,26 December 2020,10/10,"I read the previous review, and saw that it was number 3,000, making mine the 3,001st. All that I can say is that Sam Mendes's ""1917"" is a mind-blowing movie. Filmed as a single shot, it shows the horrors that the British troops witnessed during World War I. The combination of acting, cinematography and musical score create something unlike anything that you've ever seen (not least because of the sheer intensity of the battle scenes). We in the 21st century can never truly imagine the misery of fighting in WWI, but this movie at least gives us a feeling of it.Anyway, fine movie. Definitely deserved its Oscar wins."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"I was excited about this upcoming war movie for the various trailers and behind-the-clips shown about two months before its release, then it was getting a lot of attention during Awards Season, so I made sure to see it on a big IMAX screen, from BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Sir Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Skyfall). Basically, during the First World War in April 1917, the German army has pulled back from a sector of the Western Front in the north of France. General Erinmore (Colin Firth) briefs two young British soldiers Lance Corporal, Blake (Game of Thrones' Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (Sunshine on Leith's George MacKay). Aerial reconnaissance has confirmed that the Germans are not retreating but have made a tactical withdrawal to their new Hindenburg Line, where they are waiting to overwhelm the attacking British with artillery. With field telephone lines cut, Blake and Schofield are ordered to hand-deliver a message to the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off their planned attack, which might cost the lives of 1,600 men including Blake's brother Joseph (Bodyguard's Richard Madden). Schofield and Blake cross no man's land and reach the abandoned German trenches. These turn out to contain tripwires, and a rat triggers a planted bomb. The ensuing explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake manages to dig him out. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where they witness a dogfight (an aerial battle). The German plane plunges into the farm and Schofield and Blake save the pilot from burning. Schofield proposes to mercy kill him, having severe injuries, but Blake has Schofield fetch water for the pilot. The pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield, who comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission. Schofield is picked up by a passing British unit, led by Captain Smith (Mark Strong). A destroyed bridge near the bombed-out village, Écoust-Saint-Mein, prevents lorries from crossing. So, Schofield crosses the remnants of the bridge alone. A German sniper across the river in an abandoned house tries to attack him. Schofield tracks down and kills the sniper, only to be knocked out by a ricocheting bullet. It is night when Schofield regains consciousness. He walks through the nearby ruins, when he is spotted by and fired at by a German soldier. Schofield stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with a baby. She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and his canteen filled with milk from the farm. Schofield leaves and is again spotted by two German soldiers. He strangles one and pushes the one that is too inebriated to stop him. Other soldiers chase him, but he escapes by jumping into a river. Schofield reaches the Battalion as the British attack is due to begin. He fails to stop the start of the attack, so he sprints across the battlefield, after realising that the trenches are too full of soldiers for him to make it to the commander in time. He forces his way into meeting Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) and shows the letter, and the attack is called off. Schofield then locates Joseph, who was among the first attacking wave but is unhurt, and delivers the news of Blake's death. Joseph is upset but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to Blake's mother to tell her about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Schofield walks away and rests under a nearby tree. It ends with Schofield looking at photos of his loved ones, his two young daughters and a wife at home. Also starring Spectre's Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie, Plus One's Daniel Mays as Sergeant Sanders, Killing Eve's Adrian Scarborough as Major Hepburn, Richard McCabe as Colonel Collins and Billy Postlethwaite, Pete's son as NCO Harvey. The cast are all impressive, the locations, costumes and period detail are authentic and fantastic, but it is the direction by Mendes, camerawork and choreography that deserves the most praise. Movies like Rope, Silent House, and Birdman have used the ""one shot"" technique, filming continuously for long periods, and making near-unnoticeable edits, apart from the obvious fade to black, it is almost impossible to spot the edits, it really plunges the viewer into brutality and horror of the war, a moving, effective and and breathlessly immersive epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score for Thomas Newman, and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Original Music, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated Best Original Score. Outstanding!"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"It's over seventy years since Alfred Hitchcock made Rope, which tried to tell a thrilling tale of murder in a swanky New York apartment location with as few shots as possible, the director hiding any sneaky splices with clever visual trickery. For First World War adventure 1917, Sam Mendes pulls off the same illusion, only with the advantages of 21st century technology, meaning that his film is far more seamless and able to cover much more ground: the vast, body-strewn battlegrounds of northern France, to be precise, where Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given the unenviable task of delivering a letter to advancing British troops heading into a trap that could cost 1,600 lives.There's no denying that 1917 is an amazing technical feat, with many an impressive shot as Blake and Schofield risk life and limb to head into enemy territory. Director Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins pull off the seemingly impossible on many occasions, the camera gliding and sweeping over muddy war-torn terrain, in and out of trenches, and through numerous ruins, rarely leaving the protagonists, clearly the result of much planning and impeccable timing. As such, 1917 is, for the most part, an incredibly immersive experience, putting the viewer right in the thick of it with the heroes, the action both intense and visceral. Occasionally, however, it's all just a little too clever for its own good, with a few moments that are so technically jaw-dropping that they tend to draw the viewer out of the film wondering how the shots were achieved. It's a double-edged sword, that movie-making wizardry!The simplistic script also works for and against the film. I liken the story-line to that of a 'first-person shooter' computer game, where the player controls a character who must complete a mission, overcoming various hazards and enemies along the way, There's not exactly a lot of depth to it -- it's about getting from A to B without being killed, and that's pretty much it. On the flip side, the minimalistic plot does mean that there's a fair amount of action to be had, so I'm not complaining too much. I do have a couple of minor niggles, though -- and considering the incredible attention to detail given to the visuals, I wish that Mendes and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns had managed to write their way round these issues a little better: firstly, trusting a German pilot who has just been shot out of the sky.... stupid, stupid, stupid. Number two: milk... just sitting there for the taking, with no-one else around (and how convenient for a touching scene later on). And lastly, a whole battalion sat listening to someone sing, with no-one on look-out - it's like they're asking to be shot!Despite its problems, I would still recommend the film, especially to those interested the whole process of film-making -- the sets, the costumes, the carefully choreographed action, and the camerawork are astounding, and worth the price of admission alone. If you become invested in the characters and their mission, then that's just a bonus.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
1917,20 January 2020,5/10,"Right, well I took my time getting around to watching this movie, but eventually got the chance to sit down and watch it.Let me just start by saying that the movie is enjoyable and watchable, for sure. Especially the first 35 minutes of the movie, because it really shows how gritty, ugly and atrocious war is. And the way that whole part of the movie was set up was just amazing.Then the next 25 minutes, the movie started to gear down, as the two characters were trekking about. Sure, it was still enjoyable. Then the last hour of the movie it just fell into mediocrity, and the movie never got out of that slump. And it was a shame, because it was off to such a marvelous start.This movie is no ""Saving Private Ryan"", although there are similarities, for sure. But they are two very different movies, both in story and entertainment value.I watched the movie, and was adequately entertained, however, I can't say that this is a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time around, because the movie just didn't have that much to offer. And those glorious 35 minutes in the start of the movie just didn't stretch to salvage the rest of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was adequate. Sure, this is not a movie that is heavy of thespian acting performances, but the people were doing good enough jobs with their given roles. But I really don't think that anyone were given any proper chance to shine and stand out in throughout the course of the movie.Visually, then ""1917"" was good. It was a dirty and gritty movie, definitely making it feel like an authentic WW1 movie, and it did feel like you were right there in the muck with the soldiers.My rating for the movie was initially going to be a 6 out of 10 stars, but because of the sliding down into mediocrity, then the movie settles on a 5 out of 10 stars from me. While it is watchable and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, it was by no means a milestone in war story cinema."
1917,2 August 2020,,"This is a really good movie, it is less about typical war battles, it is about a two man team given the do or die assignment to deliver an important message to a British regiment prepared to launch an attack the next morning. The lives of 1600 men are at stake. As such the camera follows the men through trenches and across the countryside almost in real time, viewing it you feel that you are the third person in the mission. The camera is either following closely, or leading closely, or close off to the side. It required exact choreography, almost like a complicated ballet, and very much rehearsal time was required before filming. The DVD extras show a few of the complicated cinematography techniques used, like crew carrying a camera up to a point then placing it onto a type of crane to finish the shot, all uninterrupted. To me the cinematography is the real star of the movie.This is the first time Sam Mendes scripted a movie, he based the ideas on stories told to him in the 1970s, stories of his grandfather's own experiences in WW1. So while the story is fiction it is based on typical WW1 activities and experiences.My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. A quite interesting glimpse at what WW1 was like."
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"Sam Mendes in 1917 gives us his variation on the old adage, ""if you think you're going through hell, keep going,"" and for all of the given technical prowess - and a 70 year old Roger Deakins showing with a big grin that he's still got one of the most massive cinematography you-know-whats in the industry - I didn't feel much while watching this, except the occasional ""oof"" or ""ugh"" (usually when seeing some of the first dead bodies and rats). It's a conceptual piece that means to be a major statement on the horrors of war, and it only reminds me that the films about war that have stayed with me more than any are the ones that provide visceral and complicated characters FIRST, craft wizardry SECOND (or at least concurrently).I thought at some point I might compare it to how a war-like video game works (I dont have a lot of experience playing these sorts of first-person shooters, Im just going by assumption), and to Mendes's credit he tries to slow things down here and there so it isnt all thrill-a-minute action and spectacle. But it does carry that sense of the mission these two are on and the sort of ""stuff"" that happens is more interesting than getting to know them (and when we briefly do, it's unremarkable, maybe a sign of why Mendes doesn't usually write his own films).It's a somewhat precarious position to be in as one in the audience, since objectively I know what everyone on the crew did to make this come off, from the art direction to the props to how goddamn realistically-based the camera is (or I should say like 80% of the time), yet by the end it means to lay an emotional punch to the gullet, and I just didn't connect.Maybe some will, or maybe some will be even more bothered by what is clearly, as far as elevator pitches go, an attempt to one-up Kubrick with Paths of Glory (I van almost hear Mendes in his head as he shoots this going, ""hah, take that and your trench tracking shots!"") via the near-one take approach of Rope. But, again, those films had scripts that were engaging completely on the scale of what horrors human beings do to one another on an individual scale, with the system as a cudgel, not to mention enormously moving performances (same with another film that did this far better, Birdnlman, for its theatricality). This is kind of a... Forced-Poetic idea of a tragic story, impeccably made but hollow at its heart.For all the impressive filmmaking brio on display, I unfortunately have a sinking feeling this may win best director and best picture at the Oscars not for exactly being a ""best"" but for being the ""most"" film (or trying to be). And as for it being an anxiety-filled experience... Folks, c'mon, Uncut Gems is in a theater right next door to this one at your local cineplex ."
1917,13 March 2020,4/10,"In the same way that I'm dispositioned to despise anyone from Upper St. Clair or Mt. Lebanon - Pittsburgh-centric content, yinz guys - I'm also usually on high alert to dislike Oscar bait like this film. So let me get all my vitriol out of my system before it begins: for a movie that people are proclaiming as a human experience of war, all I could see were the technological advancements and filmmaking tricks that allowed for the continuous shot style of the first half of this movie.It's fine. It was up for the biggest prizes in movie making and yep. It's a fine movie. It has no real soul or reason for you to watch it more than once, but this may be more of an indictment of this reviewer than this film.It left me cold and I felt like I was begging it for warmth. Just a casual outline of the events of the movie seem like they could be moments worth viewing, such as the choice to save or murder the downed German pilot. Instead, they are just moments.Sam Mendes has had a wonderful run so far, between his highly regarded James Bond films, Jarhead, Road to Perdition and American Beauty. He has an eye for huge visuals and the ability to tell a great story. This isn't a small movie, despite really only centering on one character's experience in the war.I probably enjoyed the scenes with the drunken soldiers blessing Schofield and Blake before they ventured into No Man's Land more than anything else in the movie. Although I wonder what the narrative point is of the film, which informs us at the end that everything that the leads have endured was truly for nothing, as the orders will probably change in the next week. This is not the first movie I've watched recently that offered little to no hope. Or maybe that was just life itself.Again - I felt like this movie was an awesome technical achievement. Perhaps the self-congratulatory nature of Hollywood and the press put me off, as I didn't need to hear its creators sing its praises so much. Or perhaps a steady diet of Mexican, Phillipino, Hong Kong and Italian junk movies have eroded my movie watching abilities, only allowing me to savor movies where black-gloved madmen strangle women and gas-guzzling mutants rise from the grave.Probably. So what?"
1917,26 January 2020,,"This tells a poignant story that touches you. It does so by being human, and not with blood and flying body parts. I was touched to tears in the end."
1917,5 February 2020,7/10,"Sometimes a film wins loads of awards, you go to see it, and realise it's not worthy of the hype.And then there's 1917. A film that lives up to the promise and then some.This is an excellent film, beautifully shot and performed."
1917,30 October 2020,8/10,"During the First World War, the British find themselves deep in enemy territory, and two young men volunteer for a seemingly impossible mission. It is a race against time for two Lance Corporals Blacke (Dean-Charles-Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) to dodge the enemy and travel cross enemy territory to deliver a message that should stop 1,600 men from walking into a trap. One of those men--Blake's own brother.Also in the cast Colin Firth, Andy Apollo, Andrew Scott, Daniel Mayes and Richard Madden."
1917,3 January 2021,10/10,"Better than platoon, apocalypse now, full metal jacket, saving private Brian, Gallipoli and that hamburger one put together. There's a funny bit where he accidentally puts his hand in a hole in that dead bloke"
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"I doesn't feel right reviewing a film of this stature when I watched it sitting in the comfort of an IMAX with a glass of Malbec in one hand and someone else's hand in my other... This depiction of the true horror of WWI really does get to the heart of the sacrifices made by ordinary, afraid, young men and lay them bare. I didn't find it particularly gory, or even scary for that matter, but Sam Mendes' direction, particularly of a wonderful George MacKay, but also of Dean-Charles Chapman is tender, taut and emotionally charged in a way that I haven't seen ""Saving Private Ryan"". The more established members of the cast - Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott feature sparingly, and do add value - but the film belongs undoubtedly to the two youngsters sent on an almost impossible mission across enemy lines to warn their comrades (one, being MacKay's brother) and save hundreds of lives. Thomas Newman's sensitive scoring and some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins make this an enormously engaging telling of courage, determination and loyalty. I'd sort of assumed ""the Joker"" was unstoppable as the best film at the Oscars this year; I certainly don't think that now! It does need a big screen to do it justice; and is very much worth seeing."
1917,27 August 2021,8/10,"Ever Since Sergei M. Eisenstein's ""Potemkin"" (1925) it became Undeniable that ""Editing"" was an Essential Component within the Power or Lack Thereof of ""Cinema"" to Invoke Impact on an Audience.Sam Mendes Completely Foregoes, Eliminates, Abandons Editing and the Editor for some kind of ""Experiment"" that Hitchcock Conducted with ""Rope"" in (1948).The Result was what one would Expect, and here it is Again in 2019, with the same Results except with 10 Oscar Nominations, as you might have Guessed, Not for Editing.Nominations are Suspect at Best.But Roger Deakens Cinematography is Splendidly Sterile Reflecting a Landscape and Individuals Drained by the Ravages of ""The Great War"".There it Ends and there is Nothing else Great about this Film.The Acting is Very Good and the Set Designs and Period Detail are Professionally Presented.So, After Films Like ""All Quiet On the Western Front"" (1930) and ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), this is a Hollow Hell in Comparison.Lacking any kind of Deep Character Development or Politics Concerning ""The War to End All Wars"".Void of Historical Context the Film Ends Up being Unenlightened, and Vacantly Presented to Audiences in the 21st Century.That Audience is No Doubt Deficient in those Regards and it would have been a much Better Film and Not just a Repeat of an Experimental Exercise.If it Tried, just a Little, to Offer some Contextual Considerations."
1917,14 January 2020,6/10,"If satire sends up reality (apart from closing on Saturday night) this effort may be said to build up satire. Apparently taking as its jumping-off point the sketch in Beyond The Frings that contains the line 'Right, Perkins, what we need at this stage of the war is a futile gesture ...' this movie begins with two squaddies being assigned a probable suicidal mission of speeding on foot through recently vacated enemy territory to warn a commander - telephone lines are conveniently down - to call off a planned attack that will end in wholesale slaughter. Wisely director Sam Mendes has gone with unknown albeit competent actors for these key roles which helps us to remain focused on the task rather than familiar/favourite actors playing at soldiers. That's it, really. A lot has been made of the 'one-take' technique which is, of course, ultimately fake, and was done much better by Orson Welles albeit for merely the opening of Touch of Evil. It's certainly watchable, has already BEEN watched by hundreds of punters and will almost certainly BE watched by hundreds more. Where there's life there's hype, and hype is a wonderful thing. Don't be surprised if there's a gong or two before it's finished."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Two young British Infantry corporals receive orders from their Company Commander in director Sam Mendes' gripping, often surreal World War I movie ""1917"" to deliver an urgent message to rescind a planned frontal attack on enemy positions on the Western Front. These two, clean-cut, lads embark on a genuine journey of hardship that nobody expects them to carry out and brave an obstacle course teeming with ravenous rats, lethal German snipers, while their own men try to sidetrack them. The action takes place in trenches, trucks, rivers, forests, and the remains of bombed out villages. Furthermore, they have only so much time to accomplish their mission, and the odds are stacked against them from the start. Heroism has rarely been portrayed in such realistic terms. Moreover, these two boys aren't trigger-happy, bloodthirsty killers, but naïve souls who don't have a clue what they have volunteered for once they forge ahead. The tragic catch is that only one of them will survive this nightmare. The one who dies doesn't die shooting it out with German soldiers. Instead, he will die trying to help a downed German aviator escape from his crashed biplane before its flaming fuselage incinerates him. ""1917"" captures the horror of the War to End All Wars as it was called by the politicians. Although ""Apocalypse Now"" dealt with the Vietnam War, the two movies reflect the futility of war as well as the humanity of their young men who bore arms in the conflict. What these two fellows experience is unforgettable, but it doesn't depict gung-ho heroics. Instead, men scramble to stay alive and often behave like cowards. Everywhere these two Brits go, they see the many faces of death. Rivers are choked with bloating, ashen-faced corpses, but director Sam Mendes resists the urge to show soldiers getting blown to smithereens or tangled up in their own guts like Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan.""
When a British sergeant orders Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman of ""The King"") to pick somebody to accompany him to headquarters, he doesn't think twice about taking his friend Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay of ""Defiance"") with him. Schofield isn't especially enthusiastic about the prospect that awaits them, but he tags along with Blake to the C.O.'s tent. General Erinmore (Colin Firth of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") shows them several maps of the Western Front as well as aerial photographs and explains that the Germans have abandoned their trenches. Initially, the High Command thought this represented a triumph. Instead, Erinmore explains the Germans not only deliberately left the battlefield, but also these sly Huns are orchestrating a Trojan Horse trap. When the British launch their next attack, they will be unwittingly feeding their troops into a German meat grinder. As it turns out, Corporal Blake has been chosen not only for his map reading skills, but also because his brother, Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden of ""Rocketman""), will die in the attack if it isn't halted. Corporal Blake has more incentive that anybody else under Erinmore's command, and the General calculates that this will enable him to complete the mission.
""1917"" is a sprawling, epic saga, and we're drawn into their plight, because we're following them every bloody step of the way. ""Skyfall"" director Sam Mendes and ""Brazil"" lenser Roger Deakins present this incredible mission as it unfolds on April 6, 1917. The film has a documentary feel to it, especially when our protagonists shoulder their way through fellow troops lining the infinite labyrinth of trenches. Each face tells a terrible story, and the officers hold out little hope for survival. Initially, during the first twenty minutes, Blake and Schofield are stunned by the uncanny silence that hangs ominously over the abandoned enemy trenches. Rats the size of racoons scavenge among the kitbags of food left behind by the Germans. Our two lads gaze in stupefaction at dozens of artillery pieces which the Huns have spiked in their urgency to retreat. At one point, the Brits enter a tunnel that appears to serve as a shortcut through this eerie no-man's land. One huge rat dragging a bag of food catches on a tripwire, and an explosion buries Schofield, and Blake digs him frantically out of the rubble. These guys were prepared to fight the Germans, but they had no idea a hungry rodent could pose such danger. Everywhere they go, no matter how desolate it appears, our protagonists discover nothing is what it seems. Death lurks everywhere, especially where they least expect it.
About forty-five minutes into ""1917,"" after one of the two protagonists has been killed, the other realizes his life literally hangs by a thread. He catches a ride in a truck with other British soldiers, but they are heading in the wrong direction, so he must leave them where a collapsed bridge marks their point of departure. No sooner has he parted company with them than a German sniper starts blasting away at him. Scenes like this spawn white-knuckled tension, and both combatants never really see each other until our hero silences the sniper. When our protagonists embarked on their mission, they were loaded down like pack mules with ordinance and rations. By the time the surviving Brit spots the men he is supposed to save, he has only his uniform to prove he is British. Incredibly, he learns to his chagrin a glory hound of an officer may ignore his message that he has literally died for to deliver. Earlier, when he lost most of what he was lugging along with him, our lone soldier dived into a river to elude enemy fire. Swept downstream, he winds up caught up in a logjam of rotting, bloated corpses that prevent further progress. A night in a bombed-out village has a hallucinatory quality as flares burst repeatedly above the buildings, and their skeletal remains ripple with spooky shadows. By the time our hero attains his objective, you'll feel as traumatized by this spectacle as he is"
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,"April 1917, the Western Front. Two British soldiers are sent to deliver an urgent message to an isolated regiment. If the message is not received in time the regiment will walk into a trap and be massacred. To get to the regiment they will need to cross through enemy territory. Time is of the essence and the journey will be fraught with danger.I had highish hopes for this movie. Written and directed by Sam Mendes, who gave us such superb films as American Beauty, Revolutionary Road, Road to Perdition and Jarhead, and massively hyped this looked like it should be one of the best war films to come out for a while. Turns out, it's not.The plot is interesting enough but that's about it. 1917 doesn't go anywhere new, say anything profound or even provide a large amount of entertainment. It's an odyssey involving characters who are clumsily drawn and aren't particularly engaging, with some goodish action scenes that are few and far between. The military side is okay but not 100% plausible.If you were hoping that this might be a confronting drama, showing the wastefulness of war, there's elements of that but it has been done before and done better and more jarringly. It's only confronting and profound if you've never watched a realistic war movie before, and even then it's probably not graphic or engaging enough to make a profound point regarding war.Overall, it's okay, but not great, and quite disappointing."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"I have to come to terms with the fact that I enjoy war movies. I've denied this for years--decades even--because I detest war and I don't care to see a movie glorifying war. But, what I've come to realize is that most war movies do not glorify war. A lot of them are human interest stories--stories about one or a few characters that are involved in a war. They're not war mongers, they're not policy makers, they're just people doing a dirty job.""1917"" is about people as well. More specifically it's about two British soldiers that have to get to a certain battlefront to deliver a message: ""Do not attack, it's a trap."" One of the soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), has a brother in the targeted battalion so he has added incentive to get there.One of the more spectacular aspects of this movie was the camera work. Somehow, they made the entire movie look like one continuous camera shot with no cuts. Through trenches, barbed wire, around men, in and out of buildings, etc., and the camera was continuously rolling.This is something I tend to pay attention to and something I really appreciated in the movie ""Children of Men"" when there were a few extended scenes with no cuts. In this movie it is an entirely different level. I know that there had to be cuts and my assumption is that they were expertly done when panning from one point to another, but that's just my guess. In any case it was a marvel.Expert camera shots and editing alone aren't enough to make a movie worthwhile. The story and the characters are ultimately going to be the draw. Like many war stories, this was a story of self-sacrifice. The true strength of the movie comes in the form of its authenticity. The more authentic the more gripping, the more personal, the deeper the emotional connection to the overall story and its characters. ""1917"" offers that along with some awesome cinematography."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"The year is, as you may have guessed, 1917. The war to end all wars(oh, if only it actually had been) has been going on for 3 years. The German forces seem to be on retreat. Unfortunately, like other times that appeared to be the case, it is in actuality a trap. Blake(Chapman, green) gets a signed order from the general to the regiment(as he has a brother in it) that are to pursue the enemy. before he was given that briefing, back when he thought it would be something simple like to go gather some food, he was asked to choose someone to go with him. He picked his friend Schofield(MacKay, more experienced, and as a direct result, more reserved). It seems impossible but they have to try.Their journey shows a huge amount of the countless legitimately terrifying and disgusting realities of WWI. You'll see many corpses. It was rare to bury your dead. Some are being slowly eaten by rats. Others are bloated. We as moviegoers can almost smell their stench. While I have an extremely high tolerance for violence and gore, I do acknowledge that there is a certain line. If you cross that, if you show more graphic material than you ""should"", the audience becomes desensitised. It no longer packs a punch. This movie does an incredible job of getting right up to the limit, going as far as it can, without going overboard. I agree with those that say this isn't really an entry in the action genre. I'd classify it as a horror-thriller. Within 15 minutes, our duo have crossed into what they just been explicitly told, technically is still enemy territory. No man's land. The focus is not really on battles so much as tension and suspense. Any moment they could encounter someone one who's stayed behind specifically to stop them, to prevent their victory.This is presented as a one taker, with the few actual cuts, perhaps not entirely successfully, hidden. I found it to be incredibly immersive. Your mileage may vary. It does come with weaknesses, such as dialogue scenes that would have benefited from traditional editing, and are instead bland. And limitations, which I can't discuss since I am not getting into spoilers. Some criticize the low characterization and plot. I agree with them on its presence, not about it being a considerable negative. This is instead about the more general experience of participating in World War I, and keeping to a faster pace and smoother flow. What we see in this is essentially a microcosm. To understand the scope we do have to ourselves multiply it by millions. Far more effective than throwing the real(legitimately overwhelming) numbers at us. No, it's not the exact experience of everyone, that's not what they wanted to go for. The camaraderie rings true. Here's hoping this picture(and it's positive reception, when it comes to critics, general audiences, and awards) will inspire a third adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front. The two that are already out are both excellent, covering different aspects really well. And another one could go into new things that those don't, from the book.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this contains some strong language. I recommend this to anyone that has the stomach for it. 9/10"
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"1917 (2019) ***1/2 Dean-Charles Chapman, George MacKay, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch. Filmmaker Sam Mendes (who collaborated on the screenplay with Krysty Wilson-Cairns) makes an impressive mark in his Lean like take on the War Picture with the First World War as the setting for two green British soldiers tasked with a grave order - deliver the message to hold off a battle that the enemy has set them up for massive failure. With its one-take gimmick (i.e. the film never breaks action thru its run time), master cinematographer Roger Deakins takes on the Herculean challenge with grave aplomb in making the impossible, possible, not unlike the task set for its young charges."
1917,21 January 2020,6/10,"The first thing anybody will tell you about ""1917"" is that it was filmed to look like one long take. It's the kind of movie that uses ""making of"" featurettes as part of its marketing strategy. Unless you really dig movies that are technically accomplished but not much else, beware. Remember ""The Revenant?"" Remember how whenever anyone involved with that movie talked about it in public all they talked about was how grueling it was to film? They didn't talk about the characters, or the story, or the themes, or the emotional investment. No, it was just a bunch of logistics about how to work in the cold.Yes, ""1917"" is a technical marvel, and I would probably recommend it just so that people can see it for themselves, as I'm sure a lot of people will be dazzled enough by it that they won't care that the gimmick came first and the story came later. My problem is that, for a movie that's supposed to make us feel what it's like to be dumped into the chaos of war, it feels so overly choreographed. The film never stops being impressed with itself, and as the camera tracks and swoops and swirls around perfectly art directed WWI battlefields, you can practically hear Sam Mendes cooing ""wait till they get a load of THIS shot."" I was so distracted by watching the gimmick that I never felt involved in the story.But maybe that's for the best, since there isn't much of a story to be invested in. Mendes went to the Steven Spielberg school of directing, where character motivations are so simplistic that a five year old could understand them. Thomas Newman provides a typically thunderous score that telegraphs every time it comes blaring on the screen exactly how we're supposed to feel, which can pretty much be summed up as ""War Bad. Heroes Good."" Roger Deakins, who deserves every ounce of praise he's sure to get for this movie, does create some beautiful and astonishing images, but the one-shot approach gets monotonous after a while and draws attention to what a contribution skillful editing would have made to the film's rhythms.One thing that surprises me somewhat is that among all the awards buzz this film is generating, none of it has been for lead actor George MacKay, who delivers a stunning and stunningly physical performance. Because the whole movie is designed to look like one continuous shot, he is by definition in literally every moment of it, and he totally carries it. If Leo DiCaprio could win an Oscar for grunting and grimacing his way through ""The Revenant,"" why shouldn't MacKay be recognized for this?Grade: B+"
1917,2 October 2021,7/10,"Two young soldiers are tasked with taking an urgent message to a unit some miles away with whom communications have been severed. They travel through British trenches, No-Man's Land, allegedly deserted German trenches, countryside and ruined towns which have been, and may still be, the subject of German depredations.This is a high concept movie - an extraordinarily simple idea, but told with extraordinary style. The film is constructed as, essentially, a single unbroken take with a constantly moving camera. It is not unique in this, but it does it extremely well and the approach is ideally suited to the material.The film looks impressive, the acting is first rate, the realisation of the trenches and war-torn locales is fantastic, and the sense of being in constant danger is constant.It is nearly a masterpiece.For me, it failed in two respects. One was the artifice itself. It was so cleverly constructed that I was constantly aware of the planning which must have gone into choreographing the action and camera movements and edit points. The other was that there were a number of elements which failed to work, the woman and child, and the singing soldier to name but two.Nonetheless, it is a film which is well worth seeing."
1917,23 December 2019,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's now been over 100 years since World War I ended. The Great War garners barely a mention in high school history books these days, and Hollywood has devoted much more time and energy to WWII. Filmmaker Peter Jackson did his part with last year's stunning documentary THEY SHALL NOT GROW OLD, a video and photographic look at the actual people involved in the First World War. And now, Oscar winning director Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) delivers another glimpse ... and another technical marvel.Mr. Mendes, working with Oscar winning Cinematographer Roger Deakins (BLADE RUNNER 2049) and Oscar winning Film Editor Lee Smith (DUNKIRK), has shot and edited the film to give the look of one continuous take in real time. Although used previously in such films as Hitchcock's ROPE and Inarritu's BIRDMAN, the single take approach is certainly no gimmick here. We open on two young British soldiers lounging in a prairie as they are summoned to report to the commander. Their mission is described as critical, as a British battalion is preparing to walk into a deadly trap set by the Germans. More than 1600 lives are at stake and the phone lines are down. It's up to Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield to work their way across No Man's Land to the front line and hand-deliver an order stopping the attack. Oh, and one more detail: Blake's older brother is in the battalion he is tasked with warning.The real time approach serves the purpose of allowing viewers to take on the urgency of Blake and Schofield. We experience the tension and horrors of war. Barbed wire, booby traps, slushy trenches, snipers, rats, dead bodies, dogfights (the aerial type) and towns under siege all play a part here as the men rush towards their goal of saving fellow soldiers lives, including a beloved family member. Dean-Charles Chapman (""Game of Thrones"") plays Blake, and George MacKay (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) plays Schofield. We spot the personality differences between them. Blake is super focused and determined to save his brother, while Schofield doesn't welcome the assignment, but is a dutiful soldier and loyal friend.It's really the Schofield character with whom the viewer mostly relates. He's no super soldier or Jason Bourne-type, but rather a young man trying to stay alive and fulfill his orders. With the relentless pacing of the film, we feel the fear and admire the courage. There is an especially touching scene in a bombed-out town where paths are crossed with a French woman (Claire Duburcq) caring for an orphaned infant. It's a reminder that humanity still exists, even within the bounds of war.There is no clock ticking in the corner of the screen, but we know time is of the essence, and quite limited. The camera seems to be always moving forward, rarely allowing for us or the characters to exhale. As you might expect, running is done frequently - sometimes towards something, sometimes from it. Roger Deakins is in prime form here with his camera, and there are too many remarkable moments to mention them all; however, the river rapids and waterfall, and the town under siege at night, are two of the most incredible sequences I've seen on screen.Along the journey, some familiar faces pop up as military men: Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth. Although each appears only briefly, it's a testament to their acting prowess that each is memorable. The chaos and relentless terror of war is on display, more often than not. But this isn't a film designed to create deep thoughts or serious debates on the merits of war. Instead, it's meant to focus on one of the countless personal stories that occur during war. War is fought by people, not faceless countries, and each person has their own story.Non-linear story telling has been a movie-thing since even before MEMENTO, but director Mendes (and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns, ""Penny Dreadful"") show us the true presentation of linear ... in the moment and by the moment. GALLIPOLI and PATHS OF GLORY are about the closest comparisons I can come up with, and the weight of the film is felt physically and emotionally as we are drawn in. The exceptional score from Thomas Newman (14 time Oscar nominee) serves to accentuate the chaos and relentless terror. It's a work of art and a unique viewing experience."
1917,12 March 2020,6/10,"1917 is a cinematic experience, but it ain't no Gallipoli.The strength of the film lies in the bond formed between the two, which extends beyond death. However, better when it's Sam and Frodo together. Lacking action, as everything happening's surrounding the central characters. Not that action's required, but the little involved, lacks punch and realism."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Entering 2020,I started to make plans over for what films I would travel out to see. Checking for what had been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscar's, I found out that for 1917,the entire film has been opened up to the IMAX format. This led to me going to the Vue IMAX in Manchester, (second biggest screen in Europe) for my first cinema viewing of the year.View on the film:Reuniting from their Skyfall (2012-also reviewed) mission with a idyllic sit in the French countryside before pulling back to reveal the mission that Blake and Schofield are about to accept, co-writer/(Krysty Wilson-Cairns) director Sam Mendes & cinematographer Roger Deakins track them both into a No Man's Land immerse atmosphere, where Mendes and Deakins cloud the ""Men on a Mission"" the duo must carry with magnificent, ultra-stylised long shadows casting hell across the war zone.Also reuniting with composer Thomas Newman giving a excellent, shredded nerves score, Mendes and Deakins fully display the 5,200 feet of trenches dug out for the production in breath-taking long crane and tracking shots putting the viewer up-close to the dead bodies (outstanding special effects) laying at the side of the duo on their stealth walks across the wastelands.Going on a mission with Mendes after editing Spectre (2015), Lee Smith stays perfectly in synch to Mendes, Deakins and Newman's charge to the front line, with razor-sharp invisible edits keeping the one continuous shot appearance on track, descending the duo deeper into this merciless war.Inspired by his grandfather's book The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991.,the screenplay by Sam Mendes and Wilson-Cairns display a real precision in keeping exposition to a bare minimum, instead keeping the war grounded in earthy, clipped dialogue between Blake and Schofield becoming more open as they cross the battlefields.Spending most of the film on their own, Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay give incredibly expressive, raw performances as Blake and Schofield, whose humble friendship walks on the paths of glory towards the war of 1917."
1917,9 January 2020,2/10,"Fictitious war stories are generally not good and this movie 1917 is an example with what is wrong with recent war movies. The ridiculous story is implausible from the get go.A really good war movie is the recent Roland Emmerich movie ""Midway"" with a straightforward factual story and thrilling action and heroes that look like heroes. It's a travesty that 1917 won the Golden Globe and Midway didn't even get a nomination.There are so many holes in the story. Letting just 2 of them go is insane. The way Blake died was beyond irritating. Schofield's journey through sniper fire and river were just too unrealistic. Running through the battlefield at the end was just too much. Plus the elder Blake did not look like the younger Blake. Because things didn't ring true they weren't really exciting. Of course it is tense in the way you don't want him to die or get shot. But you know he will make or there is no movie so it wasn't the right kind of excitement.How not to make a war movie. Please don't give this one an Oscar."
1917,20 September 2020,10/10,"Director (and co-writer) Sam Mendes has created a most memorable film based on a story shared by his grandfather who served in WW I and the manner in which he accomplishes his desire to re-open the history of WW I is one of the most creative and successful cinematic achievements to date.World War I April 6, 1917 Two British soldiers Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofeld (George MacKay) are ordered by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to cross no man's land to deliver a message to a the 2nd Devons regiment to defer their planned attack - the attack is a trap set by the enemy. On their way Blake, whose brother is with the Devons, saves his friend's life during a tripwire explosion, and is later killed by the enemy, leaving Schofeld with the responsibility of delivering the urgent message as well as informing Blake's brother of his death. Schofeld encounters many obstacles in his path through fields, deserted farms, a village, a river and a little town, until he reaches the Devons. Literally at the lost minute, he delivers his message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the mission is accomplished. Schofeld finds Blake's older brother (Richard Madden) and informs him of the tragic news and the story ends.Not only is the film brilliantly written (Sam Mendes with Krysty Wilson-Cairns), but the casting choices to place major actors such as Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott is minor but pivotal roles adds to the impact of the experience. Much of the film's success is due to the brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins and the impressive musical score by Thomas Newman - and the many associates who aided these two men in their crafts. Brilliant - on every level!"
1917,28 February 2020,8/10,"Normally I wasn't going to watch 1917 but with all the fuss with the BAFTA's and the Oscar's winning for it's cinematography I had to see it.What a movie, story is of course sad but top notch acting and as said, the cinematograhy is stunning, one shot, almost unbelievable. Only one moment that I could think of editing is the black-out moment. But even then it's almost unbelievable to see.A must see for lovers of special movies but also for those who love war movies. I agree, a must see."
1917,18 July 2020,7/10,"1917 is a good movie but to say it's incredible is a bit exaggerated. Visually it's very good and the Oscar for that could be justified even though there were many other movies for this year that could have won that prize. But yes the cinematography was great, as was the soundtrack, so that alone makes it already worth a watch. The story on the other hand has flaws, and not little flaws, some scenes don't make much sense and that's why it's not a great movie but just a good movie. The acting was good, the cinematography great, the sound effects on top, the story (what to me is the most important in a movie) was just okay but not great. I saw much better war movies that got lesser credit so to me it's slightly overrated, but in doesn't change the fact I did enjoy watching 1917."
1917,11 January 2020,,"""Poor fellows shot dead are lying in all directions. Trenches, bits of equipment, clothing (probably blood-stained), ammunition, tools, caps, etc., etc., everywhere. Everywhere the same hard, grim, pitiless sign of battle and war. I have had a belly full of it.""
Captain James PattersonAn Oscar spoiler? 1917 won the top Golden Globe award, and no one can complain about that, regardless of how that quirky Foreign Press decides. At the least it is one of the most moving films of the last decade; at the best its cinematography bests newly- classics like The Irishman and Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood.WWI already has its iconic trench warfare epic in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory. 1917 equals the visual horror and claustrophobia, the animal-like scramble to survive, and it adds another personal dimension as writer-director and writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns focus on two soldiers (Dean-Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Blake and George Mackey as Lance Corporal Schofield) commissioned to travel with a general's letter to save 1600 men doomed to be massacred by retreating Germans, who have faked retreat.The remarkably continuous shot has iconic Roger Deakins' camera snake through the trenches and into the danger of land travel and gives the sense of our accompanying, and none of the sights is pretty. The body-strewn landscape is somewhat sanitized here, but that could be because of the fabulous messenger conceit.
Although dialogue is sparse, the visceral energy of the mise en scene is incomparable. The tension is more than fear of death. It is fear that the young soldiers will not get to their comrades in time to stop them from advancing to an ambush.Although a couple of incidents along the away feel contrived to bring the drama to a more traditional level, the overall brilliance is cinema verité-a gut level dread that mirrors the horror felt by the two couriers. Their devotion to each other echoes the dedication of the armies to end the war to end all wars.You may cry at the reality of real war or at the decision to make this best movie of the year, but you will not be sorry to see one of the best film experiences of 2019."
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"Saw many war pictures and each have a different take, and story with each director filming a different way. This War War 1take ""1917"" from director Sam Mendes is a single camera gazed straight shot that has a focus of travel and journey that being the destination of two British soldiers. The background shows war is hell as along the path you see dead rats and human remains like skeletons caked in the mud all sacrificed from blood and glory. Both soldiers have been dispatched to deliver an urgent message to some other 1600 soldiers that being a trap by the Germans. So maybe the British might rethink about a war attack otherwise.Thru the journey you see the village of war is a no man's land from booby traps to riverbanks alone. Still the two have hope even though fear and doubt is forever present. The film is moving it really holds as the images stick in your mind along with this journey as the images and travels speak a message of emotions as it's clear this work has it's images to speak louder than words."
1917,20 February 2020,7/10,"Right at the beginning of the credits, the story is kind of explained because there is a WW1 vet mentioned as the source of the tale. The Director Sam Mendes wrote this movie with a woman who has the hottest looking pictures on IMDB for a writer. While she has written other movies and TV, this is Sam's first movie writing. The film is technically great but this explains a bit about why the story is a bit like Paul Bunyon, a General relying on 2 people to take important orders to the front lines army charging into a trap.This story is the reverse of Saving Private Ryan, instead of trying to make rescue a family member, this story sends both brothers into harms way.Story wise it is written for maximum dramatic effect. It accomplishes that. The direction by the director of Skyfall (one of the better Bond films in recent years) is quite capable. The story rarely bogs down and the film moves along pretty well. The actors could have done better if the story had been based upon a real story. Instead we get a toned down version of a vets embellished story which does not all the actors to really develop their roles.Considering the 2 guys in a hurry with the General's urgent orders, their detour into the bowels of the abandoned German trench and rat triggering the trip wire explosion makes little sense. The life saving is the reason for it, dramatic, but should not have been needed. Embellishing one character to make it more dramatic is the accomplishment.As much as the story is off, the film looks good and packs a dramatic power. That and the visual looks get me to rate it okay. So far this expensive film is a loser at the box office. Unless there are some scenes cut from the film to fill in the glaring gaps in character development, it's unlikely this film will break even until it hits DVD, maybe. There were 5 of us in the theater for an evening show."
1917,30 June 2021,9/10,"This movie is spot-on, I say as I yearn for tea. Probably my favorite war movie I've ever seen, but that's not saying too much since it's my least favorite genre. And that said, I have enjoyed quite a few dozen. But, while this one is (mostly) predictable, it was an incredible marvel at filmmaking, score, acting, visuals, sets, costumes and depth. Yeah, this is definitely a tear-jerker. While, I'm glad PARASITE won Best Picture over 1917, this would've been my selection had this come out one year later."
1917,12 April 2020,9/10,"1917 is a powerful, riveting film about two soldiers undertaking a brutal mission to prevent a massacre. From what I've read it's historically unrealistic, but it feels real in its portrayal of heroism that less about being a hero and more about doing the job you're expected to do (although yes, it gets pretty hero-y as it goes along.The movie is shot as though it's one continuous take, and while this is distracting in that my ex-film-student brain couldn't stop looking for the seams (basically the places where there are no people on screen), it also keeps things very immediate."
1917,10 April 2020,8/10,"1) i am so mad at myself for not watching this in theaters. i'm generally not a fan of war movies. if i knew, i may have watched it twice in IMAX2) i generally prefer not to take myself out of the movie by thinking about the film-making, at least not the first time i watch something. but in this movie, i was doing that half the time. and i loved it. i marveled at it. i was baffled by it. i even yelled at the screen a couple times. how did they do that? what am i watching? i don't understand. it's amazing. reminded me of how i felt about the revenant, altho that focused more on the cinematography and atmosphere whereas this was weighed heavier on the directing techniques. both movies were great in all of those areas3) we've seen the ""simulated"" one-shot used in other movies, namely birdman. but i don't think it's ever been this good. i couldn't tell half the time. or other times i would catch it and still not understand how they were able to do it. even without the tricks, the takes were SO long. some of the stuff they were able to pull off is nothing short of remarkable.4) basically everything else in this movie was great. the acting was fantastic (can't believe that was tommen from GoT). the music was amazing. the emotional weight you feel. the cinematography... wow. and of course, the direction. well done on all counts (1 viewing, 4/9/2020)"
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningApril, 1917. World War One is drawing to a close, but the odds are no less tense. In the trenches, on the Western Front, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are stationed, serving in their unit. Blake finds himself summoned to General Erinmore (Colin Firth) who asks him to choose someone to accompany him on a mission to stop another unit, which includes his brother, from launching an attack, which will benefit the Germans. Selecting Schofield for a seemingly easy mission, the pair find themselves thrust into a terrifying battle for survival.Here, as we are, in the early part of the twenty first century, living in turbulent and unpredictable times, where no one can be certain what will happen or what's around the corner, many of us will carry on our lives, sparing nowhere near as much thought as we should for the terrible sacrifices and hardships that were suffered for us to have the life we have today. And so, renowned director Sam Mendes transports us back over a century, when these events were in full swing, and sweeps us up right in the heart of the horrors of the battlefield, with a unique and trailblazing style that absorbs you in ways you can't imagine.So, yes, more on that ground breaking style. Mendes shoots his feature in one long, continuous take for the duration of the feature, keeping us in the heart of the travails of our lead protagonists, and their inner conflicts, struggles and demons as they embark on their dangerous and uncertain mission. They amble on, stomaching the horrors of the battlefield with as much humour and resilience as they can, their relative calm punctuated by the sudden, cruel loud blast of a mortar shell or elaborately hidden enemy device. Newcomers (or, at least, relative newcomers) Chapman and MacKay in the leads deliver their roles with conviction and power, with solid support from established older co stars such as Firth and Daniel Mays.An accomplished, seasoned (and still fairly young) director applies his talent and professionalism and has delivered one of the most surprising, absorbing and breath taking films of modern times, as well as a brilliant testament to the horrors suffered to give us our freedom. With any justice, it'll sweep the Oscars. *****"
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"'1917 (2019)' is an exercise in suspense. As its two leads creep across an increasingly deserted 'no man's land', the music ebbing and flowing with each carefully placed step, the unseen threat of sudden death looms. It's constantly moving forward, yet manages to balance action and character incredibly well. It ebbs and flows, often moving straight from quiet contemplation to ear-rattling battle, and it's - more often than not - truly gripping. It's also unexpectedly affecting, tugging at your heart on more than one occasion. Of course, the thing on everyone's lips is its almost 'one take' appearance, crafted using clever camera-work and subtle visual effects. It is, undoubtedly, impressive. It hurts the flick almost as much as it hurts it, though. Sometimes, it creates a nearly unparalleled sense of immersion, wrapping you in an edge-of-your-seat fight for survival set over one hundred years ago. Elsewhere, it distances you from the narrative, more technically impressive than actually necessary; I find myself trying to figure out exactly how each 'hidden take' is achieved, with the answer typically being more spectacular than anticipated. Still, the experience is an absolute feat of film-making prowess. It's exciting, tense, stunning and sad, its story more poignant than you'd think possible for such a technically focused affair. It would be spectacular even if it didn't have a 'one take' appearance. 8/10"
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,"Apart from the 'Will it, Won't it win Best Picture', the main talking point regarding ""1917"" is the fact that it was filmed in a single take, though of course it wasn't. Mendes shot the film in a number of seamless takes that give the impression the whole thing is happening in real time with only one obvious break midway through when the screen goes black to signify the passage of time from day to night; otherwise, all the events we see would seem to take place over the film's two hour running time and that's where my problem with the picture lies.""1917"" is an exciting, technically brilliant picture but it's also unbelievable. What happens to the characters in this film might happen to them over the course of a day or two, a week perhaps or possibly a year but what happens to George MacKay, (never really off the screen in this film), in two hours is very hard to take. Okay, perhaps I'm being picky; it's only a film after all and what we're seeing is several stories stitched together to form the events of a single day but it's still a cheat, a brilliant but unnecessary display of technical virtuosity. Watching ""1917"" I kept thinking, 'Do we really need to do something just because we can?' For me, ""1917"" would have been a much better film had it been done in the old-fashioned conventional way with the action spread over several days.So what's it about, this 'one-take masterpiece' that's neither one-take nor a masterpiece? Well, to prevent a massace of around 1600 troops two young soldiers must make their way behind enemy lines and warn a particular colonel to call off a planned assault; it's as simple as that and to make this an 'exciting' picture all sorts of superbly filmed misfortunes befall them.You might call it a director's picture since Mendes engineers everything brilliantly but it's like a massive stage production with everything designed down to the tiniest detail rather than seeming in any way 'real', (let's just call it 'the theatre of war'). It's certainly a cinematographer's film and Roger Deakins will justly deserve the Oscar he's going to win for shooting it and in the case of George MacKay you might even say it's an actor's picture. He's superb and on the strength of this alone I predict a real future for him, (otherwise too many well-known faces flit across the screen in the manner of ""Oh, What a Lovely War"" or ""The Longest Day""). Of course, a lot of people have been blown away by it or maybe they've just been blown away by the hype. Personally, I didn't buy it."
1917,30 January 2021,8/10,"It was even better than I've thought. Very intense movie, I liked this one more than Dunkirk. Dunkirk was lack of emotions, it didn't show view from first perspective. This film had lots of emotions, I liked plot, maybe it has less visuals than Dunkirk but that's not most important thing. I would really recommend to watch it for action and war movies lovers. Strong 8 from me."
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"I'm afraid that I saw yesterday the movie that will win the Academy Award for Best Movie this season. I wrote that 'I'm afraid' because '1917' directed by Sam Mendes is an extremely technically ingenious film, impressive in cinematography, and belongs to one of the thematic categories loved by the members of the Academy. I could not help but be impressed by the visual aspects of this film. But I didn't feel any emotion, no special interest and no intellectual challenge when watching the movie. In a season blessed with many interesting, original and exciting films, '1917' risks to steal the show and the big prizes - Best Director and Best Film - as it already happened at the Golden Globes. If it happens at the Academy Awards, in my opinion, it will be a shame.The story is between simple and simplistic. Two English corporals from the First World War trenches are sent on an almost suicidal mission to communicate to an isolated division the order of cancellation of an attack that would have attracted 1600 British soldiers in a tactical trap set up by the German enemies. The lines of communication had been cut, and the English generals had not thought of using aviation (already existing, as will be seen) to convey the message, because otherwise the story of the film would not have had any pretext. The film describes the race against time and death of the two soldiers, in the fields of fire, mud and death of the war.I used the verb 'to describe' but what happens is that the spectators are close witnesses of almost everything that happens during the two hours of action, and the merit is the technical ability to use the long frames (although not really one shot as sometimes advertized) and the close camera perspective. The most appropriate term can be borrowed from the field of virtual reality and it is 'immersive experience'. '1917' represents a formidable immersive and cinematic experience, succeeding in introducing its viewers to the nightmares of the war trenches. However, the action is simplistic as in a trivial action movie, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypes are not avoided, and even the presence of well-known actors in the role of the commanders who send soldiers in the risky mission fails to elevate the film to a human dimension. The comparison with the great war and anti-war films related to ww1 makes no sense. Perhaps also due to the technological promotion of the film, the viewers are prepared to watch the movements of the camera and forget (or have not many reasons) to feel emotion. I think that '1917' deserves the Academy Award for cinematography that it will get. But I'm afraid he'll get a lot more."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"1917, if released before Jan 1, would have easily cracked my top 5 films of the year, and more than likely made it into my top films of the decade list as well. A brilliant display of filmmaking from top to bottom, an emotional ride in a war film that I haven't felt since probably Saving Private Ryan (but Dunkirk may have something to say about that), and simply one of the most visceral movie-going experiences I can ever remember having. The movie barely takes a second to breathe, and its during those few minutes that I often realized how sore my a** was from being stuck in the same viewing position for a good 45 minute stretch. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes deserve a ton of credit for their insistence that the film be presented as if it were one-shot, when in fact it's more than likely around 8-12 long takes. It truly creates an environment in the theater that will be hard to replicate. And even the lead performances and bit parts from well-known actors are extremely well handled and meticulously crafted. Make no mistake, 1917 is an absolute masterpiece.10/10"
1917,30 December 2019,,"This was an intense and expertly crafted film, very much worth your time, not just for the effects but for the impressive sound/score/directing."
1917,22 January 2020,8/10,"The one continuous long take (or seemingly so) comprising most of or an entire picture that I've seen in other movies largely seems to me a gimmick--a technically impressive one, but gimmicky nonetheless. ""Rope"" (1948), Russian Ark"" (2002), ""La Casa Muda"" (2010) and ""Birdman"" (2014), for example. ""1917"" has a reason, or at least a rhyme, for it, though. Basically, the narrative is the inverse of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998): risking and sacrificing the life of one man to save that of many instead of the other way around merely to rescue Matt Damon. There's also the added pressure of preventing a scheduled massacre--the race against time. One shot for one man. One shot for him to save the day. To top it off, the shot ends where it began, as a seemingly unbroken loop, with one soul resting against a tree.So clever is this that I hardly mind that the drama may not be the most arresting, let alone enlightening, I've seen over countless war films, nor that it may not be as moving or as thrilling as I might've expected given the set up. Granted, there is the tree as life motif contrasted with the bodies of dead soldiers and other animals in the polluted war zones and abandoned habitats. The younger brother is knowledgeable about orchards, and these trees also mark the way to accomplish the mission. A similar contrast is made with the scene involving a woman and a baby and the soldiers remembering the families they've left back home.Speaking of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" again, though, that Steven Spielberg masterpiece was a technical marvel in several regards, but largely for the horrific chaos of the opening D-Day sequence, as seen through the eyes of Tom Hanks's character. There, the camera's gaze, as linked with Hanks, was something, too, of a hapless, shell-shocked warrior struggling to make sense out of the war and the mission of risking multiple lives to save but one. ""1917"" shares the symmetry of the camera's gaze being linked with a single character, Schofield. This perspective, however, is unflinching--so much so that it's made to look like a single take (well, except for that brief blackout when the character and the shot itself is shot by a bullet). It's the camera as savior. Note what happens every time Schofield and, thus, the gaze of the cinematographic apparatus, lose track of their partner, Blake. First, he volunteers Schofield for a dangerous mission, and, then, he gets into a fight with other soldiers--twice and with varying degrees of severity--and there's also the trip wire. That two relative non-stars are cast in these lead parts is wise, too, as if to suggest that the lives of their characters are not valued as highly as those of the stars (Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, etc.) marking the path of their journey, let alone the stars who provided a similar purpose within a similar structure in ""Dunkirk"" (2017), or, you know, Hanks and Damon. Regardless, the point is that the point of view suggests early on who the protagonist is and who will be protected. The sixteen-hundred soldiers advancing into a trap can only be rescued when Schofield takes the one-shot to them.And so I'll rank ""1917"" highly because it employs this single technique to effectively harness the power of the cinematic gaze. Someday, perhaps, a picture will come along that will more fully recognize how deep in history the single-shot film belongs, though. ""1917,"" however, does recall the loop aesthetic of early (or even pre-) cinema, by beginning and ending with the same composition--indeed, back when motion pictures were first screened in rotating instruments based on the phenakistiscope, where a spinning series of still images were given the illusion of life. (In this respect, I also like how Schofield looks at still photographs at the end, as did Blake.) Look at one of the so-called ""first"" films, for instance, ""Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory"" (1895); it ends where it began, too, with the gates closed. ""1917"" doesn't actually consist of only one take, though, but is rather compiled to look as though it did by digital editing (and as aided in its effectiveness by a fine score, soundtrack and visual effects). Alfred Hitchcock and company had to move the camera and cut in strategic places for ""Rope,"" on the other hand. Further back still, one of the first filmmakers to create the illusion of multiple takes being but one was Georges Méliès, who reflexively employed such tricks for magical performances. These stop-substitutions gave the illusion of appearances and disappearances, resizings, doublings and other fantastic visions. If the one take continues to grow in popularity as a gimmick, maybe someone along the way will reference Méliès's magic. Until then, ""1917"" succeeds in repurposing the mission of the one-shot film."
1917,28 January 2020,,"On paper, 1917 is a simple, straightforward story of two men journeying into no man's land to deliver an urgent message to an isolated regiment that's heading into the enemy's trap. What makes it an astounding achievement of its genre however are the new technical challenges it undertakes to narrate its story in real time. Conjuring pure magic under Sam Mendes' sophisticated direction, Roger Deakins' immaculate cinematography & Thomas Newman's impeccable score, 1917 is hands down the most immersive cinematic experience of the year."
1917,22 March 2020,8/10,"1917 is a simple story told in a magnificent way. The cinematography is like a well-choreographed dance, moving from scene to scene almost seamlessly. This film tugs at your heartstrings during some parts, then makes you hold your breath during others. Trust me, once this movie starts, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen."
1917,28 August 2021,9/10,"I am very happy to have watched this movie in the cinema. Although it was very simple as a story, it was great as a picture. The plot of the movie is awesome. Congratulations to the editing team."
1917,2 May 2020,4/10,"Positive: Good visuals e.g. the trenches whether accurate or not.
But: Right off the bat I was alerted to potential problems w/some incongruence beginning w/the contemporary hand clasp & quickly followed by everyone without a speck of mud on their clothing. Next the soldiers (and I mean thousands) were all clean shaven. Not a stubble to be seen let alone razors; soap, & water in a barren landscape with not a drop of clean H2O for miles. And, the business of latrines or lack of. Couldn't figure out building miles of trenches nicely braced w/cut lumber; sandbags; wiring & again with no trees or other building resources. Oh, middle of a battlefield to challenge it all.
German soldier predictably was portrayed as nasty; Allied soldiers as nice & helping.
Nice predictable ending."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"A number of times while watching this film (on IMAX 2D) I wondered to myself ""Wow. How did they do that?"" I did not dwell on those moments though, because the film has an insistent pace and is totally immersive.That immersion is due to some of the greatest cinematography and camerawork ever seen on film. Like an unflinching witness, the camera takes the viewer on the odyssey of its two protagonists. It is a seamless technical performance.Director Sam Mendes had a brave vision for this film, inspired by the war stories of his grandfather. He provides a visceral journey through hellish landscapes and labyrinthine obstacles. For me, this is one of the best films of all time."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""1917"" (2019) is a movie during which i constantly said to myself - i have never seen anything like it. And indeed, from a craftsmanship perspective - this movie is visually stuning piece of art. Its not my favorite war movie ever by any means, but its a great entry into war movies genre. It reminded me a bit of ""Come and See"" (USSR masterpiece) regarding its visual style. Directing was amazing as well terrific cinematography - Roger D. deserves another Oscar for this masterpiece of visual telling of a story.Overall, while ""1917"" lacks more character development, its unlike anything i have ever seen (and i saw ""Victoria"", truly done in one shot). This is a great cinema."
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendes has put together a compelling immersive film experience by a seemingly continuous moving camera record of two soldiers assigned the job of saving a battalion of 1,600 soldiers from a German entrapment and potential bloodbath. This is the second major film to provide its audience with a one streaming shot experience, the first being Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Birdman ( 2014). There is a lot to commend here in terms of cinematography reminiscent of some of the best war and survival movies from the best directors in the business, including: Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998), a rescue mission set in World War II Germany and War Horse (2011), an animal story set in cruel trench warfare of World War I; Alejandro G. Iñárritu's The Revenant (2015) a period survival, revenge piece the wilderness; Ron Howard's The Missing (2003) a rugged and stark Western rescue story; Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) a contemporary military rescue effort in war-torn Somalia; Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) a horrifying, intense Vietnam War story; John Ford's, Henry Hathaway's, George Marshall's How The West Was Won (1962), an epic Western classic; John Sturges's The Great Escape (1963) an escape attempt from a notorious World War II prison camp; and even Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006), a story of survival in the perilous jungles of the declining Mayan empire. What is fascinating is the parallel to the breathtaking, pulsating science fiction thriller of Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity (2013) a survival story in outer space. The camera work, the music, the storyline of survival and loss are intense in both these movies. What minor flaws or manipulative script devices that occur in 1917, can be somewhat forgiven: the coincidences of the terrible circumstances and friendly soldiers that may be nearby, a mouse and tripwire, an obvious overlooked advantage the protagonist had in regards to a potential duel with a silhouette who becomes an enemy soldier. Mendes comes close to transforming this movie into but somehow avoids turning it into an extended virtual amusement thrill ride experience. Whether or not this war movie will join the ranks of Black Hawk Down or Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves or Sam Mendes' own war movie Jar Head (2005), only time with time as the technology and cinematography continues to innovate to bring fresh and exciting visual and audio experiences to the audience."
1917,19 March 2020,9/10,"This 2019 motion picture tells the harrowing story of two British World War 1 Tommies soldiers William Schofield (George MacKay) & Thomas Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) who are ordered to deliver a message about a German ambush before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie too much, composer Thomas Newman's music is jaw dropping haunting yet beautiful to listen to. 'The Night Window', 'Gehenna' and 'Sixteen Hundred Men' are some of the best tracks I ever heard in a war movie. Along with that, the visuals by cinematographer Roger Deakins with his crew are epic. They really did capture the perspective of what a soldier from the first world war will go through with the visuals. Everything about the camera work was near perfect. To add onto that the film was so meticulous edited that it really did look like the entire film was shot with one continuous real time seamless take. It's hard to spot where the cuts are. While some people might think that this way of shooting is highly distracting and gimmicky. The long take sequence wasn't too much of a turn off for me. I think that way of filming works within the story as it shows how vast the scale the dangerous journey is and how much time it takes to get place to place in order to save lives. However, the contrived coincidence moments involving the milk and the truck transfer just appearance out of nowhere was kinda jarring. Plus, I would had like to see the film done without the whole black out intermission flash forward sequence. That took me out of the story a bit as I was reminded that I was watching a film rather than real time occurrence but that's nitpicking. If anything, most of sophisticated camera movement was surprisingly smooth for a war movie. Glad to see that they went the spiritualism third person viewpoint rather than the first-person shaking cam look with their plan sequence. You really get to see all the details such as the vast number of extras with historical well-made accurate costume & make up work trapped in a claustrophobia sandbag trench surround by muddled empty field of craters full of corpses, barb wire, and shell cases. Then there is the wore down farm house including the burn out ruins of the urban settling that reminds the audience that the battles of WW1 weren't always fought in nowhere trenches, but also around people's homes. Surprisingly for a war movie, there was a very limited amount of action scenes here. Instead most of the film has the characters move from one upsetting site to other to build fear and suspense. For the most part, it kinda works. I would rather have that rather than a poorly done large CGI battle. The fake looking special feature failure of Schofield jumping off a cliff into a river to escape the Germans was enough to prove that direction would not work. Instead just seeing them scout around was very intense as invisible enemies are always hinted to be nearby. The acting from these two along with the supporting cameos of several seasonal performers like Colin Firth, Mark Strong & Benedict Cumberbatch was top notch. You really do see the anxiety and heart break spill out within their faces. The movie could has work with just the two main characters being silent and letting the body language speak for itself. However, I do get that it might cause the characters to seem more fictional shallow one-dimensional everymen that the audience can put themselves into rather than realistic living breathing human beings. Nevertheless, I felt that most of the dialogue between them could had been more detail. I really didn't get a grasp of who these characters really were. Regardless I did like the small semi conflict between the two over patriotism and just wanting to survive the war. After all, WW1 by contrast was a global conflagration in which nationalism was the spark. While other war movies might pick a patriotic or antiwar side. This movie was just more focus about the goal of enough saving individuals as possible rather than making a political statement for or against war. There is no better example of that than the beautiful reading of Edward Lear 'the Jumblies' poet sequence & the haunting singing of 'I am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger' later on the film. The character at first feels like he is just a wander in a deadly nonsensical world. Until he finds purpose by seeing unsung heroic done by his comrade for the immediate love of the family unit. That's deep character development. We also see this with the symbolism of the white cherry trees throughout the film. They are use to represent both death and life. For example, the cutting of the trees are the first signs of the salt the earth strategy employed in the war, yet the film points out that in the long run it will result in even more cherry trees growing in the area. The movie even opens and closes in a tree of life settling. It's very powerful metaphor. Fortunately, contrary to many other works about World War I, the film makes no attempt to show sympathy with enemy soldiers. Germans troops in the film are portrayal as uncivilized brute killers when in truth, most of them hold the same moral valor and honor as the allies. While the movie does take others artistic liberties such as the mixer of British units when most of them were regionally recruited and weapons like Mark II tank yet to made. For the most part, the film is historical accurate despite most of it was loosely based on various real-life accounts that director and cowriter Sam Mendes's grandfather told him in his youth. Although the screenplay by Krysty Wilson Cairns might be fictional set in a real historical backdrop; '1917' is one film worth fighting in the trenches for. Highly recommended."
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"This film certainly opened with an awful lot of fanfare, and a part of me was intrigued because I do quite like World War I movies. However, for some reason I really couldn't get into this film all that much, but that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't like it, by no means, it just didn't grab me in the same way as some other World War I films have grabbed me.The story is about two young men who are given a mission to cross over enemy lines and to prevent an attack on the Germans that will no doubt meet with failure. This is a little odd though because there were an awful lot of such attacks during the war. In fact, the Colonel at the end of this film does make mention that while this attack has been called off, no doubt sometime in the not too distant future there will be another order which will result in the same number of casualities.The interesting thing about this film is that it appears to have been filmed in one continuous shot. Mind you, it hasn't, it is just that the film has been edited together to make it seem to be the case, though of course doing it in such a way is going to make filming it very difficult indeed, especially when the shots that are being taken take about ten odd minutes each. However, there were a couple of scenes, such as the one in the river, that certainly wouldn't be able to be done if the entire movie was made in one shot (namely because we would have to account for errors and all that).This aspect of the film certainly does give it quite an edge though, and while it took me a little while to work it out, it certainly does have the ability to draw you in, and especially holds you glued to the screen all the way through. The suggestion is that this way it ratchets up the tension, and in a way that certainly works. Further, it doesn't give you enough time to sit back and breathe.While, as I mentioned, that it isn't one of my favourite movies, it still is well worth seeing."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Exhilarating from start to finish, well deserving of the Golden Globe wins! A masterpiece I'm so glad I got to see in RPX. So well filmed with beautiful lighting, suspense, incredible action, and cinematography is top notch. I loved everything about 1917 especially the exciting night sequence and the I'm happy with everything that happens."
1917,17 April 2021,10/10,"There are many excellent films of the first world war, almost without exceptions, but still I must hold this one as the best one I have seen. It is perfectly realistic all the way, everything is convincing, this is as far from Hollywood you could possibly come, and yet, for all its realism of bloody terror and deaths without numbers and shocking tragedies all the way, there are tremendous moments of beauty, the cinematography is more than perfect all the way, with neckbreaking contrasts between tragedy and humour, nightmare horrors and beauty, while the sequence from the burning city in the night stands out in an almost Tarkovsky-like splendor of magic and wonder, while perhaps the most unforgettable episode is the curious story of the milk, the woman and her unknown baby. In brief, this will stand out for all time."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"I just got out of 1917.I have to say the one continuous shot thing, really does work, and I certainly never noticed the cuts. It's a simple story, but it's done in a way that you are always invested. I found myself looking out in the background for the enemy. There isn't much gunplay in this movie, so don't go in expecting a Saving Private Ryan. Although something happened and I jumped out of my skin. In fact I was on edge a lot of the time during this movie, you never feel like they are safe.The cinematography is great, I just looked and it's the same guy who won the Oscar for Blade Runner 2049. I expect him to be nominated again here. The acting (especially the two leads Dean Charles Chapman and George McKay) is great from all concerned too.I have a few gripes, the two main soldiers are pretty naive when it comes to the enemy, they are either trying to help injured Germans, or don't kill them when the have the chance!! Only for the Germans to try and kill them first chance they get.I'm surprised this won best picture at the Golden Globes, as for me it is not better than Joker, The Irishman or Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen, it deserves it."
1917,24 January 2020,,"This movie offers superb demonstration of techniques in film-making: camera movement, light and shade, editing etc. However, attempts to compare it with ""Saving Private Ryan"" are shallow and hollow. While both depict the ordeal experienced by soldiers in war, ""1917"" is one-note, focusing on a single protagonist whose character is quite ordinary. ""Private Ryan"" offers a rich collection of various characters with depth. As to daring the audience with the raw brutality of war, ""Private Ryan"" needs no copycat. ""1917"" is not even trying to replicate ""Private Ryan"" as some shallow critics suggest. Compared with the agony of a dying young soldier caressing his own spilled guts weeping for mom, a few bleached corpses in ""1917"" look like Disney.The story line is simple. The Germans have laid a trap to lure an Allie troop to mount an assault, when they will be massacred. Two soldiers are sent by a general to brave no man's land to give warning to the commander to avert disaster. One of them dies saving the life of the other. The survivor's Odyssey-like journey culminates in accomplishing the mission thereby saving the life of thousands of soldiers. The tragic ending note is his finding his deceased companion's brother (a member of the troop he just saved) and passing on the sad news.Playing the lead protagonist, relatively unknown George MacKay has turned in a solid performance as the Lance Corporal who is charged with the mission. Of the stellarr cameos, three stand out in particular. Bookending the movie are Colin Firth as the General who dispatches the order to stand down and Benedict Cumberbatch as the Colonel receiving it. Richard Madden plays the Lieutenant, the brother of the deceased companion of the protagonist, in a most poignant scene at the very end of the movie."
1917,10 March 2020,8/10,"Well, this was a very different war movie! Much of the film works only because of the stunning camera work and cinematography, and great acting by Dean-Charles Chapman. The film has a great production design and hauntingly beautiful score. It is also visually stunning. There's a scene where he wanders through the ruins of a city, being lit only by bombs going off in the distance - and it is an absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing scene. '1917' is filled with spectacular scenes.This is one of those rare movies I can't really fault in any way, although it probably won't go down as one of my favorite films. Every scene was done to perfection and the film flows effortlessly and beautifully. I only have praise for this film.
'1917' is a moving drama about friendship, loyalty and determination against all odds."
1917,1 June 2020,8/10,"The filmmakers really went all-out on this one. The journey is very absorbing and makes you feel the struggles and horrors of war. There is plenty of impressive visuals, a constant sense of danger and disgusting gory dead bodies. The only downside is that the story and character are lacking. This film is more of an ""experience"" than a fully fleshed out narrative."
1917,25 February 2020,8/10,"""1917"" is a Drama - War movie in which we watch two soldiers trying to deliver a message and stop an upcoming of 1,600 men because it's a trap. It's a war movie which is based on true events and shows us the true face of war.I enjoyed this movie because it had a lot of suspense and action. There were many great scenes that left me speechless and it was obvious that Sam Mendes did a great job on the direction of this movie. Regarding the interpretations, George MacKay who played as Lance Corporal Schofield was simply amazing and Dean-Charles Chapman who played as Lance Corporal Blake was good too."
1917,16 January 2020,8/10,"1917 (4 out of 5 stars).1917 is one of a king epic war film which puts you right with the characters Will (George MacKay) and Tom (Dean-Charles Chapman) as they travel through the battlefield. Director Sam Mendes is trying to achieve something with his direction, long camera shot continuation, and a wonderful music score by Thomas Newman. The film does well in capturing the realism and raw tone of war. The silence in walking through a mineshaft. The enemy firing at you and hearing the bullet ricocheting. Or an enemy charging at you. The audience is put right next to these soldiers as they cross enemy territory.The plot follows Will and Tom as they are assigned by their captain to cross no mans land and to warn the other battalion that they are about to fall into a trap from their enemy. It is a race against time that they will have to walk a far distance in less than a day. While watching out and avoiding their enemy.Director Sam Mendes does well in capturing a still camera shot. Mendes does not over do it like other action film directors with adding a lot of unnecessary action or explosions. He does capture the realism and raw tone of the movie. I like that he is trying to break the ground barrier with a one long continuation shot with the camera. Sure, there may be a scene cut somewhere. The editors did a great job in keeping the camera shots and direction very coherent without breaking away from a scene. It is kind of distracting. It works great with the movie. The opening scene following Will and Tom from their captain being told their assignment. To walking through the trenches around the soldiers. The cinematography by Roger Deakins did a great job in following these characters. And capturing the production set with torn down villages. Or a gritty aftermath of the battlefield with corpses on barb wires. It is just impressive. Lee Smith editing was well done in keeping the one long shot focused.The music score by Thomas Newman was beautifully done and haunting in a way. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman were also good with their characters. We learn a little about them as they talk about their history as they walk through no mans land. Plus there are other actors in here with a small appearance like Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Claire Duburcq, Richard Madden, and Benedict Cumberbatch.My one issue with the film which I dislike about it is the pacing. It is nice to see a one shot sequence with the cinematography following the characters without cutting scene to another. Basically, you're with the characters every foot step they make. Which is cool and all but it does get a little slow when they walking a long way in a field or come to a complete pause.Overall, 1917 is a good war film done by Sam Mendes and his sharp beautiful direction. With a good music composer, editor, cinematography, and cast. It is one film that is worth seeing on the big screen."
1917,27 January 2020,7/10,"From the very first frame of ""1917"", it is abundantly clear that the film is going to hang its hat on cinematography and technical prowess. Truth be told, that aspect is indeed so good that I'd never consider dropping it below the seven stars I gave it. That being said, I really can't vault it into the stratosphere of my celluloid favorites either, due to it being relatively short in the plot department.For a very basic overview, ""1917"" tells the story of two British WWI soldiers who are tasked with relaying a very important message to an adjacent line: the Germans are not retreating, but instead regrouping for a trap. So, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) set off across the dangerous French countryside to relay the message. Along the way, they encounter numerous obstacles and meet a string of individuals both friend and foe. Adding further emotional stakes to the proceedings is the fact that Blake's brother is one of the soldiers about to be sent over the trench and into the trap.There is absolutely no doubt that the visuals here are splendid. Noted cinematographer Roger Deakins truly does work his magic. Whether running through the trenches, navigating the muddy quagmires of no-man's land, or simply traversing the countryside, this truly is a sight to behold. Of course, the thing everyone is talking about is how the film looks like one long take (not true, of course, but expertly camouflaged). While I found that to be technically more of a ""gimmick"" than anything, it does structurally provide the forward momentum that a film like ""1917"" needs.Which, actually, brings me to why this movie will never be one of my favorites. Perhaps this is as much personal preference as anything, but I just need more plot ""meat"" to sink my teeth into. Because the characters are always rushing forward on some urgent task or plight, there are precious few times to stop and really be at all introspective about what is happening. This isn't so much noticed ""in the moment"" when the action is hot-and-heavy, but upon conclusion my thoughts rolled more towards ""what am I actually taking away from this experience?"", with (unfortunately) the answer being ""not all that much"" in terms of overall plot/themes.So, the way I see ""1917"" is that if it doesn't win all or most of the technical or cinematography awards at the Oscars, it will be a shame. But is it in the territory of Best Picture? I would argue no...there just isn't enough substance to take that leap."
1917,9 January 2020,10/10,"If there was some form of MVP award for cinematic achievements that had taken place over the last 12 months, I'm positive that many would agree a worthy winner of one such award would be legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose work here alongside director Sam Mendes on 1917 is some of the most technically marvelous and creative that you're ever likely to see in the movie making medium.Sharing more in common with fellow war set thriller Dunkirk than more traditional war films such as Hacksaw Ridge or Saving Private Ryan, 1917 sees Mendes and his team of behind the scenes superstars and on-song actors unleash a rather simplistic men on a mission type race against time pulse racer that becomes something truely special thanks to the craftmanship on show that is of the highest order you'd ever hope to see.Much fuss has been made already before 1917 was ever released concerning it's one shot like execution, a magic trick of sorts that ensures viewers are gripped from the moment we join Dean-Charles Chapman's and George MacKay's British Lance Corporal in the muddy and body filled tranches of Europe in World War 1 as they are tasked with going behind enemy lines to deliver a life changing message to a certain death bound battalion of English soldiers.It's a directional and design choice that might on paper seem gimmicky or even distracting in theory but Mendes and Deakins employ it in such a way in 1917 that is captivating without ever being in any way, shape or form a decision that feels cocky or unwarranted.There are many moments throughout this cinematic marvel where your jaw will lay agasp at what you have just witnessed, a frantic run across a battle field or foot race through a German occupied broken cityscape just some such occurances, but it's never pulled off in a way that takes us out of the plight of the two Lance Corporals as they face a seemingly insurmountable task.As the two likeable central figures, rising stars Chapman and MacKay both excel in what are both likely to be star making turns and their respective performances are the unsung heroes of the piece that would've been a piece of creative genius but nothing more had these two performers not been able to bring Mendes heartfelt and deceptively emotive tale to life through their important roles.They are at the end of the day both impressive cogs in a feature filled with some of the modern era's finest cinematic construction, a crowning achievement for a director and his cinematographer who have both enhanced their already glowing reputations with this unforgettable exercise.Final Say -A war set thriller that is alive with energy, heart and technical wizardry, 1917 is a mind blowingly good cinematic creation that will be a deserving Oscar king should the cards fall that way on Hollywood's night of nights. A must watch on the biggest screen available to your viewing needs.5 milk filled canteens out of 5"
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Surprisingly there's a lot of fake 9 and 10's, but even worse there are the idiots who gave a film of this production value and caliber 1 and 2's.I will say, I've rated over 1000 films and reviewed 800+, and the directing and cinematography were both perfection in 1917. The 1-take style was incredible. The first time I saw something similar was Birdman, but I hated it in such small quarters as it made me nauseous and dizzy, and there really was no point to do that. But in a film like this that is outdoors with such long detailed sets, it was perfection. It makes you wonder if it's even possible to pull off, yet here it is. The acting was outstanding and helped with the tension and suspense even though the camera never left its targets. The score was also perfect. Although the pacing was good, the story only had a few ""wow"" moments, thus making the 119 min run time feel much longer. I would've have liked to see less trenches - albeit magnificently put together, and more of anything else. Nevertheless, the sets were spectacular. I'd normally give a story like this a 6 or 7, but 1 stars added for the great sets, and the unique and captivating directing and cinematography, thus a well deserved and honest 8/10 from me."
1917,26 August 2020,5/10,"Review:
Now I know that a lot of people think that this is a cinematic masterpiece and that Sam Mendes deserves every award under the sun, but I personally think that it is just a toned-down version of Saving Private Ryan with some dull actors. There are some A-listers popping in and out of the film, but the main character, Schofield (George MacKay) didn't have any screen charisma. I know that it was made to look like it was one shot, which was extremely clever, and an amazing achievement from Sam Mendes, but I personally think that the film wasn't anything that we haven't seen before. I appreciate the amazing effort that was put into the timing of each scene, which must have been difficult to achieve because of the flow of the film, but from an entertainment point of view, I did drift off a couple of times. If they had put an actor in the same category as Tom Hanks, then I would have agreed with the critics and a lot of the viewers, but I honestly can say that I wasn't in a rush to watch the movie again, once it had finished. It felt like a bit of an anti-climax when Schofield reached his destination, after everything that he had been through, and Cumberbatch made it clear how he felt about his presence. That's the main difference between this film and Saving Private Ryan. They actually fought together to get out of the mess they were in, once they reached their destination. I know that Schofield saved many life's by delivering the message but I was expecting fireworks at the end. Anyway, I'll give Sam Mendes props for the cinematography, but there are better war films out there. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Sam Mendes, who also brought you American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Away We Go, Skyfall and Spectre. 1917 won an Oscar for Cinematography, Visual Effects and Sound Mixing, along with a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Original Score and Best Director. It was tipped to win the Best Picture Oscar, but it was beaten at the post by Parasite, which I am yet to see. It was inspired by Sam Mendes grandfather's experiences in WWI: ""The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991"", so it really came from the heart. It took the actors 6 months to rehearse the movie, mainly because of the timing of the shoots, and with over 40 awards for cinematography, it's clear that it's getting recognition, more for the filming than the content.Budget: $95million
Worldwide Gross: $384millionGenre: Drama, War
Cast: George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Daniel Mays, Colin Firth, Pip Carter, Andy Apollo, Paul Tinto, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. 5/10"
1917,15 January 2020,5/10,"Overpraised like Dunkirk. All the time you just hear (or read) that the movie was made with an one shot approach/method but this is just a technical question and makes no good movie itself.
Compared to Paths of Glory (1957) or All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) this is not much better (regarding being realistic) like Emmerich's Midway or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, but those at least got some fine and epic action scenes.
All in all: a big Hollywood production with every possible war cliche you can conjure up. Also the sounddesign (drones, ambient noises and melodies) does not fit into the movie at all - and where is the sound of heavy artillery that you can hear for many miles!? To sum it up: no masterpiece, but mildly entertaining."
1917,6 March 2021,7/10,"""1917"" is well produced but its gimmick of having the movie done in one continuous shot doesn't work that well. Sometimes it's cool but more often it's distracting. It took me out of the moment many times. ""1917"" has more than its share of cool moments. There's no denying that. But overall, I found it too show-offy to be really engaging. It often felt like I was watching someone play a video game. ""1917"" does get an E for effort. Maybe I'll like it more the next time I see it."
1917,22 August 2020,4/10,"I know I'm swimming against the tide on this one, but I was really disappointed with 1917.
I get it was shot in a unique way but after a while the novelty wears of and I was left with some characters I failed to invest in or care about.
It's relatively boring and soulless in my opinion.
I truly wish this 'beauty pageant contestant' had something deep and meaningful to say, but NOPE!"
1917,22 January 2020,7/10,"As technically impressive as it is, it should only work to serve the entire larger goal. Mostly, 1917 succeeded, seamlessly & un-distractingly placing us within the mud-covered boots of young men forced into war. At others, I was too focused on it, constantly trying to pinpoint where the ""edit-cheats"" were hiding. Ultimately, it's a war movie more about adrenalin & inspiration that brains or ethics...not bad, I just think I'm more interest in the latter."
1917,4 January 2020,7/10,"1917 is one of better war films of recent years even if it doesnt have a lot of fighting and war ascepts until the end,i would compare this film to dunkirk they both have similiar way to tell story and both films focused more on characters arcs and their journey through hard years and expereicing them,this film has one of best musical scores of year and it dominates scenes and builds them with tension and even despair,also this film is really visually great to look at but that was expected since deakins was cinematographer and his way of filming was very good made and it was used well,my only gripe was the same like in dunkirk that we didnt learned a lot about characters and they felt unexplored,1917 is defienetly one of better films of 2019"
1917,24 April 2020,8/10,"Any bad? Not much, BUT it is ""glorifying"" one of the most hideous wars, with lots of violins and supposedly heroic acts, the way Hollywood typically likes to portray war movies. That's only a minor gripe though. The acting by the unknown leading actors isnt great, but it surely aint terrible either.Suited for families, because there is NONE real war horror to be seen, everything is presented as another exciting action game without disgusting violence, evertything constantly smoothed over by glorious sounding violins.The good; it's indeed a brilliantly photographed movie. Really impressive and deservedly awarded with an Oscar for photography, but NOT for Best Picture. More good: it's a fascinating and thrilling spectacle from start to finish. The masses will love this kind of spectacle Hollywood war movie. I loved it too!The story is simple: 2 soldiers have to sneak through enemy lines to deliver a crucial message that will determine the lives of thousands of British soldiers. Will they get through enemy lines alive?Will I wanna see it again, now I now how the story goes? Yes, because it's a thrilling action adventure, BRILLIANTLY photographed."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"Though I feel a little like War films are going to struggle to find anything new to say, ""1917"" has a pedigree that meant I couldn't let this one pass me by, and it's such a technical marvel that I'm glad that I did.During The Great War, two soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are charged with crossing what was formally no mans land to locate a battalion that is planning to go over the top the following morning. Unbeknownst to the command team at this location, the German's have withdrawn strategically and are setting a trap. Blake is particularly invested in this mission as his brother in part of the battalion due to attack.There was a great choice made to attempt to tell his story is a few cuts as possible, so, for example, the film opens with a good half an hour long scene of the soldiers receiving their orders, making their way along the trenches and across no man's land. It's here that you get a sense of the filmmaking scale, with miles of trenches being dug out and hundreds of extras giving a full impression of how awful conditions would have been for the real soldiers. You also see the skill of camera work, as it moves along the trenches with the guys, before sailing out and around them as they reach more open land.All that technical work though, shouldn't over shadow the central performances from the leads. They're excellent. Both convey that they are best friends, but that they are at different points in their war experience, with Blake more optimistic about heading home than Schofield. The key personnel in the military brass are all played by recognisable actors, Daniel Mays, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch and though they're little more than cameos they're obviously dependable and they all do a good job.Admittedly, away from the strengths, it is another film that has the similar ""War is bad"" message and whilst that's a message that's often worth repeating, it's not a new one. I would also be a little critical of the score, which felt heavy-handed in places - particularly around the ruined town.The positives far outweigh the negatives though for a film that must be the favourite for the Cinematography Oscar at least."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"As ""1917"" (2019 release; 119 min.) opens, we are told it is ""April 6, 1917"", and Lance Corporals Schofield and Blake from the British army are summoned by the General: the two soldiers must deliver an urgent message to 2 battalions who are about to fall into a massive German trap. Blake's brother is among the 1600 soldiers in peril. Off they go, Schofield and Blake. At this point we are less than 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out...Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director-writer-producer Sam Mendes, who brought us the 2 most recent James Bond films, and American Beauty way before that. Here he brings a WWI story to the big screen as it was relayed to him by his grandfather, who served in WWI. I don't want to spoil anything by revealing more of the plot. Instead let me make the following general observations: as the movie opens, we watch as Schofield and Blake walk to the General's camp, get his orders, and get underway, and after a couple of minutes, I realized that all if this was being shown in one continuous take. Then it became 5 min., then 10, then 15 min., and I thought to myself, how much longer can this be just one continuous take? (Sorry, I'm going to to tell you.) The movie is just epic on so many levels. There are some stretches where there is little to no dialogue and it is then how critically important the movie's sound design is. You may recall that in 2018 there was a fabulous documentary called ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" (directed by Peter Jackson), in which WWI archive footage is restored gloriously. And in 2017 there was Christopher Nolan's epic WWII drama ""Dunkirk"". To me ""1917"" recalls both those films in the best possible way. Kudos also to Thomas Newman for the massive original score, which plays almost non-stop during the movie.""1917"" went wide this weekend, and i couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a mid-size theater was pretty much sold out, I am very happy to say. Winning Best Picture and Best Director at last weekend's Golden Globes will only reinforce the strong word-of-mouth this movie surely will generate. I am going on record that this movie will get multiple Oscar nominations (and then win them). If you like an epic war movie, you are in for a treat, and I would readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"Generally the majority of the reviews of 1917 have been positive. But one of the chief arguments against the film among the negative reviews is that somehow director Sam Mendes has sanitized the war-it's described as an ""empty spectacle"" or designed in effect as ""eye candy"" for ""thrill seekers.""
I can only push back against these views as Mendes's ""spectacle"" is meant primarily to be entertaining. How can any film truly depict the horrors of war? By the very nature of cinematic art, there is going to be some distancing and in the case of a film about World War I, what better way to convey (in some measure) the utter pointlessness of that particular conflict then by creating an exciting story of two ""everyman"" soldiers, racing against time to prevent catastrophe?
This whole idea that many of the soldiers' recollections (including Mendes's own grandfather, on whom the film is loosely based) cannot be viewed simply in the context of their sense of adventure, is just plain wrong. As depicted in the film, a certain amount of suppression of feelings had to take place, just so the soldiers could carry on. Hence, 1917 is both a tale of adventure and cautionary tale about war.
1917 also has been edited to suggest one continuous take, as though everything is happening in real time. Whether this is merely a gimmick, or adds to the overall verisimilitude, remains open to debate.
The inciting incident occurs when a General orders Lance Corporal Blake to hand deliver a message to Blake's brother's battalion (miles away), to call off a planned attack on the Germans, who have actually reinforced their position, thus setting a trap for them. Before he finds out the nature of the mission, Blake selects the more cynical Schofield who ends up accompanying him into no-man's land. All we know mainly about Schofield is that he traded a good bottle of wine for a medal he previously received-much to the chagrin of the more straight-laced Blake.
So yes, Blake and Schofield aren't very developed characters but they really don't need to be. Mendes introduces their ""ordinary world"" as the trenches, where they exist most of the time, until being called to attack German positions. The two intrepid soldiers leave the ordinary world when they climb out of the trenches and make their way into no man's land.
There's enough here at least to suggest some of the horrors of World War I including all the dead horses strewn about the bombed out landscape along with masses of rats and dead bodies-their faces eaten away by maggots. You can say that our protagonists are initially tested in the first half of the second act ""call to adventure,"" when they enter abandoned German trenches, which they must navigate through, in order to push forward toward their destination.
Blake's competence as a soldier is highlighted when he saves Schofield after a mouse hits a trip wire causing a tremendous explosion in the trenches which reach underground. It's something unexpected and keeps us glued to the screen.
The midpoint of the film comes early, in another extremely suspenseful scene-a German airplane is shot down and crashes a few feet from Blake and Schofield who have been making their way through an abandoned farmhouse.
Schofield reaches the ""point of no return"" when the German pilot stabs Blake to death after they pull him out of a burning plane. It's another shocking reversal and the mark of good creative screenwriting.
The second half leading to the second act crisis is not as well thought out. Mendes has Schofield picked up by a passing British platoon and illustrates the difficulties of transportation during World War I (a truck gets stuck in the mud and must be extricated) along with an illustration on how soldiers must suppress their feelings in order to function (as the soldiers tell bawdy stories inside the truck, the camera focuses close-up on Schofield, who obviously is trying to contain his emotions, after experiencing the death of Blake, his friend and fellow soldier).
Schofield's dark moment, his second act crisis, involves direct combat with the Germans-first he must pick off a sniper and later, inside a bombed out French town, strangle a German soldier and escape another one, who fires at him incessantly with a rifle.
In between, Schofield provides provisions to a French woman who is caring for an infant-it's a scene designed to show Schofield's humanity and make him more sympathetic. But what about all those shots fired at Schofield during this sequence?-yes he's initially injured by a ricocheting bullet but later all the bullets fired at him, miss their mark!
The improbable escape (which still features a neat, eerily lit town from flares and unattended fires), leads to another improbable (third act) escape, as Schofield must survive a wild trip down the cascading rapids of a river (this scene also proves to be not particularly original).
1917 ends with an exciting climax as Schofield reaches the beleaguered battalion right before they advance on German positions. The way in which he must deliver the general's orders to the company commander, Mackenzie, is riveting and equally poignant when he ends up informing Blake's brother of the sad news of Blake's death.
Not everything in 1917 proves to be completely believable but this is a very solid film which manages to both entertain and (in small measure) convey the horrors of ""the war to end all wars."""
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Is Sam Mendes capable of making a bad film? It seems not because he is yet to do so, and if '1917' is any indication he seems to be getting better as his career goes along. This was one of the most unique films I have ever watched. Filmed to look like one shot, despite the film being nearly two hours long. Just think about that for a moment. The amount of problems and difficulties it must've caused, and yet they fought through the adversity and got it done. The final product is one of the best films of 2019.The one shot isn't just a gimmick either. It adds immensely to the film. It makes everything feel so much more realistic and almost like you're actually a part of the movie. Without even realising it, cuts in films subliminally take you out of the movie. Here that problem doesn't exist. If it wasn't so beautifully made you could be watching a video someone took on an Iphone. There was a point where the characters were in the back of a truck on rough roads and I actually got an overwhelming feeling that I myself needed to put a seat belt on. That might sound silly, but that's an indication of how amazingly well executed this film was.Then to top it off the story is incredibly powerful. It makes no bones about the fact that the war was extremely grim for everyone involved. The film was sad, powerful and tense, often all at once. Finally some superb acting from the entire cast was the icing on the cake. I can't say enough good things about this film, and I would be very happy to see it win Best Picture at the Academy Awards in February."
1917,2 January 2020,9/10,"Although it did not start out that way. It started with this slow burn the used to set up the camera motion that remained constant through the film. If you ever seen Birdman you get the idea. This camera motion helped keep the movie going and full of energy at the same time the angels put us right in the action. We basically saw everything from the point of view of the protagonist.
It seems like all these world war movie have that same cinematic tone. Feels like they just started to invent color in 1917. It's a cool feeling that makes them all match up and I note it makes it easier to conceal certain effects.
Overall, this movie gave good energy and is one of the best war epics I laid eyes on."
1917,28 August 2021,7/10,"1917 (2019) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres upon its release during the pandemic. The storyline follows two men given a critical mission to hand deliver a message to another regimen who thinks they're about to attack the Germans but in reality the Germans know they're coming and are waiting to massacre them. If they don't get the message to the regimen 1,600 men will be massacred. This movie is directed by Sam Mendes (Skyfall) and stars George MacKay (How I Live Now), Dean-Charles Chapman (Before I Go To Sleep), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Daniel Mays (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and Mark Strong (Cruella). The storyline for this is okay but the cinematography, settings and circumstances are well delivered. The scenarios the soldiers have to overcome are intense and well delivered. The constant running, ducking and dodging wasn't as exciting a storyline for me as other war movies like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket or Platoon. Intensity and caring about the characters seemed a step back from those movies. This is still a good movie and worth watching once but isn't the masterpiece of better war related movies. I'd score this a solid 7/10 and recommend seeing it."
1917,29 December 2020,9/10,"Director Sam Mendes has presented us with a gritty grim tale from World War I based on the recollections of his grandfather. He does so without showing a single battle scene. We see British soldiers in the trenches with some ""going over the top: but no actual battles.Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) is summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). His pal Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) accompanies him. The General informs Blake that his brother's regiment, who are poised for an attack on the Germans, will be trapped by the Germans and massacred if they are not warned to stand down in time. The General orders Blake to take a dispatch carrying stand down orders across the battlefield to Col. McKenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) the commanding officer. Schofield goes along.Blake and Schofield travel across a burnt out battle field littered with rotting corpses and rats. Schofield cuts his hand on the barbed wire. They arrive at a German bunker and go inside to inspect it. A booby trap goes off pinning Scofield under a pile of rocks. Blake digs him out in the nick of time and thereby saves his life.Later they come upon a deserted farm where Schofield discovers a pail of fresh milk left behind by the Germans. He fills his canteen. The boys observe an air battle overhead with a German plane being shot down. In one of the most exciting sequences in the film, the German plane plunges toward the earth but manages to head straight towards the boys before crashing. They pull the pilot (Robert Maaser) from the plane. While Schofield goes for water to help the pilot, the pilot stabs Blake. Schofield kills the pilot and the comforts his dying pal. He agrees to proceed with the mission after Blake dies.Schofield is befriended by a passing convoy of British soldiers. They take him along as far as a blown up bridge where he leaves them. A wounded German sniper shoots at Schofield and manages to knock him out when he confronts the dying German. Later in a bombed out town while being pursued by Germans, Schofield takes refuse in a building where meets a young French girl named Lauri (Claire Duburcq) with a young baby. She dresses his wounds and he presents her with his canteen full of much needed milk.After leaving the young woman, Schofield is chased by Germans until he is forced to dive into a raging river. Barely stating afloat he goes over a waterfall and almost drowns. Crawling out over decaying corpses, Schofield manages to come upon the a group of soldiers waiting their orders. It turns out that they are part of a second wave in the planned attack that Schofield has been sent to prevent.After racing through the trenches and across the battlefield, Schofield finally reaches Col. McKenzie. He has to convince the officer of the urgency of his message and...................................................................Director Sam Mendes gives us a grim picture of war in the trenches with it's filth and squalor, burnt out battlefields rotting corpses and of course the rats. Who knew that the next year would bring the Spanish Flu that would kill more people than WWI had."
1917,5 July 2021,9/10,"Two British soldiers, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are sent into no-man's land in a 'race against the clock' carrying orders to another British unit to call off an attack that is suspected of being a trap set by the Germans. There is not a great deal to the story but the production values and cinematography are outstanding, and the cast uniformly excellent. The film both engages and dodges 'war-movie' clichés, is more grim than gruesome, and does a good job of illustrating life in the trenches (but see goof sections for inaccuracies). Recommended."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"As to war dramas, the war itself can be in the foreground (battles, campaigns) or in the background, where small units or individuals are meaningful and their minds and evolvement are dominated by war/military. 1917 is mainly about the latter, with war spinning around personal destinies. The events start running promptly and the journey of 2/1 soldiers is versatile, full of hope and misery, with distress all the time still.All this is captured via talented directing, camerawork, and defined performances, both leading and supporting ones. There are several character actors performing small yet important roles, plus I am sure George MacKay (Lance Corporal William Schofield) will get more significant roles in the future. But, in my vexation, several ""individual"" scenes with Germans involved appeared not to be realistic, they were apparently meant for the twist paving the way for the next steps in the journey (in particular, I have in mind a certain stabbing, a certain shooting and a certain pursuit which ""normally"" could not have taken place). Thus, when rating this film, I should assert that the script includes almost only weaknesses here."
1917,22 March 2020,,"Operation Alberich is underway, and British aerial recon observes that the Imperial German Army has seemingly pulled back from their position on the Western Front. Knowing this to be a strategic withdrawal instead of a full-fledged retreat, two young enlisted men are tasked with a perilous mission to cross no man's land, go deep behind enemy lines, then deliver a crucial order to the Devonshire Regiment that will prevent a massacre. If director Sam Mendes really wanted to pull viewers into the trenches of the first Great War then he succeeded with flying colors: some amazing cinematography, stunning visual effects, and masterful direction with the use of long takes make you feel like you're right in the heart of it, and the realism (and sheer horror) of the battle scenes are overwhelming. A fantastic technical achievement, but startling and emotional as well, with characters you can accompany throughout the entire ordeal. ***½"
1917,20 January 2020,6/10,6/10 - stunning cinematography elevates a rather ordinary war story
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"I saw ""1917"", starring George MacKay-Captain Fantastic, Peter Pan_2003; Dean_Charles Chapman-Blinded By the Light, Game of Thrones_tv; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv and Colin Firth-the Mamma Mia! movies, the Kingsman movies.
This is a WW1 movie that is inspired by the director's grandfather's experiences, 'The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1879_1991'. Sam Mendes is the director and writer, who also directed Spectre, Skyfall and Road to Perdition. The film is shot and edited to make it look like it is one long shot that takes place in real time. It takes place in April of 1917 and follows two British soldiers, George & Dean, who are given an important mission: Get a message to fellow soldiers behind enemy lines that are about to launch an attack against German soldiers. If they fail to notify their fellow soldiers, the Germans will spring a trap on the Allies and over 1,600 men will be massacred, including Dean's brother, Richard. Colin is the General that gives George and Dean their orders and there are several cameos, including Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. The action scenes look great and realistic as George and Dean make their way across enemy territory, determined to succeed in their mission. It is a visceral look at war.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
If you are a war movie fan, you will probably enjoy this one. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"A British regiment is walking into a trap and the only way to reach them is by messenger. It's a long shot and the troopers know it so the commander has wisely chosen Corporal Blake, the brother of a member of the regiment to provide them with incentive to move with haste. His war weary mate's feelings remain mixed.Fix your bayonet and join Corporals Blake and Scofield in a race with death across No Man's Land, April 1917. Without an ounce of let-up 1917 is a film experience like no other with director Sam Mendes seemingly only having to yell action once. Relentlessly paced it gives the audience like our protagonists little time to pause or relax as Mendes infuses every moment with tension, every movement one of unpredictable suspenseful outcome.Dean Charles Chapman and George Mckay as the corporals give powerful performances as they make their way through this macabre obstacle course of death, decay and destrutction. Chafing with resentment at times, they nevertheless have each others backs and commit to the mission.Pantheon cinematographer Roger Deakins simply delivers one rousing image and bravura camera move after the next that plainly states why he is. He along with Mendes and company (editor Lee Smith, production designer Dennis Gassner) have not only made the best film of the year but the best since its ground breaking predecessor Birdman (2014). Falling out of its high velocity synch only once ( a scene with a refugee and child) 1917 is masterful film making that will awe on many levels."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Two young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.There is a lot of beauty in 1917. The war is catastrophic and the casualties are sickening, but it's all presented in this gorgeous light through the intricate eyes of Roger Deakins (cinematography).Bravo Roger Deakins! Thomas Newman's score is gorgeously depressing with this layer of victory sprinkled in for good measure. This is quite possibly the most technically sound film of 2019.1917 is a visual spectacle that is sure to be brought up again and again in the years to come. 9/10"
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"This film recently got nominated for best picture at the Oscars, so I had to see what all the fuss was about and I have now seen 1917 and this is my review of the film.
Main Character
This film actually has two lead characters, relative unknowns George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman and after this film I am sure I will see more performances from them in the future. They are both fantastic in this film and have really good chemistry together, they give very physical performances and you really do care about them as they go on this daring mission. Mackay in particular stands out and gives a memorable performance that was highly impressive.
Supporting Characters
Now this is a hard category for this film as the film truly focuses on these two actors and nobody else, don't get me wrong seeing Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott in entertaining but small roles provides this film with legitimacy and star power. But as mentioned I have to be fair and say this film maybe doesn't do enough with it's supporting characters to make you care about them.
Story
The story is pretty engrossing, the journey that these two people go on is very tense and emotional, you support them all the way and you want to see them succeed. It isn't the most unique story but it makes up for it in how intense it is and how it make you feel a part of their journey and how you are the third man in the group supporting them all the way.Script
The script is very good, obviously the film is very serious and it nails its dramatic dialogue to encapsulate just how dark the situation they are in, though, when used the humour feels appropriate and well placed for a pair of friends travelling together.Style
Now we get onto the star of the film and that is cinematographer Roger Deakins, this is possibly the best looking movie I have ever seen. The film is shot in one continous shot and it feels perfect for this film and allows you to get immersed in this WW1 setting and you feel like you are with the characters. The musical score adds to the drama of the situation and I cannot stress how tense this film is and how it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Overall
This is a fantastic film experience, one of the best war based film in recent memory. Any big film fan needs to see this film mainly for its style and how beautiful it is to watch."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"This is something like a more traditional (and thus for my taste better) version of Dunkirk. The film is as much about what time means in light of death as it is about The Great War. It has an operatic scope. The storyline is sparse and the dialog spartan. But the characters are more clearly defined in this film than Dunkirk. There is a stronger central plot and a better sense of narrative momentum. If you hated Dunkirk but thought maybe the concept could work this is a film to see.In any case I still found the film too technique driven to fully work. The film consists of long takes stitched together to form almost one continuous shot for the entire film. (There is one visible cut in the film, the rest are hidden). This technique-to various degrees-has been used several times already-usually to a better effect. You get it for comedic tone in The Player and Birdman. You also have it used for building tension about survival in Gravity. You have it for meditative effect it The Revenant or for that matter for a shot in Atonement. You have the time thematic application of it in Russian Ark. Having seen this trick a few times now how and where the cuts are hidden can be obvious. I found Mendes' use of the technique distracting. I spent much of the film looking for the seams. In any case I didn't find the long take all that immersive. To often the way the camera switches its general location-i.e. from behind the actors to in front-broke the atmosphere of the film by calling attention to the fact it was a film. It ended up feeling all a little staged.It is a pity. Several sequences are well put together. The two main performances are quite good. The film works in fits and starts. When it works it really works. When it doesn't it really doesn't."
1917,13 March 2020,1/10,"This film start at April 6th, 1917, and two Lance Corporal(Blake and Schofield) talking along the war trench scene! As turnout, this film is about Blake and Schofield need to deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie to stop the war with the German army, because the German army actually lure them into a trap! Entire film full of walking scene of the two main actor! Make the film unwatchable! The film also quite slow and full of boring conversation! All the shooting scene in the film just simply shooting, never create any intense atmosphere! Barely intense scene is, an aircraft crash at Blake and Schofield! Blake kill by the man he save from the aircraft! At the end, Schofield successfully deliver the message to Colonel Mackenzie! Schofield give Blake's locket to his brother! Schofield admiring his photo at the tree! That's it! A super boring war film!"
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"In WW1, 2 soldiers are sent to warn a Colonel across enemy lines not to advance as it's a trap.Apparently filmed in one continuous shot - the camera certainly never leaves the leads' sides - this is unquestionably a towering technical achievement but this close up of our heroes throughout the 2 hours is the problem, in that you yearn to look elsewhere. In addition, the story can only progress through the characters and situations they come across, hence the effect, however touching, is that of chapters in a video game. So much to admire rather than like here, it sets an interesting new approach to story telling, I'm just not convinced that the talent on display or the story stand a chance against all the technical cleverness and trickery."
1917,16 May 2020,9/10,"1917 is a war movie directed by Sam Mendes and stars George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman in the leads with Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch doing important cameos.Whenever you watch a war movie that too the depicting any of the world war you always wanted to see how authentic the movie is shot, not really about the violence and the bloodshed but how innocent lives were lost in the name of pride and glory, the pathetic conditions of war which destroyed many families to feed ego of some maniacs.In terms of authenticity the movie will not disappoint you in fact the movie is shot so accurately that you will realise that you are watching the movie shot in 1917.Sam Mendes is a genius and he again proves with his great direction. The screenplay of the movie will keep your heartbeat going fast. Another strong aspect of Sam Mendes movie is music which is good in this movie.Acting were great and small cameos from few of the great actors is mesmerising. The climax of the movie is emotional and can have your eyes moist.This is probably one of the best war movies of the recent times and a must watch."
1917,13 January 2020,6/10,Solid World War 1 film that looks great and has some great acting.
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"You had Wings as the first great WW1, and it won the first Academy Award for Best Film. And two years later, you had All Quiet on the Western Front, an interesting film based on the perspective of German soldiers. Both of those films richly deserved the award, but you have really not had a great WW2 film since 1930-31. Of course, there was Kubrick's Kirk Douglas anti-war film on WW1, Paths of Glory, but that does not match the scope of this film; a masterpiece of direction and execution of one continuous shot. Almost two hours of perfect movie-making. The acting is superb and the production values and music are letter-perfect. You couldn't make a better film. My pick for Best Picture, although it will get great competition from ""Gems"". Not to be missed."
1917,15 March 2020,7/10,"Excellent cinematography and background score. Great story telling. Thanks to Late Alfred H. Mendes and the stories that he told to his grandson, we got this gem of a movie. Very touching. Very moving. Made me cry. 5/5
Roger Deakins deserved that Oscar!I am a poor wayfaring stranger
I'm travellin' through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I goI'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there, no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home."
1917,10 April 2020,9/10,"Movies like ""1917"" , in all honesty, don't need special treatments and reviews as they speak for themselves, especially, if not recounted by real experiences of combat veterans, making their reviews even more intense and filled with truthful realism.This is a movie, simply told, having a simple but touching story showing the basic horrors of WWI, complete with amazing cinematography, up to the point accompanying music and very good acting from the cast.It is not paced with action packed scenes in its true active form, but keeping showing the visceral emotions that the protagonists and soldiers were experiencing in that period, specifically on 6 April 1917 as they see themselves present and awake in their surrounding minute by minute.It is an homage among countless others to those brave soldiers who have experienced those harrowing times and to the miseries of war in general.As such, it deserves praise & recognition and its story doesn't disappoint a bit and beautifully told."
1917,8 January 2020,,"Easily the Best Picture I've seen this past year - and it wasn't easy. Until this week it was at only two theaters in NYC, so you had to make an effort; it was worth it.After a little time to set the scene, the picture picks up steam and proceeds at break-neck speed to it's climactic ending. It starts right after Cpl. Blake gets his orders; go behind enemy lines and warn his brother's unit that they are walking into a trap, the hook being that Blake would try hard to succeed since his brother was at stake. From this point on it's like a roller coaster ride with no let up. I was exhausted at the end after the ordeal of the story. It's a war picture but it's also a story of survival, like ""The Revenant"".AA Noms could go to George McKay, who i'd never seen before, for Best Actor and for whoever designed the sets - they were perfect as well as authentic. It is a British production which is fitting as Hollywood produces nothing of consequence anymore."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"1917: The trenches are narrow but crowded, some soldiers on one side waiting to go over the top, some crouched on the other side, eating, smoking, crying, in shock, petting a terrier. When you're moving fast through a trench system tempers are short when you bump into troopers, they are likely bereaved of friends, seeing their mates lose limbs. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are on a mission to inform two isolated battalions of the Devonshires to call off an attack due the next morning, the Devons will be advancing into a trap. The stakes are higher for Blake, his brother is in one of the battalions. The messengers cross no mans land, bodies caught on the barbed wire, rats gnawing on corpses, dodging snipers, booby-traps once they reach the abandoned German trenches. Watching an aerial dogfight. This is truly a journey into the heart of darkness for Blake and Schofield.Wonderfully filmed by Roger Deakins in subdued colours with shades of brown, tan, green and khaki predominating as the soldiers progress through the mud and fields. Also some great scenes underground and in shelled out buildings lit by flares. The script is spare but gripping as not just MacKay and Chapman put in great performances; there are also great supporting turns by Mark Strong, Colin Firth , Nabhaan Rizwan and Benedict Cumberbatch. Director/Writer Sam Mendes delivers a film which will remain in your memory long after the final credits roll. 9/10."
1917,10 April 2020,5/10,"The cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen, action is great, but story is full of plot holes. For example: trap bomb exploded near the characters yet they survived without scratches. Or the scene there one of them got stabbed and the place got full of comrades out of nowhere. Whole movie is full of inconsistencies and plot holes."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,The continuous shot really immersed me into the film and the whole thing is shot wonderfully. Excellent cinematography! The technical skill was impressive. Sam Mendes you rocks!!
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,"This year's Best Picture Oscar nominee is a one shot (cuts hidden digitally) journey of a pair of soldiers during WWI trying to get a message to a unit about to engage in an attack which is actually a trap laying in wait. Sam Mendes (Spectre/American Beauty) has co-scripted an ambitious meditation on duty & sacrifice plunging the viewer into the horrors of trench warfare by solely focusing on these 2 comrade in arms (George Mackay, Dean Charles-Chapman) who take on this suicide mission (Chapman's brother is part of the unit they're heading to) when the odds aren't especially great. This visceral quest is felt in almost every frame as the dirt, blood & weirdly flowers engulf the screen making the experience a singular event. Yes one could argue that the sheer propensity of episodes (an enemy plane crash near one of the pair's stops, meeting up w/a French woman caring for an orphaned baby, a sniper attack which needs to be dealt with) may cause some audience members to decry 'come on!' but this may be the most intimate of epics put to screen so relish it while you can. Co-starring some Brit heavy hitters like Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch & Richard Madden."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,Roger Deakins' cinematography and visual style saved 1917 from being just a standard and almost boring movie. All the technical aspects are 10/10 and I would say the story is mostly fine. There were some illogical moments and second half of the movie really dragged. This is just a little weaker Dunkirk.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"I LOVED this experience. I feel like experience is really the way to describe it too. The performances are great but this is so much more about the technical achievement. A ""one-shot"" movie set amidst WWI and all the chaos that comes with it.What it manages to accomplish, as a ""one-shot"" film, is a sense of immersion, tension and investment into these characters that is truly astounding. So impressive that, for the vast majority of the movie, didn't even know the characters' names, which really irritated me in Dunkirk but here I'm so sucked into this world that it doesn't matter.It also doesn't try to romanticize the war like some movies would. This is gritty and hard, a torturous and hellish landscape that scars everyone it touchesThere are a couple of minor issues I did have. Characters, soldiers that don't shoot when confronted by the enemy. That decide to inexplicably aid someone they never should. I'm sure this stuff happens but it felt a little more like a plot necessity than a character choice.I need to see this again. Walking out of the theater I was so stoked. The film has flaws and yet I find myself wanting to rave about it and give it the highest score possible. A second watch might knock it down a smidge but for right now, I'll happily love this one."
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,"The continuous shot is amazing, just make me feel get into the scene. It's a challenge for actors for this shot under normal situation. Nevertheless, it's not a normal situation, it's a war background with all the chasing in tranche and escaping somewhere in the woods, under the waters. Even though it's not one take shot indeed, but the technique adopted is astonishing and the preparation should be lots more than other usual movie. The story itself is straightforward, but the process just make me watch intently. Just hold my breath and exciting for many scenes. Surely will watch 2nd times to see any flaws and details."
1917,27 April 2020,8/10,"I haven't seen many films about WW1, but Sam Mendes WW1 epic is really well done. 1917 is a crowning technical achievement as this film looks and sounds amazing. It was also well performed. While 1917 is not the most action packed war movie, it makes up for it with it's stark realism . 1917 shows the loss of innocence and the horrors of war in a manner not really seen before. This takes you to the battlefield amongst the rats and rotting corpses and drags you through the mud for the first modern war in history and is a grim and harsh tale of survival. This is a slow burn of a cinematic journey, but not one you will soon forget. Very gripping and excellent all around."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"With stunning cinematography, a thrilling narrative, and so much more, 1917 more than feels worthy of being one of the best war films ever made. Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes, the film is everything you would want it to be. At times the pacing may seem to take a dip, but the emotional impact of the characters, is more than enough for you to stick around. The film is also shot beautifully, and makes for by far the most engaging film to grace the screen this year. All actors involved truly give it their all, and all characters seem to truly not only look real but feel real as well. In the end, 1917 is by far a technical achievement, but is also unlike anything we have seenn before in this genre, and is more than able to hold itself to that.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"The storyline about delivering an important message to avoid a massacre is deceptively simple. Blake and Scholfield, two corporals, must go through dangerous territory to reach the battalion where Blake's brother is serving, to avoid 1600 soldiers falling into a German trap.The two embark into a nightmarish mission, during which they both will prove to be outstanding human beings.The tension is palpable throughout their journey, and since they're both nice people, you really feel for them and hope they're going to make it. Nowadays it is increasingly rare to see sympathetic main characters on screen. For that reason only, this movie is a step ahead of all the pretentious ones that patronise their audience.Besides, even if the devastating effects of war are visible and plenty of corpses are scattered on the battlefield, the camera never lingers for cheap shots of horrifying, voyeuristic thrills. Again, a major difference with lots of other war and crime movies.Really hoping that for once and after years of delivering Oscars to politically correct mush, this one will win the well deserved prize."
1917,12 March 2020,9/10,"""1917"" is in essence not about war but finding what is human.Its the simple moving moments of gently rendered humanity, that define this film. It is an anti war film but not one that's overtly lecturing. Instead like ""Come and See"" it shows you what war does to ordinary people and lets you reach your own conclusions.In most other respects this is an uncomplicated film, with a simple story reminiscent of ""Gallipoli"" from the 1980's but painted in more subdued and reverential hues, akin to the the more recent offering, ""Dunkirk"".Perhaps my only criticism, is its a little too generous to the historically callous and often incompetent senior British officer class, who squandered lives needlessly on a daily basis.That said, this remains a masterful work, that joins other great anti war films cast in a similar vein.9/10 from me."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"""1917"" is more an experience than it is a movie; it's as if you're an invisible soldier right there on the battlefield, waking up alongside Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman, ""The King"") and Schoefield (George MacKay, ""Marrowbone""), before you're tasked to carry out the mission with them. I say this film is an experience more than a film because it feels like a virtual WWI experience: you follow these soldiers from the moment they get their mission to the moment their mission comes to an end (however that may be), quite literally never breaking away from them.The film is made to look as if it's two long unbroken shots, and yes, there are hidden cuts throughout the film, and some of them are more obvious than others, but the length of the shots is probably the main draw of this film. It makes it incredibly unique as far as the intensive technical aspects that needed to be coordinated for every shot, but it also gives the film a whole new perspective that doesn't focus so much on the action of war, but instead on the desolation it causes to the surrounding countryside (sort of like Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" or Tarkovsky's ""Ivan's Childhood""). While the story ""1917"" might be incredibly simple, it absolutely makes up for it with it's amazing direction, production design, cinematography, and subtle character development. ""1917"" is far from my favorite film of the year (2019 was a great year for movies), but it's still a 5/5 Star film in terms of sheer ambition and exe!"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is an incredibly immersive war movie that's intense, emotional and harrowing. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay both give incredibly committed performances and have great chemistry. Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott and Richard Madden all give brief but effective performances. It's extremely well paced, consistently extremely engaging throughout. Sam Mendes' direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography is incredible, crafting a film that seamlessly appears as if
it's one continuous take. The music by Thomas Newman is excellent."
1917,30 January 2020,3/10,"All the time I was staring at nothing. It wasn't interesting. There were no women present. There was no human sexuality present as a corruptive presence, but it was a bodily fact that the dripping corpses of the soldiers knew enough wisdom to be teasing the temptive toasts to their amazing friends called the boms at home. Barely did the camera ever leave the sanctuary of wine with mud and water among German bombs and dreams to talk to the dying in what they were doing. I mean, really. How the heck can a little more time of fragments of shellshock under the skin of problem make use of sex in the woods where the challenge for the brother was most likely to find the other although the three years of request coming before we're rejecting his own situation over the other; now where to find but to complain about the nonsense of his wife, embarrassing to recognize a simple tree on the program with her clothes on. Yuck yuck for such a movie."
1917,22 June 2020,10/10,"If I were actually attempting to fill out my 11-20 of a top 20 of all time, Sam Mendes' 1917 would be fighting for a spot. I adore this film. From opening frame to closing fade out, I think this is the work of a masterful voice in complete control of his technical gifts while using extreme intelligence in the use of images and telling an extremely affecting emotional story on top. This is a film I am going to be watching repeatedly over the coming years, and I think I'll be getting more out of it with every viewing.First, the required comment on the ""one take"" stuff. I do think this story could have been told without the gimmick. I think it works marvelously well as it is, and I do not want to change it, but I bemoan the fact that the discussion of the film always seems to revolve around the method. I think it's an easy, low-hanging topic that a lot of people can latch onto and call distracting, seemingly hobbling the movie in their eyes. I wish that conversation didn't have to happen.That being said, the ""one shot"" (it's actually two, but whatever) is executed really well. There are moments where invisible cuts seem kind of obvious (like when Scofield is getting out of the truck, the angle on him from one side of the wipe to the other, hidden by a coat, doesn't feel quite right), but otherwise the technique ends up working best in its biggest and its smallest moments.There are several obvious influences to 1917, but in terms of moments, it's Saving Private Ryan that came to mind first and foremost to me. In my review of Steven Spielberg's masterful World War II film, I said, ""In a movie that has two fantastically large action sequences (D-Day and the Battle at Ramelle), its best moments are very small."" I feel much the same way about 1917. There are two scenes in particular that call that to mind. The first is in the small French town on first, Scofield ducks out of view of the occupying Germans and ends up in a small hidden room with a French woman and a baby. The kind gentleness between Englishman and French woman, her turn of emotions from terror of the new man in front of her to terror for him as he decides to leave and continue his mission, and Scofield's immediate self-sacrifice at the sight of the young child, offering up every piece of food he has as well as some milk he had picked up along the way, is a marvelous quiet little moment. It works almost as a short film unto itself, but it's actually a key part of Scofield's emotional journey. The second moment is the final scene of the film, where Scofield meets Lieutenant Blake and gives him news of his brother. The quiet way both men barely control their emotions demonstrates the power of reserve in film rather than excess.So, the story itself. Word has come that an advanced until of sixteen hundred men are falling into a trap set by the Germans who are performing a feint back into their own territory and readying a much stronger push. In order to head off this disaster, the general sends Lance Corporals Blake and Scofield out to hand deliver a message to the Colonel in charge that orders him to draw back. Blake and Scofield need to advance through No Man's Land to the abandoned enemy trench, across a river, through the small French town of Écoust-Saint-Mein, and to the hidden English position. Without knowing what they're marching into, every step feels like it could be their last. Quiet, relaxing moments are few and far between the extended moments of tension and terror as they question what is right around the next corner.The story is simple enough, but it's the execution that really sets the movie apart. From the beautiful images of the burning French town with Scofield in silhouette to the use of cherry blossoms, the movie is gorgeous. On top of that, it's not just that the movie looks really good, but it uses its images really intelligently. The easiest way to look at that is to point to the structure of images. We start in a green field and we end in another green field, but in between Blake and Scofield march through mud, blood, swim through raging torrents of water, and run through a ruin of a town on fire, feeling quite a bit like Hell. It feels like a descent over the course of that Good Friday, with the nadir coming in the small dark hours between Friday and Saturday. As Scofield gets to the line, desperate to stop the attack before it begins (with obvious echoes of Peter Weir's own masterful film Gallipoli), he jumps out into a green field just as artillery are beginning to rain down on it, starting the process of tearing it apart into the No Man's Land we had previously seen our characters wade through. It's that desecration that Scofield is out to stop as much as saving the lives of the sixteen hundred men. It's a visual reinforcement of the idea central to the story.Scofield's emotional journey, though, is the real center of the film as a whole. When he starts the film, he's recently traded away his medal that he was awarded for fighting at the Somme for a bottle of wine. The idea of glory has been eroded to nothing with him, and it's through Blake that he begins to open his eyes again. That's why the meeting with the French woman is so good. Scofield has made a promise to see the mission through, not because it's his mission but because he's forced himself to adopt Blake's sense of duty and dedication. Almost by osmosis, Scofield has begun to be less cynical towards the fight around him. He goes from, after barely escaping the booby-trapped German line, nearly walking back through No Man's Land to the relative safety of the English line to offering up everything he has to a stranger. It's the enormity of the experiences that he's going through that are changing him, from a close death to a near death experience and finally to the sight of a lone woman with a baby not her own, desperate to survive for just one more day, that pushes his worldview so that by the time he does get up over the lip of the trench to run through those green fields to deliver his message faster, it's a believable moment of selflessness from him.My brain was firing on every cylinder as this movie progressed. It was about the halfway point when I realized I was watching something truly special, something more than just another great movie but something that stood out from the rest of the crowd. I haven't been moved or engaged with a new release like this since Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. Sam Mendes made something absolutely incredible with 1917. We don't seem to get traditional war movies anymore. Instead we get directors who made studios a lot of money in a franchise followed by almost esoteric new takes on warfare. Namely, I'm thinking of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and this. I can't really complain that we're not getting movies about generals pointing out over a field and demanding a flanking maneuver when we're getting stuff like this."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A stunning visual testament to WWI.JIM'S REVIEW: Masterful in its direction and technically impressive, Sam Mendes' war epic, 1917, is a straightforward tale based on actual events about a dangerous mission during WWI. The dialog is minimal as is the character development. It is all action-based storytelling about two young British soldiers trying to stop an ambush behind enemy lines.Those corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) focus on their goal to save lives while risking their own. The film is a series of perilous detours to deliver their message. It's part Saving Private Ryan meets Dunkirk. While it vividly shows the horrors of war and the heroic determination of those in the military, it rarely reaches a level of emotional connection. It is a tad too clinic in its approach with its narrative structure, as we go from one danger to the next. Sure, we care, but not to degree of gravitas that we should feel.Yet what makes this film so unique is the visual sweep of the film. Technically speaking, the imagery is powerful and Roger Deakin's superb cinematography is immersive on a grand scale. 1917 is staged as one continuous tracking shot. The fluidity of camera movement is astonishing and takes the moviegoer directly in the trenches and mud-soaked fields, unlike any other war film.Adding to the tension is Thomas Newman's haunting music score, Lee Smith's precise editing, and Dennis Gassner's production design that brings a sense of stark reality to Mr. Mendes' vision. While his screenplay, co-authored by Krysty Wilson-Cairn, would definitely benefit with stronger use of dialog to build greater interest and further depth of its characters, the visceral rush of the life and death events greatly compensates for this minor deficit.The director also wisely casts his film with unknown actors in the lead roles which provides more authenticity to his storytelling. Mr. Chapman and especially Mr. MacKay are excellent in their roles. They become the human faces of war in their physically demanding parts and most of the film's success depends on their nuanced portrayals. However, the sight of famous British actors in supporting roles like Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, and Andrew Scott undoes that casting decision, despite their fine acting contributions.1917 is a stirring testament to those who shall not grow old, told with extraordinary skill and the utmost respect to these fallen heroes.NOTE: The one shot tracking device has always intrigued filmmakers.
Alfred Hitchcock (Rope), Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange), Orson Welles (Touch of Evil), and Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas) are just a few directors who plied their craft to this gimmick. Now add Sam Mendes to this illustrious group of artisans. 1917 is a memorable filmgoing experience due to his artistry and vision.Rent Peter Jackson's magnificent WWI documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old as a companion piece. Together, they tell the whole story."

A Little Dense
SUMMARY:When it comes to a focus on British history and acting, there is always class injected into the presentation of the movie. In this war movie, that same focus has been curtailed to present the familiar concept of war into a new light. For one thing, this movie is much more about the acting compared to other battle ballads. Chapman and MacKay are fantastic in bringing the young cadets lives to bay, acting as the mirror to Britain's involvement in the war. The turmoil, the dedication, the friendship, and even the courage to face potential death are portrayed beautifully to cover the wide range of emotions involved with serving in the first great war. While we have seen great performances bringing out the nightmare that is war though, 1917 manages to bring a new way of telling the story through the frontier itself. The harsh landscapes, destroyed villages, and lighting are all coordinated to provide the true menace of the war and that beast is often scarier than the fighting itself. Like a Quiet Place, it's the silent nature of the vast landscape that adds the true emotional tensions. And as it all progresses the movie continues to show that artistic approach of capturing all the deep messages, emotion, and angles that come with war. I can't say much to minimize spoilers, but let's just say the mission to deliver the messages changes face and approach various times to display one of the most dynamic approaches to war theater dramas. This even bleeds over into the few fights that show up, trading the flashy Michael Bay sequences for simpler battles that rely on strategy, timing, and fewer shots. It may not be the most jaw dropping battles to date, but it fits so well into the presentation that it adds to that deadliness this film is showing. Finally, the real star is the cinematography. The specials did not lie, the movie is shot beautifully, an almost seemingly continuous shot that immerses you into the experience. You will feel a part of the brigade to deliver the message, and as a result you'll get the full amount of terror, intensity, and other components that they directors wanted, and it's all done with stable camerawork.Yet, this opera also has a few things that did not quite work for me, that while not worth too many point deductions was worth mentioning. First it's not for the faint of heart, as the saying of war is hell is true, those with weak stomach may not handle a few things that are displayed. I can't say much, but just picture the worst part of war and get yourself prepared, a few of which were a little too drawn out for my tastes. Past that warning though, the action junkie in me wanted a little more bang for the buck. I get the realistic approach they were taking, but a little more combat and coordination would have helped spice some things up for me and get the pace moving. While artistic and realistic, I can't lie that the movie is rather dense, relying so much on visuals that it leads to a slower paced war tale. Again, this keeps in time with the artistic nature, but there were some slower parts that had me battling to remain conscious. And when the movie hits about the middle of the film, the dynamic they take sort of uproots what the trailers promised. It's not a bad twist at all and really captivates on the experience of war, but it's just not what I had intended to see.The VERDICT:The rumors about this movie are true, it's an amazing display of war visualization that was able to break free from the traditional war story movie. British acting alongside award winning cinematography are the key components for this film, setting the screen for that wild war frontier where emotions run wilder than the bullets from guns. True, I would have liked a little more war sequences and excitement, and I could have done with a little less dense dialogue, but overall it's a solid movie and worthy of the praise. Again, not for the faint of heart at times, but this reviewer encourages to catch this one in theaters when you can.My scores are:Drama/War: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.5"
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"I don't really care for war movies. With that being said, 1917 was really great. Epic cinematography makes this film feel very original and special. Would recommend to any war-movie lover."
1917,30 November 2020,1/10,"This movie was far more effective when the Australians made it and called it Gallipoli. In that movie, which helped make Mel Gibson a star, the two main characters had revealed backgrounds so we were invested in them. It was a story about two friends who were put into horrific circumstances.Whereas 1917 just sorta starts at the beginning of Act 2, where the two young soldiers are sent on a mission. And frankly, I've been on more harrowing hikes. Although granted, I've never stuck my hand in a rotting corpse.The implausibilities keep piling up, to the point where you just sorta throw up your hands at the audacity of the director. Frankly, I couldn't care less about the single tracking shot conceit. Who cares."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Though the acting here is good, this is most definitely a director's movie. The real star here is the use of the almost constantly moving camera, which is either following from the side or often leading from the front of the characters.Since the main characters are sent, from the opening of the movie, on a DANGEROUS QUEST, this means that they are in almost constant movement across a dangerous terrain - the NE part of France during World War I - that gives the director the chance to keep us in almost constant suspense with that camera movement. In fact, I came to feel, as I watched it, that this movie was like the sort of video game in which the player must traverse a certain area, always on the lookout for things that might jump out at him or otherwise prevent his reaching his goal. But in the end, it is the standard format for almost any adventure, be it The Lord of the Rings or a medieval knight's tale: the hero must traverse dangerous lands in order to prevent a great catastrophe, with only his wits and - in this case - very limited weaponry to defend himself from those who try to stop him.The movie most reminded me of a video game during the moments when it seemed least realistic. Without giving anything away, the main character's encounter with a rapidly-rushing, rock-filled river while still wearing his boots and kit goes far behind the realm of human possibility.There were also a few scenes where the main characters do things that, while they build suspense, would not likely be done by individuals in their situation, like investigating an apparently deserted farmhouse that they do not need to worry about in order to continue their quest.So, in short, though the movie presents itself as functioning in the real world of NE France during World War I, you have to suspend your disbelief on occasion when it enters a sort of fantasyland.Still, the use of the camera is often downright remarkable, as I began by saying, and that carried me beyond such moments and held me to the end."
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"It was September of 1999. I was sitting in a South Bend, IN movie theater watching the domestic dysfunction that is American Beauty. Its director (Sam Mendes) won an Oscar that year and I was thinking to myself, ""this guy might have something"". Cut to twenty years later and Mendes is back with the on the mark yet sometimes tedious, 1917 (my latest review).Sam's 1917 has to do with World War I (hence the title). Two British soldiers named Tom Blake and Will Schofield (played wonderfully by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay) have to deliver a message to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment. Said message is for the Devonshire Regiment to call off a planned attack that could save the lives of 1600 men.Reflecting on 1917, I was reminded of two filming techniques done in two different movies by the same director. The movies in question are The Revenant and Birdman and they are helmed by Mexico City's own Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.Mendes takes a page out of Inarritu's gifted, how-did-they-film-that playbook. He shoots 1917 in almost one continuous take and his camerawork is surrounding, provocative, and completely encircling. The camera is rather a stalker that stalks in panoramic fashion, every single movement by the actors. It's an impressive feat if not a gimmick and you wonder if 1917 would be totally conventional had it not been for Sam's audacious trickery.Wonderment and impeccable dramatic timing aside, 1917 isn't brutally rabid like other war pics. It's also shot low to the ground with its WWI trenches immersing as staunch main characters. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is lush, wide lens-ed, and wholly canvassed. Finally, 1917's ending is the best part because it's a culmination and a journey evoking real vehemence. Will 1917 win some Academy Awards next month? I thinking yeah. Out of ten nominations it sure as heck better. Rating: 3 stars.Of note: Check out the final credits in which you realize that the paternal grandfather of Sam Mendes (Alfred Mendes) actually served in the First World Wars. That is in a word, inspiring."
1917,2 February 2020,8/10,"1917 is a beautifully made film from start to finish. It never waivers in its momentum. The filming techniques are great and capture the mood well. The Direction is great, it scores well in realism. There are no over the top moments and it builds up well. So when we have some pivotal events Mendes shows and allows us to experience moments. There is also an emotional payoff in the end. The acting is top notch and brought home well by a good cast. A truly great film that doesn't try too hard but simply delivers. 8/10"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Set in 1917 during the height of World War I, this one take movie is very well done and tells the story of a man on a mission to deliver a letter to his brother while all the fighting is going on . It's very surreal and I think its gonna win some Oscar's if it ever gets nominated for Oscars."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Seen a screening of this tonight & was locked in from the start.While I'm not a fan of War Films as such but this one was well done & a great watch surprisingly.The film follows 2 soldiers who are crossing enemy lines to deliver a message in the first World War. However, their task is far from easy & plain sailing as they encounter many dangers ahead of them.I found the film to be quite enjoyable. You felt the suspence as you watched because the film was edited in a way to appear as if you're with the soldiers on their perilous journey.Not a bad film & actually one of the best War Films out there.9/10"
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"Even though the film reminds you of the death and futility of the First World War as Kubrick did in his laudable film ""Paths of Glory,"" this Mendes film is reduced to mere war heroics that will please a viewer seeking entertainment without much reflection. The saving grace of this film is that the heroes are the foot soldiers and not the top brass of the military. The music was awful. The script is hilarious (it includes a pail of drinkable milk, with no milkers in sight or likely to be nearby and a single cow (without a calf) grazing--just to prop up the weak plot that allows a soldier to eventually feed milk to a starving infant!"
1917,1 April 2020,4/10,This film had some good points such as the cinematography and the set pieces but apart from that it's just two young soldiers who have to pass a message on. No real story arc just following someone pass a message. That's not a story. I'm not rating it highly because it's to do with war. Don't get sucked in. Weak story.
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"This is an incredibly personal movie. Everything in the picture is designed to make you an intimate witness: the writing, the performances, the cinematography, the editing (or lack thereof), the uniqueness of all the exteriors which never repeat, and it is incredibly effective. You find yourself holding your breath as the action plays out. The seed of this film came from the stories Sam Mendes heard his grandfather tell of his time as a message courier in the First World War. The partnership between Mendes and cinematographer, Roger Deakins, to create the movie as one long shot is award worthy and completely elevates the film above its genre. It's not just a war movie, or an action movie, or a thriller, or a drama. It's all of this things, and more. A truly intimate experience, I give this film a rating of 9 (superb) out of 10."
1917,15 February 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendes took an enormous task to cover with this vast war epic - he decided to show just 24 hours of a war-torn day in 1917, April, through the means of a seemingly uninterrupted endless camera shot so that we could witness the whole event as if through the eyes of a main hero, Lance Corporal William ""Will"" Schofield, here depicted masterfully by George MacKay. Alongside him, there's a whole array of wonderful British actors appearing here and there, such as Mark Strong as Captain Smith or excellent Benedict Cumberbatch as Colonel Mackenzie, or equally superb Colin Firth as General Erinmore.
This technique of a seamless single shot is nothing new, and here we see some obvious edits and cuts, which are not a tragic obstacle. Generally, the movie delivers the message extremely well, with a certain drawback being very obvious - the movie often drags and plods, thus losing much of its certain steam.
Several blatant mistakes and goofs apart, 1917 managed to impress me, but on one thing I surely agree - this was not the Movie of the year."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"Directed by Sam Mendes. Starring George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Colin Firth, Claire Duburcq, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, Benedict Cumberbatch. (R)Two British soldiers (MacKay, Chapman) are given the task of delivering a message across enemy lines to halt an attack that would cost over a thousand lives. Director Mendes' WWI drama cares naught for the politics or grand theater of war, choosing instead to focus on two individuals undertaking one mission covering less than twenty-four hours, with the camera ceaselessly following them in real time. That faux-continuous ""single shot"" gimmick is a distracting one, especially in the early-going; Roger Deakins' photography is sublime as expected, and the technical mastery is undeniable (though some of the edit points are hardly seamless), but the technique trivializes character dimension and the economy of rhythm for the sake of raw, limited experience. Designed to give the viewer a down-and-dirty, firsthand look at the experiences of soldiers, never exceeding its scope beyond what the main characters can see or anticipate, but also never escaping the labors of its own ritual--visually spellbinding at times, appropriately stark and grimy, yet never fully immersive or emotionally engaging. The leads do solid work with little meat written onto the bones besides exhaustion, fear and determination; small roles for recognizable faces do little besides provide faces to recognize.67/100"
1917,31 March 2020,7/10,It was a really goood movie but not to the point of giving it 8
1917,18 September 2021,10/10,"I don't usually review mainstream films and shows but, it has to be said this was so good that I couldn't stop myself from singing it's praises.I usually find the big films to be over-hyped but not in this case.The time just flew by as you felt you were with Schofield and Blake on their journey.It reminds me very much of the BBC mini series Birdsong and the Aussie classic Gallipoli starring a young Mel Gibson.A great story, well executed with brilliant cinematography. I watched it via Netflix.Those that saw it on the big screen must have had a real treat."
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,"And filmed as one shot which means that the action time is almost the same as the projection one. The story is simple but very exciting. In World Wat I it happened that two British soldiers in France are assigned by their general to deliver a message to the colonel commander of a battalion a few miles away who is planning an attack to German positions to profit from German army withdrawal. However this message urges the colonel to stop the attack since the supposed withdrawal of German forces is feigned and intends no more than attracting the British troops to a trap where 1,600 British would be killed. This message is needed because the phone lines had been cut by the Germans. The two men must cross a no man's land to get to the Colonel's battalion. During their journey they are fired at more than once by dispersed German soldiers and that is filmed and shown in admirable images and sequences using often great plans in every detail. The actor's performance is also great. One of the best movies of 2019."
1917,20 July 2021,6/10,"In my opinion this film is a bit overrated because it is true that it has a beautiful photography department, that the acting is excellent and that the style of the director is beautiful, but in my opinion this film is very boring, can not entertain you as it should and so it makes you bored."
1917,14 March 2020,8/10,"1917 is a cinematic triumph in terms of its technicalities, the single-take storytelling style (like in a third-person shooter video-game), and the compelling tale it tells about war, survival, brotherhood, and compassion. Corporals Blake (Chapman) and Schofield (MacKay) are assigned the task of delivering an important, timebound message to another garrison - this story is essentially a race against time for these two young army men, and the camera follows them in real-time.The film seems to have been written keeping this design in mind - it's more of an adventure thriller than a conventional war movie. Roger Deakins offers an immersive experience of the two corporals journeying through hell to save a troop from falling into a German trap. At times, it even becomes difficult to differentiate between real and dreamy - the sets have been marvellously put together, the flare-lit shots look brilliant, and the fluidic feel of the cinematography keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.While it's easy to complain that character development is slightly lacking, there are solidly written scenes that give us insights into the (mindsets of the) protagonist duo - Blake's fellow feeling explained in the plane crash scene where he tries to help a German solider, Schofield's helplessness when he has to leave a woman with a baby behind, and the way both characters deal with pain and loss.The little but significant cameos from Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Benedict Cumberbatch add to the film's strengths. The musical score by Thomas Newman fully supplements Deakins' efforts. Mendes portrays the physicalities of war by holding nothing back - the dirt, the decaying bodies, the ramshackle cottages, and of course, bullets and shelling. I believe Mendes has used his stage directing skills to the fullest in 1917. With long takes and the humongous cast and crew working together in complete sync along the lines of ballet, 1917 is undoubtedly a tremendous effort."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"1917Great MovieIt was refreshing that for once we had a director totally in control of his personal vision, from the script through the production to the directing and editing.A deeply memorable movie for all the right reasonsWhat was goodDespite the over-arching matter of futile warmongering amid the squalor of the trenches the Director chose to put front and centre different themes to explore, mate-ship, grief is a luxury, human resilience, etc.The tone and atmosphere was comprehensive, as with Hacksaw Ridge, we were there in the trenches our viewpoint was that of another soldier and we were forced to confront the horror.The use of humour as a pressure valve, the audience laughed at some macabre incidents, this was very cleverly used.The focus on the bonds that join men together in avarice, no conclusion was given, quite rightly, but it was palpable in its presence.The incredible use of all the cinematic forces as a vehicle to forward the story, we were all engaged, this aspect was greater than the sum of its parts.The score was really quite brilliant, the singing set piece was inspired.The incredible focus of creating believable characters perhaps the triumph of of this movie, when Corporal Blake died we felt grief.What was not so goodThe pacing was slow bordering on stop, however this was entirely intentional.The variety of the images, yes we had some diversion, the farm, the night scene, the cellar, the cherry orchard, the river, perhaps more arial shots or indeed the dog-fight.Lack of redemptive conclusions, Schofield arrived at his personal epiphany but this was not rammed home.With regard to awards, this year was overall a bad year for movies. This is perhaps best of the bunch with Ford v Ferrari a close second."
1917,17 November 2020,8/10,"This film is astonishing on almost every level from start to finish. The continuous camera shot is just on another level, Roger Deakins definitely deserved that Oscar. The attention to detail in a war ridden land is exemplary: The trenches, the underground tunnels, the fallen soldiers, the abandon buildings, and the vast valleys were all spectacular and felt very real, you feel as if you're in the middle of it all. The storyline is engaging enough, the score is amazing as it captured every level of intensity of action scenes and the acting is solid.Overall, A very entertaining, eye pleasing war flick, definitely one of my favorite movies of 2019."
1917,10 January 2020,4/10,"Saw this on January 9 in the theater. I was eager to see it, having seen many, not all, war movies, including recently the much-better film Midway.A quick review of the plot: During the World War, two British corporals are assigned to travel, by foot, through German territory to bring to a colonel, orders to halt an attack that is to begin tomorrow at dawn on April 7, 1917. Almost the entirety of the film deals with soldiers talking as they pass through all sorts of scenery trying to get to the place to deliver the message. They converse, go through abandoned German trenches, encounter numerous rats and dead bodies and occasionally live people, including a fighter pilot they see shot down in a dogfight. If you're looking for great wartime action scenes, look elsewhere.That's really about it. We get to know a tiny bit about the two lead characters, virtually nothing about anyone else. There are plentiful scenes involving soldiers walking and breathing heavily, many dizzifying scenes where the camera pans around a room or an outside scene. I know someone who is sensitive to even TV shows where the camera pans around and believe she would have had real problems with those oft repeated movements during this film.As one reviewer noted, there are many cliche moments in this film, the kinds of things you seem to get in almost every war movie. There are, as others have pointed out, many things that seem highly implausible or unrealistic.Now I loved the TV series Combat, and they definitely had an episode or two that bore a strong resemblance to what this film presents. Only Combat did it in a 50-minute (minus commercials) presentation. Picture this as a three-part Combat. It just seemed to drag along, the same plot, just extended over two full hours.For soldiers in a hurry to get somewhere to deliver a certain message to save the lives of thousands by calling off an attack, our heroes seemed to pause ever five minutes to do things they need not do. They also seemed to veer off course repeatedly, to go through every building close to their route. I kept wanting to call out, ""Quit stopping for tea (actually a milk break) or to look through every building within sight. Just carry on with your mission!""Since this is a fictional film, we viewers are not even learning about an actual World War I battle, nor about the lives of real people. It was a visually stimulating film in terms of the bleak shots of battlefields and trenches and such. But I was just left with a sort-of empty feeling as it was concluding, like, ""So that's all there is to this?""Had it been made in the early 80s, with an ""R"" rating, I imagine I would have heard some mild obscenities (of which we had many here) and a couple of F bombs. Since we are so much more sophisticated today, they must have had at least 65 uses of the ""F"" word, including one non-com who must have used over a dozen in his 2 minutes of screen time. Note to movie producers: You can make a realistic, earthy film without having to weakly resort to cussing nearly as often as this film does. They used to talk about ""gratuitous sex""...this film truly had gratuitous cussing. It didn't advance the plot or develop the characters, it was just there for no purpose.I think my rating of 4 is accurate."
1917,15 March 2021,7/10,Blake and Schofield were assigned to let the commander know about calling off the attack as it would save hundreds of lives because it was a trap which was set up by Germans to lure the Britain soldiers into attacking. The two lance corporals went through rotting dead bodies and rats feeding on them and ended up by a dilapidated abandoned house. The brits downed a german plane and the plane crushed right next to the house and they escaped by the skin of their teeth. Blake wanted to help the injured german pilot and got stabbed by him. It was a lethal wound and he passed away there and a British convoy found the other. He joined them and travelled at the back of a truck until they reached a collapsed bridge. From there on he had to walk as he was racing against time. A soldier was trying to shoot him from a window of the house by the river as he was crossing the river on the railing of the collapsed bridge. He managed to kill him but passed out too as he was injured too. He woke up and continued on walking through the ruins of some buildings. It was rather heart-breaking when he found a young woman and a baby girl hiding in a basement. He gave them all his food and had to kill a german because and had to jump into the turbulent river while trying to run away from the other. He got almost drowned but managed to get out of the water in the forest and find the soldiers of the second battalion. I expected here a more impressive ending but he just walked thru the trench until he found the commander and gave him the letter. He then found the brother of Blake and told him about what had happened. Blake's brother was the worst actor in the movie. Then he sat down leaning against a tree and looked at the picture of his beloved ones. The ending was a bit too anticlimactic as I expected the commander to not comply with the orders and even more but everything went a bit too smooth. All in all I enjoyed it especially the two lance corporals and their acting skills as they are spot-on casts.
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,"Absolutely incredible - I've seen it 3 times in cinemas and each time I find myself even more in awe of, blown away by, and in love with this film. It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. A masterpiece."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"Now that all the glittery dust has settled at the golden globes and 1917 has made away with best picture award and stolen the weekend at the box office with over 37 million I finally got to see it. And guess what it was great. Sam Mendes's execution of the WWI flick is a unique, edge of your seat ride that follows two men as they try and warn a battalion before they fall into an enemy trap. George Mackay of Pride(2014) is our guide through a horrific war torn landscape that's as nightmarish as it is beautiful. The execution makes you feel as if the entire venture is one non stop shot that you're unwillingly participating in. Theres not alot of development character wise and that's definitely a conscious decision but because of that I felt oddly disconnected at times. That being said the first half of the movie has an intense first person flow to it that's almost unbearable at times. But when it finally breaks for air, when our lead comes into contact with a young woman it reminded me I was in a theater. It was a solid scene but definitely broke up the pace. That being said it returns to its anxiety splitting pace not long after. When I say this movie is intense I mean it but it does stop and smell the roses so to speak. It is quiet and inspired. The lead performance from George Mackay is really fantastic and definitely deserves some award attention as does the film which I'm sure will ring it up at the Oscars and deservedly so. From the sweeping but intimate cinematography to the nerve shredding score. Its definitely one of 2019s best."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"1917 was based off Sam Mendes' grandfather's account of the First World War and the film proved to be an unbelievably powerful reflection of the horrors the world faced after Franz Ferdinand's assassination in 1914. You can feel the desperation, angst and terror the soldiers faced at the time: and the film's use of one-shot-takes gives the viewer the impression they're actually there WITH the battalion of British Allied Soldiers. It's ridiculously well-done whilst being very harrowing stuff, and it all really happened (at least the tension around Operation Alberich was firmly rooted in history).This film's like a one-shot Dunkirk but tries capturing the dehumanizing qualities of war from works like All Quiet on the Western Front and War Horse. 1917 is a war movie that gives a new perspective on tried-and-true historical cinema, and it's World War One setting is oddly fitting for today's political dilemmas, mistrust of authority and national interests clashing with the individual soldier being used as a pawn to achieve whatever means to an end. Historical stuff aside, the bunker booby-trap scene with the rat was set up beautifully and the way this film was made gives that scene undiluted tension and fright when you see what happens on-screen. Seriously, that scene might become the stuff of cinematic legend and used as a how-to guide on delivering unexpected shocks from an unlikely place.1917 is pretty damn solid cinema and the direction delivers a lot to the character of the film's story itself: it's one continuous journey that's as relentless as war itself and its immersion is groundbreaking stuff.5/5 stars. It's a great experience with an impactful story."
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,"War dramas are a dime a dozen. This one was cool, but really they all just start to blur the line for me. It was interesting to watch the war from the perspective of two dudes in a single shot type of way. The actual sets or locations were amazing. Dead bodies everywhere and lots of blood.It wasn't anything special, but I really enjoyed myself. It had weird moments too. But it was real good.I would recommend it7 stars"
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,". . . with a vital message during World War One, those viewers in the audience with either cross country or marathoning experience will be sure to brace themselves for the grueling ordeal ahead. The beginning of this WWI trek commences in slow motion, not unlike film footage of the Boston Marathon's annual onset, during which it takes some competitors about half an hour to cross the starting line AFTER officials yell ""Go!"" However, once the corporals get their lances in gear, their quest begins to take on the guise of a cross country event, complete with unexpected obstacles (such as broken bridges or army trucks mired in the mud) and life-threatening narrow escapes. As I grew up, one of my uncles devoted much of our summer visits to regaling us with his foot race ""war stories."" For instance, one time he led the first five miles of a marathon in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, he had started out too fast, and passed out a couple blocks from the finish line--somehow running TWO MILES in the opposite direction and then waking up in the back seat of a Philly police squad car! When ""William"" has the shootout with the German sniper by the broken bridge and is knocked unconscious for several hours, I was reminded of my uncle's experience.
During my relative's NEXT marathon in the City of Brotherly Love, he felt himself beginning to lose it again after 22 miles. Just then a senior citizen veered off the road next to the race course, snapping off a light pole. My uncle dropped out of the race, turned off the geezer's car engine (where the vehicle had come to rest in some bushes) and waited for the Authorities to arrive. In 1917, the lance corporals also face problems created by the arrival of a crashing vehicle (the shot down Prussian plane). My uncle said that during his first marathon, another competitor thought someone hit him in the head with a rock. When this guy finished, he had a stray hunter's bullet lodged in his skull! William finishes his 9K jaunt with several bullets in his body (most of them not so stray!). Then, of course, there's the Boston Marathon Bombing, which runners in the movie theater will instantly think of as the booby trapped bunker begins to explode during 1917. Bottom line: this film illustrates why ALL road racers and cross country harriers--no matter how poor--should be packing heat during their events, so go watch 1917, and then generously support your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps)."
1917,2 April 2020,7/10,I am not fan of War movie so this one didnt impressed me lot.but nice art work and good screenplay..
1917,20 November 2020,10/10,"A quite incredible and powerful war movie. Some people liken it to Saving Private Ryan, but that shows the horror for 40 intense minutes, whereas this movie will affect you far beyond the closing credits. The acting, script and sound are all superb, but the cinematography from Roger Deakins is on another level. A modern day masterpiece."
1917,18 August 2020,8/10,"Visually stunning and moderately engaging story of soldiers who need to transit the weaving front lines to call off a doomed attack. If I got truly sucked into the movie my rating would be a ten and this review would be different, but that never happened for me. Arguably derivative as a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Paths of Glory (a fantastic film), I felt mildly manipulated but far short of the personal invasion felt by watching the detestable War Horse. I just didn't get all the way in for whatever reason, but I would recommend Paths of Glory to anyone who thought this movie was extra special.."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"The first thing that made interested in 1917 was the one-shot cinematography. It got me interested in seeing how exactly can such a film be made. As I watched it yesterday in cinemas, I thought it was a riveting experience. 1917 is an outstanding war/action drama film that pulls you into its tension-filled, action-packed and emotionally captivating atmosphere. It succeeds more on the technical front, to be honest, but it also succeeds in terms of story, performances and overall execution.1917 is more of an action-adventure film set during the World War I. There's plenty of action, and it's accompanied by some really quiet moments that elevate the tension when the action suddenly explodes. Physical stunts, gunfights, explosions and chases: it has got it all, and in a perfectly balanced manner. It also doesn't get loud due to minimal usage of background music: another reason why the film starts feeling more intimate with the viewer. The score, wherever present, is indeed electrifying, especially during the final action scene.George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman are what completes this film. Unlike many war movies where entire armies are the focus of the tale, this one has only got two young men, and that works for it big time. Kudos to Sam Mendes for delivering a spellbinding race-against-time action drama that succeeds in conveying the horrors of war and often, a strong tale of a realistic friendship.1917 needs to be experienced in the highest quality available, and the best way to do so is by watching it at cinemas. It's a film that definitely deserves to win big at the Oscars: something that seems fairly possible given how great this film is. And just one thought: looking at the poster which has 19 and 17 written in separate lines, does it tell something about the two protagonists? Like one is aged 19 and the other is 17? Well, who knows better than the makers themselves?"
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,"I read a headline critical of 1917 right before I saw it, that said something along the lines of 'Does 1917 have anything new to say about war?' I couldn't help but think about this throughout my viewing of the film, and realised pretty early on that no, perhaps it doesn't really have anything 'new' to say.But at the same time, what is there to say about war that hasn't already been said? The personal and psychological experience of the solider, following orders and just trying to survive, is a surprisingly universal one, and has been captured extremely well in many of the past few decades' best war films, including Platoon, Come And See, The Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket. The broader issues of war, breaking it down politically and socially, looking at why nations fight and to what extent they are or are not justified in doing so, and the way things so often spiral out of control are all far more complicated topics to tackle, but someone like Ken Burns has more or less made a career out of doing that through his lengthy documentary miniseries.' So even in that department, it's hard to explicitly say something truly new and unique about the topic of war.This is all preamble to say ultimately it didn't matter to me that 1917 did not have a lot to say beyond how terrible war is, how foolish the higher-ups sending young men off to die are, and how brave some of the individual soldiers on the frontline were for surviving and trying to hold onto their humanity in the process. What 1917 does bring to the table is a new way of putting the audience into the war, capturing the tedium, tension, and horror of what our two main characters go through, largely through the immersive use of numerous long takes strung together to give the illusion of one single, continuous shot.It could be something of a gimmick to some, and I was skeptical in the film's first few scenes just how well this approach would work, but early on, when the camera follows our two main characters crossing No Man's Land, forcing us to experience every painful, tension-filled step along with them, no cuts to ease the tension by showing them suddenly safe and on the other side, I was basically hooked.To give away anymore of the set pieces I feel would be criminal. But even with the scenes in which danger isn't 100% present- the 'downtime' if you will- are often just as engaging and interesting, thanks to a powerful score, consistently great visuals, and two strong lead performances (plus a whole host of recognisable actors popping up in cameos, that honestly weren't too distracting).Very occasionally the writing veered close to being cheesy, and there were a couple of shots involving one character jumping that looked out of place- I think he was composited onto a green screen or CGI was used, because a couple of these stunts didn't look seamless. But these are ultimately nitpicks. By and large, this film as a whole works thrillingly and surprisingly well, and is entirely worth seeing on the big screen.There are images and sequences here that will stick with me for a long time to come. It's not quite my absolute personal favourite of 2019, but if it ends up taking home Best Picture, it'll be deserved."
1917,23 December 2020,7/10,"There's no debating that '1917' is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. With the entire film consisting of only one continuous, uncut scene, it makes for impressive viewing. It will no doubt be remembered for its innovation and breathtaking cinematography.But while '1917' excels in the visuals category, I was left disappointed overall. The problem with creating such a visual feast is that people end up more interested in how the film looks rather than what actually happens it in. It felt like the plot was complementing the visuals a lot of the time rather than the other way round.While '1917' looks fantastic and is well acted and produced, the story failed to grip me, there wasn't enough character development, and there was a serious lack of emotion for a war film."
1917,2 January 2021,6/10,"I liked this oscar movie for showing us real war experience and environment. It reminds us of such important and bad time as world war. It gives us realistic insight into consequences and difficulties of war, like survival, raising kids, suboptimal hygiene and health care. Also emotional, where sadness is appropriate war emotion. But still much less emotional and interesting than Rambo (2008) and it's sequels. I think this is bit worse, more boring, more amateur. and less detailed. Maybe worth an oscar because still war environment is realistic enough, especially graphcs."
1917,1 February 2020,8/10,"Hot on the heels of (the better) Dunkirk comes 1917.There are two distinct chapters to this film: the first half all mud and macabre; the second despair and hallucinatory. In the first half, we have the brown landscapes of trenches and into No Man's Land. The second an orange bombed-out French town.While the two-take structure works well for ramping up the claustrophobia, it comes close to veering into Indiana Jones territory. What saves things, is that you instantly relate to our two heroes, which brings the pay-off at the finale."
1917,1 May 2021,10/10,"For all of the adrenaline rushes and vicarious thrills that can be had with a well-calibrated action/war film, the best ones invariably focus on the human drama instead of mindless carnage. And in the tradition of the best war movies, 1917 does this exceptionally well while still delivering the thrills and tense moments one expects from this type of cinema. I don't remember being this affected by a war movie since probably SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (to which, in a small way, this owes a small debt). When it comes down to it, Marvel and DC and all the others can keep their world-at-stake existential crises because the intimacy and emotional gravitas of personal relationships is where it's at. This is filmmaking on a human scale."
1917,24 June 2020,10/10,"On April 6, 1917 in northern France, two British soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to another British regiment requesting that they call off an attack against German soldiers: an attack that would jeopardize the lives of those in the regiment. Lance Corporals William Schofield (George MacKay) and Thomas Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) face much difficulty and danger during their journey.It is said that the entire film (just under two hours) was done in only two long takes. I counted three but who cares? What is most important is the uniquely, brilliant execution of this film. The perfectly long and detailed takes are praiseworthy enough; but to include so much secondary action in the background without errors places this film in the masterpiece category.The cast lives up to the high standard as well with MacKay truly standing out. There is also a moving scene in which a lieutenant (Richard Madden) begins to gradually decipher that he is receiving bad news only by reading the silent face on the man in front of him. The camera shows only the back of the other man while Madden's face progressively registers a series of emotions followed by an obligation to repress them and get on with his duties. This is probably the most poignant moment in this great movie that has many of them.Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have created a thrilling work with real-time intensity. It is gripping and moving all the way while paying tribute to those who made great sacrifices in World War I. - dbamateurcriticRATING: * * * *OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Sam MendesCinematography by Roger Deakins"
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,The film itself has a simple story and some of the acting at times was a little ropey especially the first half but still that doesn't take away from the mesmerising way this film has been filmed and quite frankly beautiful moments of cinematography despite the horrific landscape of war it was largely set in often taking your breath away. It honestly at times especially watching in imax made me feel if I was there alongside them. All star leads alongside this and it would almost certainly have been a 10 in my eyes but never the less a great film.
1917,28 February 2020,9/10,"Wow! The camera work, the sets, the cinematography. Unreal because it was so real. You feel as though you are part of this epic the entire way through.I felt a little overcome at times but then I guess this heightened the sense of being in the action.Loved that the director didn't overplay the heroism or the horror or the pathos. Just in your face realism. Obviously there was a lot of over the top action and plot twists, it is a movie. But, what a movie!A must, must see!!!"
1917,2 December 2020,8/10,"We have seen so many movies of warfare that are historical, entertaining and made-up for our amusement or purposes. War does bring out all the emotions using thirst, hunger, fear, sleeplessness, courage, stench, horror, visuals and ear-busting sounds to make the point war is hell. This movie takes us there quite well. Objectively speaking, when you are out in the middle of nothing and you meet the enemy out there too, it dawns on everyone how senseless this all is yet they will try to kill each other. In this movie, we have bodies on both sides out in the middle of nowhere and we don't know who killed who, how and when only that they are now dead! I enjoyed visiting the era of 1917 and found the dress, weapons, and countryside well done in portraying that time. The movie leans on dialogue which if you let it captures you into the moment the actors are in. We often think being silent when in enemy territory is the way to go and it is most of the times but these buys were out in tin-buck-tu thus we are invited in on their talking points. Steady action, some tenseness, moving scenes and an array of thoughts of feelings will have you feeling like you just fought a war or it fought you. During our World War 2 efforts, many signed up for duty after Pearl Harbor wanting payback. Easier said than done. It is interesting to note that the Japanese were better trained as were the Germans and it was our Leadership that was on a learning curve using green recruits on foreign soil to figure things out at the cost of millions of lives. We won but at what cost? Hopefully we learn the right lessons. By that I mean now we employ cruise missiles, technology and massive machinery to deliver the blow. Anew more modern way to win a war? Snack up for this movie as you will want to put-off nail-biting. Add a tasty drink too. Kudos to all involved on this movie"
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"The desire to make one long endless tracking shot seriously interrupts the story. For example, when the soldiers are crossing through corpse strewn battlefields we get only a brief glimpse of the carnage. A pause to consider the broken body parts would help serve the story, but instead we get only a peripheral look."
1917,15 February 2020,3/10,"A non story that makes the one of ""Saving private Ryan"" look like the Godfather. Non-characters ala ""Dunkirk"", but without actually committing to it, giving the two leads a handful of ""emotional moments and lines"" (some fine, some absolutely ridiculous and forced) typical of usual archetypes and basic ""emotional arcs"". A gimmick (a really impossibly hard gimmick) ""one shot movie"", that is ultra clearly not one shot and requires excessive ""non scenes"" where nothing happens other than people slowly walking, slowly crawling, slowly jogging. And a handful of specially great and breathtaking visual sequences that has little to nothing to do with being ""a one shot movie"". Those same sequences in a ""normal movie"" would've been incredible too, regardless.So. A zero for the story. A zero for the characters. A zero for the score. A ten for the technical tricks. A ten for the imaginative ways of putting action and the ways there were filmed. A ten for that handful of amazing visual parts. And a zero for the absolutely ridiculous moments that are supposed to give you the chills.I guess if you were ""into the movie"" from the start, and the trick one shot made you feel ""there with the protagonists"", then those moments would've way more impact to you and increase the enjoyment. It wasn't my case."
1917,15 January 2020,7/10,"This is a good war movie. An old classic with a 21st century pastiche. The uninterrupted camera shot is meant to be noticeably cool, and yet, I really didn't notice it. Maybe that was the intention. It's easy to get used to. Or it could be a testament to how far we've come technologically. Either way, this is a gorgeous film. It's story is very touching as well. Unsung praise also goes to the acting here. The question is, did it warrant its Golden Globe win over The Irishman? Listen, this was good, but wtf Hollywood Foreign Press? No, not by any stretch of the imagination."
1917,29 December 2019,8/10,"I finally found a war film that I absolutely love. 1917 is the latest effort from a very quality filmmaker in Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes has never made a film that I didn't like and so seeing a new war film from him was something I was going to welcome with open arms. This film from opening frame is an absolute technical and emotional journey. Its worth a watch in the cinemas while you can and something I am looking to go see again when I can.
The film is about the journey of two British soldiers who are tasked with delivering an important message about an impending German ambush on British forces during Operation Alberich. The soldiers go on a long and dangerous journey in order to stop this massive planned attack. The film stars George McKay, Dean Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch. It is Sam Mendes' first non Bond film since 2009.
The obvious must be stated first. I am a huge fan of long takes. Loved Alfred Hitchcock's Rope which was a pioneer in that technique. Then we had memorable long takes through the years including one of my favorites for Gravity. This entire film is presented as one long take; a riveting continuous shot. It is absolutely incredible and completely contributes to the claustrophobic, frantic, and ever present war setting. Roger Deakins is a legend and needs another Academy Award for his work here. Simply incredible. Everything about the set was realistic. The bodies, dirt, and filth looked so authentic. For two hours you feel like you are in the trenches and in the war field, hearing every shot fired and every roaring plane overhead.
Technically the film is a brilliant achievement. It also composes of an excellent score, one that complements each changing scene in the film. So much went into how the film looks and I love that critics have been appreciating it. I had no problems with the fleeting characters and think the two initial leads and their bond is captured well enough. We are here for the journey which is ever changing and sporadic. Overall, this was an extremely pleasant way to end the year for me. One of the years very best.8.5/10"
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"There is not many movies out there that does the unique and hard way to make a film in one continuous shot and Sam Mendes did it here with one if not the best movie of 2019. It's a war movie but far from something that we are used to watch, what we did get was a very real portrayal of The Great War and everything horrible about it.
Right from the start we get introduced to the two characters and they then start their adventure, it does not take a long while to the true horrors of WW1 to be shown to us and its what the actors, script and direction succeeded in doing, creating an incredible experience.The production design is just extraordinary, sets most of all. To think of all the trenches they dug and everything else, it's amazing how hard all the crew worked to create this masterpiece. Cinematography was simply superb, giving us shots that makes us immersed, focusing on the environment and everything on the screen when the actors aren't in the focus made us feel the shocking sights the soldiers had to see everyday. Musical score was one other highlight, keeping us suspense with music fitting a war movie. Why should you watch this movie, a war movie that earned 10 nominations in the Oscar's. You'll experience something totally unique, visually stunning that makes your eyes stick to the screen and witnessing acting that portrays realistic soldiers. It's a masterpiece in its genre and in film!"
1917,5 May 2020,6/10,"The story was OK, but because the film was made without editing, it wasn't consistently exciting rather a bit boring."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"While there have been movies filmed to look like they're one long take (the Best Picture winner, Birdman (2015) comes to mind) and movies that revolve around key moments of retreat during war (Dunkirk (2017) comes to mind), never before have the two been so masterfully combined. 1917 (2019) is a rare piece of cinema that tackles the less-popular World War I as its subject matter, but doing so in a way that's personal, gruesome, and tense. Those viewers who might be put off by the gore of this film might come to realize that cinema has been censoring the ugly side of war for far too long.None of the violence seems out of place in 1917. Its moments of horror highlight the ugliness of war that results in constant and ever-present death. Fortunately, there are enough moments of peace and rebuttal between these intense sequences to let the audience catch their breath. Because, after all, the one-shot style of this film is breathtaking all on its own. The ability to pull something like this off, with brilliant peaceful bookends encapsulating intense action, makes 1917 a generation-defining movie that will likely remain as a landmark of cinema for years to come, regardless of the awards it does or does not win.Sam Mendes' career is just as varied as that of his contemporaries (Christopher Nolan comes to mind). After winning Best Picture with his breakout film, American Beauty (1999), Mendes has dabbled in almost every genre, including comedy (Away We Go (2009)), period drama (Road to Perdition (2002)), and franchise success (Skyfall (2012)). It's a testament to his skills as a director to show how far he has come in 20 years. Sure, American Beauty was good for its time, but I think 1917 is excellent beyond any annual awards cycle. It could be the kind of film you only see once in 202 years.A generation-defining film that pulls no punches, I give 1917 5.0 stars out of 5."
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U.S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself."
1917,25 February 2021,8/10,"As a history buff who wishes there were more World War One movies, this was right up my alley - and what a great piece of filmmaking it turned out to be.The premise is brilliantly simple and effective in its urgency: two British soldiers have to reach another battalion and call off a doomed attack. Performances are effective: the relatively unknown leads bring sincerity and intensity to their roles, supported by a cast of veterans (Colin Firth, Mark Strong...) with short but memorable appearances.Technically, 1917 is a marvel: director Sam Mendes and legendary director of photography Roger Deakins really achieved something remarkable. The movie appears to be filmed in an unbroken single take (actually with innumerable perfectly hidden edits), but it never feels gimmicky or distracting.The level of tension is phenomenal.8,5/10"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"1917 tells the story of Lance Corporal Schofield(George MacKay) & Lance Corporal Blake(Dean-Charles Chapman). Schofield & Blake are tasked with a very important & difficult mission. They have to deliver a message in hostile territory, that will save the lives of 1,600 soldiers, from walking into an extremely dangerous trap.1917 is a mind-blowing film. Director Sam Mendes has given us a pulse-pounding, edge of the seat, action-packed & emotional thrill ride, that is unlike any war movie I've watched before. All the war set pieces are jaw-dropping. What is even more impressive is, the whole film is made to look like a single take, from Schofield & Blake's perspective. Kudos to cinematographer Roger Deakins. George MacKay is spectacular as Lance Corporal Schofield. Dean-Charles Chapman is outstanding as Lance Corporal Blake. The cameos from all the legendary British thespians, are unforgettable. 1917 is a must watch. It deserves Best Film at this year's Oscars & a host of other accolades, that it has already received & will receive."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"I have just viewed the film that WILL WIN the Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Cinematography (and probably many, many more).Yes, 1917 is that good.A tour-de-force presentation of a film, 1917 tells the tale of 2 soldiers in WW 1 that are tasked with bringing a message across ""no man's land"" to prevent a company of soldiers from walking into an ambush.Director Sam Mendes (SKYFALL) chose to shoot this film in such a way as to give the impression that this film is just one long shot. While it is not (he shot it in about 8 minute bursts), the choreography of the action is staged in such a way that the cuts are seamless and unnoticeable. It is a master class in Directing from Mendes, for - though it is an interesting ""gimmick"" that puts us (literally) in the shoes (and steps) of the 2 young soldiers on their mission - this gimmick does not get in the way of the film. It helps and enhances the film, you can sit back in your chair and forget about ""the gimmick"" and just get wrapped up, emotionally, in the story that is being told.And...getting wrapped up, emotionally, you will be. For the story, events, struggles and triumphs of these 2 soldiers are brilliantly brought to the screen from Director Mendes and Cinematograper-extraordinaire Roger Deakins (14 time Oscar nominee - from SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION to his win, finally, in BLADE RUNNER 2049). These 2 (and their crew) suck you into the action and tensions of the situation. You feel every step that these soldiers take.Since you spend the entire movie with them, Mendes has done a tremendous job of casting 2 charismatic (but not overly so) actors as the 2 soldiers. Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen Baratheon in GAME OF THRONES) is determined, focused and single-minded as the lead soldier on this trek - he has personal stakes in this mission - as his brother is in the invasion force that is going to be ambushed. Chapman does a nice job of finding the balance - and making a true person - out of a character that has a single, over-arching mission. It is strong subtle work.But, to me, the standout in this film is George MacKay (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) as the buddy who is ""brought along"". This could have been just another ""reluctant war hero"" character, but MacKay brings a sense of decency and vulnerability to the early scenes of his character (where he could have just as easily played the ""reluctant companion""). These nuanced character dimensions take root later on in the film and elevate this actor - and this role - above the norm.Mendes brings in a ""who's who"" of modern British acting stars to fill important extended cameo roles - Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch all bring gravitas and heft to their brief appearances on screen.This is not the fastest paced film you will ever see - and I think that this serves the film well. It earns its pace and I was drawn in, emotionally, in a way that would not have worked had Mendes rushed the pace (especially early on).But this film (and Mendes and Deakins) shines during the battle scenes. Even though we are following 2 foot soldiers, they set up the boundaries of these battles in such a way that you understand what is going on - and what is at stake - at least to the 2 soldiers we are following. It is in these scenes that this film really finds its footing. I was drawn even further into the intimate, emotional stakes of these characters at those moments.A marvelous piece of film making that shows a Director and Cinematographer at the top of their games.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a film which undoubtedly would have been ear marked for awards right from it's conception. The good news is that the film delivers on this potential. I'd be very surprised if it didn't win the Oscar for Cinematography and must have a good chance of taking away a few other gongs.The film is set in the trenches of world war one. It tells the story of 2 men who are tasked with delivering a message to the commanding officer of another battalion. The film really conveys just how awful conditions were for the troops involved in the trenches. The film gives the effect of being one take, but there are significantly different scenes along the way. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are the soldiers tasked with delivering the message. They are excellent in the roles and aren't actors that I'm familiar with. None of the other actors have significant screen time, so if you are going along to see one of your favourites, don't expect them to be in it for long.1917 is an engrossing film and well worth seeing on the big screen."
1917,31 October 2020,4/10,"The movie was stuck in second gear and dialogue so poor, shockingly dragged out and just does not feel like watch any other war film. The second viewing does not help as you just see more points where acting could and should have been better. The Cinematography was interesting and some great shots, but hatted one take method of filming really was like a video game and took away soul of movie."
1917,1 January 2020,10/10,"REVIEW - 1917UK RELEASE DATE 10 JANUARY 20There are only a few films which have been shot in 1 continuous shot and after watching this film honestly the cinematography is absolutely amazing!As far as I could see there is only 1 transition which is used to turn day into night but this can be very easily ignored as this film in its depiction of how futile war is, is one film to definitely consider going to see.No spoilers, you follow 2 young soldiers ordered to deliver a message which will save 1,600 other soldiers.The true devastation of war is shown and I can't even imagine how this film was made as you follow these 2 young soldiers following orders.Slow in places but as it is set in real time (except for the transition mentioned above) even war can't be action all of the time.Don't go expecting a Hollywood big blockbuster because this is muddy, bloody and real to the end.A must see!Rating 10 out of 10"
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,"The only reason I didn't give 1917 a 10 is because the lead actor had the personality of a piece of chalk. He looked almost as dead as the bodies that were strew around him. Or maybe that was the point and I'm missing it. In any case, the cinematography was worth the price of admission alone. Compared to the other films up for Oscars, 1917 should be an easy win. It was full of drama and action, and paced in a strong way that The Academy likes. I wish it luck."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"It's already won Best Film at the Golden Globes, and seems set for Oscar glory too. Is Sam Mendes's WW1 epic any good?""The Man is the Mission"" - The similarities with the storyline of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" are evident. Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) has a brother serving in another battalion of 1,600 men under the command of Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch). The problem is that they are walking into a trap and are about to be slaughtered when they go over the top at dawn. General Erinmore (Colin Firth) picks Blake and his mate Lance Corporal Will Schofield (George MacKay) to run a dangerous mission to cross no-mans land, break through the German lines and get the message to Mackenzie to call the attack off.Famously, the movie uses the ""Rope"" / ""Birdman"" technique of appearing to film the action as a single continuous take. This adds enormously to the tension as the duo proceed into danger. Aside from a chance meeting with a French foster mother (Claire Duburcq), the tension is maintained at 110% for the film's duration. Which makes for an exhausting watch! Congratulations by the way to Ms Duburcq for bagging the one female role in the whole movie! This is the anti-dote to the female-heavy movies of 2019!This is a movie you MUST go to see in the cinema. A star of the show is Roger Deakins' cinematography which is just glorious to look at. The hell-holes (literally) of no-mans land are one thing, but then we get the sweeping landscapes of the green french countryside (actually Wiltshire, just a few miles from where I live!). But the really jaw-dropping cinematography for me came in a flare-lit ruined French town. The effect of a raging fire in the distance and the constantly shifting shadows of the ruins is truly spectacular.All of this is helped by a great score by Thomas Newman, particularly at this moment in the film. The music suits the action perfectly, which is all you can ask for from a score.I first noticed George MacKay in one of the lead roles in the Proclaimers musical ""Sunshine on Leith"" and then again in ""Pride"": both relatively low-key British films. Here he is catapulted onto the global blockbuster stage, and has nowhere to hide being on-screen literally for the whole running time (and he is running!). He doesn't disappoint: the performance is a stellar one and he holds the drama together.He's got good support though: small but important supporting roles come from not only Firth and Cumberbatch but also Daniel (""Line of Duty"") Mays; Andrew (""Kneel!"") Scott; Adrian (""Killing Eve"") Scarborough and Richard Madden. But my favourite was a quietly strong (no pun intended) from Mark Strong as a friendly captain with good advice for our hero.Is the single-shot idea a gimmick? Perhaps. But it is extremely effective at maintaining the momentum. Perhaps to a degree it is a bit of a distraction, since I was constantly looking for the cuts (and very clever they are too). But it is undeniably a marvelous piece of film-making. The choreography involved with getting all of those actors and extras moving in unison for the length of some of those takes would make even Busby Berkeley sweat!There are also some truly extraordinary action shots: a barn scene (and its dramatic aftermath) is one of the most incredible bits of film-making I've seen not just this year (that's not saying much!) but also last year.The movie is not for the faint-hearted, with some truly gruesome scenes that stick in the mind afterwards. The illustrious Mrs Movie Man spent most of the movie with her hands over her eyes! But in general, this feels authentic. My own grandfather spent 3 days and nights lying wounded in the French mud, before being rescued... by the Germans. War is hell, and the film reflects that.Director Sam Mendes - also a Golden Globe winner - only goes a bit Hollywood at one point: a musical interlude where an exhausted Schofield creeps into camp (what? no guards?) and listens to a wistful acappella. The realism felt like it went from 10/10 to 7/10.This is a top-class piece of movie-making and deserves all its award success. I went in with a bit of an ""Oscar-bait"" attitude; the one-take gimmick peaking my interest but also stoking my cynicism. Was this to be just a technically fabulous movie that would win the awards but not really entertain? But my cynicism was unfounded. It's a gripping watch and a truly memorable movie.See it. See it at the cinema. And see it at a cinema with as big a screen and with as great a sound system as possible!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web and Facebook)."
1917,20 October 2020,,The timelock of the dawn deadline makes this a really thrilling film to watch. The technical virtuosity on display is also seriously impressive. My heart was in my mouth throughout and I've now seen it 3 times. Highly recommended.
1917,13 April 2020,8/10,"'1917' brings something new to the table as far as war movies go. Its gripping story is filmed in a very interesting way that really elevates the viewing experience and the cinematography really deserved the Oscar it got. The score by Thomas Newman is masterful as-well - Already a classic in my book. There are also plenty of epic scenes that stick with you long after the credits roll. With all that said it's not a perfect movie. I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat the whole way trough, like I thought I would. Maybe a few slow parts too many for my taste, but it was never boring like some people say. It's still one of the best war movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them. Really glad there is still some quality movies coming out of Hollywood these days."
1917,17 October 2020,7/10,"First of all I enjoyed the viewing experience of 1917. However the well documented single take/tracking shot is a distraction amongst many critics it appears that deflects from the screenplay.Director Sam Mendes and his trusted cinematographer Roger Deakins have shown great technical skill no doubt but a well photographed film doth make a brilliant film that it appears to be rated amongst some.1917 is a First World War film. There aren't many around. I still hark back to Kubrick's Paths Of Glory. 1917 is just a colourized version of the horrors of the trenches as shown in that black and white 1957 film.Casting of the central characters Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield are two relative unknowns (Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay) who both deliver excellent performances and it is left to more established actors to fill mere cameo roles, in that I'm thinking primarily of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong.Was that done on purpose? After all, the two young Lance Corporals are sent deep into enemy territory to deliver a message to another group of soldiers to prevent them being lured into an enemy trap and certain death.Was it assumed by their superiors that they wouldn't achieve their mission?A good film I say, but not a great one. Many other war films that have superior stories are rated lower."
1917,19 January 2020,7/10,"WWI was the trench war and this film depicts this very clearly. 500 meters ahead would be the other side's trenches. Intelligence is obtained which requires a message to be delivered to a platoon behind enemy lines. Two men are picked to undertake this journey.This film covers that dramatic journey, taking the audience along for the slog into the unexpected.Anxious moments with unknown outcomes make this film a gripping drama and covers the horrid experiences of the messengers in enemy territory."
1917,6 March 2021,6/10,"This movie is overrated, other than the one shot idea there was nothing interesting about the movie. man gets mission, man's friend dies, man finishes mission. Nothing in this movie other than the one shot idea was Oscar worthy to me. Performances were alright, music was what you would expect from a generic war movie, there is a classic ""nice guy is kind but dies to enemy"" death. Besides the camera shots, nothing else was impressive. Disappointing. I didn't particularly like the movie. I mean, 45 minutes in and NOTHING happens. very slow scenes, slow pace. I don't wanna say it was a chore to watch because the cinematography was just beautiful. This film was looking cool and historically accurate but apart of it the story for me was an absolute unbelievable sequence of events, I was terribly disappointed by it at the end. So near the end he stops to listen to a song. Really? He's almost at his objective - and listens to a song? Naa. Boring. Didn't care if the characters lived or died. The only good bit was the French woman in the cellar - everything else was poor."
1917,25 January 2020,6/10,"Once you get over 1917's one single gimmick, you realize it's not that great of a war movie.1917 is a one-shot film based during WWI. The plot is rather simple: deliver a letter across enemy lines or else thousands will die. It's straightforward and the action moves quickly.One area that I appreciate about this film is the respect it pays to WWI. Special attention is given to the hell-like conditions that the soldiers had to face. 1917 does an excellent job showing how the Great War turned normal men into savages. It also did a great job showing the life-and-death conditions that people faced.But, there were times I felt disconnected from the film. Is it from the dizzying speed the camera moves around? Is it the lack of character development and cheesy dialogue? Is it from the rather cliche plot? I felt no real connection to the characters until close to the end. Shame that this movie was missing that special something.1917 is a good movie to watch. Yet, I wouldn't call it too memorable. With a bit more polishing, this could have been a much stronger movie.3/5 or 3.5/5. Average or above average. Sam Mendes was missing that special something to take this movie to the next level."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"If you're ever in the mood to watch a war film, there's an over-abundance of them throughout history. You can almost always find one that you haven't seen before. For this reason alone, I find myself being very cautious when one is about to get a wide release. With recent releases like Hacksaw Ridge or Dunkirk, my faith in the genre is always rejuvenated. Well, 1917 is yet another war film to come along and surprise me. For all the technical reasons to love this film on top of the powerful story itself, here's why I believe 1917 is one of 2019s very best films.The premise is nice and simple. Two young soldiers are given the task of sneaking through enemy lines in order to deliver a message to their commander, which will, in turn, save thousands of lives if received in time. This premise makes for a very tense ride. On top of being an engaging story, this movie is filmed in such a way that it makes it feel like one continuous take, for the most part, which ultimately begs the core actors to deliver the performances of their career.Although I've seen him in great films like Captain Fantastic and Pride, George MacKay never really stood out to me as award-worthy, but I stand corrected. This may very well be the best performance he ever gives, but that's not a negative, because I'll always remember him for this role. Alongside him is Dean-Charles Chapman, who I've also liked in Game of Thrones and Blinded by the Light, so I knew to expect a solid performance from him. With that said, he also delivers one of the better performances I've seen in 2019, simply due to the devotion he has to his character.Now, this would absolutely be an incomplete review if I forgot to bring up how incredible the technical aspects of this film are. Roger Deakins is basically a god in the cinematography world, so his work astounds me every single time he brings his vision to a project, and 1917 is no exception to that. The way this camera seamlessly follows these actors in and out of small or big sequences was simply astonishing. Layered on top of this jaw-dropping cinematography is the superb score by Thomas Newman. The combination of being swept up in these performances, caring about the story, being impressed by the camerawork, and then finally being moved by how well the music was composed for each scene, I found it very difficult to criticize anything here.Overall, 1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019."
1917,15 February 2020,8/10,"While 1917 is a great experience motsly due to the way it's shot and edited, the abscence of a good story really hurts it.1917 does feel like a collection of war stories told by the people involved (which it surely is) but there is no rooting message in this story, no real characterizations or relatable human emotions. Some of the stories feel disconnected from each other and feel like filler.If you disregard the single shot style of the editing, the film would feel no different than Midway, for example. Midway was a big budget spectacle with no story and little dramatic elements and this one is too. I understand the attempt to move from heroism cliches but having no emotional investment in a war film is not a good idea.Aside from a couple of Mendes' trademarks like the truck scene (reminiscent of the Semper Fi scene of Jarhead) and night fire silhouettes (reminiscent of Skyfall), there is not much to grasp to.It also has a big segment that is so tonally different and disconnected from the film it makes you wonder why did they put it in (the sniper scene and the follow-up with the baby).1917 is a technical achievement with little to no essence. While this style of immersion is inspiring, more investment into the story would've made it even better."
1917,9 January 2020,10/10,"My Review- 1917 my Rating 10/10. NO SPOILERS other than what's in the trailer.I'm amazed that I'm giving a film of my least favourite genre a perfect score but I think Sam Mendez and Krystal Wilson -Cairns who co wrote 1917 with Sam Mendez have had the final say on the futility of War and have done both their Grandfathers proud.
Both Wilson and Mendes separately say they want the film to act as a corrective to a repackaging of the war in the service of jingoistic isolationism. ""People who are attached to some sort of nostalgic vision treat these wars retrospectively as triumphs,"" says Mendes. ""In fact, they were tragedies.
""That kind of hijacking of shared cultural memories and pride is very subtle, and very easy to do. At the moment, it happens all the time. 'We're going back to being on our own again! This is the spirit that fought two world wars!' That's what we're now lumbered with.""
1917 definitely is a Tragedy and I think possibly two reasons why this relatively simple story succeeds is that it's shot brilliantly in a group of single takes that have been seamlessly edited together to appear as one long take to create the impression that it's unfolding in real time . Also because co writer Krysty Wilson - Cairns unique feminine perspective has contributed an emphasis on the emotional impact . I'm sure it's her influence that helps humanise the personal sacrifice and bravery of these young men who by an accident of birth were born into an era when an entire generation on both sides was erased from the face of the earth between 1914 and 1918.
Only the human race is capable of such barbaric behaviour through the ages in the pursuit of power, territorial supremacy and hate and it's still happening today.Sam Mendes of course we know is a great Director and has dedicated this fine film to his Grandfather famed West Indian writer Alfred H. Mendes who served in the 1st Rifle Brigade, and fought for two years in Flanders, along the Belgian Front, and was awarded a Military Medal for distinguishing himself on the battlefield. Towards the end of the war, he accidentally inhaled the poisonous gas used as a weapon by the German army, and was sent back to Britain to recover.
The end credits simply say Dedicated to my Grandfather Alfred H. Mendes ""who told us the stories "" after five decades of silence when Sam Mendes asked him to tell him about the War his Grandfather was in his mid 70's he lived to be 94 years old.Sam Mendes won his first Academy Award in 2000 for the superb movie American Beauty his other great films include Road to Perdition, Revolutionary Road, SkyFall , Spectre, Little Voice and Jarhead plus many great stage productions . I predict after his Golden Globe wins for Best Director and Best Movie this week that he is assured of at least 2 more Academy Awards plus the film will be awarded a host of technical awards for ""1917 ""as the lighting, camera work ,editing and sets are extraordinary.The acting performances of course are all exceptional especially the two young stars
Dean- Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Blake and George MacKay as Lance Corporal Schofield who set off on an impossible mission to deliver an order to the Captain of The Devonshire regiment to call off their planned attack and avoid an ambush that will cause the deaths of 2000 men including Corporal Blake's brother.
Top name Stars Colin Firth , David Mays and Benedict Cumberbatch have relatively small roles but add their fine stamp of quality performance to the film.1917 is at times painful and upsetting to watch it's not because of the gory battle scenes with heads being looped off or blood and guts everywhere it's more the result and cruel horrific aftermath of these battles the corpses the dead horses, and the destruction of war, it's all necessary for this film to have the impact it does have.The score by Thomas Newman son of the famous film score composer Alfred Newman is superb at times it's just a long continuous drone but elegiac in atmosphere. It reminded me of a Mahler symphony especially in the magnificent shadow and fire scenes of the burning French Village Corporal Schofield passes through on his mission. In a totally different way that scene reminded me of Sam Mende's other iconic beautiful moment in American Beauty of leaves whirling around in a wind tunnel I know It may sound odd but along with the ugly scenes of war 1917 has some beautiful moments.The film affected me personally because of my own Maternal Grandfather Herbert V Fortescue who I never knew and also fought in that war in France and who also was sent back to England to recover from poisoning by gas. I have his War Service record and 2 poignant letters one enquiring of his whereabouts by a lady who obviously cared about him and the other written by his father written in 1917 just 2 months before this film is set requesting any information regarding his son to be forwarded to his new address they put a human touch to the list of dates and battles mentioned in his service record.I've always boycotted most War films ( I did see the wonderful Australian film Danger Close The Battle of Long Tan earlier this year ) like Saving Private Ryan which I acknowledge may be the finest War Movie up to this time but 1917 in a year where there have been so many exceptional films like Joker, Little Women ,Once Upon A Time in America , The Two Popes ,Rocketman Ford v Ferrari etc 1917 stands out to me as the best as it will be a classic for ages to come to some up in 3 words Lest We Forget.."
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,"When one hears a politician boasting of the armament that his country possesses, one claiming that he has the mother of weapons, the other the father, while some ""cockerels"" of the third world are also doing nearly the same, those who do not solve food and housing and in the end they end up offering slogans with death as an inescapable promise, it is because those presidents or supposed courageous men have never been in war. The film ""1917 (2019)"" of British director Sam Mendes, based on the stories of a family predecessor who had the misfortune to participate in World War I, is a clear example of the number of lives lost in a war, the pains that cause in the families of the fallen ones and the economic damages that it causes. This film reflects the damage with many details, one of them is the hatred among rival soldiers, to the point of assaulting when they are doing you a favor of life or death. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, both managed to attract all the attention of the public throughout the film and their performance was such that they looked like the same soldiers on the battlefield. They managed to bring reality to the big screen. There were no foolish scenes of those vulgar war movies that show non-existent supermen in those confrontations. It is a quality film, with a real plot, well-designed fiction, and excellent photography."
1917,13 March 2020,6/10,"Its a well made war movie, but falls into the blob that is war movies. it has some impressive shots but there are plenty onther war movies who have better ones. so in the gerne of war movies or just a movie in general, it lacks on quite a few fronts.6/10: not that amazing"
1917,3 February 2020,9/10,I won't say anything about how immersive and impressive on a technical level this gritty yet moving film is; I just want to say that I can't remember the last time I identified with and was emotionally invested in a character in a war film as I did with George MacKay's William Schofield. What a talent!(9/10)
1917,3 April 2020,9/10,"The style of the film reminded me of Dunkirk and that's a good thing. It has stylish filmmaking, with the central focus on the character's. 1917 had so much hype surrounding it and I managed to avoid it. I don't believe it was the best film of 2019, but it was a great film. Much was said of the making of the film and Sam Mendes has created a tense film. I love watching long takes, it's something rewarding and in the moment. 1917 has my distinguished award of being the most ambitious studio film of the year."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"This is a smart film that you expect battles like saving private Ryan but what you gets is an edge of your seat thriller the plays on you fear of what is around the corner this film plays like one long shot like birdman. The this feels like you are in the trenches going through barb wire. Dir mendez goes for an alternative to put a fresh take of the cost of war two soldiers get an impossible task blake and champan delivery a messages behind enemy lines and they know the Germany a laying a trap for a regiment to get there in broad day light to thousands of soldiers the story is fictional story but risky missions were not uncommon then
For soldiers to complete there mission must cross peak blown up muddy battlefields get through rat infested German bunkers. The swamps dodge planes fights face to face combat and snipers in raging city infernos..
A destroyed bridge near the bombed-out village of Écoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, so Schofield crosses alone on the remnants of the bridge. This draws an attack by a German sniper across so as the flares go Chapman races through bombed burnt building he races through the streets to avoid flares from Germans.
whilst surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.
It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundanceWatch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder
Edge of your seat stuff
It will will an Oscar but it will have to share something with the joker this film is unique 10/10. great camoes from strong and cummberbatch"
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"War drama.The movie closely follows two ordinary soldiers, shot over a 24hr period, who have been tasked with a seemingly impossible mission. In a race against time, they must cross enemy territory and deliver a message that (if successful) will stop the massacre of 1600 of their own troops.This is a very simple idea, but it works so well because it has been shot as near as they could manage, as one long take. Sam Mendes used this technique at the beginning of 'Spectre' and used here puts the viewer right in the thick of the action. However, watch carefully and you'll see where the very subtle edits have been made. The heroes are in constant danger and the viewers are apparently projected into the very tense and totally gripping scenes.The movie is an enormous technical achievement, and remarkably executed, I was exhausted at the end."
1917,12 April 2021,10/10,"This movie should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is an astounding achievement. The way the trenches, the devastation... the way it was recreated is beyond belief. Unforgettable."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"Revolutionary Directing from Sam Mendes, Unbelievable Cinematography from Roger Deakins, and Mesmerizing Score from Thomas Newman, Defintly One of the greatest war movies of all time and one of the best films of The Year, i highly recommend watching it in IMAX."
1917,2 May 2020,9/10,"This review contains spoilers.1917 is a war movie that was directed by Sam Mendes. The movie is written by Sam Mendes, and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. The movie stars George MacKay, and Dean-Charles Chapman as two lance corporals in the British army that are sent to deliver a message across enemy lines.1917 is an incredibly simple story. The story follows two lance corporals that are assigned a mission to deliver a message across enemy lines. The movie immediately begins with the two lance corporals as they awaken to the mission. Lance Corporal Blake has a brother in the second Devonshire battalion that is going over the top in the morning and assaulting the enemy lines. The two lance corporals race against time to deliver the message and prevent the attack from taking place. The story is not the main focus here as the story is incredibly basic without many twists and turns. The story is appropriate to the movie as the audience does feel the panic of the main characters as they are trying to overcome the time crunch.The casting of this movie is excellent. Both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman do a great job in their roles as the messengers. George MacKay deserves praise for carrying a stoic performance as he is plucked for a hellish mission. The movie uses George MacKay astoundingly as he has to navigate through enemy territory in a race against time to save the second Devonshire battalion. Dean-Charles Chapman did a good job for much of the movie until his character's death. The death scene is incredibly haunting as Schofield, played by George MacKay, has to deal with the death of his friend and uncertainty around his chances of succeeding in the mission.The music and cinematography of this movie is bewildering. The music and cinematography work together in such a way as to create an invested experience for the audience. The use of a one-shot directing style did not feel like a gimmick. The one-shot style added to the experience as the directing showed the realities of trench warfare that Lance Corporal Schofield and Lance Corporal Blake had to endure. The audience also followed the journey of these two as they had to cross into enemy territory at risk of danger from the environment and German soldiers. The one-shot style is done in a way that will dazzle the eyes and senses. Of note is the scene in the ruins at night where Schofield has to run through the ruins in order to reach the second Devonshire battalion. This scene is impressive in the execution as flares were constantly fired into the air to reveal any presence in the ruins. This along with the soundtrack created a foreboding sense of tension that at any moment Schofield could have been hit by a bullet.I highly recommend '1917'. This is one of the best war movies and one of the best movies in the 2010-2019 decade.Grade: A"
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Let me just take a deep breath... Wait, one more... Uff, I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917. Usually, I don't delve deep into technical stuff since most people don't know or don't care about these attributes, but it's impossible not to address Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not the first time a film has been edited to appear as ""one shot"" (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me.Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Birdman, Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen, or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock... all produce the same trick. Even Mr. Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal ""one shot"" episodes, edited as well with the so-called ""stitches,"" meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it's all just one continuous take. Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter ""pans"" (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area.Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. Yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. Even if you don't know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it's impossible to watch this film and not think ""something feels different about this one."" This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at all.Throughout the whole runtime, I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake. It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. I believe 1917 is the best ""one shot"" film to date (I've been using the quote signs for a reason, don't mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with Birdman as a close second. If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running/walking/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats.I really have no words to describe Roger Deakins' cinematography. It's not merely a film, it's a whole experience. It's not just another cool technical achievement. It's the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. However, a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smith's work. Don't forget, this isn't an actual one shot movie. If it's been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. Yes, he doesn't have to work with thousands of cuts (I counted 14, but I'm sure there's more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. And he did so perfectly.My last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman. As the director, Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film (Skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. As for Newman, I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917's score is fantastic. Hildur Guðnadóttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score, but if Thomas Newman takes it, I'll still be delighted.A lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. They're similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. Story and character-wise, both movies don't really develop that much. Nolan's film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. I didn't mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. However, I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman's characters have small arcs, but they exist. In the beginning, Blake is the emotional-driven character, while Schofield seems to be the rational one. We, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. By the end of the film, I was crying. Both play off of each other really well, but it's their dialogue that impresses me the most. What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn't. If it's not meaningful at the time, it's going to be. The acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances.I would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk. I might be tempted to choose the former due to the ""recency effect,"" but there's one small aspect that negatively affects both. Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don't work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home. You will never feel or understand that ""immersive experience"" that everyone talks about. You won't know what made people to be blown away. You won't love it as much as everyone else. So, please, do NOT miss 1917 in theaters!Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith. Director, director of photography, editor. Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of all-time. Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Deakins' always jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score, Mendes impeccable directing, and Smith's seamless editing. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it's the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It's meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won't get at home. It's going straight into my Top10: Best Movies of 2019, and I hope you'll love it as much as I do.Rating: A"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"It was the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand at the hands of Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 that set off World War I. When all was said and done, four years and six and a half months later, on November 11, 1918, as many as fifteen million people, civilians and soldiers alike lay dead on the continent of Europe.It remains one of the most misunderstood conflicts in human history's sadly long (and getting longer by the minute) series of wars. But it's a war that hasn't necessarily gotten as much attention from Hollywood as, say, World War II, Vietnam, or the wars America has fought since September 11, 2001. The best films about what Woodrow Wilson once called ""The War To End All Wars"" have been Lewis Milestone's 1930 classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, and Stanley Kubrick's 1957 magnum opus PATHS OF GLORY. One can now add director Sam Mendes' ""1917"" to that rather short list.In this movie, shot in one huge long flowing take lasting 119 minutes or so, young British actors Drew-Charles Chapman and George MacKay portray two British soldiers assigned to what could best be called a suicide mission. They have to deliver a message to a British force deep inside enemy territory to call off an attack against a supposedly retreating German battalion, which their commanders have labeled to be a deadly trap. Indeed, this deadly trap, if the Brits fall into it, will result in the loss of 1600 soldiers, including Chapman's own brother (Richard Madden). And in that time, a bond of brotherhood will develop between these two soldiers as they make their long trek across a wide swath of no-man's land, full of body-filled trenches, tripwires, German snipers, and all other manner of the horrors of war the likes of which humanity had never seen before.Mendes, whose directing credits prior to ""1917"" included the 1999 Oscar-winning AMERICAN BEAUTY, 2002's ROAD TO PERDITION, and the 2012 James Bond offering SKYFALL, both directed and co-scripted ""1917"", inspired by the stories his grandfather told him about this brutal part of human history, a war that proved most devastating to Mendes' native England, not only in the numbers of Brits who were killed, but also in the manner in which more than a few of them died; this was the first known instance, and by no means the last, of chemical weapons being used in military conflict. And while Mendes' film does not feature any uses of chemical weaponry like mustard gas in its story, the director nevertheless shows a great deal of the brutality and inhumanity of this war, and how Chapman and MacKay keep their humanity about them in a situation in which bloody death is a constant thing. That he was able to do this in one long single take from start to finish is indeed an incredible achievement; it is a technical marvel. But Chapman's and MacKay's performances as the young soldiers offer up the importance of how innocence is always the first thing that gets destroyed in war, helping make ""1917"" a masterpiece that goes beyond just the ""one-take"" technical brilliance.Mendes is particularly good in the opening section of the film, creating the long flowing shots in the trenches, ones that are, whether wittingly or not, a nod to what Kubrick had done with brilliance in PATHS OF GLORY; and the avant-garde score by Thomas Newman (AMERICAN BEAUTY; BRIDGE OF SPIES) captures both the horror and the humanity of the situation at hand. While Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch, both great actors on their own, do have roles in here, the focus remains on Chapman and MacKay throughout, ensuring that ""1917"" does for World War I what both ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and PATHS OF GLORY had done before it: find a spark of decency in one of humanity's darkest times."
1917,2 February 2020,8/10,"Understandably dealings will get most of the credit here, however the script is also immaculately put together and subtly developed."
1917,28 June 2020,8/10,"Nice of the leftenant to bless them. Seriously. Even if it was half hearted.I'm sure his hand won't get dirty... ooo... It might be cleaner if he dunked it in the muddy water.I'm sure this is an incredible land of smells.This will make fertile farm land after.Wrap your hand with something please.Who's gonna see that and come home right in the head.""Wrong hand"" :)F-n rat.Those are massive shells.There are still flowers?You try to help someone...No one knew to peel around corners back them huh?Helmet?That was a close rock.At least he got to wash his hand well.That's a pleasant crawl out of the river.No one is watching the back?And to whence we came."
1917,10 May 2020,9/10,"All aspiring film makers/cinematographers must take some notes from it. The amount of hardwork and dedication shown by the whole crew is truly commendable. The camera work, the editing, the direction; everything gelled together in perfection. It seriously couldn't get any better. No doubt it won 3 Oscars for Cinematography, Visual and Sound Design! It will be set as the epitome of Camera work for many times to come.Even If I keep aside the flamboyant technical supremacy here, we still get a solid storyline with some captivating performances given by the lead characters. The screenplay helped massively regarding the tightness of the plot and maintained the suspense till the end. Although frequently in few scenes I saw it dipped a Little bit that's why I'm not giving it a Full Mark. Nonetheless it was riveting, breathtaking at places. There are some particular scenes that I won't explain here but You will surely get to see some of your life's best visual experience there. This film managed to give a surreal experience of being within the action. You will get a feeling that you are a part of the journey. Not many films have done that before. For that point of view it's a must watch. Grab onto your seat and give it a go. It's something you won't ever forget in your entire lifetime."
1917,16 October 2020,8/10,"It was a great film and I really enjoyed it but it was definitely overhyped. People saying it's the best war film ever but it definitely isn't. Saving private Ryan, hacksaw ridge and fury are definitely better. Just to clarify I'm not saying it's bad, it was a great film just people need to calm down."
1917,19 October 2020,8/10,"The kind of film that leaves you completely stunned and exhausted as the credits roll.How do you even write a review for this? Feel too stunned. It was great. The technical aspects were excellent. Did I enjoy it? Given the realism, to say I enjoyed it, would be to practically say I enjoyed war. War is hell. I don't much like hell.The runtime went by so fast, which I think is a great way to gauge how good a film is. George McKay was phenomenal. Amazing seeing his career transformation from singing Proclaimers songs to William Schofield on the frontlines of WWI.The cinematography was breathtaking. In fact, the whole film was breathtaking to the extent you need to come up for air. Only once the credits roll can you finally come up for air and start to process what you've seen.Powerful stuff. I enjoyed it a lot more than Dunkirk."
1917,24 January 2020,7/10,"Two young English soldiers (possibly Cockney) must deliver a message across enemy lines to save 1600 men from certain annihilation - and one of them has a sibling in the doomed attack.Technically, directorially, cinematographically, 1917 is stunning; amazing. As you probably know, it's supposed to consist of one continuous 2-hour shot. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.Nearly 500 rank-and-file digital artists alone might tell you different, and I'd be interested to learn about the size of the camera disk drive they used, if it was 'one take'.Emotionally, 1917 is suspenseful, scary, shocking, sad, exciting, nightmarish, and yet: your engagement with the two main characters is more to do with 'what will be thrown at these actors next?', rather than 'what will happen to this person I really care about?'It's like watching someone play a massively multiplayer online WWI game, with graphics and camera movement that blows the competition away because it's actually staged. It's not like feeling anger at the stupidity of war, or feeling grief at the deaths of thousands over a pointless dispute between royal cousins - any Germans certainly get a very rough ride from the script.1917 is impressive in the way 'Saving Private Ryan' was impressive, but not as moving in the way 'Paths Of Glory' and many others were emotionally moving.Ten stars for technique, five for throwing money at a series of old soldiers' gory tales without any more context than, 'Wow, look at this!!'"
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"It's a solid 8/10 war movie but it has problems, the biggest of which is: There's several times in this movie where the main character makes IDIOTIC choices, which directly disadvantage him and puts himself and others into peril. It's honestly poor writing, for the sake of building the drama/suspense... but having the main character in your movie make stupid descisions simply to raise the suspense level is a very scummy writing tactic because the writer hopes that the viewer won't notice it (sorry, but I noticed).As far as the plot goes, it's a good plot, although the main character being a pacifist is dumb and honestly the movie would have been much better if they made the main character not be a pacifist... I mean, it's a battlefield in World War 1, so why would you make your main character a pacifist? I don't really object to it, I just know that the movie would have been better if he actually used his gun a bit more, but hey, they chose to make him a pacifist so it results in a movie with less action and thus in my opinion it's a more boring movie.And the 'one long shot' gimic is done adequately though it's not as good as Birdman (2014), and you can very easily see the moments that the next scene starts because there's always something passing between the field of focus and the camera (that's when you know a cut was made). Anyway, it's a cool gimic which is executed adequately but not executed as well as in Birdman.There's also 2 large plot-holes at 1hr2mins into the movie... Without spoiling anything, I'll just say: Why would the german target 1 lone guy, instead of a whole squad? In real war, any soldier would have JUMPED at the opertunity to shoot as many enemy soldiers as he could... And the 2nd plot-hole here is that it is exactly 55sec from the time that they dropped him off, until the first gunshot goes off, and in 55sec they would be MAYBE 800meters away from him (assuming they drove at 50km/h, which is being generous for army trucks on mud roads), so they would absolutely have heard the gunshots, and would have turned around to render aid to him, which would have changed the course of the entire movie.Overall, it's a good war movie and it'll keep you entertained for 1hr50mins. There ARE better war movies out there, like Fury (2014) or Saving Private Ryan (1998) which are both 10/10 movies, but this one is still a fine war movie at 8/10."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Undoubtedly the best film of 2019. What a masterpiece. And I will go so far and say its the best war movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"" or AT LEAST in the Top 3 of the best ones those past 20 years.
Sam Mendes gave us a realistic impression of what it must have felt like for a soldier of that time in this traumatic environment. The atmosphere he creates is just calling. As an audience you feel like you would be in the middle of this battlefield. Absolutely authentic. It even gave me teary eyes at the end what I did not expect.
The acting is good as well. George MacKey perfectly handles this movie on his own shoulders and will shoot right to stardom with this film. His face constantly mirrored the horror of his surroundings, and this is just one attribute that made his performance so great. Another great performance that is mostly underrated was the one by Dean-Charles Chapman. What made him almost better but at least just as good as MacKay that he developed his character better and there is one particular scene in which he just perfect. (But so is MacKay). Generally you can see both actors are incredibly underrated for their performances - almost criminally. The most prominent cast members Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong had more of cameos but memorable ones to say the least. The score was fantastic and so versatile. Sam Mendes direction is flawless. The decision to make this film look like it was done in one take (or two takes) just adds to the realism. Kudos also to Roger Deakins for his great cinematography and Lee Smith for his editing, to make this effect as great as it turned out.
Its a winner piece. And a film that will be remembered for a long time."
1917,29 March 2020,6/10,"Visually it's absolutely stunning, and the one take is well done (though certainly not perfect).Ultimately though the storyline just doesn't have that much substance, George MacKay as the lead role was poorly chosen and Mendes just had to add pc nonsense that sadly simply wasn't the reality of 1917 Europe.Cameos were fantastically picked though."
1917,9 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is a war film co-written and directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall). Starring George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman, it is a raw, down-to-earth account of a significant moment in the First World War shown off with beautiful cinematography.During World War I on April 6, 1917, one section of the British army are informed that the Germans are faking a retreat as a means to ambush an attacking Battalion of more than 1,600 men. Since the Germans have cut all technological lines of communication, there is no normal way of letting the Battalion know that they are being led into a trap. Left with no other option, two young British soldiers Schofield (George Mackay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are tasked with delivering a handwritten warning letter to the Battalion, with whom the latter's brother is a part of. With time clearly not on their side, the two of them must carefully navigate through dangerous enemy territory to transfer the message before it is too late.Cleverly utilising both landscape and its actors to tell a compelling story, 1917 may be one of the most ingenious war films to grace cinemas in quite some time. Much like Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk before it, the film uses the backdrop of a World War to show how every second counts in just about all important situations. We are constantly on edge over whether or not these brave young men will survive any obstacles they are put through, from the rat-infested trenches of no-man's land to an eerily quiet abandoned farm. The theme of mateship is evidently shown throughout, with both soldiers ready to risk it all to defend each other in the face of these hardships.Co-writer/director Sam Mendes, who based this film on stories his grandfather Alfred told him as a child, brilliantly implements the work of acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins to give the impression that the whole thing is shot in one take. This puts the audience into the perspective of a World War I soldier, feeling all the claustrophobia of the cramped trenches and the shell shock of nearby explosions. There were several moments where I wondered how certain things would be shown to the audience without the need to cut away but each time the film amazingly found ways to do this. This is similar to Alejandro G. Inarritu's 2014 film ""Birdman"" and Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 classic ""Rope"", which were also edited to look like they were filmed in one continuous take. While there are apparently some hidden cuts at times, there is only one that is plainly obvious. I am intrigued to figure out where the other cuts are and repeated viewings should help in that regard.Relatively low-key actors George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman each do a fine job of carrying the film, much like their characters carrying the important message to the unsuspecting Battalion. The decision not to have big name actors in the lead roles works to the film's advantage, as it does not distract from the fact that these are supposed to be normal everyday soldiers who don't stand out in a crowd. With that said, more well known cast members like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Andrew Scott make for welcome additions to the film playing minor but crucial supporting roles.In conclusion, while it may seem that the horrors of war have already been shown off enough by this point, the film proves that if it is told correctly, we can still be informed of how difficult things were for any soldier on the front line risking it all for not only his country but his fellow man. The sense of public duty and overall determination is a powerful thing, and at the end of it all, it is what keeps the human race going as a species.I rate it a solid 9/10"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"Wow - this is a great movie. It's the odyssey of a young solider's journey to deliver a message to a superior officer in trench warfare WW1. The camera follows the solider has he crosses the battlefields, enemy trenches, ruin villages. He sees distant combat and deals with his own battles. The cinematography is haunting, great acting, and despite very little dialogue the writing is masterful. One of the best war movies I've ever seen."
1917,25 March 2020,6/10,"I understand the plaudits for this film, it was really good in many aspects and deserving of its awards and nominations; however, I'm apparently one of only a few that noticed the intellectual dishonesty, the unnecessary sanitization of battle-emotion, that is, when Blake was knifed by the German pilot he and Scofield tried to save, there was no cursing, no racial epithets, in fact, no anger, and that's the problem, no true feelings, inauthentic, sanitized. The film is already rate ""R"" but it was a soft R likely due to mild language and gruesome scenery, so an honest, R-rated display of battle-emotion would've been perfectly fine and accepted, but instead we get PG, not even PG-13 and that's a big hit against the film's authenticity for me, even amidst so much genuine experience."
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,"The GOAT cinematographer Roger Deakins is now just toying with us mere mortals. His latest film is one big flex, proving how a war movie can be shot to appear as one continuous shot. His photography is stunning and basically makes this movie what it is. Sam Mendes provides reliably great direction and Thomas Newman's terrific score is pulse-pounding and urgent. The unknown lead actors are excellent, as are their more famous counterparts. The main flaw of the film is the lack of substantial character development or plot. 1917 is definitely more of a technical achievement than a full-fledged masterpiece as some are claiming. However, the classic trifecta of Mendes, Deakins, and Newman continue to work their magic."
1917,27 April 2020,9/10,"1917 great military drama. There is no pseudogeroity and a lot of patriotic speeches. The story is simple and quite real. And while as in Dunkirk the true enemy is not very often shown, the film keeps in tension throughout time. Yeah, operator 's work, it 's better than what 's in the movie. Made just fine, one of the best films of 2019."
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,"We all talk about story being the paramount bit of making a fantastic movie. Now we big budget blockbusters year round so being amazed by special effects is getting more and more rare. But the cinematography and film making in this was fantastic. Making the movie as if it were one shot was amazing. Saying Roger Deakins is stellar at his job is redundant but he and Mendes make a great team. It was key to this movie being as great as it is, it doesn't feature climactic battle scenes but it is no less thrilling than some other notable pictures in the genre. I'm not a big buff for cinematography, but this was so well captured and masterfully done that I continually was commenting on how beautiful and scary the atmosphere was in this film.While I can't describe 1917 as story focused or dialogue driven, it does run the emotional gauntlet. This movie had me in knots, the tension is thick and they really make you feel the possible consequences their mission failing and how anything could happen at any moment. I've already talked about the cinematography but the flow of the plot brings you in. The unpredictable nature of the story puts you on the edge of your seat and helps you understand how nightmarish and chaotic time this was in history. I laughed (more like chuckled) in this movie, I almost cried and it never felt manipulative or unearned. I was completely drawn in and left the theatre pretty jacked up.Going with some lesser known actors for the leads in this played to this movie's strengths. Some stars going over the line might have been distracting and taken away from the rest of the movie. I didn't realize during that I had seen both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman but they're a long way from 11/22/63 and Game of Thrones. Both are solid and do an appropriate job showing horror of the situation. My favourite in the supporting performances was Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie. I haven't liked him in anything else but Sherlock but he was pitch perfect here. I also liked Colin Firth and Mark Strong in their respective supporting performances. All the acting in the movie gets the job done and there wasn't an obvious weak performance in the bunch.The complaints I had when watching this movie were few to none. My friend complained a little about some slack pacing but I didn't find a dull moment in this movie. There are quieter and more intimate scenes but I think they were included to sell the gravity of the situation and to let the audience catch a breather. If you're expecting a giant fight, then you might be disappointed but its more of a man on a mission story than a wartime epic.1917 shares many things with recent war hit Dunkirk. Both aren't story-driven, they both drop the audience right in the middle of the action and both feature famous players in supporting parts but trust up-and-comers to lead the way. I think 1917 is the superior film, Dunkirk has the action but I think 1917 does a better job of getting you to care about their characters and showing what it will take to overcome these unbelievable circumstances. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly and provided you're not too squeamish (the movie isn't terribly violent but there's plenty of stuff to make your stomach turn), this is well worth seeing on the big screen. Catch it in theatres when you get the chance"
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"I went into this movie wondering why we possibly needed another war film. It is a fair question, especially since this movie does not really bother with deeper philosophical examinations of war, and the story is a bit cliche at points. But Mendes and Deakins accomplished something truly different - I felt like I was in the trenches with the characters, and the journey was absolutely riveting. From the very first moment, the story grabbed me and barely let me breathe. I walked out ready for a drink and a nap. I also have zero idea how they made this movie (the camera shots defied all laws of physics). That said, I am glad they did."
1917,17 February 2020,7/10,"Get more wemon in these roles who aernt just standing within ten feet of an open house. At one point (when the st. Bernard was running on the treadmill) (in a cave) a woman flipped the light on in there saying: are you well, do you need five of my pounds. Now im not jesus or anything, but please, give it a chance for the fe_male gender. They could of at least showed a women in a double sized ford f-150 that had a 3 pound hand."
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"George mackay deserves some kind of prize, just for surviving this movie. it's 1917, george and a buddy have to deliver a message, before it's too late. lots of ""you are there"" action. sam mendes does a great directing job. even if you hate war movies, this one's for you."
1917,5 February 2020,9/10,"Much has been made about the technical achievements with this film, the editing creating the illusion of the single take and the long, carefully choreographed shots needed to achieve that. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in this, I stopped counting at five shots though, because of course that's not it's core strength. Granted it does anchor you in the action, you're right there, something not to be sniffed at, but it's the story and those involved that pulls you in. 1917 is as visceral and terrifying as you'd expect. It'll have your jaw quivering on the floor. The story of two young soldiers attempting to get a message, in a race against time, to save hundreds of their like from near certain death, as the Germans plan a surprise attack. Cramped trenches, open countryside, shell beaten towns, people drifting in and out of the narrative. It could've been complicated, but it's the simplicity that shines here and allows the cinematic hopelessness to weigh on you. If there's one thing that films like this share, it's the common portrayal of the pointlessness of war. Lives lost, friends lost, clinging on to hope and humanaity. To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle to put this into words, but it's brutal, amazing, with a brilliant cast all at the top of their game. Stunning."
1917,13 January 2020,6/10,"I've been griping for years for a WW1 movie that would show the real ugliness of that war, and here we are with ""Saving Private Ryan"" story. Get the message to the front before something bad happens. It so happens, the brother of one of the travelers is at the front lines about to face certain death.
While that is an engaging premise, the execution is...well, let's just say there is a reason why there is editing in movies. It's a slog because the travel time is essentially at real time.
Though I will give credit where credit is due, how do you make that remotely interesting. Well, predictably, it's to include townspeople. In the French, a couple of faceless enemy soldiers and running into other soldiers. It couldn't just be a walk. Great. Unfortunately, you start to feel the slowness of the flick. The concept is great, but we missed out on the true ugliness of war, BECAUSE, it most likely is THAT boring. So you see the exercise in it.
Granted...director Sam Mendes does something really great, which is not glorify war. You see a LOT of aftermath.
However, too many dumb things in this movie that anchor it down. The dead run through mortar and gunfire at the end is pure..um...""Dances With Wolves"" or the fact that the Germans couldn't shoot straight to save their lives. Too many questions bog this down. Was there a better solution here? Probably not. This is THE best a WW1 movie could be. I guess. ""Paths of Glory"" is probably better.
All in all, it's not a movie recommended on a streaming platform. It is a theater movie, so go see it there.
The rest, well...I can't say it has a re-watchable quality. I went with a friend who said he would, but I doubt it. Sure a few people here probably wished they hadn't wasted their time in the first place."
1917,19 January 2020,6/10,"The movie makes you travel through one person's perspective which kinda gives a video game feel except the fact that the camera is always facing the person instead of their back but this movie is a perfect of how a single person's perspective alone could make wonders to a movie. It simply takes you through the rollercoaster ride of people on the battlefield, it feels so rough and tough that you'd feel pity for them all even in the movie, leave alone the real battlefield. The cinematography is just flawless, it simply shows you off the reality of the war field, watching it in the IMAX screen makes it more real, even without a 3D. No wonder that this film has been nominated for the Oscars, after all, they've been awarding the movies where the protagonist goes through a life-threatening journey and finally comes out as a winner by honing his survival skills."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"It's been a while since Sam Mendes's last feature film. Spectre was quite a disappointment but I'm sure that 1917 will be a definite crowdpleaser.1917 follows two British soldiers who are assigned a task to deliver a message in order to stop 1,600 men from dying.Like Birdman, the main selling point is how the entire film looks like it's been shot in one single take. Through long demanding long takes and clever editing, the makers were able to achieve this. Whilst Birdman was shot in a very small area, 1917 traverses through many different locations which makes it really difficult to achieve the goal they were going for. What we got in the end is nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. You never feel bored since the location and action that takes place feel extremely real. This movie acts like a VR game as it genuinely feels like you are there with them about to embark on a perilous journey that may prove to be fatal.Roger Deakens has always been my favourite cinematographer and here he gives it his all. If he wins an Oscar for Best Cinematography, I wouldn't be surprised. The way the camera moves in front and behind the characters is fantastic. There are some absolutely gorgeous shots including one with George MacKay running which is just a feast for your eyes. What impressed me the most was the use of lighting during the dark scenes. There is one which involves flares and it's incredible how Deakens lit the scene up just using that. I really have to commend Deakens and Mendes for their work here. Making a war film seem like it's done in one shot is not easy at all but they managed to do it extremely well.Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were required to do a lot for this movie but they both gave off very believable performances. On the other hand, their characters could have been better. Through the whole film it's very hard to care about both of them since we don't learn much about them. There is a very important scene that tried to bring an emotional reaction from me but I could not feel it due to how one dimensional the characters are. If Mendes and Wilson-Cairns tried to flesh out the characters more then this film would be much better.Altogether, this is a great achievement that should be viewed in the cinemas to get the full experience. The lighting, acting and camerawork are all done with tremendous skill. 1917 could have been better in terms of its writing but the aesthetics are what make this film unique from the other war films. Roger Deakens deserves another Oscar for this film and I have no doubt he will win it."
1917,14 January 2021,9/10,"The second best movie I saw in 2019 is an excellent movie in all respects, especially the photography and the visual effects were great, and using the one-shot method of photography was a good choice. The acting in the movie was excellent, especially in the shot of Blake's murder. I wasn't expecting the actor for Blake's character to reach the level required, but he surprised me with an excellent performance, all of the cast performed excellently, and the weak part in the film was the lack of war scenes that were almost. Nothing, the film's story was excellent and exceeded my expectations, the film greatly exceeded my expectations"
1917,17 March 2020,9/10,"2019 is the year of some of the best films ever made. Parasite was a revelation. I couldn't watch 1917 in theatres because I was sick. I saw it in the largest possible format and the biggest screen I could find and it was totally worth it. This is a movie you should pay and watch. This is pure film making art. The direction, cinematography, editing, music, production design, makeup and costume, acting and all other departments were just simply perfect. I don't know which I liked more, Parasite or 1917. But I could say that I enjoyed both these films very much and these movies were one of the best cinematic experience I ever had. Hats off to everyone who worked towards this and to the soldiers who fight the wars."
1917,28 March 2020,9/10,"With all due respect to parasite, Sam Mendes's masterpiece is an incredible movie. A journey of two soldiers to the enemy lines in order to call of the attack on the enemy turns to be a bloody scenario of survival and time running out. A pure fantastic movie in one shots deserve much more appreciation then any other movie this year at the academy awards."
1917,24 January 2020,7/10,"The movie is technically perfect. Beautiful shots (not, it's not a single shot) all over the place and one of the best cinematography works I've ever seen.However, it lacks passion, good characters and a more compelling story. The first 30 minutes are really boring and, even if it gets much better after that, you never really care about the characters.It's good enough because it looks great and you always want to see what will be the next beautiful shot. Watch it like an episode of Planet Earth, however don't expect a cinema masterpiece."
1917,23 January 2020,8/10,"Brilliantly shot, mostly at waist level, and cunningly edited to give the impression of a real-time sequence, 1917, like Spielberg's WARHORSE in 2011, presents as authentic impression of trench warfare as we are likely to see. Not just barbed wire and bomb craters, the two lance corporals crawl over rotting human corpses and dead horses to get to the German lines. There are a couple of overdone sequences which trip the movie into Indiana Jones territory, but mostly you do feel that this really is how it must have been for our grandfathers and great-grandfathers.In the key roles Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are totally ""right"" for the story and the period. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott are shoehorned into cameos. It's a tough two hours to sit through, almost as grueling as a Holocaust story, and it rams home the message that - extraordinary heroism and sheer endurance apart - there was nothing Great about the Great War."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"It has great presentation values and it succeeds as a moving tribute to the men who fought in the Great War, but as a movie, it doesn't really excel. There are many things I liked about it, such as the tension at the start, the depiction of life in the trenches, the artistic way the horrors of war are presented, the fact you're never quite sure what's going on in the bigger picture and it really does emphasize the pointlessness of the whole concept of war. However, the actual events that occur along the way feel too staged and don't flow into each other very well, and everything just kind of happens with little fuss. The acting and the music is good and the focus on the human side is more grounded because of the destruction, but I never felt the urgency, which is after all, the main plotline."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a very good film in general, but it's the way it's shot that marks it as an artistically cutting-edge film. It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man."
1917,17 November 2020,8/10,"I've titled it ""visually amazing"" because when watching this film it's something that is just that good you can't help but keep complimenting. The cinematography is absolutely brilliant. The one shot technique is something that isn't really used in films and it's done so well and works with the plot. The scenery, lighting and just the set display is all incredible, honestly beautiful to watch.However, people don't watch films for good camera work and sets. Is the story any good? And I think it's very good. My only concern regarding the storyline is that I feel it loses steam past the half way point. The dynamic and tone of the film changes after the hour mark and it's quite noticeable. I think this is what stops this film being a 9 or 10/10. Other than that though I think it's a brilliant film that needs to be seen if you haven't watched already."
1917,9 September 2020,10/10,"I'm really astonished about this move. In particular about the unique shooting technique. My eyes appreciate it.
The story is simple and cute. Another particular thing is that there are not so many dialogs, at the end. Or I have this sensation.
The acting is not perfect, the main character (George McKay) has not so many facial expression but he did his job.The fact that this movie is based on true events, on the grandpa memories, makes it more significant.I can't comprehend why this movie didn't get the Oscar. Maybe is just a personal taste, but I think that this is better than the one that won it."
1917,29 October 2021,4/10,"If you didn't know what WWI was like, well it was even worse than depicted.For all the drama and lack of any real plot, I found myself questioning many things. Not least of all how all the papers and photographs were dry and why the abandoned German trenches contained no bodies, and how Will survived the rock fall and why they showed no caution to the German pilot etc, etc, etc.Towards the end I was reminded of Gallipoli, the one with Mel Gibson, it was very similar."
1917,1 May 2021,10/10,"The combo of Roger Deakins' cinematography + Sam Mendes' storytelling of this World War 1 event is simply beautiful. One of my favorite movies of 2019, and possibly my favorite war movie."
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"First, I really like war movies like Saving private Ryan, Apocalypsis Now or The thin Red Line. Second, 1917 is a pretty good film with an excellent cinematography. Third, the camera work and the only few CGI effects are amazing too. But, on the other hand, the script here is not quite original and the storyline is quite weak. To add, some scenes looks like unrealistic or unbelievable.
So, overall a pretty good war film but not a masterpiece like Saving Private Ryan. Enjoy."
1917,19 February 2020,9/10,"This film surpassed my expectations and they were high! The direction, sound, costumes, sets and pacing were spot on. The cinematography was astonishing. Great writing too. This film was on par with Saving Private Ryan. Not as much character development. But not required for the telling of this story. A simply spectacular film."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Everything is just great. This movie captures our emotions by sticking us to the main characters. The cinemetography is soo good, it tell stories without words."
1917,16 January 2021,5/10,A fairly weak story padded out with the hope it would draw the audience in but unltimately leaves you feeling that it was predictable and too long. In some ways reminds my of Lawrence of Arabia in that it is long on cinema but not that much actually happens and consequently I think many will find their attention wandering with looks at the clock.
1917,27 February 2020,1/10,"It's a kind of virtual ride through a WWI battlefield. It has nothing to offer in terms of plot, dialogue, character development, or emotion. It's just entertainment, like everything else these days. I wouldn't watch it again. Zero for artistic value. The only possible value it might have would be to show young generations what trench warfare in WWI used to look like. Minus the murderous German pilots. That's just ridiculous. One final note: I know what you did with the Scofield reference. The 'Scofield Bible' from 1917 by any chance? Or has it more to do with the Balfour Declaration from 1917?"
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,This movie was filmed brilliantly. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. I felt the movie didn't have enough of a storyline for best film of the year. I do see the movie taking home an Oscar for cinematography.
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"The story follows Corporals Blake and Schofield as they're given a mission to cross into enemy territory to deliver a message to a Colonel about to step into a German trap. The film follows along roughly in real time as the two men traverse trenches, no man's land, and abandoned towns, taking every opportunity to show us the horrors of war along the way. They meet a variety of side characters who help them move from one setpiece to the next, all while the camera follows keenly, never cutting away from what they see or how they react. As far as story goes, there honestly isn't all that much to it. It's a straight-forward story of a journey from point A to point B. No frills, no mind-bending twists, no flashbacks. The story is secondary to the experience the film wants to immerse you in.The most obvious way the film immerses you in the theatre of war is with its relentlessly promoted use of long shots and hidden cuts. If I was a pernickety critic, I'd point out it's actually two composite long-shots rather than just a single one thanks to a cut to black roughly in the middle, which makes the gimmick feel almost superfluous. If you're going to make a film with the goal of it being a single long-shot, don't cut it to black in the middle. Of course the reason they do this is so they don't have to tackle with the problem of dusk. Dusk is already a difficult time of day to film in, but to somehow capture the transition from day to night in a composite long-shot would be almost impossible. It also helps narratively by placing the climax of the movie in the early morning without the film being twelve hours long.So I can see why they made that decision, but ultimately I feel like if it was really that necessary, the film should have eschewed the gimmick and been filmed and edited more traditionally, using the concept of long-shots more sparingly to make certain scenes stand out above others. When you make the whole movie a long-shot, you're making the visceral trek across no man's land just as significant as an uneventful trek through the woods. The walk through the woods didn't particularly gain anything from being a long-shot, nor did any sequence of events at the farmhouse or in the truck, and bringing them up to the level of the no man's land scene, the numerous trench scenes, and the Écoust sequence kind of cheapened the experience for me.All that said, on a purely technical basis, the use of long-shot was phenomenal. This was easily some of the best composite editing I've ever seen. In fact knowing it was going to be a long-shot kind of ruined the experience for me because I spent the whole time trying to spot the cuts. There are some obvious ones like complete blackout when they move from an exterior to an interior, and of course clever use of obstacles in the foreground like walls and trees, but there are many more that I couldn't spot. For instance there's one during the plane crash and I couldn't spot it even though I've seen a video pointing it out. God knows how many more of those kind of cuts I missed. There's a couple more as well that are a bit obvious when Schofield jumps down into something (once into a crater and second into a river). You can tell there's a cut because his jump is CGI'd in in order to match the two shots together. Regardless the camera moves so smoothly from one moment to another that most the time it's impossible to tell. Watch out for the river scene. There must have been cuts there, complicated by the turbulent waters, but I couldn't see any. The illusion of moving from one scene to another is maybe only spoiled by so many landmarks being seemingly so close together. Thanks to all the difficulties they encounter along the way to slow them down, the actual walk unimpeded would've taken less than two hours.The use of lighting is also remarkable, especially in the Écoust sequence with the blazing fire creating Deakins' favoured single-source of light, but then complicating matters with a number of flares that go up and cast ever-shifting shadows on the walls of the ruins. They had to map this sequence out with a model of the entire town and a moving torch in order to track the shadows movements before filming, and that alone is worth kudos. Other than that though, 1917 is a fairly subtle film for Deakins. It's never particularly pretty, and the long-shot gimmick prevents the opportunity for fixed camera compositions, but that's not what this movie is about. Deakins manages to craft a visual identity fitting for this movie that services every need while showing off in more subtler ways.Acting was pretty good across the board. George MacKay manages to hold the emotional weight of the film on his shoulders from beginning to end (or tree-slump to tree-slump) as Corporal Schofield, playing a young man already disillusioned with war. He's already earned a medal, and given it away, longing only to get back to his family. He comes across as cold and distant for much of the film, because he's a soldier with an important mission that must be done, no matter how unhappy he feels about it. Dean-Charles Chapman is also really good as Corporal Blake, offering the perfect counter to Schofield's pessimism. He's driven, enthusiastic, kind-hearted, and wouldn't mind a little bit of glory on the side. While he doesn't ignore the horrors of war, he certainly perceives them differently to Schofield, assuring him that while the cherry blossom trees may have been cut down, they'll only grow back in larger numbers.The various cameos of side-characters are all great as well. Colin Firth is perfectly cast as the General, no nonsense and straight to the point. Mark Strong's Captain is a warmer fellow, encountering the boys at their lowest and giving them a leg up and a word of warning. Andrew Scott almost steals the show as a Lieutenant on the frontlines with a blasé and matter-of-fact attitude towards what's going on around him. Benedict Cumberbatch is a slice of antagonism in the Colonel, but manages to escape any cliché in his small screen time, delivering one of the most brutal lines in the whole film. And finally Richard Madden as the older Blake brother gives an emotional turn, although I did find it somewhat hilarious that this film described Robb Stark as an older lookalike of Tommen Baratheon.1917 almost lives up to everything it promised (it's two long-shots, not one). War is not pretty. It's horrible and intense, and a simple trek through five miles of fields is fraught with danger around every corner, from the places you'd least expect. The barren wasteland is not as barren as it would appear, still hiding civilians and enemy stragglers (who hit like stormtroopers, I'll add). 1917 is an experience more than anything, and it's an experience I would gladly have again. I give it a solid 8/10."
1917,18 June 2020,9/10,"As the title says, the movie has some minor flaws which irritated me, but that can't deny the genius of the simple, yet interesting story. For those who are looking for big battles, stop looking here. This is more a psychological journey through WW1 than a movie about battles itself. Whole movie is basically characters traveling. And if that isn't your cup of tea, simply don't watch it. Movie has some beautiful and emotional scenes and the whole idea of filming everything in a way that it looks like one shot is great. Also, it's worth noting that for a war movie, it isn't too hard on the subject, so you can watch it without problem without mentally preparing for it. I give it 9/10! I recommend it wholeheartedly!"
1917,27 January 2020,6/10,"Having read a lot of history, this movie falls a bit short in the realism dept. The story is paper thin and unbelievable. Cineamatics are nice. The soldiers are unbelievably undertrained and would not have been chosen for such a vital mission. The main soldier should have been killed many times over due to poor choices. Felt like watching a Commando like movie with soldiers unable to hit targets 20 ft in front of them."
1917,18 October 2020,7/10,"I'm a sucker for a good war epic. This film was certainly long enough to be considered an 'epic'. Unfortunately, there just isn't much to write about '1917' (2019). The casting was fine, but there were no great performances. As a matter of fact, no one really says much throughout the film. The underdeveloped characters go about their business and advance the story. I've seen this film three times now, and I never really get too invested. Because of the release date, some people will confuse this film with 'Dunkirk'. This is not on the same level of filmmaking as 'Dunkirk' (2017).RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"...Much more than Dunkirk, 1917 feels like a compliment to Saving Private Ryan, and, if you'll pardon the obvious connection, a brother film to it. While Spielberg houses Saving Private Ryan in a groundbreaking, bombastic and terrifying shell to shock a reminder to the world of the sacrifices made in recent history to afford us our freedom and complacency, 1917 is a love letter to those who never gave up, and enlisted a purity of spirit to see their missions to their end. And like Saving Private Ryan, Sam Mendes does this with no less bravura and potency.In many ways, despite the comparisons, 1917 is the antithesis of Dunkirk, a film that is more of an exercise than a cinematic experience, one that strains the limits of its medium in a different way, a finely tuned watch turned out and rearranged in front of you, and with a sadistic and pervading intent to accost and unbalance you immediately and not let go until the final moments.1917, however, goes out of its way to show you the linearity and simplicity of its thrust; the trenches, such as they were designed to be, are the perfect proof of concept to get the audience on board and lulled to this new version of cinema presentation with the long takes. The film takes the time to show you the world through environmental storytelling (not the first time in this review I'll reference video games!) and whereas Gravity put its bland characters and dialogue front and centre, 1917 carefully uses the extra characters and dialogue as a subconscious layer or normality, to draw you in to a hypnotic trance as Deakins' camerawork and lighting slowly pulls out of the faces of the leads their grief or exhaustion, wracked with unimaginable thoughts we are blessed never to have to think.And as such, and due to its vibrant camera work and unstuffy photography, it doesn't feel twee or old at all. The approach of ensuring 1917 didn't feel rote or samey and instead feel exceptionally present and modern and human also allows it to be relatable and less of an archive document and more resonant to now.Many of Deakins' shots are incredible. In fact almost all of them are, not content with stitching multiple long takes together, Mendes/Deakins et al have crafted a million moving paintings. And the long takes are a thing of beauty; a few conveniently placed rocks or cuts to black in the cloth of someone's back notwithstanding, this is the absolute best I've seen this kind of technology and approach being used. It's a far cry from the awkward shoehorning of some of Birdman's obvious cuts and even pips Cuaron's Children of Men for most impactful use of long takes.This is most felt in moments of real loss. The camera, lingering there as we know it will, injected into me a deep sadness at the normality of death, the general lack of significance or theatricality. The acting then benefits greatly from these long takes, the characters feeling like they are ebbing and flowing physically and emotionally towards and away from us as if we're running to keep up with a busy friend, afraid we'll lose them. As they draw away they seem to emotionally retreat into themselves, and when we're gifted a close up, it's such a palpable and tacit moment that it eclipses theatre (the medium compared to 1917 most in early interviews) by proving us with the heartbreaking simplicity of looking into another's face. Mark Strong acts up a treat in the small part he's in and he's an enigmatic and welcome role and one that proves he can still act beyond generic villains with unconvincing American accents.1917 owes a great debt to video games; the walking simulator, the first person shooter and the stealth game. Certain moments feeling like they are ripped directly from video games; the tense barren walk listening for gunfire or footsteps, twitch finger on the trigger ready for when that enemy rounds the corner in Call of Duty, will you shoot or flee? Or those moments of respite and story in Metro, between the gunfire and struggle, as you wander through an enclave of survivors, or silently taking down an enemy as you spin the camera around to see if his mate can see you in his cone of vision. All these moments are fresh and immediate in a way that's missing from something like Dunkirk. However, I don't think that's the only reason for this, I think that using much more of a recognised first person perspective approach mirrors the diaries and letters and journals chronicling World War I and so 1917 manages to be authentic my borrowing from a very modern medium and arches backwards by reaching forwards.I'm intrigued why, besides in order to advance the timeline, that Mendes chose to put that single obvious cut in the film. And I'm not sure I liked or needed the subtitles, it pulled me right out of the experience and reminded me I was watching a film and it served little purpose, especially because the French was designed to be simple and he didn't really understand it anyway. I'm reminded of Polanski and his one regret with Chinatown when he wished he'd put the image on a camera lens upside down as it would have been in real life but for studio pressure he relented and put it the incorrect way for clarity. I wonder if Mendes would look back on this the same way.But that notwithstanding the film is close to flawless. And despite being half an hour longer than Dunkirk, it doesn't feel it and I wouldn't have taken anything out. Interestingly it must have been tight and bold screenplay to allow for almost no wiggle room and little retiming. I guess that's Mendes' theatre experience kicking in. The film is full of little moments but they are the most meaningful parts. In some slim ways I thought Tarkovsky may be proud of it, and I had partial and welcome Stalker and Andrei Rublev flashbacks.The film is essentially about you and this soldier. And how much you really connect with him is a testament to how earned and fist-pumping the more (brief) saccharine moments are. There's a close up towards the end of the film and I felt as if I could read the characters mind and I was completely urging him to make the decision I knew he would make anyway. That's powerful stuff and a feeling I never really get in cinema very much anymore.Those moments are swept up, bolstered, underscored or otherwise lifted by Thomas Newman's incredible score. Newman, not a stranger to iconic, recognisable and listen-to-able scores manages to do the impossible (for him) and creates a powerful score that doesn't immediately sound like his work. It's a score that tells all that's missing in a scene without the film having to resort to exposition. It's not an an obvious score until it wants to be. And it's a world away from Zimmer's now predictable cacophony even though it sometimes scantily resembles it in places.There was a moment in the film, a very deliberate moment of drama and arch-power when I realised what an aural and visual treat this movie was. It was like being on the stage of an opera; it was grandiose and energetic and flamboyant and iconic and at the centre was this small figure running through what for many could have been their afterlife. This ""afterlife"" moment felt like adrenaline itself; not shock, just awe; danger, fragility, beauty and purity. I have never wanted a moment in a movie, without realising it, more. It was cinematic bliss. Good job 1917. My day started and I was at work. But by the end of it, I was exactly where I wanted to be."
1917,11 March 2020,9/10,"1917 is a visual masterpiece and perhaps one of the best big screen experiences I've had (it probably helps that I saw this at the BFI IMAX). 1917 lays bare the brutality and horror of war in a way I've rarely seen before, creating some incredibly moving and powerful cinema.A great deal of this praise is due to the technical prowess of the film. The decision to phrase this film as one take created a ticking time bomb feel a cultivated a real closeness with the characters. It truly felt like we were on this journey with Blake and Schofield, experiencing the horror and tension alongside them.The way that the film flips from eerie quiet to panic and chaos was masterful. I was never quite sure what would be coming next, echoing the unknown adventure that both men embarked on.Mendes' crowning glory in his career has to be the final 20 minutes of this film. Him and Deakins produced a truly stunning shot as Schofield ran across the line, perhaps one of the most visual stunning and emotional shots I've seen. I was so moved by the final 20 minutes of the film as the futility of war was presented so expertly.1917, while perhaps a little thin on plot and script is an incredibly moving and powerfil portrayal of war. Mendes' direction and Deakins' cinematography were some of the best you'll see, making 1917 the finest WWI movie I've ever seen."
1917,13 January 2020,5/10,"More an exercise in film-making than entertainment. Music totally inappropriate for a modern audience. I just didn't like the approach of the single camera set-up. I want to see actors interacting, not a disembodied voice off-screen. And the lack of a physical face-to-face enemy took away a lot of the terror of war. I love war movies but maybe this isn't really one! Just left me feeling flat. 5/10 for effort. (viewed 1/2020)"
1917,6 June 2020,9/10,"Much reminds me about Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk here - in that they're both war films which technically stunning, but are also laced with heart and soul. The cinematography will prove to be a high point in the career of Roger Deakins - a career littered with more remarkable achievements than most working in any area of film. Somehow he conjured images and moment of striking beauty, nightmarish hellscapes, touching intimacy - all without sacrificing the narrative propulsion which the apparent one-take style serves; we're left with the sense that this story is but one part of an endlessly, relentlessly flowing river which is sweeping a whole generation mercilessly along.Remarkable though his work is, it's not just Deakins' achievements that should be mentioned. The visual effects are more or less faultless; Thomas Newman's omnipresent score is startling; the story itself replete with razor-wire tension, humanity and emotion. It all manages to evoke the hell of war without giving in to the increasingly tiresome war-is-hell cinema clichés we've grown so accustomed to.What's rarely mentioned are the two central performances by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, perfectly understated enough to draw us in and take us into the heart of ordinary people caught up in events no one should ever have to experience.1917 is a brilliant, exhausting, thrilling, moving achievement to stand alongside Dunkirk to make a pair of modern war films that will stand as pillars of the genre."
1917,22 February 2020,8/10,"The camera makes the story. technically brilliant. We're positioned like in a role playing game. Based on intense angels, slow moving pictures that forces the audience to watch and watch and watch, and be in the middle of the war.The story is slow narrated. You feel the war, but you never see the face of an enemy. Its lonely, quiet. The soldier with its mission. And just like this, the movie ends."
1917,6 April 2020,8/10,"As a veteran, it's hard to watch some war movies. The grotesque brutality that man can have for man is violent and not pretty. This seems to get more personal the further back you go in history. This is a movie about WW1, a lot of hand-to-hand combat. It is in your face and non-stop. There is some ""fog of war"" and indiscriminate death and mayhem. The story is compelling and real. It is well acted and well told. The cinematography is astounding, award winning. Check it out."
1917,7 February 2020,6/10,"Give us a break. The movie is ok but nothing new, utter predictable, I do not know why this movie is expected to win The Academy Awards. Parasite is 100 better than this film."
1917,6 April 2020,7/10,"Because, much of the movie has been made by using of ""one single shot"" (very linear plot) approach (like in the Birdman) for me, after an about one hour of its runtime ""1917"" became little bit too much and dull experience. There are long stretches without dialogue, while the movie which is treating one of the titanic events of modern times is largely conventional and intellectually shallow. Actually, the uncomplicated screenplay retreads classic war film themes without anything new to say. At the same time, while watching ""1917"" there is a sense that you are waiting for an interesting point but that never comes, mostly because audiences really don't need ""1917"" to tell them in 2020 that war is hell. In the movie, there are two real stars - one is cinematographer Roger Deakins and the other is George MacKay. As much acclaim Dean-Charles Chapman and director Sam Mendes are gettin, it's MacKay that is the break out star. Ultimately, you get the idea that the basic script was one hour long. ""1917"" is a decent war film, but after all the buzz, I was disappointed.Rating: 7+ Just because of the first 60 minutes of almost perfection"
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"A riveting journey from quiet beginning to cathartic and captivating end. The real-time, one-shot concept is effective but would not have worked as well as it did without the excellent camerawork, production design, and performances. Far from a mere technical exercise, here the fear, the mud, the tears, and the blood are all too real and heart-wrenching (stand-out moments include no-man's land, tragedy at the farm, the petals on the river (sob), talking to baby, surreal song in the forest)."
1917,19 May 2020,10/10,"Stunning, everything, Music, directions, cinematography , performance ......the movie is also ONE SHOT , like there is no transition, which more stunning.the movie should n must watch on BIG screen and bad ass speakers."
1917,4 April 2020,7/10,"1917'1917' is a technically impressive war movie from Director Sam Mendes.
Impressive because of the way in which it has been filmed. A continuous one long shot that tells the story of two soldiers during World War One.
They are tasked with delivering a message that will prevent 1600 soldiers from walking into a deadly trap.
In actual fact there's secret edits throughout the movie but Mendes and editor Lee Smith seamlessly hide these from the audience to create a real-time experience.
'1917' is a captivating movie and it's been heaped with praise since its release. It's good no doubt but I won't follow like sheep and say it's up there with the best of them.Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay take on the daring mission. A race against time to stop hundreds of men from meeting their demise.
There's some wonderful set pieces and unexpected turns that will keep the audience invested but this is a war movie that never truly ignites.
There's no 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Hacksaw Ridge' levels of grandiose.
Like those films it delivers a realistic depiction of war but not to the same scale.
In my opinion it's never magnificent enough to be up there with the best war movies ever made. My personal favourite being the aforementioned
'Saving Private Ryan'.Mendes's film looks crisp and detailed in High Definition. Camerawork is supremely handled as the lens sweeps and cascades around war torn environments. Sound is also handled expertly and fans of the genre won't be disappointed.
I certainly enjoyed this movie and recommend you guys check it out."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"The expectations for ""1917"" were huge - and not let down. This was my 7th Sam Mendes movie & the 4th 10/10, earned truthfully. Teaming up with the master of craft Roger Deakins and successfully casting a stellar lead - George MacKay, Mendes has orchestrated an exhilarating journey through the horrors of war.Amazing filmmaking mastery, every element of it at play in ""1917"", makes it one of the (if not 'the') best war epics of the 21st century, taking its rightful place besides the great ""Saving Private Ryan"" in my book. It's not a movie with an extensive plot, but rather a tightly packed depiction of the fundamentals of war. As we're following - quite literally - our main protagonist William Schofield, he takes us through all the dirt, mud, blood, sweat and bullets, while also never forgetting the meaning of friendship, companionship and all that's beautiful inside a man. George MacKay truly shines in a portrayal that feels intimate to the viewer. While unmistakably being the very central character, the rest of the cast plays their parts excellently as well. One can't begin to compliment enough the aesthetical pleasures of ""1917"", it's masqureeding as a one-shot movie, very impressively so, and shows off an effortful down-to-the-last-detail production design. Really, it must be the best looking, most jaw-dropping war movie since the 1998's ""Saving Private Ryan"". Original score is no less impressive & I'm willing to bet the lot of us were happily surprised (and soon emotional) when hearing the ""Poor Wayfaring Stranger"" far away in the woods.Believe all the people who recommend experiencing ""1917"" on the biggest screen You can find - they are absolutely right. Sam Mendes's latest is an impressive feat, a breathtaking cinematic expierence, a war film with as much horror as heart. My rating: 10/10."
1917,28 February 2021,4/10,"Like most WWI and WWII movies made today, this one looks like modern day actors playing soldier, all lacking military bearing, speech, phrasing and decorum of the time. If the viewer thinks to ask, what brand hair oil from the year 1917 might these two message runners use, the answer at the shampooed non-oiled fluffy hair is, of course, none because men today do not use hair cream. The movie is 1917, and clearly not made in 1917.Also, like most big war movies made by nonmilitary people, when out in the open at the front lines, the actors mostly look 10 to 15 feet ahead. They do not have ""the 1000 yard gaze"" and do not rubberneck their view to constantly be aware of 360° of their environment.But there is a special problem with the movie 1917 that makes it tough to watch through to the end, and that is that it has a clear bothersome pattern, or dramatic plot giveaway. As the two messengers are trekking, urgently moving on their mission, there is no drama. As the two messengers are moving, we see they are not at risk. But each time they stop to explore (and this is weird because stopping and exploring is not part of their urgent mission), each time they stop, great problems fall upon them.One problem is booby-traps by the retreating enemy. You would think that once the first booby-trap is found and inflicts a painful toll, the two messengers would be extremely cautious to even think about stopping and exploring again, but they do. And yes, as they have stopped and are spending time exploring without caution, more great problems fall upon them.Also, after experiencing a booby-trap first hand, even if stopping again to recklessly touch and explore things around them was somehow acceptable, there should still be some concern for the two messengers that the outdoor paths and wood boardwalks that were all enemy territory just hours ago are now mined. Actually, the Germans made extensive use of anti-tank landmines during WWI. Landmines were the ""cheap"" weapon of WWI. Yet, although complicated booby-traps were set by the Germans in the movie 1917, no quick and easy landmines are on the main paths of the newly abandoned German territory, and these two actors seem to know there are no landmines as they walk on top of boardwalks and paths.1917 is less than realistic."
1917,13 December 2020,6/10,"""1917"" presents a day of World War I, when two British soldiers were sent to deliver a message traversing 6 miles along no man's land after the communication lines were cut to stop an attack, which can jeopardize the lives of 1600 soldiers in the battalion, including the brother of one of them. The story is based on the memoirs of Sam Mendes' grandfather who served in World War I.Undoubtedly, it presents an excellent depiction of the wartime with the realistic trenches and the beautiful landscape with war seen as an aberration to the beautiful nature. The film is a superb work of cinematography and delivers the expectation from Sam Mendes. However, the story lacks the layers and feels a bit bland, which overall makes it an unengaging watch. Overall, the film is excellent in terms of the period details and cinematography, but the film overall lacks the grip and finer nuances in its narration, which holds the excitement.Rating: 2 stars out of 4"

."
1917,26 December 2019,,"The film follows a standard four-act narrative structure. Each act has only one shot, which, as you can imagine, is an extremely long take. The cinematographers and production designers must have done some impossible work.Under this immersive and atmospheric setup, you see what the protagonists saw, hear what the protagonists heard, and feel what the protagonists felt. This is one of the most realistic, intense and hard-hitting thrillers I've ever seen. That's why I don't recommend this movie. You will be traumatized by the film, even long after you finish watching it."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"A masterpiece. Sam Mendes's finest film since American Beauty, and an unexpected achievement. Brilliant performances by the two otherwise unknown lead actors and tasteful casting choices on the smaller cameo type of roles. Astonishing effects and visual accomplishment. If this wins any Oscars, it deserves them all.Everyone is already saying it, but the most groundbreaking and impressive part is how the entire film appears to be one non-stop shot. Though the director admittedly used editing tricks to achieve this, it makes no difference as the viewing experience is greatly enhanced by this filmmaking choice. The entire film really does feel like a gripping rollercoaster with only very brief periods of coasting, or rest. It's an electric film-viewing experience that stands on it's own in the entire history of film, and it's one that everyone should take."
1917,22 March 2020,9/10,"Finally, in 2019, weep tears that don't let us hate-when Schofield was sitting in the truck compartment, surrounded by other brothers, he looked at the distant village from the god, which is almost the most heartbreaking in 2019 It's time."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"So I decided to see this on my 22nd birthday - as I'd been wanting to watch it ever since I'd viewed the first trailer upon its release - & what a gift 1917 turned out to be!Intense, thrilling, enthralling, emotional, captivating; a remarkable technical achievement - insanely complex with its inventive ingenuity & yet made to looks so easy & simplistic as a stunningly immersive cinematic experience.Not a single ounce of the awe or admiration I had for the sheer craft of this film detracted from the story as the audience & I witnessed it unfold.Regardless of the outstanding level of meticulous consideration made for each & every frame of the movie's genius visual progression, we were all absolutely encapsulated, glued to our seats & eventually left the theatre as one collective mass of blubbering messes.Roger Deakins continuously surprises; I naively presumed Blade Runner 2049 would be defined as his career best & in decades to come, we'd look back & label it as the point in which his work eventually ""peaked""... But then within just 2 films & 2 years later, he returns to obliterate his previous accomplishments, blowing what we thought we knew of his capabilities right out of the water, exceeding expectations immediately.Not only that but more importantly, Sam Mendes manages to expertly capture the unending horrors of war - depicting its grim brutality & inhumanity whilst also providing contrasting glimpses of it in the serenely quieter, contemplative moments, whilst conveying the general desperation for peace - reminding us that those who fought were not two dimensional military caricatures but normal men thrust in to an abnormal & hopeless situation - one they were never accustomed to or ever fully prepared for. Their battles weren't valiant or heroic - the conflicts erupted from the struggles of survival. Additionally, the violence isn't glorified or portrayed as inherently good, but morbidly necessary in the intent of preserving life. It's this moral ambiguity which prevents the feature from becoming clichéd.The astonishing production design, the strikingly intelligent & concise writing, the breathtaking cinematography, the faultless direction, the subtly masterful editing & the incredible music (major praise given to Thomas Newman for crafting such a fierce & tense score); all of this culminated to form what can only be described as a genuine masterpiece."
1917,7 January 2020,5/10,"""1917"" is technically impressive. The entire movie is filmed with some clever cuts in a way that makes it look like a single shot (similar to the style of ""Birdman""). This style and the impressive sets give it a lot of realism. Unfortunately, the movie is emotionally empty (with the exception of the two scenes) and the plot is paper thin.

1917,14 March 2020,9/10,"While it's usually history's second world war that gets the most attention from Hollywood, the original ""great war"" gets thrown a bone once in a while. The Sam Mendes-conceived tale of risk, sacrifice, duty and honor that is '1917' is one that should be held on a pedestal as an example of what excellent filmmaking can bring us.To be fair, what really makes '1917' what it is is the masterful cinematography. Mendes uses the camera in ways that make the ugly horrors of war have a sense of beauty. There's not a single film in the genre, with perhaps the exception of 'Saving Private Ryan,' that brings the frontlines to the general audience in a way that puts them right there on the battlefield. We feel for Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) as they are tasked with the impossible mission of delivering a message to a regiment that could be a matter of life or death for thousands of young soldiers.The journey over the hills and trenches of war-torn Western Front is one that we are afraid to follow along with, but we must step up to the plate and grip our seats for the sake of those whose lives are at risk. This is exactly how we all feel while watching '1917,' and any film that can have this effect on viewers deserves all the accolades it can get.It may not have won best picture, but '1917' remains a landmark cinematic milestone for war stories that will be referenced for years to come for its ingenuity."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is definitely a masterpiece. I was sitting in the theater at the end of the movie like wow I just saw the greatest movie ever made. I am usually not speechless, but I am it was fantastic."
1917,14 March 2020,6/10,"Granted, this movie was amazing visually. Lots of eye candy, different sceneries, colors, lights, action. But that's about it. Storywise it was a sequence of scenes many of which the protagonists' actions didn't make a lot of sense or were simply unrealistic. Without spoiling anything, let's just say the main character survived quite a lot and sometimes walked around the battlefield as if he was strolling through a shopping mall. But especially the (few) interactions with the Germans were absolutely ridiculous.
I know there is an unwritten law in the film industry that Germans have to be portrayed as the bad guys at any opportunity, but could they at least make it somewhat believable? There is one particular key scene in this movie where even an absolute German-hater had to think ""oh come on, this makes no sense."" Oh, and also, I wasn't aware that there were so many African and Indian soldiers fighting for Britain in WW1. Political correctness rearing its head to rewrite history again? Well, at least they did it to both sides in this one."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I have a recurring dream.It's a common one.In it I am a soldier trying to evade the grasp of my enemy in a war zone. I sneak around fields, towns, villages often being spotted, running for my life. Sometimes I spot the enemy from afar preparing to attack and a sense of dread overwhelms me. It last all night.The dream interpreters, not particularly surprisingly, suggest this reflects some form of conflict one are facing in one's life.Today, in the cinema I witnessed that dream come to life, imagined by Sam Mendes in a Hades like no other.It's terrifying.Totally and utterly terrifying.It's a true story based on the experience of Mendes' grandfather, Alfred, who shared a fragment of what happened with his grandson.Mendes' career is largely theatre-based, and many film critics believe theatre makers do not make good film makers. Yes, they might be strong on dialogue and characterisation but they tend to be weaker on cinematography.One way to resolve this is to create your movies with Roger Deakins, surely the greatest cinematographer in history - given not only his ridiculously great eye but also the technology he has to further enhance his art.There can be NO doubt that this is as much Deakins' movie as it is Mendes'. He was Oscar nominated 12 times before he finally landed one for Bladerunner 2049 (along the way his greatness has blessed No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Shawshank Redemption, Faro and The Assasination of Jesse James...). This will be his second. There can be no doubt about that.The combination of stunning grading, extremely long takes and unworkeoutable steadycam technique defies logic, description and understanding. It is mesmerising.Remember the first 20 minutes of Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest War movie of all time? Would you agree with me that the remaining 90 minutes is patchy at best? Well, 1917 begins more slowly, but no less electrifyingly, as we settle into Deakins' art. The difference though is that the remaining 90 minutes of 1917 grab you by the throat and do not let off.It's completely overwhelming.Technical movies of this competence don't always have great acting performances. And this won't win George Mackay an Oscar, probably not even a nomination, but he does not let the side down, neither does his supporting actor Dean-Charles Chapman, but although this is SUCH a human story it's the sheer scale and bravado of the overall thing that is what makes it such a compelling piece of filmmaking.Some will lament the fact that this is so, but I believe Mendes has found the balance.One other thing Thomas Newman's soundtrack is so gripping, so menacing that jeopardy is maintained for it's entirety, it's a significant achievement.He has created a nightmare vision that out-horrors even the likes of The Exorcist, because this is no fantasy, this is reality, and it feels like it.Truly a seminal cinema experience. This will only be half the movie on your TV set so get up and get down to your local big screen, before it's too late.Peerless.The movie of the year (although I've yet to see Parasite) in an already epic year."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"""1917"" hits you so hard it will leave you pinned to your seat. A masterful technical achievement and a breathtaking piece of cinema.
.
In this war drama, two young soldiers during the First World War are to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men from walking straight into a deadly trap.
.
Director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", Skyfall"") has always been one of my favourite filmmakers just because he is so subtle, yet makes some of the best films out there. ""1917"" is great and should be seen on the big screen. From the opening scene you will find your eyes glued to the screen and your gut boiling with intensity. Cinematographer Roger Deakins (""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Blade Runner 2049"") holds the bar for his style of creating beauty and pulse pounding frames, especially here with his ""one-shot"" takes making the film seem like one continuous shot. I do not agree that ""1917"" is the best film of the year, but I do agree with the all the hype it's been receiving and you should all go out and see this film for yourselves."
1917,29 January 2020,8/10,"Photography is the single best aspect of 1917. Acting - Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are still cutting their teeth as actors - is good enough. Direction is first class, especially during the first two thirds.Unfortunately, from the moment Scho (Mackay) is shot by a wounded German soldier, I found it tough to believe that a fully-fledged British Army lance corposal in WWI would just abandon his weapon and try to elude bullets, not just once but at least twice - just as I found incredible that so many German soldiers were such poor shots as to keep missing him when they had him cornered.1917 is a piece of memorabilia to Director Sam Mendes, as his grandfather Alfred was the source of the story he tells us, but that last third tries to elevate the hero and film to virtually supermannish heights, as Mackay runs through his army's attacking lines to deliver the crucial message. As it turns out, he is late, the first wave has already gone on to the frontline.Cumberbatch has a small but, as ever, intensely repellent part, as Col. Mackenzie, who initially refuses to read his general's orders -- another flaw in the movie's credibility -- and who apparently loves to wage war, regardless of costs in terms of men.I think 1917 is a good movie, and it pays homage to two great WWI movies: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (US 1930) and LA GRANDE ILLUSION (France 1935), but it fails to reach the heights provided by the simplicity and sincerity of those two films."
1917,3 June 2020,8/10,"""1917"" sets high standards about cinematography. Director Sam Mendes achieved an amazing result and technically speaking I can't say anything of negative. Camera work is just amazing and the idea to adopt the one-shot like technique immersed me even more in the story. Some scenes are really tense and you cannot look away from the screen. This filming style is not easy at all to achieve, cuts are undetectable.Photography is perfect and there are some spectacular shots, visually speaking is very clean, nothing to say about special effects or shootouts. There is the right dose of action, but the movie also take his time to deepen characters.The story is nothing special and the movie on this aspect is not groundbreaking. Some scenes are completely unrealistic, soldier survive to a grenade that will cause the destruction of a trench, but when is stabbed he dies almost instantly. Screenwriters could come up with something better for sure. I appreciate the great effort made from a technical perspective, but a movie cannot be judged solely on the cinematography.I gave 8 stars out of ten, because I personally like these kind of experiments, and I really hope that one day we can have a film that will be satisfying on every front."
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"""1917"" It is a film, a film that transforms due to its applied technique, with a lint of script, the feature film directed by Sam Mendes conquers the viewer by its visual and technical direction, all simulated in a sequential plane and with a frightening sound mix, the claustrophobic and menacing film takes us on a journey that we will feel in our skin the linearity and terror of a war.The script is simple and clear, two cables have the mission of taking a message from one point to another, until the success of your object is dubious, because the journey here is worth more than the conclusion, the two cables, lived by the actors George Mackay and Dean-Charles are doing very well, although the film doesn't leave much room for us to contemplate performances, George's few moments of terror and anguish are great.In addition to a script that serves as an excuse to embark and enjoy a journey, the character developments are simple but profound, but the film puts itself at a pace where it is counterproductive to create depths, and when Sam Mendes does that, he is the only 5 minutes that we disconnected from the film.The technique of the film is the one that most stands out, simulating a sequential plan of a war movie seems very bold, when ""Birdman"" did it 5 years ago we were delighted, here, this feeling is even more elevated, care of technique that Sam Mendes had here is something to think about, it is clear that the sequential plans are simulated, we perceive their cuts, however, the long planes conducted are diverse and bold, although many of them are with little action on screen, their conduct is magnificent, with several open plans and a constant contemplation of the disaster, with mutilated bodies, rats and dirt, the disgust and fear is passed on to the viewer who accompanies that narrative stuck in the chair, much because of this narrative conduction and other fundamental aspects too, his composition of scenery, his photography that in certain moments blurs in order to create tension and darkens in planes with strong lighting that turns scenes into horror films, and last, but not least, the sound, everything that surrounds this important component of war film is great, starting with its mixing and ending with its magnificent soundtrack, the composer Thomas Newman abuses classical music and its equalization sound, always with high and progressive tones, in order to lead the viewer to the climax, as an element of horror film.""1917"" is not a cinematic perfection, we have some errors of continuism (which are acceptable in a sequential plan), we also have a problem when the film uses special effects instead of practice, as such effects are very perceptible, even so ""1917 ""is a spectacular film, very similar to classics such as"" Saving Private Ryan ""and recent films like"" dunkirk "", whose immersion capacity is the same.Sam Mendes returns to be very prestigious 20 years after his classic ""American Beauty"" with an extremely technical film and who has everything, even in an extremely busy year to become the highlight of the Oscars and awards. NOTE 9/10"
1917,26 August 2020,4/10,If you like war movies related you must watch this.
1917,27 November 2020,,"It's spirited, sad, and fast. The plot was simple, two men had to get somewhere in time or else something bad would happen. But what was in it was just amazing. If you looked away for less than a couple of seconds you would miss something. Great choreography, acting, and effects. The director paid a great attention to detail such as what was happening behind the scenes. The pace was really good too, they would hit us with a rush of air and give us a break and then the same thing again. It was like any other war/history movie but with improvements on the choreography and effects.Overall a solid and good history/war movie. The wait for the ending was especially worth it, to see the results of what would happen which was really well acted and done.Memorable: No. Rewatchable: Probably when I feel like wasting my time"
1917,4 August 2021,8/10,I absolutely loved every single moment of this film. I really felt as if I was immersed in it. I wish there would be a TV show made of this. The acting was phenomenal and there was some wonderful twists and turns so it was very unexpected and on the edge of your seat stuff.
1917,12 April 2020,8/10,"It's ok. Not the best war movie I've ever watched, and I love war movies. Well executed, entertaining but that's all. The red thin line was way better imho."
1917,18 May 2020,10/10,"A lot of the time WW1 is overshadowed by WW2 simply because everything was bigger, better, stronger, faster, deadlier etc... But its easy to forget that when WW1 happened, the world did not see a massive war for about 100 years since the Napoleonic Wars and the French Revolution. So with that in mind, it was a bigger shock to the world how destructive this war was with all the new technology.This movie's attention to detail is just pure insanity. Starting from the first moment up until the end, you can analyze every different sequence and talk about how they got everything right and how the war shaped up in the way that it did to create those moments in the film. It's just phenomenal. The trench warfare, the muddiness, the dirt, the unknownness of the enemy's whereabouts and their plans, the brand new weapons, dead bodies everywhere piled up on top of each other, and much more. I think it is must watch for everyone regardless of your interest in war movies.And to top all of this, the technical aspects of the film is also near perfect in my opinion. Incredible cinematography, an excellent use of one-shot filming, amazing sound design, amazing production design, great acting. This movie is the full package.Two soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to stop a regiment walking into their death."
1917,9 February 2020,7/10,"Set throughout the course of 24 hours during April 1917, two young soldiers in World War I (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a mission by their general to travel from their bunker to one deep into enemy territory to warn a regiment of the British army to call off their attack at the break of dawn. There's strong intel that is a trap and in order to save the lives of 1600 men, one of which is one of the protagonists brothers, they need to reach the bunker in time. Sam Mendes is one of today's greatest directors; absolute classics like American Beauty and Road To Perdition and two great Bond films under his belt, make anything his name is attached to worth a watch. It's beautifully dedicated to Lance Corporal Arthur Mendes as mentioned in the credits which give it a moving personal touch. Visually it is incredible and works on the basis of feeling like one continuous shot. I've always loved this idea since I was young and adored films that incorporate this even just for certain scenes such as Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men or that great episode of Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's Psychoville. So this really pleased me from a cinephile perspective! On a technical level, it is a massively impressive achievement and its first hour in particular is non stop intensity, it's truly captivating. I'm sad to admit though that there are a couple of scenes in the last half that I did feel meandered and took me out of the experience a fair bit. There are moments in there designed as a breather from the drama which I felt would be okay if I was more engaged on an emotional level. The performances are absolutely spectacular still, it's just that it's a film written more with the visual scope and atmosphere in mind than necessarily character. Nevertheless, definately worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find!"
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,"Boring as all hell. I've never seen a movie about such an exciting subject be so boring. The ""one take"" gimmick hurt the movie. If this could have been edited with multiple set ups the movie could have been much better. After about 20 minutes of following behind people and time filler dialogue I really started to notice the real time format. I was really interested to see how they were going to pull it off. I am very interested in new camera work and story telling but this time it hurt the movie.When he goes up the hill in the woods forever I almost left. There was no reason for that. I'm sure Mendes was watching the movie during editing and wished he could make some cuts. Doing Rope as ""one shot"" works and doesn't dictate the story. With this it dictated the story telling."
1917,7 March 2021,9/10,An almost perfect film from start to finish. The directing is outstanding the performances are outstanding. It's edge of your seat from start to finish.
1917,13 November 2020,8/10,"One of the best looking films I've seen with a breathtaking envoirmental attribute, and a tremendous ability in intriguing the viewer to a place which feels as close as reality. The story may not be as groundbreaking, but the thecnical advancement is absolutely mindblowing. And it actually manages to touch one with the atrocious reality of war."
1917,24 May 2020,10/10,"World War 1 is a war that is drastically underrated and under used in Hollywood. To be completely honest, I'm getting tired of World War 2 movies, they're mostly the same thing but with different characters. So when 1917 came out, I was ecstatic because World War 1 would finally get the recognition it deserves. 1917 is more of a drama than a war movie, and I love it; you can only see soldiers killing each other for so long. 1917 is about two men trying to survive what's happening around them. The war is just a backdrop mostly throughout the runtime, so it feels like a breath of fresh air in the war genre because you're not constantly being bombarded with people getting shot and blown up.I love how simple the plot is; it's just two men trying to send a message across a war zone. Everything about the plot and the writing is perfect. It's intense, it's sad, and it has great pacing. 1917 is also realistic, none of the characters are superheroes; they get hurt and make mistakes. 1917 is a history lesson too, it depicts the trenches exactly how it was in real life. The war torn landscapes are also depicted very well, as it shows corpses stuck in the mud, which took away a lot of lives during World War 1. I love the history of World War 1, and 1917's writers really did their research, because it shows it in the final product.By far the most impressive aspects of 1917 is how beauty it is. The cinematography is amazing with these wide landscape shots. 1917 is just such a beautiful film to watch, even though there's constant imagery of war. The most impressive part about 1917 is how it looks like it was shot in one continuous take. Filming this way is extremely difficult; you need great camera work and choreography, but when it's all said and done, it's so satisfying. You also need smart editing to blend in all of the shots.Last thing I want to mention is the acting. Both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman did a fantastic job. They made the characters so believe by their body language, showing how tired and hurt they are. With 1917 having almost no exposition, somehow they've made these characters so likable and understanding. All we need to see is sacrifice and determination to make these characters understanding, and the writers did exactly that.I love 1917, it was amazing in every aspect. I already knew Sam Mendes was a great director, but to direct a project this difficult and make it look easy forces me to respect him even more. The acting, the cinematography, and the simple plot made 1917 a joy to watch. All I can say is that 1917 was definitely worth my money."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"I've saw this one while I'm in Hawaii, in a broken beaten up theatre. And if I can still love a movie there then I don't know what else to say. This movie is brilliant, it's shot in a compelling and amazing way. The whole movie looks like it's one take. The whole time you can always feel tension. Like things are happening but you don't know what. Almost like a horror movie. The action is done brilliantly. My one singular complaint is that there isn't a lot of backstory behind Schofield. Still, an amazing movie and a must watch!"
1917,23 July 2020,8/10,"In 1917 the German Army pulls back from an area of the Western Front but aerial evidence indicates it is a strategy to overwhelm British troops. With telephone lines cut, two young corporals are sent to prevent an offensive that could cost the lives of 1,600 men, including the brother of one of them.Superb multi Academy Award winning World War 1 film which is cleverly filmed with long takes, making the film appear as one long shot. Cinematography and special effects are outstanding and, along with expert direction by Sam Mendes, this is no ordinary war film and one you will not want to miss. Stars George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"1917
2020
Director: Sam Mendes
Starring Dean Charles chapman, George makay, Colin Firth, Richard Madden.Bendadict Cumberbatch etc
1917 is based within the first world war. Where a battalion of 1,600 soldiers are sent to retreat the Germans but what they don't realise is that it's a trap and a massacre. So, it's down to Corporal Blake (Dean Charles chapman) and corporal Schofield (George makay) to stop this from happening but they will be met with multiple challenges along the way. Wow what a truly incredible movie that hit the mark on every level, visuals, acting and a compelling story lets talk more about this.First, the cinematography was stunning. This film really was firstly phenomenal to look at, and secondly really transported you into the world of the film, and it really made you feel a part of the time, with its scarily realistic set designs and scenery truly making you feel like you were in the battlefield with them. Leading to a truly phenomenal film just to look at and I was often sitting in awe of the film. The visual creativity as well was of the chart, making me truly respect the artistry of Sam Mendes with what he can create.Next the film really made you connect with the two main characters and their performances were fantastic. Due to the film largely being focused on just two characters it gave you more time to truly connect and spend more time with them as there friendship developed throughout the film, so they actually made a good decision by having more secondary characters with only a couple of scenes and two key characters to connect and focus on. And the performance from both Dean Charles Chapman and George Makay were truly fantastic. Considering that I had never heard of either of these two actors before they surprised me at there acting abilities. They showed emotional complexity of what it would be like being a soldier in the war, in truly versatile performances, hitting all the right notes with both serious, impactful and emotional scenes.Next the film did not hold back with showing the harsh reality of war with its gore and action sequences. In order for the film to leave the impact that it did, gory scenes showing the true horrors of war was needed, and it was most certainly shocking to watch. The film did a great job at getting under your skin with surprisingly very realistic looking bodies. A key scene that stands out to me would be when corporal Schofield, is swimming in a lake trying to get on the shore, but there is a large amount of bodies that he had to swim through in order to save himself, this scene truly left one of the biggest impact for me, and I am glad the director did not hold back with showing what war was really like, and especially glad that he didn't play it safe.
My only slight nit-pick that stopped the film from being truly perfect for me was that I felt that they could have been slightly more creative with the films character arcs and development. The film didn't show a lot of back story to the main characters, which I got as it was more about the developing friendship, however it would have been nice to have learned slightly more about them, but this is only a slight nit-pick. As well as the death of corporal Blake I felt could have been saved for the final act, yes this gave corporal Scofield the motivation to find his brother, but perhaps another scenario for the film could have been where Blake reunites with his brother and then gets killed whilst the Germans were attacking, but once again I didn't have an issue with what they did but this could have been how this particular death could have been placed slightly differently.Next, I thought the film managed to achieve an extremely tense tone and well executed jump scares. The film in a lot of places didn't have any soundtrack, which worked perfectly as I felt on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film, and I also think fear of the unknown for the audience and for the characters on the screen also made the film very tense as well. And due to this lack of sound in places there was a surprising amount of well executed jumpscares. These were largely just explosions or gun shots, but they happened completely out of the blue which I was not expecting but it was a welcome surprise for me.My next two positives would be the films surprising amount of emotional weight and its incredible final act. Wow this film was surprisingly emotional, just seeing the large body count throughout, truly made me realise whilst watching how pointless war is, and I think that's a good message to spread. And to have corporal Blake get killed was extremely heart-breaking, due to him not being able to see his brother and the connection he had formed with Scofield you could really tell how sad he was feeling which is another credit to there acting abilities. And the long drawn out scene of his death really allowed the audience time for what just happened to sink in, therefore making it even more emotional to watch. The final act was truly one of the best things I have ever seen. Sam Mendes did an excellent job at misleading you into what was going to happen, he could of easily went the predictable root and just let the message be delivered, but no the soldiers were already on the battlefield when Scofield was attempting to deliver the message. They went all out with fantastic cinematography, surprising cameos and an impactful ending with Blakes brother which really worked as a show of respect for the character and to make you leave the film satisfied.However, my final biggest positive would be how the film managed to look like one continuous take. Wow what a clever creative decision here. Yes, there was clearly a few cuts, but they were very well disguised and didn't affect the flow of the movie. Having one continuous take really gets you immersed in the film, and makes you feel like you are there with the characters truly leading to excellent experience whilst watching, as you connected with the characters more and it makes you feel like part of the movie.Overall 1917 is a true cinematic masterpiece and deserving of all its awards buzz. With a fantastically acted and fantastically crafted immersive film that might be my favourite of the year."
1917,7 February 2020,10/10,"L left my home around 12 pm today , to head ti the theater where this was playing. I'd been wanting to see it since it was released but was always sidetracked by something going on in my life.I arrived there before 1:00 and the movie started at 1:02.I'm sure as most here may have felt before it began ... I had NO idea what to expect or what I was going to see. I've seen many a war movie in my life ,
from the black and white era to Saving Private Ryan and Fury in 2014. .....but (and I am not exaggerating) , this film has captured exactly every feeling, emotion, action of those made to fight in the truly nightmarish and holocaust like places that are the front lines and battlefields.They have also fully captured the look of everything a military set up and used in this , World War 1 and future wars. The look is sad, scary,somber and in some cases as dark as war truly is. (Not speaking from any experience but I know this movie does not lie). The cinematography, yes, does pull that off perfectly , in my opinion.As some already know the story is , two British soldiers are chosen to get a message to another regiment many miles across 'no man's land' ( where if the enemy spots you , you are likely to get shot and killed). The reason is, the Germans have retreated but it may be a trick. So they have to get there to warn them and find the brother of the younger soldier.From the start, the bulk of the first half is filmed in 'real time'. following every move of these 2. Without giving anything away, there's a slight pause of darkness, then the real time pursuit continues. I was astounded at how steadily and perfectly the camera (cameras?) followed along.Lastly, in an early morning scene in a village, the true look of war/night time battle is (once again) shown by (I can only call it astounding) visuals and cinematography. Usually a few hours after a film, I've forgotten most of what I've seen. In this case ....even if I never watched this film again (and I will) there is no way I will ever forget any of this.Much like those who survives wars , they never forget either. World War 1 , for a long time after 1930's ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" , was very forgotten and thought by younger generations as 'not a serious war'. This movie , like Western Front, shows that is not the case. At 3:01 , my odyssey was over.It was was just as violent and horrific as World War 2 or any war since then. I will not make any Oscar predictions here. Except to say , I'd be very pleased to see it placed among the the top pictures of the past.Please , go see this ...I put no spoilers in here because ,feel , it is not boring and it's certainly something you will ever forget. Not everyone will feel the same but well, I can only recommend."
1917,30 May 2021,9/10,"1917 is a horrifically beautiful depiction of war with tough performances and eye-gripping visuals. Sam Mendes has definitely created one of 2019's best films. The film is set as an endless shot completely to the brim with realistic details, which are all enclosed by outstanding music and life-like sound effects.Not only is 1917 one of the year's greatest films, but it would have to be classed as one of the best war movies of all time. And a lot of that would go towards the beautiful cinematography, which is really hard to not mention since it's one of the movie's unforgettable features. The one-shot style and the fact that the actors can carry on with their performances for extended amounts of time is phenomenal.Another thing that most audiences will also get from 1917 is the feeling. Your heart will be thumping as you remain on the edge of your seat, shocked by the horrors of war. The sound effects, visuals, performances and angles are filmed so perfectly to cause you to feel like you are following the characters through the battlefields.So 1917 is a true cinematography experience. It's gripping, entertaining, realistic and memorable - An exhilarating choice for a movie night set in war films.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"'1917' is both a WWI film and a masterclass in cinematography. It's not based on one specific true story or battle, but rather the plot is inspired by stories the director's (Mendes) grandfather told him. From the opening scene, it's clear the ""real-time"" no-cuts concept is going to make the film different, as we meet Corporal Blake (Chapman) and Corporal Schofield (MacKay) and then the camera doesn't leave them for the next 2 hours. They're assigned an urgent mission by a General (Firth), to alert another battalion not to enter what is a German ambush.While set in France, it's filmed in England. The number of extras used is astounding, as is the accuracy of the trenches, barbed wire, ruins and uniforms. The trenches in particular are impressive to see as they walk through them, as they're not just CGI from a distance. From the moment Blake & Schofield step out into no-man's-land, the tension (and score) are ratcheted right up and there's only a few moments of respite.They meet a few helpful soldiers and some Germans on their journey - Captain Smith (Strong) and his troop, Colonel Mackenzie (Cumberbatch) and Blake's brother (Madden). Other than that, only Lauri (Duburcq), a frightened French lady, have any screen time. Thankfully, both the leads are great and easy to cheer for. It's an enthralling ride, with lots of subtle - and not-so-subtle - reminders of the horrors of war. It almost leaves you exhausted, as you feel like you've been on the mission with them."
1917,10 February 2020,4/10,Battle of jangsari which is great 1917 way let down watchable but not a masterpiece
1917,7 September 2020,,A stunning visual spectacle. Intense and thrilling.
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"It still wasn't fully satisfying for me.Obviously the story is pretty much one line: deliver this message. This is ok, not every movie needs to be packed with story. But then it shouldn't waste too much time either, it should be faster paced, there should always be something to look at that's actually interesting. The stapled corpses get boring at some point.The biggest problem I had with this movie, were the unnecessary coincidences.
1) The germans take every step to not leave food or anything behind, yet there is exactly 1 cow and 1 milk bucket left. Which leads to
2) In the town the protagonist jump exactly into this 1 house wherw there's also a baby that needs this milk.
3) The rat. It just runs into the trap exactly when our protagonists are there. Of course.
4) The plane. You guessed it: It lands exactly at our heroes feet. And they decide to help the german guy (why?) which leads to Blakes death.Other than that, the movie really was spectacular and a feast for this eyes. But it is a movie with just a few too many problems to really shine for me."
1917,31 March 2020,9/10,"My friend introduced me to the film, and stressed that I should pay attention to feel the shooting skills and expression of the end of a shot. And I did. And followed the messengers on their mission. I'm thankful that the director and the photographer used different angles and scenes. It goes up and down. Give me a chance to catch my breath and balance my cerebellum. Some of the shots really dazzled me, especially the quick frontal shots. I can't keep up. But my millennials love it. Movies are like video games. It was fun. Maybe it was because I couldn't focus on the visual effects to get the feel of the scene, so the plot was dragged down. I'm not impressed. I don't think some of the plot lines make sense. What is this story really about? The cruelty of war? The goodness of humanity and the hope of peace? Then can you paint the plot more deeply and reasonably. Let me be able to ""empathize"""
1917,14 August 2021,7/10,"""1917"" is no doubt an outstanding technical achievement, to the point I spent the whole film admiring the camerawork and riveting photography instead of empathizing with the characters (Deakins, you did it again!!). The film really succeeds at giving the illusion of being shot in a single take, with lengthy yet incredibly fluid and suggestive tracking shots that let you discover the world at the same pace as the main characters. It's an immersive experience but ultimately felt more like a horror-tinged virtual tour of the battlefield rather than an example of emotionally resonant storytelling. There are a few engaging moments along the way indeed, but it always seems like the director's ultimate objective is to impress and keep making you think: ""how the hell did they shot that!"". Gimmicks can make a difference in certain films, but at some point, you are supposed to forget about them so that you can get lost in the film's world.Still, I do appreciate that the film tries to point out the absurdity and monstrosity of war without being preachy and maudlin. The beginning can be a little misleading, but eventually, there is no hero to glorify nor big speech to make. You just follow an ordinary soldier in his journey and let the images speak themselves."
1917,12 February 2020,6/10,"1917 reminded me a lot of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (which I prefer over 1917).In both movies we are thrust straight into the action, with no backstory and the main characters essentially blank slates. Both movies have simple plots with one clear objective: to stop the charge in 1917, and to get off the beach and go home in Dunkirk. Moreover, both movies rely heavily on a gimmick: the single take in 1917 and the play with time (one hour, one day, one week) in Dunkirk.In essence, if you cross Dunkirk with the last 15 minutes of Peter Weir's Gallipoli stretched out into two hours, you get 1917.This recipe didn't really work for me. The only thing more paper thin than the plot are the characters (a generous use of that term). I guess the reason for them being blank slates in both 1917 and Dunkirk is to make it easier for the audience to walk a mile in their shoes. In Dunkirk this works since the plot essentially is about wanting to escape a grave threat, that's the only motivation needed. Not so much in 1917 once Blake kicks the bucket. It doesn't help that the actor playing Schofield, who we're stuck with for the rest of the movie, isn't very good.How 1917 managed to get nominated for best screenplay is beyond me. The dialogue falls flat. The pacing is glacial. In Dunkirk you really feel like you're in a fight against time, something which is emphasized by Hans Zimmer's score. In 1917 they don't seem to be in a rush once they leave their trench. Even Blake, whose brother is about to die if he can't deliver the message in time, acts as if he's taking a pleasant stroll through the countryside. Not even a light jog? Come on.And when the story and characters don't work you start focusing on other things. Like the airplanes. If they were in such a rush, it almost makes you wonder why they didn't send someone in a plane to deliver this urgent time-sensitive message.Technically, however, this movie is amazing. The cinematography is astounding, and the Oscar very well deserved. And I'm quite surprised it didn't also win for its magnificent production design.Although it will never happen, I would love to see the entire movie in split screen, one box the final image, and the additional boxes how they shot it. But that's the only reason for me watching this movie again.Just ask yourself this: If this movie had the exact same plot, dialogue and characters but didn't use the continuous take gimmick, would it still be hailed as a masterpiece? My guess is no.This movie was by no means bad. It was just OK."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"Very good movie, will have to admit. Wanted to see it on Christmas Day but the studio pulled the rug out from under everyone and released it this weekend, presumably to escape Star Wars. My main reason for going to see this movie was because Sam Mendes directed, so I know what to expect from him. It attracted the usual war movie crowd, some of whom tend to rub me the wrong way, if you know what I mean, but nevertheless, almost every seat in the theater was full and very few people ever got up for any reason.The one shot theme in this movie does an excellent job of illustrating what the trenches were like and almost feels like it's putting you in the shoes of the characters. I wouldn't say it's the best movie out there, too many characters are doing foolish things that probably wouldn't happen in real life. It is a movie, if this didn't happen, it would be boring. There were a lot of times that characters did things that I assume they wouldn't because of training and protocol.I liked seeing Sikh and black soldiers serving with the British in the movie. Quite often in war movies such as World War I and II, you see minority soldiers ignored even though they served. At first, it looks like some sort of revisionist history, but these men were there, thankfully depicted as they were, not serving as generals or something.There will be some complaints from the audience. I've heard that it felt soulless. I blame the one shot them employed in the entire movie. If you are familiar with the film fanboy discussions on Daredevil, you will have heard about the one shot take fad. So I understood what was going on, but other people won't. There also isn't much action or fighting. I almost want to say that it's not really a war movie. If you're looking for more action and fighting, watch Gallipolli, the TV miniseries, it's on certain subscription streaming sites. This will be well worth your time, highly recommended!"
1917,3 October 2020,10/10,"Phenomenal film. Scenes throughout the film can be overwhelming and at no point do you feel at ease. It is visually stunning, with an incredible soundtrack, and appropriately cast. There is a sprinkling of famous British actors, but fortunately they are not dwelled on, which is important as nothing should take anything away from the storyline. A fictional storyline, but set in a setting all too real. These films are necessary to ensure that new generations are aware of the horrors of the past, lest we forget."
1917,12 July 2020,3/10,"So the pretext is that in the context of Operation Alberich, where the Germans fell back from two salients that they seized to the Hindenburg Line, a British general who has for some reason decided to put his headquarters at the front lines at the end of one of these salients, decides to call off one little isolated attack. But because the general is in a bad position to communicate with troops under his command and because the Germans have magically destroyed all the telephone lines, the general decides
1. Wait for an hour or so for the telephone lines to be repaired and then calls off the attack
2. Sends a runner back to headquarters to which sends a message by telephone to a place where they can send a runner to call off the attack.
3. Sends their driver (they are a general, they would have a driver) to deliver the message via the roads around the area.
4. Relocates their headquarters to a central location where they can communicate more easily with troops under his command.
5. Use a set of runners to run behind the lines in shifts to get the message to call off the attack to the troops.
6. Sends 2 soldiers to cross deadman's land and the former German lines, then cross British lines without being shot (ummm...they actually skip that bit in the movie) and deliver the order.If you chose 6, then you are an idiot and will enjoy this movie and have a good shot at being a Hollywood hot shot. Otherwise, just enjoy the acting and cinematography of this movie where very little makes sense."
1917,21 January 2021,6/10,"I haven't gone to the cinema much for years now and it's not just the high prices that put me off but also very few films really appeal to me. I would rather watch a documentary or a play or sit through a classical music concert rather than a film for the sake of it.So when I read that the director Sam Mendes was going to make a film inspired by his grandfather who served during the First World War, I was rather curious and after seeing the trailer pop up on my Facebook news feed, I decided to go and see it as it looked promising.The plot of the film revolves around two lance corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) who are sent on a mission to inform fellow soldiers who are about to launch an assault against the Germans that they are walking into a fatal trap. For almost two hours the viewer, through the seemingly one long continuous shot employed by Mendes and his team follows Blake and Schofield as they make their way through enemy lines in order to deliver that crucial message.1917-george-mackay-reviewAlthough one of the premises behind Blake and Schofield's mission was a bit contrived, the film succeeds in portraying the conditions in the trenches - the acres of barbed wire, piles of decaying corpses both the human and animal kind and life in the trenches. There is also the contrast between how the British and the Germans built their trenches and the camera angles do emphasise that.I came across one review that described 1917 as like watching or playing a computer game and some of the scenes do remind me of my childhood playing Super Mario Brothers where the two intrepid characters dodge bullets, enemy soldiers, and mud as well as trip wires. Given the urgency of the mission, the script sticks strictly to the main plot and avoids going into introspections and backstories (which are instead woven into the conversation between the two men). Better yet is the absence of subplots that would have detracted from the narrative.Too often several movies and TV programmes fail because they are poorly written, suffer from the lack of narrative coherence as well as attempt to ram down an agenda down its viewers' throats. I see 1917 as a breath of fresh air - not only is it good old fashioned story telling but is also proof that sometimes, less is indeed more.If you haven't seen the film yet, I highly recommend it. Below is the trailer that gives you an idea of what it is about:"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a new war drama directed, partly written and produced by Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty and Skyfall.The film is set during the First World War where the two British soldiers Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackay) are sent on an important and dangerous mission. They must alert the British troops of 1,600 soldiers, among which Blake his brother before they attack and thus fall into a deadly hostile trap. The two must travel through friendly and enemy trenches for this mission, but also through the dreaded no man's land filled with war victims, damage and deadly booby traps.Director Sam Mendes, together with photography director Roger Deakins, visualized and edited the film in such a way that it appears as if the film was only shot in a long scene. This way of filming was also done by Alejandro G. Iñàrritu with his Oscar winning film Birdman. The cameras film the entire film around the characters. The various cameras are held by the hand for filming, on cars or via iron rods and wires concentrated on the characters. This way of filming makes it feel like you are also present as a third soldier as a viewer during this mission in the war. As a viewer, you also want to look around to see if you see any dangers such as barbed wire, bomb wires or mines. This creates extra excitement and intense moments, because just like the characters you are in unknown hostile territory. You also do not know that when you see others at a far distance, whether they are friendly or hostile soldiers. Because of the way they put this film together, they show how bad a war and its consequences are.The film location and the attributes on the film set also help well with the realistic transfer of the film. No man's land is filled with war victims, their animals, used ammunition and hidden booby traps. Because of the way they were filmed, they were also dependent on natural light and weather. Because of this, they needed more time when filming, because they had to wait until the sunlight was out or in the right place.The acting is done well by the two main players. As a viewer you do not know too much about them, but you still care about them and their important mission and hope that they do not get themselves in danger. Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are also not such well-known actors, but they still know how to deliver good and fitting acting in this film. Major actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Colin Firth play more smaller roles in this film, but they are important roles."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester this afternoon - 1917. Throughout the years there have been many films, starring many people, and coming from many different points of view about the First World War. Without taking anything away from those film makers who have come before I can say this was certainly one of the best shot films I have seen for a long time. Following just two soldiers for much of the first half you get a real insight into the life of the individual. Yes we know thousands of men died on both sides but the way this film is shot isolates the very individual struggles and emotions felt by men under direct orders to carry out a seemingly impossible task. Even when surrounded by hundreds of other men there is a sense of aloneness emanating from the screen. I particularly liked how the camera angles changed direction whilst the soldiers were walking, one minute the camera is going backwards, the next it swings round as it allows the men to pass and you almost get a feeling of the cameraman trotting to keep up as they purposely stride along on their mission. Take a moment to look beyond the characters, note the detritus of war lying around, items of clothing, munitions, and so many bodies. Remember this is real, it did happen and note the horror of it all. Lots of big stars in very small parts, look out for Colin Firth, Mark Strong to name a couple. Well done Sam Mendes, you have excelled yourself with this masterpiece."
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"This _will win_ the best film and the best director Oscars. It is amongst the best war films of all time and would rank near the very top, in terms of its relentless intensity and the realistic depiction.This is the director,Sam Mendes's triumph. There are several sequences of such brilliance that they can barely be described in words. They have to be seen for their power to be felt.The editing, which makes it feel as if you are watching a single shot from the first frame of the film to the last, is truly breathtaking.The background score and the acting enhance the viewing experience.For me, there is no other film amongst those nominated which is any where close to this masterpiece.Enough said. Watch it, please."
1917,26 January 2020,4/10,"1) It was so boring I wished I could leave halfway through. 2) The plot is very average. 3) There are tons of inaccurate or illogical things. For example, the whole premise of just two men carrying a crucial message is laughable. Then they have to cross enemy lines to meet their army again? How is that? Then they survive an explosion in the underground room, with no scars: that's impossibile. And so on and on and on. Terribly staged plot. 4) The cinematography is breathtaking, but you know what, that long shot (or should I say two shots, they were two shots) was boring and annoying. 5) The beautiful scenes, such as the shadows in the city. Again, am I watching a painting or a movie? This use of eye-candy strips all of the emotional involvement. Do you want me *into* the battle, or outside looking beautyful pictures? This is a critical and rather basic mistake. 6) Overall, this is an average movie with good looks and the huge minus of being utterly pretentious. Same as Dunkirk. I hate this millennial, hollow, falsely artistic style. It's a shame it's a nominee for the Best Movie award."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"The plot is a simple one - 2 guys have to deliver a message to the battalion stationed on the other side. What makes this an wonderful experience rather than a 'see and forget' movie is the exceptional cinematography by Roger Deakins. The entire movie looks like a single shot and it makes you feel you are walking along with the 2 protagonists rather than watching it. There are good jump scare moments in the film. Overall, a wonderful experience this movie is!!"
1917,8 May 2020,8/10,"A one shot take amazed me. I've never seen a movie that has done this before. That was the thing that intrigued me the most.And I actually watched the behind the scenes of how they did it. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes put in a tremendous amount of work to make every scene calculated. And I mean every scene. It was a step by step process to make sure the one shot take would be executed upon perfectly.And beyond the curtain of the filmmaking, the storyline was great. Having it be a one shot take made it a personal connection between the viewer and the two soldiers. It was a sad, yet uplifting and inspiring movie of showing a partially true story from a story that Sam Mendes grandfather told him about WWI."
1917,7 January 2021,6/10,"WWII obviously overshadowed ""The Great War"" especially in the states. The significance of the war on a geopolitical level. A shift from Monarchies to modern governments...and its complexities should be part of any core curriculum.
That being said this is the most overrated WWI film since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The only part of saving Ryan that was powerful and well shot was the landing at Normandy giving a sense of how many allies died before getting to fight. The rest of the story was disinteresting.
Since 1946 there have been so many WWII films that were overall just better films.
Now there is really not a lot of American films on WWI....This is a story that's been told in different genres so many times...that it's a WWI film simply from the title. The Gold Standard for WWI and the horrifying trench war fare, with military officer egos lays best in Kubrik's Paths of Glory...there's no WWI film that comes close."
1917,12 July 2021,9/10,"Clearly a director's film, with the writing being cursory. Nice, clear set-up. Likeable characters but didn't have much to go on with them.Not to say that the action was very good, especially considering the physical requirements the actors went through remembering minutes-long sequences. But, all in all, there wasn't much for the actors to work with in regards to character development.The visuals suffered early on for many seconds vs the requirement it be in real time as it ended up with dead time, which is very long on screen, even if it's seconds.A very horrible air to it, too, as it went along. For a few seconds, though he was dead leaning against that tree. Near the end was a nail biter if he would succeed or not.Predictable he'd meet someone in the hiding place before he met the French woman and child.Thought I was clever and spotted places where cuts happened, but then read the notes and found out there were over 70. Yikes!Thought I was also watching a very technically-accurate depiction but was shocked the many mistakes that other, smarter, viewers saw in the imdb notes. Had considered that maybe a plane could drop a message on the soldiers that needed the warning, being they established areal photos. Sure enough, there were planes. So---bad story element not to cover.A must see."
1917,16 January 2020,8/10,Most war films are intense but this goes to a whole new level in its own way. The film being set in one long shot is very unique but works brilliantly.The pace of the movie is incredible it goes past in the blink of an eye and at the end the first thing I thought was 'I have to see that again'.Because of the pace of the film it doesn't allow for a lot of character development outside of the main characters but that doesn't detract at all.A great film and a brilliant bit of directing.
1917,4 April 2020,8/10,"The story line of ""1917"" is very simple. It tells the story of two soldiers who go to the front during world war I to serve an evacuation mission.But the film's redemptive dialogue, metaphors and hidden texts save its otherwise thin plot and keep its so-called one-shot technological marvel from being showy.What was supposed to be an immersive experience of the technological age turned out to be an allegorical masterpiece, possessed by tarkovsky's soul. If the first world war were to be replaced by another war, even the war against epidemics in which we live, it would seem to have more meaning."
1917,26 January 2020,7/10,"Big production for the crews and scenes. Storyline is simple. Didn't have the ""wow"" moment for me."
1917,10 July 2020,6/10,"I thought the idea of the movie was okay, but the actual plot could've been a bit better. I did think the plot was intriguing at times, but the problem for me was that it was slow for the most part and personally I'm not a fan of slow movies. I thought the action scenes were good, especially the one at the end. There probably should've been more action scenes which would've made the movie a bit more thrilling and intriguing to watch. It's not the worst movie, but it's probably a movie I wouldn't like to watch again."
1917,27 January 2020,9/10,"Director Sam Mendes controls even the smallest component of this historic recreation of a heroic feat. He keeps the pace fast and full of action. And he confirms, in theory, the feeling that the First World War was nothing more than an abominable futility caused at first by a fight between cousins. The Balkans were the cause of the war at the beginning, but Kaiser William II, son of Frederick III of Germany and Victoria, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria of England, was the one who agreed to help the Austro-Hungarian Empire wage war on Russia. It was the Kaiser who encouraged German nationalism and warlike vocation; who built the German armies and navy.T. S. Eliot started his most famous poem, ""The Waste Land"", with the verse ¨April is the cruellest month¨. Why is April cruel? Because it leaves us full of hope and the desire for spring to come soon. Yet... spring lingers with time! In war, we hope that peace will come soon, and yet it lingers with horrors. April in any temperate climate gets tired of the winter and the cold. It wants the light and the heat back. April offers only a few beautiful and pleasantly sunny days; ain't April a provocation, full of rain, mud, cold and false promises?In ¨1917,¨ which takes place on April 6 and 7 of that year, Colonel MacKenzie's final sentence (Benedict Cumberbatch) - ¨I hoped today would be a good day. Hope is a dangerous thing¨ - confirms that April is synonymous with false hope. Pessimism wins.The German withdrawal from the Hindenburg Line - their defensive position built on the Western Front (France) in 1916 in an attempt to curb Anglo-French attack power - is taking place. Mendes' film tells the emotional & exhausting crossing by two English soldiers of the enemy lines. Brightly shot in the sequential-shot (long-take) technique, it takes the viewer into the trenches, out of the trenches (¨no man's land¨) and thus enhances realism. Although, technically speaking, the film has more than exactly one shot, the ingenious skill of the extraordinary, 14 times Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins manages to mislead the viewer.There are no slow parts and the journey is electrified from the first minute. Dialogues are, of course, an essential component for the long-take style to work. There are no redundant dialogues and '1917' gives the false impression of being shot in a single scene. A huge technical achievement at a remarkable rhythm. Despite its extraordinary audacity, however, the screenplay gloats in some places. Being the case of a realistic film, one can't help demanding... realism! I'll just give one example: a rat casually blasts a tunnel, and the people inside it would be literally without salvation; the explosion was powerful enough to collapse the entire tunnel, yet they survive. In any case, from now on, whenever avant-garde cinematography and camera handling are discussed, 1917 will be part of the discussion, together with Hitchcock's ¨Rope,¨ Sokurov's ¨The Russian Ark¨, and a few Oriental filmmakers."
1917,13 August 2020,8/10,"About 15 minutes in to this movie, it dawns to you that ""1917"" is something uniquely brilliant and by the end, it's clear that Sam Mendes has arguably made one of the best films of 2019.That's largely because of the very innovative cinematography: The entire film is one long tracking shot. Of course, there are edits, as imperceptible to viewers as they might be. And, to be honest of course, whether or when the film stopped rolling isn't the point -- it's the desired effect that it has endured on our minds.As the camera follows the two British Soldier-runners trying to get across a German-occupied battlefield to deliver their urgent message, it moves around them -- in front, behind, next to, sometimes around a rock or a slightly different route but keeping the soldiers in view. It creates the video game-like feeling that you're the third soldier on the mission.Cinematographers aren't often household names, but Roger Deakins might just become one thanks to this Herculean accomplishment. Given that the film is essentially a one-direction journey in which the camera rarely stops rolling, the production design is a real feat. At times some scenes defies logic but that's how war goes. We follow both the soldiers through a very long trench, a maze of a barracks, and French countryside that's ravaged from the wages of war. That's the hallmark shot of the entire movie.Editing and Sound effects set an almost an eerie effect on the screen. Costumes & make up are top notch. The acting standards are really good, but MacKay will rip your heart out as a low-ranking officer who's resentful of his dangerous assignment but rises to see his mission through, no matter the potential sacrifice.Many people may be reluctant to see a movie about World War I, but 1917 could be a entertainer to even the X Box-PS4 Generation. It's hard to imagine anyone who won't appreciate 1917's originality, heart, and grit. A Must watch movie for people of all ages."
1917,17 February 2020,7/10,"Winning in Oscars effectively reflects that the movie excels in sound effect and shooting. However, the story is a bit dull, lacking story twist to attract my eye ball. Anyway, it is a ok time killer."
1917,24 March 2020,8/10,"This one single shot movie, what an amazing cinematic experience. This movie does not even let you blink your eye, amazing concept, superably made, beautifully laid and a fantastic experience.
Sam Mendes, should have won the awards for this, including oscar, cause on this and joker are movies with some sense.
Nevertheless, a must watch, any time and every time."
1917,3 March 2020,10/10,"I am grateful that one of my Grandma's friends recommended that we see 1917. All I knew about the movie was that it was a war movie, it has lots of critical praise, and that it was nominated for Best Picture. After seeing the movie, let me tell you that all this hype is well earned.While 1917 is set in World War 1, it reminded me of a classic World War 2 movie-Saving Private Ryan. Both films are about the horrors of war and a dangerous mission to find the brother of another soldier. 1917 has another plot point as well though, where 2 soldiers are going to enemy territory to offer peace and stop a battle that will have deadly results if pursued.1917 succeeds most with the emotion, and that's what carries most of the movie. For example, one of the 2 soldiers is stabbed and then dies in the other's arms before he can get proper help. This is very emotional, especially since the viewer can connect with the bond that they have. Any death, whether from an enemy or not, is felt by the viewer.Speaking of the deaths, the violence is very effective as is necessary, of course. I especially appreciated that the gore was shown but not as graphic as Saving Private Ryan. Simply put, it shows enough war violence to stun the audience but not be too depressing.1917 is also effective with jump scares. Yes, there are jump scares, but not in a lame horror-film way. These are jump scares done right and well deserved. A character may be walking around and then without warning...BOOM! A gun is shot or a grenade is thrown.The movie also has great cinematography, as other reviewers have said-this should be considered to be among the best camera work of any film this year.Another great film-making aspect is that it has a ""one shot"" feel that makes the movie look to have one continuous shot, not broken up into different angles(The Oscar winner Birdman was filmed this way as well).1917 also does a great job of taking us to the year. That is, it really feels like it's 1917 now, even though it was 103 years ago.While I have not seen any other of the nominees for Best Picture, I agree that this deserved one. I have minor flaws with it, but they don't affect the movie's overall high quality.This ranks with American Beauty, Road To Perdition, and Revolutionary Road as one of Sam Mendes's best movies, and is well worth the time to see, so please do so!Note: After the movie ended, I asked my Grandma what she would rate it, and she said a 9.5 or a 10. I was shocked, as she hardly ever gives 10s. This got me asking what other movies she would rate a 10, to which she listed Hidden Figures, My Fair Lady, Titanic, Mary Poppins, among others.Since this is the case, that is 2 10/10s for you to base your decision on to see this movie. I hope you choose to see it, 1917 is a rewarding experience!*If you enjoyed this review, please click on cinephile-27690 for more. Movies are my passion so allow me to share it with you. I know I am a bit amateurish, but I hope I am improving over time! Thank you for reading this and any other review!"
1917,20 February 2020,8/10,"Even if you aren't into war films, 1917 is a film one must experience, because there is a simple story, sufficient and efficient, backed by an extraordinary technical accomplishment, which pretty much shapes and enlarges the cinematic experience to the highest degree. The pace just flows flawlessly frame after frame; to me it was intoxicating to have such a personal point of view, it certainly enriched the momentum, it made everything feel more tense, up close yet distant. I was very eager to see what would happen next and how the story would ultimately unfold. We don't get to see the known horrors of war in a crude fashion as it wasn't intended, but we get to witness glimpses of hope and tenderness which add to the emotional impact of the film. And I have to say those moments are necessary because something else is needed besides the constant suspense and continuous turbulent path towards the success of the corporates' mission, otherwise it's hard to feel something for these characters, given that it takes place in a constricted time frame and with a clear objective, that it doesn't leave much room for a film's usual way of progressing.The plot involves a race against time, the context is set, the story is rather simplistic, so the technical aspect is where the strength of the narrative lies. Sam Mendes and his crew were fully aware that they needed a particular way to tell their story so that it would enhance what these young soldiers had to go through by carrying out such a difficult undertaking.1917 is a phenomenal film, with much of its grandness being granted by its technical resources rather than its story itself; so, without its practical prowess would it still be an excellent film? I dare to say that it would not, perhaps it would be a good film, but not an excellent one. The premise isn't lacking in merit, but a film that spans across such a limited time frame can be somewhat difficult to handle regarding certain elements like character development (not that it matters at all in this film), emotional investment and an in-depth plot progress. And on top of all to make it as if it was one long continuous shot is an incredibly hard feat to achieve, but done excellently and cohesively in 1917.Whether you enjoy these type of films or not, whether you heard great things about it or that is overrated, it doesn't matter. Just watch the film and see what everyone else is talking about."
1917,15 February 2020,8/10,"This film is very nicely directed and is very interesting throughout. The impression of it being a single take really immerses the viewer in the events and this is further enhanced by strong performances from the cast. Cinematography,sound and editing is top-notch. Highly recommended."
1917,18 January 2020,4/10,"Another boring take on WW1.A General turns up at the front and tasks two corporals to find a lost battalion about to fall into a trap by those nasty Hun.It must be important as a General is within shooting range of a German.
But not important enough to get a pilot to find them and drop a note telling them to cancel the attack.
So important he sends two men instead of a squad of a dozen or even twenty.So we get a Perils Of Pauline wander through the German lines with pretty much every cliche thrown in to a melting pot of pretentious pap."
1917,5 May 2020,9/10,"Shot beautifully and acted greatly. I enjoyed every second of this film. See it, you won't be disappointed."
1917,23 February 2020,8/10,"First, I wanted to go to Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford, but I saw on the websit of the theater that 1917 was still projected, I had heard a ton of compliements about this film ,but I was reticent, because I thought hat the visual achievement was a pretext to win all those Oscars.I was totally off, the long-take is not made to show off the talent of Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes. it is an excellent way to accentuate the thriller aspect of the movie and the suspense of the war. Never in the movie you are bored, you are always at the edge of your seat. The all movie is subliminal, and I can compare it to Dunkirk in the way that character doesn't have a clearly identified personality, this serves the purpose of the director, Mendes wanted us to think that this film was just relating a random day in a low-graded soldier is life. The movie remains surprising. The sound is well-done, you feel that you are a companion of the corporal Schofield, like him you have no clue about was is going to happen, and when he is shot by an enemy solider like him you are tying to find out were the shot came from.I highly recommend this movie, it deserved all his nomination, but more particularly his wins in the technical categories."
1917,10 January 2020,1/10,Stay away - don't watch. I have never seen such a boring film in my life 😩
1917,12 April 2020,10/10,"I'm from Russia, we have a lot films about World War II but there are very little number if films, books ot anything belse about World War I. It's explained by Soviet policy, they named this war ""imperialism"" one and did all to forget it. Nowadays we only begin to explore this tragedy.
If my friends or family ask me to recommend a film about WWI, I recommend this one. Firstly, the story is great. It looks very simple (just story about one episode if WWI) but it's really catchy, because it's rarely when fims shown life of ordinary soldiers. Secondly, the atmosphere of war is shown great, you see a lot injuries, blood, dirt and pain. Thirdly, the cast did the amazing performance, two main characters perfored real friendship in war. Finally, the great work of camera operator, film looks like one-shot one.
So, it's great film, one of the best of 2019."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"This is definetly a decent war movie and stands out with it's one continuous shot approach. But this gimmick also works against the movie in some parts.""1917"" feels very real and has great sets, action and its continuous shot style is very well done. Even if it also means it drags a bit in places and the story (which only follows a couple of characters) can only go so far and in one direction."
1917,16 August 2021,8/10,"'1917' is visually complex, filmed in one-cut technique, providing the impression of a one-take filming process, while we follow Blake (D.-C. Chapman) and Schofield (G. MacKay) through ruins, mud, corpses and other traces of war.The two main protagonists somewhat remind me of Frodo and Sam since they all are young, anxious, unfledged and on a journey full of uncertainty.Do not expect the movie to show a lot of actual war scenes, as it revolves around the runner quest of two young soldiers."
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"Yes, it's a war movie... but not really. It's more about a corporal's determination to accomplish his given orders; and that he does through thick and thin !Excellent cinematography, superb directing, good acting, believable scenery, and so much more.It's a very good film worthy of the 10 Oscar nominations... I shall predict 1917 will win for Directing, and possibly some other categories too - but not for Best Picture!"
1917,12 December 2020,9/10,"It runs 1917 on the French front. Two British Army corporals, William Schofield and Tom Blake (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, respectively) are sent to carry a note to stop the offensive of another English battalion on German lines that he believes are in retreat, when in fact the Germans fell back there to ambush him. A true suicide mission, stimulated however by the incentive of Blake's reunion with his brother in that battalion.1917 is an astonishing immersive experience in the horrors of the trench warfare of World War I, filmed in a (almost) shot sequence that accompanies the protagonists at all times, so the film takes place practically in real time. At certain times, the warlike character gives way practically to horror movies. The anecdote, then, is minimal, as well as the characters. The power of images, sound and music (by Thomas Newman) is prodigious. Roger Deakins' photography (multi-award winning, as well as the film in general) is beautiful and his twists are fundamental in creating the different climates of the film. There is a nocturnal sequence that is simply anthological because of its tension, its aesthetics and the variety of feelings and sensations that it brings into play and produces.Some critics have objected to this film by the eclectic Sam Mendes two central aspects that in my opinion are virtues. One of them is that the adventures of the protagonists and the sequence shot in motion resemble the perception of the film to the experience of a video game. And will it not be the other way around? Video games simply don't reflect the experience of war and especially now with its remote and virtual control aspects? The First War was a labyrinthine trench warfare.The other criticism is the lack of ""personal history"" of the protagonists, which would take away psychological depth. 1917 in this sense resembles Dunkirk: it addresses its characters in media res, that is, in the middle of the battle front. Well, I must say that this ""lack"" and the simplicity of their motivations places the protagonists in the shoes of true ""anonymous soldiers.""1917 is one of those films that one regrets not having seen in the cinema, a cinematographic display with capital letters at the service of a war story where despair and duty go hand in hand."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"First couple of minutes in I didn't know what to expect from this movie but then I realized that it's going to be war that I haven't seen before. The whole movie shot in one take is not something I haven't seen before but a war movie - this is something I think everyone ought to see. 1917 is perfect from a director of photography, set designer and stunt coordinator point of view as well as a great challenge for all of the actors involved who had done their jobs splendidly. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are relatively new to the audience but after the great success of 1917 (which in my humble opinion is inevitable, multiple Oscars worthy and well deserved) the world will hear about them. My only weak point about this grand spectacle of a movie is if you take this one magical component that holds it all the whole movie would fall flat in comparison to other, much greater movies of its genre and would be claimed as one-dimensional and multidimensional at the same time. But it sure does make one fall in love with cinema once again."
1917,2 May 2021,10/10,"This simple story of two soldiers given nearly impossible orders to provide a message to stop 1600 men from walking into a trap is an astonishing piece of filmmaking. This race against time and death is presented as though it were filmed in one take and it is breathtaking in nearly everyway. The cinematography is phenomenal. The acting by the two mostly unknown leads is perfection. Though he has an extensive career in theater and film since he was a child, I had only seen the lead, George MacKay, twice before in the fine films, Captain Fantastic and Pride. He was excellent in both and he is the mesmerizing focal point here. The film ends in a simple manner despite all his character has done as that is the way life is sometimes. This was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, won three, and deserved more. It is a great film."
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a wonderful look at the WWI experience. It brings trench life, dealing with mud, dealing with rats, the perspective of the trench charge, bodies left to rot in no-man's land, and other aspects of WWI to life. 1917 has a decent story that allows the creative team to explore the life and trials of a British soldier from that time frame.
The idea of having a two shot movie was interesting. While the movie was a consistent flow that focused on the two stars, it did slow the pace of the film and it limited what the story could have been - now that is saying it could have been a 9/10 story but was stuck in the mud to bring the story to a 7/8.
The other downfall of the two shot movie was that there was less of an opportunity to bring the two mains to life. It felt (from a veteran's perspective) that you were watching another squad go through this experience with no investment. It still did not lower the movie, but it made you wonder how much better the film could have been had there been a few more breaks in the shots to bring more story and depth to the characters.
Still a solid 8 movie."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Sad sad sad war, war bring nothing but misery to humanity. We don't even know if our ancestor died honorably or just died for nothing. To fulfill our leader's pride who just sit on the throne watching us sacrifice our life while he/she eating kentucky. Sam Mendes did a great job depicting the horror of war, we should be afraid of war more than ghost. Because ghost cant do nothing but war do everything. War is not even stop until today, massacre keep happening here and there until we think that human's life is worthless. Just for the sake of thing called oil and money. Everyone must die. Can peace still happen? Or it is just fata morgana?"
1917,4 February 2020,8/10,"I sometimes fear we're running out of stuff to do with the War Movie - to me, this is a genre particularly prone to redundancy, cliché, and cheese. But with 1917, Sam Mendes aspires to do for World War I what Spielberg did for II, creating a sort of complete immersion that never lets us disconnect from the ever-treacherous wartime setting. This is largely due to the presentation; the entire movie looks like one long, uninterrupted shot!Of course, the film isn't truly done in one take, instead creating the illusion of it with editing and effects like those of Birdman. There have been genuine attempts at a one-shot movie before (like Utøya, Russian Ark, and Victoria), but they came with the hiccups that will inevitably arise when one tries to do live theater plus shifting locations plus special effects plus a purposely limited camera crew. And of course, many of Andy Warhol's ""films"" were technically done in one take. It needn't always be an impressive thing to do.1917, however, is quite impressively made, even when you can deduce when and where it hides its cuts and gives the cast and crew a well-deserved break. As mentioned, we still feel wholly trapped in the setting, which is both due to the lack of cuts and the fact that we view the world-shaking horrors exclusively from the point-of-view of two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman), sent on a suicide mission to deliver one simple message.Problems arise when we reach the film's slower moments, which aren't made that much more admirable on a technical level just because the actors converse in an uninterrupted session (even during the purely ""talky"" and small-scale bits, Birdman had more directing going on in its lengthy takes). Granted, these moments are some of the film's most human, supplying a somber breather in-between busy trenches, suspenseful action, and horrific, squalid battle sites.The most popular complaint seems to be of Thomas Newman's music, which can be overbearing and, rather than enhancing the emotions, damage scenes that would've been more powerful, immersive, and intense without it; I only partly agree. Another complaint is mainly popular on Film Twitter (my favorite place), where people sincerely question why we still make movies about the World Wars - which, in spite of what I said about irritating war film clichés, isn't exactly the sort of tacit celebration of historical ignorance I wish to humor.A few of the inevitable cuts are pretty obvious too (one is willfully obvious, creating an intermission point in the very middle), even attempting to merge two shots with slight but noticeable differences in lighting. But there is still so much to admire in terms of special effects, coordination, camera movement, production design, and indeed, the effective use of lighting (especially in a scene where threatening ruins are lit exclusively by a flare) that it doesn't matter much. Much of the time, the execution lives up to Mendes' ambition.Our leads also carry the film nicely; they work as focal characters on top of sharing genuine history and chemistry, as we also admire their devotion. Perhaps celebrity cameos like those of Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch will distract from the realism and immersion, but this will hardly be true of every viewer. I conclude that this is a pretty damn good film overall and that it should at the very least win some techies this Sunday. I won't go for my highest rating (my #KeepingUpWithTheOscars fave remains Little Women and Parasite remains by Best Picture vote), but I sincerely believe that - with the climactic shot of Lance Corporal William Schofield running alongside the Pas-de-Calais trench as the final attack breaks loose around him, driven only by his devotion to the mission - Mendes has created one of the most iconic sequences of our age's cinema.Finally, on the note of historical accuracy, you may not need to worry so much with this one. 1917 isn't based on any particular event within World War I, instead dramatizing a tale Mendes' grandfather used to tell him and his siblings. Thus, we can't be sure 1917 is based on a true story at all. You know what grandpas can be like."
1917,17 January 2020,4/10,"This film proffers a realistic presentation of a WW1 battlefield and of the threats, the physical terrors, of such a place, but it is actually like a hybrid mediated version of that reality. The result is something like following an avatar in immersive game. This impression is confirmed at the film's end.When it starts the camera has the viewer in the middle of the action and immediately the cleanliness of the soldiers, their spotless uniforms, their fresh faces seem at odds with the mud and shell fire. Then their dialogue is phrased and framed around a type of theatrical form. It needn't be crude or ignorant but it conveys a polished and mannered styling of men talking.Into the action of the film, the two leads take us through the hell of Flanders with mud, rats and corpses, and as these sequences proceed it seems as if the grammar, the structure of the drama is like a multi-level game where the avatars start on one level and then move onto another encountering new places and dangers along the way. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is the logic to the film's pacing and drama.The impression is sealed in the second half when our hero is lost in a shattered village and meets a woman - nice quiet moment in the game here - and escaping the ruins falls over a steep waterfall and lands in lush country. Where such a high waterfall is in that part of Belgium is a mystery, and then to enter a sylvan land is even more mysterious. It as if he went up to level 8 in the game.Then there is a battle scene with troops going 'over the top' while enemy shells rain down; meanwhile our hero is running as these shell bursts but do not disturb his relentless legs, nor shake the earth, never mind that the shock waves would upend a normal man.It's not Passchendaele, nor any battle front as documented, but it is like a game where you are a courier sent on a deadly mission to deliver a message before the lives of 1600 men are potentially squandered.It's not as if the film industry hasn't perpetrated a fraud with history, this one just seems more insincere than most."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"At the time of writing this, 1917 is up for 10 Oscars, fresh off the high of winning best drama at the Golden Globes. I haven't poured into exactly what it is nominated for, but I know that it is up for best picture and best cinematography. Unfortunately, I can't say I agree with the academy on it being a best picture contender. That being said, this is some of the most brilliant cinematography I have ever seen in my life. For the uninitiated, the film is shot in such a way that it seems like it is all done in 1 or 2 scenes. I know some big name films have done this before, but this is my first experience with the style. When you combo that 1 take with the brilliant picture and color that 1917 provides, you end up with a stylish and enthralling story that would have otherwise felt lackluster. Definitely worth a watch and a cinematography Oscar."
1917,25 March 2020,9/10,"April, 1917 in France, British Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackey) are ordered by the General to go to an isolated regiment to order them to stop their invasion because it is a trap as the Germans are lying in wait for them. Telephone lines have been cut so soldiers need to be sent. Corporal Blake has more of an incentive to make the trip because his brother Joseph is in that regiment of 1600.This is a very long movie, but the pacing is on target and there is one big surprise along the way and that was a shocker for me.For the most part we see Blake and Schofield cross into tree-less enemy territory littered with dead horses, dead bodies, mud, rats, broken tanks and guns, barbed wire and barricades; and they also had to keep watch for German strafing planes. There were many, many trenches and I felt I was going thru them with Blake and Schofield. They also entered abandoned German trenches that were booby trappedThe camera work was seamless watching Blake and Schofield go thru what seemed like miles of trenches loaded with sand bags, and heavy planks. The photography and cinematography were spot on. Suspense and tension crept in from time to time. The music was haunting at times.Notables: Mark Strong as Capt Smith who told Schofield to have witnesses when he tells Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) to stop the invasion because he likes to fight; Richard Madden as Lt Joseph Blake; Colin Firth as General Erinmore who from his desk wished Blake and Schofield good luck on their mission. The entire cast of mostly no-name professionals performed exceedingly well.This is a movie that finally gave overlong tribute to WW1soldiers. This is a soldier story and one not mixed in with politics. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Hey, this is war.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: No.
Language: Yes, but very brief.
Rating: A"
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,A very quiet and loud movie at the same time. Unbelievably beautiful shoot all the way to the end. Even tho it's not great pretty smart script.. simple yet really make you ful.
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"In like 30 years into future people will probably talk about this movie that is how great it is. Following two young soldiers go into journey that will save many lives in ""one shot"" is the peak of the movie making in 21st century.This masterpiece must be praised for a lot things.One shot filming is beyond this world and words can't describe how it makes you feel. Because scenes feel so long and takes take so much time tension and actions of our characters are elevated. Moving camera through so many things and obstacles that cinematographer Roger Deakins faced and his solution for every scene is brilliant and even if you try to pick point where he cuts, slides, fades camera is difficult. How time goes you realise that our characters are going to face more and more difficult things and the thing that just keeps you tight in seat.Each ""set"" or scene has its own gems and gives different feelings. From scary to tense to death threatening to relaxed to heaven like to tragic feelings it just has no flaws and it is because of how much all actors rehearsed and knew exactly what to do and when gives you emotional rollercoaster.Directing of the movie of this proportions looks like just hardcore moviemaking and it feels like it would be so hard and you are right it had to be very difficult to move so many pieces to get perfect scenes that feel flawless and flowing like river.Let's not forget that you are getting teased by story and how it always manages to throw you off certain feelings and emotions to another ones that might even be opposite it like 2 minutes time. It's so simple premise yet done in such fashion that will keep you interested whole time. Movie is 2 hours long and it feels like you have witnessed whole day in 2 hours.Performances are great even though they are not center of point but two young actors George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are great at what they are doing. There are also scenes with Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch that are fantastic, just fantastic.Beautiful, powerful, moving, tense and will keep you hooked to your bones. 4/4"
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"I'm so glad I got to see this in theaters.I love how the movie is immersive, and it uses the ""one shot"" thing to be even more immersive, you feel like you are in the middle of WWI, alongside the two main characters. That's my favorite aspect of it. And isn't being immersive what a movie's goal is in the first place?And man, the sequences throughout the film are insanely great. I believe the main example is towards the end where Sco has to run through a whole army that's running in the other direction, it's of the best and most suspenseful sequences of the year. A bit before that, there is another great sequence, that's just gorgeous, with the flare guns, and bombs lighting up the sky, while Sco runs and people shot at him.The cinematography as a whole is outstanding, Roger Dickerson is really one of the (if not the) best cinematographer working today. It's beautiful.The acting is really good as well, George MacKay is the heart and soul of the movie. Dean-Charles Chapman is also really good. And some great ""cameos"" of more known actors throughout the movie are also really entertaining, and they give solid performances. Like Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Mark Strong, and Andrew Scott.The movie is is emotional, thrilling, and gorgeous at the same time, and the score is great.Anyways, to sum up, I freaking love the movie, it's one of the best war films I've ever seeing, it's my favorite 2019 movie, and truly an unique experience to have in a movie theater. There is not a better way to describe it than saying that it made me remember why I love cinema. And that's 100% true."
1917,29 January 2020,6/10,"1917's rave reviews have heralded the visuals and the storyline as elite; even the marketing campaign has gone to great lengths to demonstrate how the ""one-take"" effect of the film as a masterful piece of cinema. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean the mediocre storyline really ever comes together; massive set-pieces and inspired lighting aren't enough to buoy the jumbled cameos and obvious cuts in scenes, which ultimately hurt 1917 more than they help. Some of the film is beautiful, but you were bound to hit the target once or twice considering how much Sam Mendes threw at this project.The story follows two British soldiers across uncharted territory, given only 24 hours to deliver a vital message to a general on the warpath. To me, this is an uncomplicated storyline that war films need to deliver on more - there is potential for drama, thrills and every setting imaginable - but writers have a habit of wanting to convolute the story. The plot does lean heavily (and not in a convincing way) on coincidental events to help drive the drama and tension, which does create a plot that verges on entirely incredulous.All of the sets are immaculate, constructed to utilise the weather and the light to create an atmosphere. The sets must have all been built to preserve the idea of a ""one-take"" film, and this is 1917's downfall. The camera will follow the subject for 20 minutes at a time, navigating every obstacle that usually interferes with a shot, only to then pan behind an easily avoidable object like a rock. Why commit to this technique if you aren't doing it properly, or if you could do a better job with a few cuts? It baffles me that Mendes didn't realise cutting infrequently (such as in Birdman) would make a better-looking film than using unnatural frames to keep the one-shot integrity alive, and this sort of naivety is exactly why 1917 isn't as good as some people think.War films, in my opinion, should use unknowns for all roles apart from the leads. If you are trying to tell a story, it should not rely on A-list actors to prop up exposition, otherwise you lose the anonymity of war, and instead end up with a mismatch of famous faces. 1917 is guilty of this, with cameos rammed in left and right: Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden, Andrew Scott and others all appear for less than 5 minutes each, but break all realism when they rock up on screen. What is even worse is that they weren't given the roles because they required great acting talent to perform - they were just the most well-known people looking for a job.By the end of 1917, I wondered if the plot really mattered - it becomes somewhat lost amongst the flashy visuals and the blaring soundtrack. It wasn't a more considered work than other war films, and I would rather watch Saving Private Ryan or Beasts of No Nation than this frankly over-celebrated piece of cinema."
1917,23 January 2020,8/10,"Written by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, and directed by Mendes, unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know that 1917 has been done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two single shots (the marketing material says one shot, but it's two - there's a cut-to-black/time-jump about midway through where no attempt is made to hide the transition). In reality, of course, there are a lot more than two shots (the longest single shot was just over 8 minutes), but the edits have been digitally 'hidden', much like Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) or Utøya 22. juli (2018). Working with cinematographer Roger Deakins (who'll win his second Oscar for the film), Mendes wanted it to be the most immersive war movie ever put on screen. And although I have some issues with it, I think he's made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are unusually tightly matched, with the style extremely effective at delivering the story in a thematically justified manner.April 6, 1917; the Western Front. Two British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). Recently, German forces have fallen back, and Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) of the 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment believes that if he attacks now, he can turn the tide of the war. However, he's unaware that the retreat is tactical - the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, Schofield and Blake are assigned to physically carry an order from Erinmore to Mackenzie calling off the following morning's attack. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered.So, the film's big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable type of form that whenever it's used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way. If the content can't do that, the form becomes gimmicky. Think of, for example, Rope (1948), which was edited to look like one shot, or Victoria (2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design. Compare this with genuine one-shot films such as Timecode (2000) or Russkiy kovcheg (2002), and edited one-shot films such as La casa muda (2010) or the aforementioned Utøya 22. Juli, all of which tie form to content in such a way that they become indistinguishable. And I think Mendes achieves like synergy.Is the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you're playing the game of trying to spot where editor Lee Smith has hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I realised I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits, instead letting the cinematography do exactly what it's supposed to do - immerse you.Generally speaking, the majority of the film is shot in one of two ways - either the camera is behind Schofield and Blake, following their path, or it's in front of them, facing back towards them as they 'follow' its path. There are some minor deviations from this, but the film never leaves their presence. And because the two men are almost perpetually in motion, it means that the camera is almost perpetually in motion - if they're walking along a trench, we're walking along a trench; if they're moving slowly through a bombed-out town, we're moving slowly through a bombed-out town. Almost everything the camera does is because one or both of the protagonists are doing the same thing, further emphasising the correlation between form and content.The opening scene serves as a superb introduction to the technique. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then the mess, then down a ramp into the trenches. Geographically, it's a short walk, but thematically, it covers considerable ground, and perfectly encapsulates one of the main thematic reasons behind the single-shot - to accurately convey the importance of geospatial relations. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we're moving in real-time through the milieu; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this sequence conventionally, and you undercut that.Along slightly more conventional lines, one also has to commend the work of production designer Dennis Gassner. Every location is visually unique - from a German bunker to an abandoned farmhouse to the bombed-out remnants of Écoust-Saint-Mein. His design of No Man's Land is especially laudable. When the men first crawl venture out, they immediately encounter a rotting fly-covered horse carcass. Gradually, however, the battlefield becomes more mechanised, until they eventually pass through a German artillery position, with their journey charting the progression of the conflict itself, which started on horses and ended up in tanks.Also in a slightly more conventional sense, one has to mention Deakins's work during the nighttime scenes in Écoust-Saint-Mein. The entire village has been reduced to nothing but the shells of buildings, and as we pass through the town, the only source of light is from the flares arching through the sky, which create very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the garish light traverses the sky, it's as if the ground itself is in motion, almost liquid-like. It might be a little too aesthetically beautiful for a film aiming for such gritty realism, but for aspiring cinematographers, you won't find a better study in how to compose a sequence using light and shadow.Thematically, by its very nature, 1917 is far more focused on the micro than the macro - you might learn something about life on the front, but you'll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict. Partly because of this, it avoids, for the most part, the overwrought patriotism and cartoonish jingoism that make films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) so obnoxious. Indeed, the protagonists' nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film. On the other hand, you shouldn't expect too much psychological insight. The Thin Red Line (1998) (for my money, the greatest war film ever made) it most definitely isn't. Having said that, however, I would value its simple individualised insights above something like the empty temporal trickery of Dunkirk (2017).In terms of other problems, the story is unquestionably paper-thin, but that's pretty much by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake constantly are, each with a perfect set of teeth. One only need watch They Shall Not Grow Old (2018) to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, the duo look like they've just stepped out of the makeup trailer most of the time, and it's glaring enough on a couple of occasions to pull you out of things.All things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed 1917. I thought the single-shot strategy worked exceptionally well, and even if the film is weak from a character/storyline/theme perspective, it didn't really matter when the form and content are this well matched. This could have become an empty technical exercise predicated on nothing, but Mendes hasn't allowed that to happen. The Great War was hell on Earth. 1917 doesn't make us feel what that hell was like. Because no film, no art form, can do that. But it's a very fine approximation."
1917,2 February 2020,8/10,"Not since All Quiet on the Western Front has there been a greater World War I movie than 1917. The film's famous one shot is absolutely brilliant, seemingly unedited and delivering the best angles at any given time. The production design is spectacular, the score is suitably intense, the acting is so strong and underappreciated, the direction is amazing, and some of the imagery here, especially the fire scene, felt truly artistic. But the movie is so much more than just this unprecedented technical achievement. It is a film about brotherhood and friendship, it's downright heartbreaking in some scenes and its most impressive achievement is how it was conceptualized as an immersive adventure film and an exciting video game. The ending is emotional, the night sequence is incredibly suspenseful and the abandoned barracks scene is unforgettable in its entirety. Consequently, Sam Mendes here directed his magnum opus and one grand war picture for the ages."
1917,17 April 2020,9/10,"After reading ""1917,"" I thought of a lot of things. Because of the exchange and work, I have more opportunities to stop and go in the UK. From Oxford with its colleges to bath with its tourists, to the streets and corners of London, from Edinburgh with its elegance to inverness with its desolation, one does not have to look far to see monuments, statues or parks commemorating the first world war -- more than 43, 000, I am told.From the summer of 1914 to the winter of 1918, more than 900,000 young britons died in foreign wars. Nobles and plebs, college students and apprentices, volunteers and draftees, however different their identities and life experiences, all ended up as strings of Arabic numerals and English letters on a stone. This is absurd, but even more so is the war.The first is the lack of meaning. The so-called world war is the avarice of the Allies, the ambition of the Allies no side, a brush fire, Europe bombed. Being a soldier may be cannon fodder, but in the end you have to aim for something. When Europe's bones have withered, except for the United States and Japan two white-eyed wolves, who did not see a successful war. ""Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism"", but what millions of europeans paid to die for it seems neither empire nor capital. The last four emperors lost their empire, many capitalists lost their wealth, and countless workers lost their homes. This is ridiculous.Then there is the lack of baseline. All wars are inhuman, but in the past man was still like a master of war. From the beginning of the war, people became slaves to the war. To shape the humanism of modern Europe is to turn people into ground rats and jam them into trenches, spending the whole day in darkness with the opposite side. The reason brought about by the enlightenment is to stuff the meat grinder with all kinds of materials that command people to become regular. The two industrial revolutions were marked by more powerful machines, more powerful artillery, more insidious mines and chemical weapons of endless variety: mustard gas, chlorine gas, phosphorescence, benzyl bromide... This is ridiculous.So it's easy to see why there are so many great war movies about world war ii and so few about world war I. In world war ii, the United States saved the world, the Soviet union won the respect, Britain and France continued the war, the Chinese shaped the concept of a modern nation with their flesh and blood, countless small countries gained their independence, jews found their homes, Germany and Japan ushered in a transformation... Soldiers dying in battle, either with the will to fight against the axis of evil, or with the conviction to create a new world, no matter how low, have the consciousness to die for the sake of the imperial movement or national glory, these are the highlights that can be made into a movie. And the young men who died absurdly for absurd ends in the first world war? A bunch of dead ghosts?But the monuments to the first world war, all over Britain, seemed to tell me otherwise. When I walked the western front with corporal scofield on the days and nights of ""1917"" with Roger dickins' long shot to the end, I was more convinced that it wasn't.When Blake pulls him to the task of delivering the letter, he immediately questions the danger. He worries about walking through no man's land during the day and complains about why his comrades take him with them. Unlike Blake, he doesn't have a brother to save, and he hates war. His skill was not good, his brain was not brilliant, and being in a foreign country had left him black and blue from repeated misadventures. This character setting, combined with the shooting technique of the film's long shot, gave me a strong sense of substitution, as if I was sent to the front, the extraordinary play is almost so. But then I began to doubt their own willpower, the movie atmosphere is tense, I and the corporal's perspective is the same, do not know where the danger is hidden, ghost territory like no man's land, the sniper in the ruins, in the dark in close combat, burning streets in the chase... I suspect I may have had a nervous breakdown at some point.But in order to complete his comrades' instructions and save more compatriots, corporal scofield finally chose to go forward. In the ruins, the ruins, the swamps, the rivers, the trenches, the bayonets, the artillery, he knew he had to give the letter to a fellow named captain Mackenzie to stop the attack. This was his task, and the whole point of his existence in that day and night. He shouted to his comrades to push the truck, braved bullets alone to cross the broken bridge, fought desperately with poor marksman and the enemy in the attic, strangled the enemy clumsily in the dark, and ran in a panic, swam across the river of corpses, squeezed through the trenches, and ran to the front... I even felt like I was watching forrest gump, but corporal scofield, by this time, had really changed from the beginning of the film, and he had acquired a courage that was not his own but that he had to carry.At the end of the movie, he completes the task, even though the task itself is absurd. First, as McKinsey put it, they sent soldiers today to stop the offensive, and soon one or two more to tell us to charge at dawn that the only way this war could end was if ""the last man died."" Second, the corporal may have saved 1,600 lives in Devon in the spring, but in the following summer more than 300,000 British soldiers would die on the western front, probably everyone he saved and himself, while the Allies' front would have advanced by a few miles. Second, almost everyone except the commander in chief would question whether such a dangerous mission could be carried out by just two soldiers. However, in the age of lack of communication technology, the meaning of these big soldiers is to ""send a message to the chief"". The lives of one or two people are probably worth only so much.I think the director was aware of this absurdity, and there are many scenes in the film that show the cruelty and even the nothingness of the war. What impressed me most was the same white cherry blossoms as Blake's hometown. The water glistened blue, and at the end of its petals, there were pale, mutilated bodies covered with bubbles. In this sense, I think the director's failure to arrange the mission (such as arriving at the front where everyone is already charging) is probably more shocking.If war is the continuation of creatures' plunder of living space and resources in the nature, and the ultimate destiny that human beings, as a kind of creatures, cannot escape, then the various values that human beings have practiced by burning life in the war are the unique proof of human species. ""Tragedy is the destruction of the valuable things of life to people to see"", the war itself is a tragedy, and even in a meaningless war like the first world war, even if the two soldiers finally gained nothing, I still see the crown of thorns of the human spirit in their heads, that is, the courage that is huge to have exceeded individual life. The lions face the flock and go away in silence; And in the face of the devil of war, even more terrible than the devil of the absurd fate of death, there may still be ""I go"" consciousness.The monuments of England, like the innumerable nameless war memorials, graves, and tombs of mankind through all ages, are affectionate tributes, silent indictments, and indomitable cries against fate."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"There was a lot of hype behind this film before I got a chance to see it myself, reading review after review...........giving extremely high praise and being tipped to win Best Picture at this year's Oscar's!!!!! It had a lot to live up too............I am please to say that for the most part, yes this film is truly incredible.....however I ended up not liking it as much as I thought I would !!There is three people behind the camera I want to congratulate first on this epic achievement. Firstly, no surprise, Sam Mendes..........to even think the idea of shooting the film pretty much one take or so it looks like it was done in one take, is extremely ballsy. Granted he isn't the first or the last filmmaker to use this technique on film, however nobody has come close to this scale as of yet.......especially in a war film. Right from the get go the film starts and it doesn't stop at all really until the end, the run time flies by...........this is helped by the ""one shot"" use. Simple but an interesting, emotionally driven story that keeps you riveted all the way along........you as the audience are taking each corner or scene with the characters. The amount of detail that has gone into this film is incredible, especially after watching some of the behind the scenes...........wow, a truly wonderful achievement, one of Mendes's best. The other two people behind the camera who deserve a mention are Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman respectively. The combination of their cinematography and score at times really really does leave you speechless............both of them absolutely top class !George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both great in the film, its definitely helped by the fact that they are relatively unknown actors, which can only help in the audience immersion and believability of their characters. You simply believe them and their rationale for everything they do and say..........they are young men being put in an almost impossible position, I cant quiet fathom how terrifying that sort thing must have been............if this story were real !There some great little cameos to from some extremely recognisable faces. Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch all have small roles but are extremely effective. The film needed someone who was more experienced.......a leader and all of them were great on screen for their limited time. Good work!However after all of that I'm left in a really strange place...........I really really liked the film it is very good don't get me wrong, its just maybe I was expecting something that much better considering the hype?!?!?! I don't know what it is about the film there is just something.......not lacking but something that little bit extra special.....I cant put it into words or describe it.....its just a feeling!! Put it this way if you gave me the choice of watching ""1917"" or ""Dunkirk"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge"" I wouldn't choose ""1917"".........Its just not very re-watchable!?!??!Overall though with that little minor gripe out the way I still really really enjoyed the film it is very good 80% out of 100.........not my favourite of the year, actually nowhere near being the best of year for me........but thats my personal opinion!! Great directing, acting, production design, cinematography and score...........just not very re-watchable for me unfortunately!! But definitely should go and see in the theatre !!!!"
1917,14 March 2020,6/10,"I had seen all the nonimations ect and had to check this out ...I was expecting to be blown away by story and special effects ect but what I experienced was Underwhelming....the story just didnt have much to it and felt like it dragged with periods of intrest and action and a whole lot of nothing going on in between..Decent acting but not oscar worthy and the story ,i'd only rate as fair, just not that interesting and only a few notches above boring...Good sound and effects when there Was action but mostly the movie is 2 guys chatting as they make their way to their goal and alot of nothing happing in between... ok movie but not a great one"
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"This movie doesn't have unicorns and it doesn't have wahmen, must scream at the sky instead of enjoying this masterclass of cinema. Compelling story, characters, and filmmaking; you know, just the real things take make a good movie.
Go watch a good film, hopefully the low iq generation of scream at the sky social justice losers fade away into obscurity."
1917,25 November 2020,8/10,"The acting from the two main lads is great, the pacing is good also. The plot is very thin and the dialogue in places is very spotty and messy.The cinematography is spectacular however. This is one to watch over and over simply to look at how beautiful it is. The camera work is top notch, no shaky cam garbage here. The music and audio are very good and accompany the piece very well.Over all I was very impressed, but just left wishing the dialogue wasn't so rough and lazy for the majority of the senior officiors that the protagonists come across during their suicide mission.The colours in the film are beautiful, the lack of gross filters and over contrasted crap is very welcome. This is a beacon in cinema on how set and cgi can be combined with some absolutely stunning pieces of work. The long takes are breathtaking.8/10 needs a stronger plot and dialogue to be higher for me, but otherwise a spectacular movie."
1917,31 January 2020,5/10,"Couldn't wait to see this thinking only Hollywood could  up a war story, i stand corrected. Soldiers didn't cry like this yeah maybe after the action died down or sitting alone thinking of what they went trough but not while its happening if at all, found it very slow and boring i left after 90 min and wish i would have left sooner,This is a movie for millennial men not real men"
1917,30 January 2021,8/10,"This movie has you hooked from the minute it starts, wasting no time jumping into the events and action. The story follows closely to real events recalled during WW1 and doesn't stray from it like you'll typically see from the Hollywood elitists. Sam Mendes directs this exceptionally and the cinematography is stunning. Totally worth the watch"
1917,5 December 2021,9/10,"This is not only a great war movie and a great film overall, it is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. My God, the camera work/shots in this movie are so well executed from beginning to end and the journey of one man navigating across so many obstacles put in his way is pristine and invigorating. Directors should take notes, THIS is why I love films and analyzing filmmaking."
1917,9 February 2020,6/10,"Well, the directing, cinematography, production design, and music definitely deserve their nominations! However, this wouldn't be my pick for best picture of the year. All in all, glad I saw it, but wouldn't see it again."
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,"#MovieReview #1917 #SpoilerFreeReviewAll the buzz and the hype around this movie beating Joker and the Irishman to the Golden Globe for Best Picture-Drama is understated in my opinion. What a brilliant, brilliant piece of cinema this is.1917 grips you from the first sequence and refuses to let go as you cant help but root for Lance Corporals Tom and Blake in their torturous journey in the front lines of World War 1. More than Director Sam Mendes' stellar canvas that has paid attention to even the minutest of details, it is Roger Deakins' camera work that leaves you spellbound.Relative newcomer George MacKay plays Lance Corporal Schofield with the subtlety and nuance of a seasoned actor and is brilliant in the emotional sequences towards the end.Three very special guest appearances-two of our friends from Baker Street along with the ""Young Wolf"" add further sheen to what is clearly, the odds on favorite to win the Best Picture Oscar.Do watch it in theaters for the full experience!"
1917,11 March 2020,10/10,"A Masterpiece, wow! I really marveled the way this movie was shot, something I've never seen in any other Movie or director do. The story was gripping from start to the finish and very realistic. Lots of good acting and dialogues plus good music too. This is a movie I highly recommend. 👌🏾"
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is utterly incredible. Obviously from a technical point of view. The editing is flawless. You can make guesses where the cuts were made logistically, but they really are seamless. You can tell that they really put a lot of work into the film and it was simply breathtaking. The ""continuous shot"" isnt a new concept but it was done brilliantly for a film like this. It's more than a cool technical gimmick...it really makes you feel like you're on this journey too. And the action, and tension just never lets off. Well, at least until the very end. You're just in constant fear and sadness for these guys. And George MacKay who pretty much carries this whole film is absolutely brilliant and I think should be getting more attention this awards season. If he wasn't good, I dont think the film would be as successful despite the technical achievement.If I had to mention one slight problem, is that if you have seen the trailers or even just THAT clip of George Mackay running through a battlefield with bombs going off (which is a brilliant scene) you know that he is alone. So *SPOILER* it wasnt that much of a shock when his friend died. It was still sad for sure. But like, I think it might have been a bit better if felt like it came out of nowhere. More like how George MacKay's character would have felt. But, honestly thats just one small gripe and I rather liked how the character's death was dealt with. I actually quite liked the scene right afterwards when he's in the truck and the other soldiers are having a conversation and joking around and then there's just Mackay's chaarcter (William) just sitting solemnly trying to process what just happened. Its a great juxtaposition. And then much later on when William is floating in the river, barely holding on and the cherry blossoms start falling down him. It felt like it was a symbol of hope or a message from his friend from beyond the grave to not give up. It was a nice and touching addition to the film. The only other small thing I will mention is that since the film seems to primarly follow William, a lot of the big name actors that you see on the poster or in trailers like Colin Firth or Benedict Cumberbatch for example feel like a cameo. In it for like maybe a 5 minutes and then gone. I mean, it makes sense story wise, but still a little, I don't know, jarring? But really, on the whole the film is amazing. If you want a film to put you right in the middle of war, then this is it."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,The action scenes and sense of being there were good. The use of making ditches for the soldiers and the after effect of the war footage was very visually well done. I thought the camera angles were smooth and you're right they didn't have many cuts. They filmed interesting tracking shots. I also enjoyed the piles of dirt with various soldiers sticking out in various ways. They must've had fun designing that. The camera angles didn't seem shaky cam. They either used a smooth digital camera or mounted it on rails like the do for some action movies.
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"Great plot, superb acting and camera. Good music. Just don't expect 2 hours full of war battle action - that is not the purpose or the focus of the movie. But rather to tell a story about two men on a desperate mission and the consequences tied to that."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"Putting the camera on your two protagonists for the entirety of the film is a risky move. So is telling a fictionalised story in a historical setting. But here, it absolutely pays off.I was knocked back several times by both the horror and the beauty I was witnessing on screen. Unlike many war movies, it's not preoccupied with white male rage, mad-cap shenanigans and the gratuitous brutality of war. It focusses only on the mission the heroes, their surroundings and the many, many terrible and moving events in both in and out of the trenches.The music, direction, production design and cinematography should all win awards for this."
1917,7 January 2020,1/10,"1917 is definitely a decent movie, and yes, there is no denying that the ambitious ""one-take"" filming method was very impressive and certainly an achievement, but the writing was paper-thin at times- not as much as Roma was (not that bad), but it had some weaknesses.Before watching it I glanced through a few reviews, and one in particular that stood out as ambivalent is the one I recalled, as I agreed with the reviewer's opinion that 1917 has every war movie cliché you could think of.Literally every cliché is in here as its main scenes, but there is something else I found even more bothersome than that, which is that a few of the scenes are actually dumb. For example, the two messengers witness a dog fight, and they actually identify their allies as winning, but a few moments later the plane they are pursuing is shot down and lands nearby where they are. Rather than play it cautiously, they immediately rush to assist the enemy out of the plane to try to save him. This directly leads to one of them being killed when the pilot stabs the one of them. I mean, what kind of solider in a major war would naively try to save an enemy without their weapons drawn and cautiously? This was very problematic to me.Another issue that I had once again pertained to suspension of disbelief, or implausibility in that the surviving messenger is shot at constantly throughout his journey with bullets just missing his head on numerous occasion. I mean, this guy has plot armour on him that is thicker than season 8 of Game of Thrones, particularly the episode, ""The Long Night"". Everyone around him is constantly getting blasted by bombs and bullets, yet this guy is just luckily and randomly getting missed. For one scene, I would be like, okay, but this goes on in every battle scene all the way through to the end. I'm not an expert on WWI, but at what point does the viewer have to say, ""There's no way this is how it was- that a guy can just expose himself constantly to gunfire, bombs, and hellfire, and not get a scratch on him?""Don't get me wrong. There is no denying that this was a good movie, but I couldn't help but feel those three main criticisms: the clichés, the plot armour/suspension of disbelief, and the thin writing. And pertaining to the thin writing, I understand that they needed to give the actors lines, of course, but every single dialogue felt like they had to put ""that"" kind of scene in to make it feel like a war movie, and that's not to say it was bad, but just cliched.Speaking of the writing, if you are a person who mostly enjoys great, original dialogue and style, then you will probably notice this too. However, you will also be unable to deny how impressive the ""one-take"" filming method is. Another thing to mention is that due to the thin writing, it gave off a very nihilistic vibe a lot of the time. I questioned often if there was any deeper meaning to anything being shown. The reason why is because it seemed like they were going for some depth, but the climaxes were not reaching any moral or lesson. Again, when the pilot was being saved, I thought, 'okay, he's showing that in war helping your enemy is noble?""...but then it results in a nonsensical death, and yet still it wasn't trying to say not to trust your enemies in war, either; it was just a random event brought about by being stupid by underestimating the pilot in an unprofessional soldier way for a big war.Finally, I have one other big issue with this. Toward the end, this stranger basically crashes the battalion's gathering, and he begins asking where the Commander is, okay. Not one single soldier asks him for identification to confirm he isn't some rabid dog or assassin. They easily trust him and give up the location of their head Commander. But that isn't all- that is just the very back group he first meets. As he proceeds to chase after the Commander, trained soldiers allow this maniac to just knock them over one by one without being suspicious of him or questioning what his problem is as he advanced through. But it doesn't even end there; when he arrives at the bunker area, or front line, he continues to ask where the commander is, and the other captains continue to immediately comply with his request, giving up the location of their Commander to a stranger like it is no big deal. Seriously? What if he was an assassin? Nobody asks for his identification or why he wants the Commander's location.....Oh, that is until he finally arrives outside his door. It is finally THEN that they make a big deal about what kind of a threat he can be. I had big problems with how this scene was set up. We're supposed to believe the Commander of the entire mission is supposed to be that simple and easy to get to when being pursued by an outside low ranking soldier?On a plus note, I liked the very end and thought most of the movie sufficed as entertaining and a decent watch. However, I would NOT qualify this as a Best Picture favorite at the Academy Awards due to said issues. It had beautiful filming and beautiful shots, but the writing came up cliched and short of what it should require.-1 (Little character development/thin writing)+9 (Cinematography/One-Take choreography success) -1 (Cliches/Suspension of Disbelief/Plot Armor)= 77/10"
1917,17 January 2020,1/10,"Out of ideas, they decide to do the one-take style that the Revenant, Roma, and Birdman did, but oh, for some sort of originality, let's just do it for war, and at that let's pick WWI so people don't confuse it with Nam or Private Ryan.Sure, camerawork looks good, kudos, but the shoehorning, lack of a script, mediocre acting, deux ex machina, no character development, and suspension of disbelief turn this into a sort of dumbed down cartoon of a war picture. The only emotional scene was in the final 30 seconds, Everything else, basically was implausible. The fact that some people are raving about and loving this movie shows that either a) the studio, Mendes and those involved have hired a bot army or shills to hype it up, or b) moviegoers are that desperate and dumbed down, but it's probably a combination of both, leaning more towards a) as the predominant reason.Plot armor like Commando, a ridiculous scene about milk, and soldiers administering dangerous enemies with nursing like they were their family member makes the whole script unrealistic and implausible."
1917,9 February 2020,1/10,"First of all, let me qualify my rating of a ""1"" as a counter response to this junk being considered as the ""frontrunner"" for Best Picture at the Oscars and ranked #51 currently on the top 250. It's really about a ""6""-""7"", but many of the reviews and gushing that has occurred with this average movie are irritating and untruthful.Many years ago, a friend of mine got me to watch the movie ""Atonement"", which I had heard of but never saw before, and I was surprised a good portion of it had a lot to do with the WWI time period. Some of the more memorable scenes in that movie which made it stand out were based on events in WWI. While I didn't love Atonement, I could at least see why it was nominated for Academy Awards because it was artistically written and filmed with several layers and themes that stuck with you, at least for a little while after watching it. Well, Atonement never won any major awards, despite the nominations, perhaps justly so as although it was a pretty good movie, it wasn't all that.Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest WWI-II time period war movie ever made also did not win Best Picture at the Oscars. Both of these movies are at least twice as respectable and good as ""1917"", which except for the impressive one-take filming method, comes across often as implausible, dumb, banal, and believe it or not actually laughable at times with how ridiculous some of the scenes are. This movie actually borders on ""Commando"" territory with the main character's plot armor, and that's only one point of many with what is wrong with it.To even consider this movie in the same league as SPR is laughable in many ways. Even a movie I didn't like too much like Atonement, at least it had some depth and an actual script with character development. This war movie, 1917, has practically nothing except for the one-take clever achievement.It actually ""tries"" to add depth, but it fails when it zeroes in on implausible and cheesy scenarios with the milk-baby scene, the Indian winding up in the back of the truck just for PC-oriented people, and a superficial yet disappointing attempt at tying in themes of family and moral dilemma, especially during the final act. The way it handles these attempts at depth truly comes across in a manner in which it seems like the ""target audience"" of this movie is Marvel comic book fans and teenagers. The visuals are great, but it has basically no depth at all. It cheesily places good actors in ""cameo"" roles, when their acting gravitas should have been used in major roles somehow to add credibility to it, instead.I just can't believe the Academy might stoop so low as to hand this Best Pic when it really has a weak script and writing. It would only validate the fact that the quality of movies Hollywood has been producing the past decade or two has fallen officially so far as to reward borderline-Marvel-comic book films that play out like video games for teens as its Best Picture."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is a breathtaking feat. Filmed and edited to appear as a single tracking shot throughout, 1917 is a skillfully crafted powerhouse of suspense and emotion that poetically captures the stress and eeriness of trench warfare with engaging performances and gritty production design all around. Heart-pounding and technically superb."
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,"I watched this with my son and was so bored I couldn't get through it. I called the ""plot"" changes before they happened. How can this be called the best motion picture of the year? I'm baffled. I didn't find it remotely interesting. It was filmed well but I expect way more out of a film. This was just a poor attempt at telling a heroic story."
1917,8 September 2020,9/10,"The use of single-camera techniques, first mastered in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948), is beautifully utilized in this film too. Even for a serious, sobering, war film, like 1917. It is an amazing piece of art, complete with great timing, acting and execution. This is something that you need to see. A first person account if you will.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB"
1917,1 February 2021,8/10,Intense adventure through enemy lines that makes you feel like you were there!
1917,8 February 2020,8/10,"What a war movie to start the new decade with. With raw and visceral directing capturing the heartbreaking reality of WWI, the film follows the character of Will Schnoner who travels across with his brother to the other side of the battlefield to end the conflict. It is some of Mende's best work and is my second favourite of his now behind Skyfall. It is also in my opinion the best film on Britan vs Germany in WWI and is my personal favourite war film since Saving Private Ryan.It's gripping, emotional, human and real which conveys a lot about the British Battalion with the minimal but careful use of dialogue between each of the characters. Colin Firth and Bennedict Cumberbatch were very enjoyable with the screen time they were in and the musical score was also very powerful"
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"Not really a fan of the war genre , but this is a film that is difficult to dismiss easily. Its seemingly one-shot cinematography is masterful how it captures a diverse landscape throughout the runtime. The narrative, based on Mendes' Grandfathers stories, balanced the right amount of tension in amongst the futility of war. Personally, I believe this experiment is more of a success than not."
1917,22 February 2021,8/10,Impressive cinematography. Unique experience. Lacks a compelling narrative and characterization. Emotional payoff not quite there.
1917,14 May 2020,8/10,"Unfortunately I did not get to see this movie in theatres, as it was meant to be seen. But I made due with the Blu-ray version. Even so this movie did not disappoint.A cinematic achievement of sorts this is indeed. Perfect no. But it need not be. What it is...it is moving, harrowing, addictive, haunting and mesmerizing all wrapped in a savage beauty courtesy of the great and wonderful Roger Deakins whose subtle brilliance is all over this movie, guided by Sam Mendes's direction.The story is compelling and lean so as to fit the movie's framework. The cast (thank you once again Nina Gold!) is on point, the music/score is epic when needed and eerriely beautiful, courtesy of Thomas Newman. In short this movie is all one expects and wants in a film worth more than its title, subject matter or surrounding hype. As I've said, it is not a perfect movie by any means, and surely lends itself open to some valid criticisms.Still, ""1917"" will definitely take it's place amongst the best war movies. Is it the best ever. No. But it sure deserves to be considered amongst them. We all think about ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Flags Of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima"" and miniseries such as ""Band Of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"", just to name a few of the movies and shows worthy of praise and accolades. ""1917"", even flawed, I think does belong amongst them and in my opinion, it more than gives Christopher Nolan and his magnum opus ""Dunkirk"" a run for it's money.While there are other compelling WWI movies, a war that has failed to ignite the same response and interest as WWII, especially in Hollywood, ""1917"" is a fine addition.8 out of 10"
1917,14 July 2020,7/10,"Almost as low as 3, not 4. Sadly. Disappointed in this :(Brilliant at first, up through somewhere around the German bunkers.Before this, it all seemed very, very natural. Immersive. Characters worked great, happy with the leads as actors, the main supporting folks.But too many cameos that are overtly themselves instead of the character, that then pop me right out of it. The creepy tension of no man's land... just disappears. And it's not clear why that had to happen or even what IS happening. There are Germans just... about? And also British troops? And no lines are crossed? Confusing.Several scenes seemed needless and didn't match the narrative. I don't get why the basement hideout scene was important, and it ended rather abruptly.Long sequences worked well with the long shots, but others felt contrived, and made it obvious. To the point I'd rather have cuts than whip-pans and so on. A few times the camera tracks oddly (out the window while the character walks down the stairs?) and also makes the camera no longer an observer, but an active thing you think about.Music was needless and distracting also. A movie all this immersive, with mostly (apparently) wild sound, and then music comes up. Nope. Wanted to go in and turn off the music track.Oh, and lastly: the overused-in-promos scene running across the line of charging troops looks AWFUL. Explosions (at least) are CGI. The rest of the movie is real; maybe some distance items painted out, but otherwise real. This really stuck out like a sore thumb."
1917,7 October 2021,7/10,"This movie, being the 115th highest rated movie, I did have some pretty good expectations and was excited to see this film, but it was honestly dissapointing. The movie has beautiful cinematography and has amazing and beautiful camera work and the one-shot throughout the movie is unique and well done. The movie had a good story, but was distracted too many times by unimportant, forgetful things. It was also very unrealistic how this guy lived, running in a straight line towards gunfire and bombs without a scratch. Still with it's flaws its a fun and enjoyable ride. (If you enjoyed this movie, or even dissapointed in it and like war movies in general then I recommend to watch ""Come and See"" a beautiful war horror masterpiece, similar to this in a way but done far better."
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"Review:
'1917' is an epic-war film directed by Sam Mendes. It is based in part on an account told to Sam Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes.
What a beautiful film! It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while.
The film chronicles the story of two young British soldiers (Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay) during World War I who are given a mission to call off an attack doomed to fail soon after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line during Operation Alberich in 1917.
Without trying to sound like an ass, because the source material for this film is so powerful, but the performances from the two leads were mediocre. They make you care about their characters which is important, but they don't really embrace them. We get small parts from Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch who all bring amazing performances in the little screen time they get.
This is a gorgeous film and it's not just due to the fact that it has amazing editing to look like a single shot, but the cinematography is stunning. There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film.
Overall, it's easy to see why this film was nominated for Best Picture along with others. It's an incredible film that should be seen by everybody.
5/5"
1917,28 January 2020,6/10,"It really disappoints me this movie had nothing beyond fantastic cinematography, some decent acting and some great visuals.The movie lacks story, it lacks depth, it lacks emotional investment in the characters, and it failed at keeping my attention throughout.Now let's get this out of the way I'm not some guy who needs an action scene ever 5 minutes, good dialog would be enough for me but the writing barely even there.So far it seems like 99% of the reviews are about the cinematography and ''1 take'' filming style.This movie ultimately failed to make the audience care for the characters they had in front of them. It failed to show the absolute horror of world war 1. It failed to show the grime and dirt, the desperation in the men, of fighting this war of attrition.This is going to be a bit of rant review, because I was intensely excited for a WW1 movie, and general reviews (I didn't really want to spoil myself with more in depth stuff) were very positive.First of the grit, it seems like they didn't want to show the true horror of this war except through either some dead bodies or injured people in the medical bay. The full last ''action'' scene in particular was something that almost felt PG rated. I'm not asking to see legs flying everywhere, but gore is a part of war, especially the first one. And it missed the mark, why I take the biggest offense from because WW1 was ****** horrific. One of the worst wars in history.But that aside, the characters, William, a soldier that a care about why? They added a little personality to his mate that died, and that was a emotional and unexpected scene for sure. But then we just travel around with this empty shell of a human being. Which I guess, his journey was wanting to die in the war but after telling that brother and seeing his mate die, he realized he didn't want to. But It felt so unsatisfying.With the other people I went with we all agreed we didn't care for the character at all. We just weren't invested in what'll happen to him. And to be honest, I really was expecting him to die, to make fulfill that empty feeling and show the true side of war, but it ended with a happy ending..I guess.Another thing, those germans must be really stupid. A british soldier avoiding multipule german encampments, being spotted by flares. With that flare scene just being a ''cool visuals'' scene in the end. They never chased him down, we barely even saw them for that matter. Seemed like no one really cared for this one enemy soldier, even though everytime we meet a german they want to skin these guys alive seemingly.This leads to the scene with the woman and the baby, he gives food, and leaves, but again.. character development? What was the point of that scene?And wow, just the final scene once he delivers the orders, first he was told to get out, but being persistent he reads them, and okay.. call the men back. That's it? That's what I watched this journey for? No view of the germany's response or from the brits?Pfff.. I can go on, I'll leave it at this.6/10 for cinematography and visuals. The rest is mediocre and I would not recommend friends to spend money on this movie."
1917,24 January 2020,7/10,"Take a dollop or Saving Private Ryan , take the finale of Gallipoli , ignore the build up of All quiet on the western front and you've got yourself a film which is really good but not as good as the above .Having said that , it had its merits . The story , the cinematography and the craft of the hand held one shot were all compelling .Without a doubt Sam Mendes has produced an exceptional film and the 10/10 reviews show that the majority of the public have enjoyed it . However for it felt like there was something missing or things missing . I didn't feel my questions were answered , there was little background information about the main protagonists and no explanation about how the brothers chose or were given different opportunities. We didn't really learn anything about the enemy , the rats had a bigger part in the film than any characterisation of the Germans . Those who were portrayed were stereotypical baddies . With 100 years passed we all are patriotic and grateful for the losses of our forefathers but films like The Water Diviner ( 2014 ) go some way to explain the background . With a title like 2017 the story deserves praise for not focussing on America entering the war and pandering to Hollywood and the risk has paid off a film about British sacrifice has succeeded at the box office because it's a human story .It's not perfect and it doesn't have the charm of War Horse but the realism of the aftermath of battle give it a realism that many other films overlook . It won't satisfy those who want to see an action war film . It's linear story with an against the odds plot that you can absorb yourself in .It's good. It just could have been better . The emotion of the final scene makes it a must see , go with low expectations and you'll love it .Pad.A 7/10"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is not about War, it is about a person who is caught in the nightmare of WWI and for 2 hours I stopped being myself and wondered if I could have done it.Sometimes, while watching a really good movie I would get this mysterious surge of energy filling me up with all kinds of emotions and that's when I would know that I am witnessing something truly special. While I have seen some great films in the past few years that I absolutely loved, nothing has felt quite as ecstatic as 1917 which is the best movie that I have experienced since Interstellar.The story depicts WWI but instead of focusing on a major battle, a monumental victory or some grand individual, it chooses to tell the tale of two simple soldiers tasked with delivering a crucial message. It was literally one day of their lives but because it happened during the war, every minute of that day felt like a harrowing experience. There aren't too many word being said and to be honest they are not needed because experiences such as those makenit hard to talk.One shot. Could you imagine a two hour war movie made of only 1 continuous shot? 1917 flows in a smooth motion and on the way it brings us along for the journey unlike any movie that I have seen before. When the bombs exploded the sound was deafening and when the leaves rustled, I could feel the breeze around me. As a history fan, I was pleased with the accuracy of both the decorations and the visible morale of the soldiers. There is a number of powerfully emotional sequences that felt like they were scraping my heart because of the constant proximity to the charaters.1917 is a perfect blend of storytelling, style and technical achievement and I give a deepest bow to Sam Mendes and the team for this symphony of cinema. What I loved is how a number of big name actors appear in this film for a few minutes and yet manage to make a lasting impact on both the protagonists and myself. There are no hidden meanings or forced agendas, just masterful filmmaking that must be experienced in the cinema.As much as I love Saving Private Ryan, this is my new favorite war movie of because it allowed me to feel as one of it's characters.#moviesshmovies"
1917,4 April 2020,10/10,"World War One is not a popular subject for Hollywood it's often not explored as much as The Second World War. As it seems very few Directors are willing to take on the mud and the blood to produce an original story. However this is a great peice of UK film making, shot on locations such as Salisbury Plain and Scotland. With a stela cast of British actors who are not over stated or underused. The main story is about two characters we are shown this from the start. It's a journey, even a race against the clock. It's tense and slow-burning simmering away. It manages to avoid being predictable and shows the war from our young tommies point of veiw. Its a fresh take on a movie where by the feel of it being shot in one take helps improve the story. This is the best British film about World War One and to me atleast, the best British film released in awhile."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Two young men are told to go deep behind enemy lines to deliver a message to call off an attack. This film is shot in a non stop viscerel way in one fluid take. The cinematography is stunning to look at. The direction by Sam Mendes is the real star of this film. He moves the camera in a way that really gets you in the thick of the action. There is minimal dialogue, the pacing of this film is really well done. The two young stars of the film do a great job carrying the movie. I really enjoyed every minute of this film, it was a joy to watch. One of the best films of the year."
1917,29 February 2020,9/10,"The best part, stuck to the plan; you got a message which you need to deliver and there's no other path chosen; I liked it. After a long time viewed a gripping ongoing war movie where there is no war shown upfront but its after affects and from the back end. The one before which impressed was Dunkirk but believe me, this one surpassed. What also energised me was the story building with an equal build of eagerness in my heart to wait and watch how the duty is fulfilled at the end.A few scenes which gave goosebumps were the mine explode, Corporal falling in river and out of no where Germans attacking their nemesis. There was no extra gore, unwanted violence and over stretched actions and yet it had all war content. However, said that, when you got so many expectations built and a perfect story line in place, you tend to find what missed or went offtrack and to me, it was the discussion with stranger lady and the child which asked a point to be deducted.Anyways, go and watch if not already, you won't regret."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"The one shot format is oddly experimental and takes a bit to get used to, but it's faultlessly done. Not sure it beats a regular edit though, as it can feel relentless. The story itself is believable and really gives a sense of the remarkable bravery shown by those envolved."
1917,29 June 2020,2/10,"There are roughly 2 way in which you can tackle a historically set movie. Either you create a meaningful narrative that exists in that period or you try and show that period in a way where the audience can experience something that is truthful to the period.This movie attempts both and subsequently fails at it so incredibly bad that I am baffled by the massive blind spot people seemingly have and will excuse any obvious bastardization of history as long as the main gimmick looks nice enough.First of all. This series of events never actually happened, nor it it plausible, but that we could overlook if the story itself is somewhat meaningful. Well, unfortunately it isn't. The plot isn't character driven, the characters are pointless, do not develop and are basically scenery.So how does it fair with providing some meaningful experience? Perhaps even worst. This depiction of the WOI is absurdly chased and viewer friendly. Black Adder goes forth is situationally more accurate and meaningful than this romanticized garbage.I would not put it in the same level as holocaust denial, but it is certainly the same filing cabinet. The writers and producers should hang their head in shame for this borderline revisionism of history.The gimmick is executed rather competently, which is a shame, because this effect could have been used so much more effective to illustrate the horror and madness of trench warfare. Just for the gimmick, one extra star in the hope that a proper writer with actual historical sensibilities will use this for a movie that actually respects the source material."
1917,20 March 2021,7/10,"This is about World War One, and whilst it doesn't reflect much on Sam Mendes' grandfather's actual stories, it's a good story nonetheless. The battlefields of the Great War are brought to life through beautiful cinematography, where it feels like its all done under one shot. I felt like I was reading a poem in school."
1917,11 February 2021,7/10,Forward moving story from the opening screen like soldiers are asked to do forward men. This movie moves like a soldier always forward no time to reflect no flashbacks forward onwards into the unknown.
1917,22 January 2020,8/10,This film manages to look at the First World War in a different perspective to many others. It focuses on a race against time to warn a company against an imminent attack that is a trap. It's strength is the way that it combines at times incredible tension and danger with effective paced character development. This is only possible because of two stunning performances from its leads MacKay and Chapman. The ordinariness of these two characters makes the heroism more impressive and believable. A film that has real humanity .Great cinematography too.
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"No wonder 1917 is getting awards by the truckloads- it is a fine war movie. Not only because it makes you abhor war, like every good war movie does. Also because it is without being overtly gritty, a very realistic portrayal of those lowest in the pecking order- the infantry-man. And also for the fact that technically- it is a marvel.It is also a very different kind of war movie. Thank god to the title, it did not need a prologue, or any character build up. We straightaway jump into the odd mix of silence and mayhem that trench warfare was in the First World War. We learn that the Germans have made a strategic withdrawal and are waiting to pounce on unsuspecting British forces chasing them, with the obvious mcguffin being telegram wires cut. The task of stopping the pursuing British forces from attacking the artillery reinforced Germans falls upon two Lance Corporals- Blake and Schofield, and they literally have to go through hell to succeed. Shades of another war epic from Spielberg I say, along with some inspiration from Tolkien of course.""They're walking into a trap. Your orders are to deliver a message calling off tomorrow morning's attack. If you fail, it will be a massacre""The plot is based on a true story told by director Sam Mendes' grandfather. And Mendes goes all in to make 1917 an experience like no other. For people unfamiliar with WW1, a large part of the war was fought through two opposing trenches- the land between them known as No Man's land. Last time we saw No Man's land in a big budget mainstream release, it was Wonder Woman's launch pad. Grim, but still comicky. In 1917, the opening tracking shot has to be admired not only for the authenticity of the sets, but also the way Mendes is able to show change in attitude and morale of the soldiers as we get closer to the trench frontline. No man's land is hell itself though- dead horses with files buzzing around, dead soldiers hung up on fences or caked in the mud, craters that much rather be euphemistically called death pits, prowling aircraft waiting to machine gun stragglers, and the rats that are constantly feasting on still festering bodies- there is death everywhere even if the enemy has long left.""You are in no man's land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but remains forever, icy and silent.""Blake and Schofield somehow make it through initially because they have each other. The loss of Blake at midpoint in addition to what he has already experienced strengthens Schofield's resolve further as he is on a race against time. And all throughout there are scenes that pay homage to past war classics- the encounter with a German sniper is reminiscent of Enemy at The Gates, the touching moment with the baby calls out to Ayer's 2014 tank classic -Fury, while the knife battle in the shadows again doffs its hat to Saving Private Ryan. It is to Mendes' credit that he makes Schofield's Frodo like journey believable till the end, even as he put his life one final time by sprinting through the battlefield to prevent the homicide.The two main leads do not have come with loads of experience, but they do an excellent job. Pity that the script did not allow for a Game of Thrones reunion. In fact this is perhaps the only film in 2019 where everything comes together in a perfect symphony- music, cinematography, realistic sets, CGI, acting and the script.The list of Oscar nominations for 1917 is a testament- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects. The best part is that unlike Joker, this is no award baiting movie. This just has a honest story to tell, and Mendes tells that with honesty and style, and that is why it is my pick for all the awards it has got nominated for.This is a mesmerizing movie. Technically brilliant, and shot in a way that kind of immerses the viewer the way Dunkirk never could. Sorry Nolan.Here is a bet- watch the movie, and if you are not running in your mind as Schofield makes his final dash, I will pay for your ticket."
1917,23 April 2020,5/10,"For some reason, IMDB gets rid of many of my original reviews or doesn't print them. I gave a highly detailed review, with nothing offensive, that was never allowed on the page. I have no idea why. This is quite annoying, when you have an entire critique wasted and your time wasted-- for absolutely no reason.Anyway, I was very excited to watch this WW1 movie, but hailing it as the next Saving Private Ryan is just stupid. The movie and cinematography are very amazing, but that is it...that is truly all that goes on in this film. It is like watching cut scenes or playing a video game. Hell, even a game has more action and exciting scenes. I cannot believe they wasted all this time with hardly any real trench experiences or massive battles, etc. They didn't develop characters, and there are terrible moments where the guys should kill a German, but just run past him, so he can alert the others. WTF??? In one scene, the hero has a German chasing him, firing at him. The German falls down a few feet behind him, but seems to still be pursuing him. The hero simply rounds a corner and walks into a house with a girl and her baby, calmly spending a few hours chilling with her, as if nothing happened. What happened to the guys chasing him??? Then he jumps in a river and floats a mile or so from the enemies and walks up on a bunch of Brits just sitting around with their backs turned, listening to a singer. No sentries on guard or anything. The behavior of the unit he goes to warn is stupid as well, and nothing else pivotal ever happens. This movie is WAY overrated, and could have been a true masterpiece but is more of a 1-6 rating, rather than 8. Make a better story next time..."
1917,21 March 2020,10/10,"Thank god i'm alive to witness this miracle. it's an epic film from every side, from the cinematography, music, acting, direction by a genius in Sam Mendes. it's one of a kind masterpiece."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"I just came back from seeing '1917', and it's a tense, absorbing, grim, and yet inspiring 2-hour journey. The theater was packed, and you could sense that every single person in the audience was mentally and emotionally glued to the screen. It's a fictional story, but built from real elements that director Sam Mendes heard from his grandfather, who acted as a messenger during WWI in just the same way as shown in the film. The WWI setting and the basic storyline sound familiar enough, but it's all in how the pieces are put together, and having seen it I now know why it's a Best Movie of the Year contender.A bit more than halfway through the movie there is an absolutely riveting centerpiece: a few British and German soldiers are trying to get through a ruined French town at night without being spotted and killed by the other side. Half-fallen buildings and corridors of stone arches are illuminated by flickering light from bombs and flares that come and go while they hide and run. It's as if we've stepped into an eerie, lurid half-world from a fever dream. I've never seen anything like this before, and words don't do do it justice -- just go and see it. This scene when added to several others feel like a tour through the circles of Hell (as in, Dante). That sequence is almost equalled toward the end when, the next morning, the battalion goes 'over the top' from the trenches while one of the messengers, Will (played by young George MacKay) runs desperately down the line across them to deliver the crucial letter (a small part of that scene appeared in the trailer but the full scene packs a far bigger punch).Aside from the big set pieces, the whole film is beautifully constructed, seems to flow organically from beginning to end. Like the ads say, it feels like ""one long take"" (which it really isn't, but it goes further with that technique than any other film I know of). What that does do, however, is make the action relentlessly personal and individual with the focus on the two messengers, Tom and Will. The two lead actors MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman nail it as two ordinary soldiers asked to do things that no human should have to experience. They are not superheros: the real heroism, for them, is simply surviving and persisting through their own fear and confusion, long enough to get their job done. Bigger names like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, and Andrew Scott fill roles that are essentially big cameos, but they importantly bookend the story.And I also want to mention Thomas Newman's musical score. It's superb. It's unobtrusive (or silent) when it needs to be, and epic when it needs to be: it emphasizes what's going on without taking over.100 years after the actual events, I don't know if it's possible to get any closer than this to recovering the lived experience of World War I from the viewpoint of the individual soldiers. A great companion piece to ""1917"" would be Peter Jackson's documentary ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" (2018) built from recovered and restored film footage taken during the actual war. It's brilliant too, but in a different way. But it verifies that ""1917"" almost uncannily hits the right notes. WWI can never be portrayed as anything other than horrific, but (maybe for that reason) it's been a magnet for lots of past movies good and bad. Some other recent films that use WWI very effectively though much more briefly in their storylines are ""Passchendaele"" (2008, Canadian-made), ""Tolkien"" (2018), and (yes) ""Wonder Woman"" (2017). But ""1917"" goes past them all."
1917,15 February 2020,9/10,"Amazing work of directing, all events are pretty real, the story is always tense, but not just the war and the shoots, have humanity, and a different look about war, what turns all the movie unic."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"Two soldiers got the oder to bring a message to another companie. It should prevent that 1600 men run into the enemies trap. On that Journney, the two soldier face indescribable cruel and disgusting situations. In this movie one can feel with the very authentic and sympathic characters of the two soldiers and it feels bad for sure. It also shows how soldiers must cut out the impressions of war, because they have to survive. So they can't be sidetracked by the dead bodies all around. And it's also not filmed with a raised pointing finger.It's not only the often mentioned one-take-style in which the movie is filmed. It also has a complete authentical production design. All I saw looked very real from the clothes over dead bodies to the explosions and fighting scenes. That makes the walk of these young guys a high suspension travel through the abominations of war. The dialogues are suspense-driven, the camera is great, the sound fits in every second. Great done! Big movie! A MUST see recommendation!"
1917,12 April 2020,8/10,"A WW1 movie depicting the horrors of trench wwarfare.The squarlor, the pain of war, the terror and inhumanity. They are all here. My only complaint: by shooting the movie in a single shot, the movie may seem like a scenario with multiple scenes. But beautifully shot."
1917,6 April 2020,9/10,One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. This should win a few academy awards. Actors were great and storline was extremely well put and tied together. It is a war movie. but not like any other you have seen. Critics and audience were spot on with ratings. For once. the critics were right!!
1917,18 October 2020,7/10,An epic visual masterpiece of the often ignored (at least in this generation) horror of World War I.
1917,30 December 2019,10/10,"A war that is now a century old (and therefore no longer widely understood) is vividly captured in this stunning dramatization by Sam Mendes. It portrays the journey of two British infantrymen who are tasked with the near-impossible assignment of alerting another unit of an approaching trap. The one-take film focuses on their grueling slog across no-man's land to the other unit's location. Along the way, their path encounters many instances of danger and surprise.Not always easy on the senses- in fact rarely so- this film gives one a first-person perspective on how hellish and miserable this war was. And although the story is about this particular conflict, one gets the sense that many of the realities of war in this film are still applicable today, a century later. That's what makes this such a startling film experience. As for Roger Deakins' cinematography, it is every bit as breathtaking as one would anticipate from him. Highly recommended to those who are familiar with this part of history and to anyone who has served in combat and who would know the horrors that are portrayed here. And recommended to everyone else."
1917,24 March 2020,5/10,"1917 is a hard film for me to critique, because I love history so much and finding decent WW1 films is extremely hard to come by, and it is a well-made (for the most part), good-intentioned film.For the good, I thought the cinematography was outstanding (except one gimmick), the parts were well acted, and the film exuded polish. The light effects in the ruined city alone were amazing.For the bad, all the camera work was heavily lauded for its unusual style, but I found it extremely unnecessary and limiting. Every scene is a very long one-shot? Neat. But ""why""? I felt like the only place it made sense was the opening, to show the size / scope of the trench warfare, and the ending, to display the ""over the top"" battle scene. Other than that it didn't really lend itself to helping tell the story at all.
Also, for being a Best Picture nominee, there were a ton of contrived / forced scenes that seemed almost silly. Soldier finds (shockingly) unspoiled milk on an abandoned farm, then, wouldn't ya know it?! He finds a mom and baby hours later! What a ""coincidence"".It's like those point-and-click computer games of old where you find a random item that you eventually use to solve some later quest, like Myst or Space Quest.
Well, this isn't a cheesy 1980's video game, so that's a problem.Also, I felt like the death of the main character's comrade in arms was a big misstep, not so much because I cared about the character, it was because from then on, the trip becomes a big, silent slog, other than the aforementioned miracle milk incident.Beyond that, having the main character ""just miss"" the start of the battle in the end was just an excuse for a gratuitous WW1 battle scene, it served no real purpose otherwise.Bottom line, good film, basically, probably just a little too forced for me to ever watch it again."
1917,22 July 2020,5/10,"As many other have mentioned,the cinematography of ""1917"" is marvelous. It really grabs us by the collar and take us inside the movie. The casting is also good. The two main actors do a good job and they do look their partBut, the story is pedestrian. There is nothing new here. We all know wars are ugly messes, and that there are good and decent human being even in the bloodiest of the battlefields.1917 is only eye candy."
1917,23 February 2020,7/10,"What's good :
Acting is all good
I found particularly impressive the general feel of the film, uniforms and dirt, attention to detail made a very gritty realism.
Lot of cameo roles for well known actors.What was not so good:
I gather this was a number of stories told to the director and although I was totally absorbed for the whole film, they didn't particularly dovetail together.Or possibly it is the rather weak pretence (to link the stories) of just 2 men being sent to deliver a vital message.But very watchable film, I was totally absorbed. Not sure I would watch again but certainly enjoyed the film and was worth the price of the cinema ticket."
1917,21 January 2020,5/10,"Went to see this because of the hype. Yes it has some great moments, but a lot of cliches - milk for the baby, tell mother I love her - and too many coincidences - the river takes him to his objective, the brother is quickly found after they go over the top.
Good for Sunday afternoon television, but it fell short of the target for me."
1917,19 June 2020,10/10,"Just rented this on Google Play Movies, and it is truly an amazing movie. It is a very effective War Adventure Thriller with amazing visuals, truly a masterpiece and an instant classic. Must Watch for me, very well worth your money."
1917,3 February 2020,8/10,This movie is truely unique giving you feeling of living the moments in WW1 times. It's brilliantly shot and the continuity in movie is amazing. Really impressive and a must watch if you want to experience Cinema.
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"1917 is about two soldiers who need to get a message to a group of soldiers not to attack this area of they will all die.1917 is a Great War biopic that I would recommend for anybody. If you want to see it but you are worried it will be too violent, that isn't a problem. The Irishman is probably more violent than this picture. Every moment of this film from beginning to end made you feel like anything could happen at anytime. That was one of the things I loved about it. The score adding to that making it feel really intense or happy at anytime of the film. The imagery was a work of art. It was some of the best I have ever seen! It all looked fantastic and you couldn't take your eyes off of some of the scenery. The whole story was really fascinating to watch. I was really never thinking about other things in its runtime. Part of that was how intense the picture was as I said earlier. The war scenes were really well put together. There wasn't too much but when they happened, you felt like you were there in the action. The cinematography is something you just can't talk about this film while reviewing it. It was outstanding. Besides for one cut it all looked like it was one shot.Overall, 1917 is a great war film I would recommend to anyone."
1917,24 March 2020,8/10,"One shot. Movie about saving fellow armymen from falling into a trap. So two brave persons into no mans country zone. Time. Thrill. Action and emotions...
This also shows why he had won the medal and sold it for some drinks. He is fierce, uses his mind over emotions, and makes the duty prime along with saving his life. The other person, is too innocent, soft and why war shouldnt happen reflects in his character. He doesnt belong to war but he needs to save his brother and cant think of any other thing...
Will they be able to save the fellow armymen?!"
1917,4 December 2019,8/10,"This film is an immersive and wholly impactful experience showing viewers just how visceral and hellish it was to be in combat during World War I. Directed by Sam Mendes and stunningly shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins, this film tells the story of two young British soldiers who are given orders by their superior to deliver a message to prevent an attack in a seemingly distant area of France. The film is (mostly) shot and tightly edited to appear akin to one continuous shot that grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go.The intensity of the film is almost heart-stoppingly powerful. Viewers really feel the tension and anguish that countless young men were forced into during the war. The use of tracking shots and differentiating scope and scale further make the film's war action seem even more impactful. Its production design is outstanding, with unbelievably detailed recreations of various landscapes of the Western Front. Two the surprise of no one, Deakins' cinematography is remarkable both in its ambition and its execution. The film is incredibly well-acted, and also manages to develop its characters well, almost placing their current states of being into a figurative tapestry summing up the film's primary messages and intended takeaways about the war in the exact moment in which it is set. All of the film's scenes and major setpiece moments are superbly edited not only to look like one take, but to establish stunning tightness and cohesion to the narrative.While the film is undoubtedly great, it's not quite perfect because it could have used some contextualization about what exactly was going on in the war during this exact time in 1917. Even though I'm a history buff to some extent and knew the basics of that, I would have appreciated some more specific information. It would have been possible to do this without breaking the film's ""one-shot"" style, as such context could have been revealed through dialogue or visually. This is the main reason that, while a very strong achievement without question, this film does not quite rise to the level of Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk,"" another visually immersive representation of a short time frame in a terrible 20th-century war. The time span of the film seems very slightly contrived as well.That said, this is probably the most unique and detailed portrait of World War I since ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" and I absolutely recommend it. 8/10NOTE: I saw an advance screening of the film in RPX (Regal's premium large format.) While the picture and sound quality were good, I still feel that RPX is inferior to Dolby Cinema and IMAX."
1917,13 March 2020,9/10,"Great war movie, straight story without any kind of flaws."
1917,9 January 2020,9/10,"Easily 2 of the most gripping hours in a theater I've experienced all year. Through a series of extended shots made to look like one continuous take, we follow (without breathers) Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield through a visceral and relentless journey during WWI. In addition to top notch direction, set design and music, I'm left with just two words: Roger. Deakins. The man is simply the greatest cinematographer to have ever lived and here he captures nothing short of technical brilliance. The man deserves b2b Oscars for this masterpiece!"
1917,15 January 2020,6/10,"I was lucky to attend a preview screening of this for almost nothing. War movies are never my first choice. They either seem to be glorified body counts using high tech killing machines or preachy ""isn't war just terrible and we should all be ashamed"" movies. This one is in the latter camp. This is a saving private Ryan style narrative minus the pyrotechnics of the opening scene. Two soldiers are selected to pass a message to a commander to halt and advance into a planned trap. The movie itself is basically about their journey and the overall emotion it conveys is one of tension. The problem I had with the movie is that the soldiers are basically inept. Every problem that they face is basically self inflicted and the result of bad decision making. Which makes it a little hard to be sympathetic. This is really a story about dumb luck and who does or doesn't have it.
It's well shot however it has less visual impact than the recent Peter Jackson effort which used real moving film. Which brings me to my next point. The tone of 1917 is very sombre while as the Peter Jackson documentary showed that wasn't always the case. For some reason its forbidden to show anyone smiling over anything in world war 1. This will earn high praise from the anti war middle-class that's lovely cinematography crowd. But many will be disappointed when the movie doesn't match the initial high scores of professional critics. Midway was a much more entertaining and emotionally engaging war movie."
1917,7 February 2021,7/10,"1917 (2019, Sam Mendes)
This is a tough film to rate, and I will probably fall victim to being overly critical on this movie. In a vacuum it is a very good movie. It is well shot and acted very well although it does have that British sensibility which can sometimes seem a bit austere to an American audience. It tells an emotional, meaningful story set in war torn Europe following two young soldiers who are trying to move quickly through enemy occupied territory in order to bring a message calling off an attack that is doomed to fail. To add to the gravitas one of the two soldiers has a brother in the unit set to attack. This gives extra urgency to the film. The two lance corporals are played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay. Chapman is most easily recognized as his role as Tommen in the hit show 'Game of Thrones'. It is actually funny because Richard Madden makes an appearance later in the movie and he is also a 'Game of Thrones' alum. Maybe it is just that so many superlative war films have been produced or maybe it is because this feels very derivative combining many elements from a lot of those other war films, but whatever the case this film just didn't connect with me. Both actors did admirable jobs in their roles. The whole thing felt off to me. I didn't feel shock or horror at the violent carnage portrayed on screen. I didn't get emotional when tragic occurrences happened. The whole deliver a message plot seemed a bit like a contrivance. I know this was based, in part, on stories that Mendes grandfather imparted, but in a world of epic war stories this just didn't feel very epic, but at the same time despite just focusing on these two men who were traveling I never got a sense of intimacy either. It is directed well although I found the faux single shot more gimmicky than providing any meaningful improvement to the picture. The cinematography from legendary Roger Deakins is a thing of beauty. I think it is easy to lump this film into the best films of the year simply because it checks a lot of those boxes that we think those films are supposed to have, but I have just seen this film too many times told in just as good if not better ways for '1917' to get too much praise from me.
Eric's Grade: B-"
1917,13 January 2020,6/10,"I wanted more, simply put.
1917 was directed by the extremely talented Sam Mendes and stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman on a journey to deliver a message to stop a British attack before it starts.Starting off with positives, it's immediately apparent that the work put into the set, costume, and sound design is among the best of the year, and Roger Deakins puts on a dazzling spectacle with his camera-work, making it look like the movie was shot in a single take (and in the titular year). But it's here where the movie begins to fall apart.While the technical aspects are top notch, the story and writing are just decent. The characters have a severe lack of depth and in a two-hour movie, it doesn't work in the movie's favor. Some may compare this to Dunkirk, which is a film that I think is one of the best movies ever made, which may prompt the reader to question why I thought 1917 was just okay.The pacing. That's the movie's biggest problem, unlike Dunkirk, which was almost entirely break-neck in its speed. While the pacing in 1917 is by no means bad, it isn't fast enough to justify spending so much time with characters that the audience doesn't have much reason to care for. Also there's a couple moments that made me question the intelligence of the two leads. Similarly, characters come and go throughout the movie, making criminal underuse of actors like Colin Firth and Andrew Scott.I understand that most of war is downtime, but downtime in film isn't engaging, at least not without characters to care about or good dialogue to speak. Most of the movie is spent walking, this may be credited to the one-take method the movie is using, which begins to feel like a gimmick the more it goes on.Overall, 1917 is an extremely competent piece of war cinema, but one that sacrifices dialogue and characters in lieu of a camera gimmick. While it's by no means a bad movie, I don't think it warrants the seemingly infinite praise it's receiving.

1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes is one of my favourite directors working today so that alone made me excited for 1917. That excitement only increased after the one-shot approach was announced. The coming together of this Director, approach, setting and Cinematographer convinced me this film was going to be something special and i truly could not have loved it more. I truly believe this film will be remembered as a landmark in film making and I cannot wait to see it again.Technically speaking this film is jaw dropping. The one shot approach never feels tedious or over done but instead completely immersive. Because of this, the tension is only exploited more. It truly feels like a 3 man mission, with the viewer feeling like the 3rd person in this mission. This is due to Sam Mendes gorgeous direction but also Roger Deakins spectacular cinematography. His work in this film is truly stunning no matter what setting the film takes, he truly deserves his second Oscar for this film and cannot see the academy not giving it to him.George MacKay And Dean-Charles Chapman both carry this movie wonderfully, I've seen other work from both actors before but this is truly the best I've ever seen both of them. Their chemistry is on point and there are plenty of subtle moments that build their characters. I truly hope to see more from both of them in the future. The rest of the Supporting cast play fairly small roles but all worked perfectly for what they needed to achieve. Richard Madden And Benedict Cumberbatch probably stand out the most as they both come into play at the end of the film and pay off in what we were expecting to see from them.I truly loved how this film portrayed its setting. It doesn't feel like it conforms to the usual cliches found in other war films. It conveys the horrible conditions of war and the constant fear of death in ways I haven't seen enough from other films of this type. I found myself latching onto the characters because the writing had made them so human and relatable. As cheesy as it sounds you do truly feel like a participant in this war during the 2 hours you spend with these characters.1917 is a masterpiece and very possible the best film of 2019. Mendes' one-shot, vision is truly realised to perfect effect and feels immersive like no other film before it. Roger Deakins stunning work in this film truly makes it feel as if no one else could have pulled of the cinematography to this level of perfection. The films gives us just enough character development to care about everyone involved. The film puts you into World War One for the 2 hours it has you and I wouldn't have had it any other way.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)"
1917,22 January 2020,3/10,"It's a nice enough movie to watch , if your expectations aren't too high .
Better yet, have no expectations at all, and a few drinks on a slow night when watching this .It's a war movie, that tries to be a special, a memorable war movie .Unfortunately, this desperate desire of the creators not only is omnipresent throughout the entite film, it is also a goal way beyond the skills of the makers .There are a few brief fine acting performances . Just not by the lead actor(s), who is (are) instantly forgettable . So forgettable, you have to remind yourself it's still the same character ( 2 of those for part of the film ) after you blinked .There also are a few very nice shots and beautifully put together locations .
It's a shame that the camera work and editing is so poorly done, you never really get a good sense ot them .It's an ongoing theme - the viewer never gets involved in the scenery, the story, the action, the mediocre attempts at adding depth to some situations .
And certainly not in the main characters, who appear like interns from catering were cast .As for the one-shot thing , it worked in a few scenes .
The technique was developed to add dynamics and/or density to scenes, that were usually fairly sort, a complex piece of a more complex overall concept .Here, the creators chose to go the easy way, and just threw that technique at the entire movie , whether it made sense or not .Apart from the film NOT being done in one single shot - for those who were fooled into thinking so - it also only works in a few scenes, and severly compromises the rest of the movie .
And even in those 'good' scenes. it really isn't very well done, and wasn't worth the effort . Mainly because it was a lazy, incompetent effort, the writing didn't match the camera work, and they just didn't try very hard .Above all, the movie is boring .
It's an unimaginative , cold and stage like presentation; stereotypical, stale and again - completely uninvolving .But at least we now know that the one-shot thing can be done very wrong - even when it's a fake - and should be used for different projects, and by better skilled creators ."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"This film is a phenomenon, and possibly one of the best war films I have ever seen
1917 is visually gorgeous flim"
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"1917 .... Oscar nominated.British war film set in the trenches on the 1st World War . Two soldiers sent on a near impossible mission... across, behind and underneath enemy lines.
It's a great film and the two male leads captive your attention.Sadly the officers are played by the usual British acting hierarchy of Cumberbatch and Frith (how many times do we need to see their faces, are there no other British actors available)
The soldiers fight across no man's land, and somewhat implausible scenarios to reach their goal. Or do they (no spoilers)The clever bit and what's gained it all the plaudits are the ""one"" shot camera work, yes I did play spot the cuts which there are many. Alas the film didn't engage like I had hoped despite some tense scenes. Oscar Nominated yes, Oscar winner No!7/10"
1917,6 December 2019,8/10,"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins combine their talents to deliver an epic war film that is not only a flawless technical achievement worth marvelling at all by itself, but an emotional and tense experience that'll leave you breathless. It's a feeling many films of its ilk strive for, but few can succeed at those lofty ambitions of hitting all the right notes across the sensory spectrum.We follow Schofield and Blake, two young British soldiers at the height of WWI in Northern France, who are given an important mission to reach another regiment and deliver a message to call off an attack which will have dire consequences. They don't have long to complete this mission, and so to increase the sense of urgency, Mendes wisely opts to have the story unfold in real-time. Accentuating this further is how 1917 is filmed to look like one continuous take with hidden edits - impressive in concept, and flawless in execution. By shooting in this way, not only does the experience feel smoother, but we, as the audience, are almost unwitting participants in the young soldiers' ordeal, right there beside them when they have to fight to survive. The level of immersion is intense, and this tension never lets up.In fact, 1917 builds and builds from scene to scene, offering gruelling images, heartfelt emotion and a relentless immediacy. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are excellent as the two leads, supported along the way by some famous cameos. And everyone delivers in each long take, whether suitably subdued or fiercely active given the context of the film and the haunting environment. However, when Chapman's character is suddenly killed, it becomes MacKay's film, and he owns every scene. Rarely have I felt so attached to a character's predicament like in 1917, but his strong performance and urgent mission almost link you to his heartbeat, forcing you to feel everything he feels in any given situation. It's a testament to the script, the camerawork, the music, the production design... everyone involved.1917 masterfully captures the horror of war, the challenge of survival, and the emotion of loss, and Sam Mendes has delivered a breathtaking masterpiece that will make you want to live through it all over again.10/10"
1917,8 January 2020,10/10,"1917 make u feel like its was done in one shot like birdman movie. Best performance by the two lead actors. A Roller-coaster ride of mix emotions showing u the sad, awful and suffering the war had causes that make us more treasure the peace we had now. Some youtuber should watch this movie before commenting about starting a war on other countries in social media when they not happy about being insult by others. Peace take years to build but its only take days to break and hard to restore as now peace is numb to us and we starting to blame each other and forget to give love that needed."
1917,14 April 2020,8/10,"It's really like a game of clearance, the audience has a similar immersive experience. The story is too simple and the depth is lacking, but the technical aspects are too powerful. The soundtrack and scene scheduling are shocking, and there are several scenes like dreams. I am also very vulnerable recently, crying when I see anything."
1917,9 April 2021,4/10,"Sam Mendes decided to make an homage to Terrence Mallick. I was looking forward to this film, so I was utterly disappointed in this boring drivel. Note to self: If an enemy plane is shot down and the pilot is still alive-shoot him! Further note to self: If an enemy soldier is charging towards me-shoot him first. I was hugely disappointed with 'Dunkirk' but even more so with this snoozer."
1917,12 August 2021,7/10,I was so immersed in the technical achievement of this film. Totally mind-boggling.
1917,17 April 2020,10/10,"This Was such an enjoyable event. It's another unique cinematic experience I have had the Joy of Witnessing. I already knew it had a lot of hype going in so I thought I would be disappointed because everything that is ever hyped is usually complete Garbage.Things I liked:° The Camera Style throughout the Movie was such a great idea. It Felt like I was on a ride, It was So exciting.° There is a particular seen with a rat that completely took the Audience by Storm. It was So unexpected that the chatter in the Theatre was louder than the Movie for about 5 Seconds. Such a Great Experience.° The Sniper and Bridge Scene was So Intense!° The Night time scene with the flares was beautiful to Watch on the Big Screen.° The Ending had so much suspense, you really didn't know if he was or if he wasn't.Overall, I've had many Tedious times in the Cinema, I've had some very Average times in the Cinema and I've had many Absolutely Amazing times in the Cinema and this was one of those Amazing Times."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"The acting is great, the music is superb, the gunshot will make you jump, and there are some really epic escape scenes in this film. This isn't a war film in terms of Saving Private Ryan, where there are huge armies battling it out with brains splattering everywhere and so on. This has none of that.This is a mix of Dunkirk (no character development or backstory), Ad Astra (With the slow moving scene and loud music, and The Revenant (people trying to survive against the elements).This is NOT an all out war film like Saving Private Ryan, this is a slow burn with about 2 - 3 really epic moments that will give you chills and make your blood run.Overall just because of the filming that was involve in making this, it is a 9/10"
1917,23 January 2020,6/10,"1917 is in itself a pretty decent action movie: tension building is well done, long tracking shots through the trenches, and even a few outstanding scenes reminiscent of the better work of Bresson, like the bridge crossing scene. However it also has several flaws, ranging from minor to more irritating. It seems the script was not well researched, and this is not Kubrick first reading several years into the subject matter, and then coming up with something perfect.First, the hierarchy as portrayed in the movie is incorrect: WWI meant strict hierarchy, it seems very unlikely orders from higher up would be ignored or reflected upon. In WWI the battle field was a reflection of society at that time, from upper to lower class. In Paths of Glory, by now the benchmark for WWI movies, we see the arrogance of the upper levels slaughtering thousands of soldiers for nothing. As Scorsese noted about Paths of Glory: ""It was so honest, that it was shocking, and what made it even more shocking, was the nature of the way it was shot, the use of the tracking camera and the trenches"".Then, the portrayal of the Germans is more WWII-like than WWI: Soldiers from Europe went to the battlefield in WWI seeing this as an honor to defend their homeland, almost like a football match. They were waved out like heroes, most were very nationalistic at that time. If you have seen the excellent Peter Jackson-documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, you noticed little hate between Germans and British. So, the stereotypical Hollywood bad German is driving the action once again in this movie. To the scriptwriters I would advice them to read a history book about the matter.Another inaccuracy is that individual ethnic soldiers are written into the script, maybe to reflect and conform with current society's ethnically mixed makeup. And although groups of colonial soldiers fought in WWI, they mostly did so in their own regiments, just as society was organized then. Few of them fought as individuals in the main ethnic British group.The story contains some odd situations: Wouldn't it be better for the Germans to catch Schofield alive for interrogation, he also goes through an unlikely amount of luck, and after the river scene he ends up just in the right place. The village looks by the way too much like a film set, and some other sets do not look very realistic either.Then the much discussed tracking shots. See again Paths of Glory: The tracking shots there have more tension, more dynamism, and more speed. Here they are dull. I was somewhat disappointed overall in the work of Roger Deakins here, take Sicario as an example of what this man is capable of.Mendes started his career with an almost perfect script, that was also well executed (American Beauty). Since then he thinks he is a great visual film maker, the problem however is that a guy like Nolan surpasses him in both writing and visual execution."
1917,11 February 2020,9/10,"1917 is perhaps the best example of a movie that I can think of where it actually feels like a war experience and as if you are there with these two soldiers. It's a movie that expertly builds up tension throughout by using silence, music, and the awesome direction by Sam Mendes. It also amazes me how I felt like anything could happen at any moment during the film, which really kept me on edge during almost the entire runtime. It's also a movie that can really capture the desperate situation soldiers faced during the World War and how beautiful the little things in life can be, especially when faced with all of this darkness. Things like a baby or leaves falling off a beautiful tree. It's almost like a horror movie in the sense that you are waiting for a ""jump scare"" of sorts throughout the entire runtime. Some people have criticized the lack of characterization, but I would disagree. I believe we get just enough information to be invested in the success of this particular mission, and enough to care about the lives of the people we follow. I loved this movie and I really don't have anything bad to say about it."
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"A relatively simple story, 2 men have to get a message across enemy lines to stop a battalion from advancing into a trap on April 6th 1917 during World War 1.However the one shot structure, brings you right into the trenches with them, and you get to witness all the small changes in facial expressions, that convey far more accurately than words how they are feeling as they face unusual and daunting circumstances.The cinematography is exceptional, as is the recreation of the trenches and no-mans land. There is almost constant tension throughout the film, which keeps you on your seat just expecting something awful to happen to our characters at every turn.A fantastic depiction of the chaos of war and the cheapness with which human life can be discarded and at the same time, the huge efforts that can be taken to preserve it. It has certainly reignited my interest in the history of the First World War, and will be reading up on it ASAP!A triumph, well worth seeing, you won't be disappointed!"
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,Awesome movie very tense at times I actually thought I was there with them. A few odd things happened in the movie that was questionable. However I enjoyed the movie.
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"Being the director of Skyfall is a dubious distinction, a movie which shows you Sam Mendes has enough talent to waste Javier Bardem's talent. Did the marketing team for 1917 forget that Mendes won a Best Director and Best Picture Oscar for American Beauty? Regardless, it is advisable to avoid watching 1917 and Uncut Gems in the same day, unless you bring along a change of shirts.While watching the continuous shots of 1917, it is difficult to not wonder whether the more entertaining show is actually going on behind the cameras, as the cast and crew frantically get positioned and repositioned for the next scene, pushing ever forward into and out of the trenches. Regardless, 1917 as we see it, is an entertaining, stressful, and sometimes tender amalgamation of World War I anecdotes, a reminder that war is hell, and the push for another hundred yards of territory might be a complete disaster, a senseless loss of life and limbs.Life is not the finish line, but rather how you avoid death along the way, whether it be gunshots, knife stabs, plane crashes, mortar fire, collapsing tunnels, loathsome diseases, or a nagging sense of dread and ennui. Wars, especially world wars, should serve as a morose reminder that we should never take peace for granted, and we need clear understandings of what we fight for."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a WWI one-shot movie, but I could not take my eyes off the screen! The storytelling is incredible and shows the effectiveness of showing a story rather than telling it.Please note, while the movie is labeled as being a 'one-shot' film, there are a few places where the cuts are noticeable."
1917,19 November 2020,8/10,"1917 is a 2019 film directed by Sam Mendes and starring George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman and Benedict Cumberbatch.First and foremost this film is absolutely gorgeus, it may be the best looking color film I have seen, the scene after Schofield is knocked out unconscious and enters the city that is being lit by the huge fire is particularly beautiful with a great use of light and shadows which is something that I really like. It's very well filmed and I think that it looks very well with it's continuous shot (even though it's not REALLY only one shot).But although the visuals and cinematography are certainly the film's most memourable part I also think that the acting is good and the story is pretty interesting.Overall a very solid film although I wouldn't quite say it's on the top 10 of last decade.8.4/10."
1917,17 March 2020,10/10,"The whole film has a degree of relaxation. The war scorched earth of the broken wall, the deafening artillery fire, and the quiet and beautiful European fertile soil,all the scenes were great. I have to say that Roger Dickins, the ""innocent king"" of Hollywood photographers, gave this film a sense of high-level aesthetics, and even shot the ugly battlefield of World War I with a beauty which we have never seen before. Of course, this film essentially expresses ""anti-war"" . This 1917 tells everyone that war is terrible through the stench of two soldiers, the French women and newborn babies who are lingering in the basement.The film tells everyone that war is terrible and peace is important."
1917,28 March 2020,5/10,Unimaginative film with many false high IMDB ratings. False high ratings are becoming common on IMDB.
1917,29 January 2020,8/10,"We have crossed across many war movie but 1917 might be a total different for you. For me, it's something a strange way of execution and portrayal. The uninterrupted shots make us believable as a single one hop on me to the edge of the seat many more times on the theater. Roger Deakins was exceptional with his photography along with Lee Smith's brilliant hide way editing. That was in my mind that the film is formatted in one single shot but I just want to experience the truth inside and there is something in my mind that it might have the same pattern as Birdman and Rope. Exactly, it was right. Poetically we can say, the film flows like a river. It has that kinetics from the first frame to the end. Into the list of brilliant war epics, I must add 1917 and give a prominent role there."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"Unquestionably Sam Mendes' masterpiece. Film of unprecedented beauty that stands out every single moment of the journey, merging anxiety and curiosity, beauty and hope. Film that is worthy of the story of our nations we put behind us thanks to an exellent narrative by Mendes, narrative that is enhanced for every single frame by a surreal cinematography thanks to Roger Deakins, in which every single situation / emotion is clear and moving; as well as the overwhelming and anxious soundtrack that brings Thomas Newman's signature, music that verges on perfection, that accompany the scene, the frame, the dialogue. Minimalist for some reason, but rich of details while the camera goes behind our characters, nothing is left aside, literally nothing. Spectacular cast, especially in the complex where heavy names stand out, an exemplary cast to reproduce the story as it was, even the scene is stolen by George Mckay and Dean-Charles Chapman who offer tears and emotions never seen in a war movie. This opera goes to the fallen and not, now and forever. A perfectionist Mendes makes perfect this picture that goes far beyond expectations. Unquestionable masterpiece."
1917,25 January 2020,6/10,"I can see this going the way of Shawshank or Dark Knight, movies I was originally neutral towards but got ruined over time by the fanbase making them into the most overrated trash of all time. This movie, while good, is already starting to go the same way. I saw this movie about two weeks ago, and over the past week I keep having to remind myself ""oh yeah, I did see that movie"". The pacing works and the movie did feel shorter than it was, but I also spaced out frequently while watching it, and much of the scenery was repetitive, which I know given that the war was mainly trench warfare you're going to have a lot of that, it still felt like watching one of those old Hannah-Barbara cartoons where the characters run against the same recycled background that keeps looping every few seconds, trench, trench, no man's land, trench, field, city, trench. Also, know how in Big Bang Theory, one of the characters points out that in Raiders, Indie's presence is totally superfluous and the plot would've played out the same way even if he wasn't there? This movie suffers from the same exact problem: the plot and main character are totally superfluous. If they needed to get an urgent message across, the common practice was to simply fly a plane and drop the message down. There. Simple as that. There would've been zero reason to send two people on foot, unless maybe the unit didn't have any planes available, which seems a bit of a stretch. People keep going on about the trick photography where its edited to look like one continuous shot. Okay? Rope has done that. Birdman has done that. Most impressively, Russian Ark was literally one single hour and a half shot with no editing tricks. That's an achievement. There's nothing new to what this movie does. It's pretty standard American War fare (I know this movie is English, but Brit and Yank war movies are the same, they have the same sensibility, the same POV), no different than Private Ryan or Band of Brothers or Dunkirk or Hacksaw Ridge."
1917,7 August 2021,9/10,"My take on 1917 :It is a war movie but like no other, I mean in terms of the film's take on World War I (WW I). It doesn't show you the usual chaotic war sequence all the way, rather it takes you for a journey which will suck you in and soaks you thoroughly in the mood during those times.Mendes known for his big films Spectre, Skyfall doesn't fail to impress the audience in presenting a visually astounding story of two courageous soldiers embarking on a journey to deliver a message that could save 1600 fellow soldiers.What worked for me was the amalgamation of brilliant direction, screenplay, cinematography, lighting, the whole productions design, top notch sound mixing, background score and class performance by the two leads. It all kind of fell in perfect blend which set the tone of grimness on the viewers.The level of detailing in the movie was so immersive that we are teleported to the war trenches. There were scenes in the dark where the soldier is running for a hide out and the flashes of grenades illuminates him, watching this on big screen was sheer breath taking. The song ""Poor wayfaring stranger"" when sung by one of the soldier before their big day was moving.At the end, we come out of the move as proud as the soldier saving the battalion from the trap.Overall Mendes's 1917 is a pure cinematic brilliance and will be a strong contender for the Best Picture of 2019.PS: Watch it in biggest screen possible.-Review by Sivakumar Balachandran."
1917,13 March 2020,7/10,"917 is an interesting story, filmed in a bit overly acclaimed, but undeniably interesting technique. William is not just a soldier.He is above all a good and loyal man who finds himself in the hell of war, which can be a parable for life itself. He gets a task in pursuit of which he invests a lot of effort and he is ready to die for the task. He experiences a great deal of grief and meets many people along the way, who are not moved by his task. Their responses are cold, superficial, bearish, but he's not like that. He is an emotional, loyal, sacrificial man. This is a film that requires a psychological approach from the viewer and thus requires much too much, so it is difficult to identify with the main character even for a deeply empathetic person.The problem is that the film fails at an extremely important element .... The viewer simply does not in any way become William. We don't adequately identify with him. There are probably more reasons for this, I personally did not get to know this man enough in the movie. Too bad, since the story and the protagonist deserve to be understood. Maybe even that is the purpose of the movie. To leave you cold, cold, as others were to his task."
1917,12 March 2020,10/10,"I've been wanting to watch this movie for so long now and I'm so happy to report that it has exceeded my expectations. I knew that this movie was gonna be good because it got nominated for so many awards and I can see now why it received so much accolade. I know the one-shot thing is a big deal because it is. I mean, it's absolutely insane how they managed to do that! Mad props to the entire team. But the best things about this movie are the writing and cast. Whomever decided to cast George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deserves a freaking raise because these guys are amazing actors. Especially George. I won't spoil anything but my god, the sheer terror and desperation on his face was so believable. And the cinematography is beautiful too, the composition and colours, the symbolism. This movie is one of the best I've seen this year."
1917,2 September 2021,1/10,"The pretentious camera work with these pathetic continuous long shots is just all showboating garbage to 'win' awards. YAWN. It;s been done to death Sam. Theres nothing special about the cinematography. It;s not bad, but takes away any intimacy of any scene. Think of Platoon then look at this mess. No where near the calibre of Platoon. You are literally a fly on the wall thoughout the entire film. The main character Schofield was a total wimp, posh boy, and a moron to boot. His friend was just as useless. Glad he got shanked and died, he was a moron as well. So many stupid things they do that just makes you shake your head in disbeleif:1) Kicking over a bucket of hot coals and talking loudly while you have just arrived in a German trench. What a fabulous idea! A rat (lol) sets off a trip wire and both characters get blown back and not a scratch on them.2) Not paying attention while exiting the crumbling trench and chatting like they are going for a stroll in their local park. Not looking out for other trip wires or landmines or enemies. Never taking a moment to take cover and observe buildings before they approach. They just walk right up to everything in the open.3) Helping a downed German pilot rather than blowing his brains out or letting him burn to death. Instead they help him and fat boy manages to let the German pilot gut him with a knife. Serves you right. Then he dies. Good. Knew it was coming anyway. Theres gratitude for you from the German. Then posh boy finds some delicious fresh milk and bottles it, then magically out of nowhere another battalion teleport to his location without making a sound to give him a ride. How convenient!4) When he is dropped off, the German sniper/rifleman was literally 20 feet away and should/could have been shooting at them all, but waits until posh boy is alone and then lets off shots. Posh boy nails him pretty quickly with precision aim. The convoy would have heard that shot and gone back to help him. But not in this movie.5) Posh boy goes into the building where the sniper is and opens the door to the room the sniper is in, completely exposing himself and the sniper is still alive. They both take a shot at each other and it's CLEARLY implied posh boy takes a bullet to the chest/torso and flies backwards down the stairs knocking himself out. Yet he wakes up and hasn't been shot? I'm guessing his canteen bottle saved him? Great directing there.6) It;s at this point where you wonder WTF posh boy is doing as he exits the building at night with flares going up in the air and he just meanders along like a sitting duck along the main path way, instead of legging it to the sides amongst the ruins for much better cover. It it because he is concussed? He seems to be alert enough to know whats going on but makes pi$$ poor choices.7) I couldnt beleive it when he stands infront of a huge burning building, yet again exposed, and sees another soldier approaching. Instead of thinking oh $hit, it might be a German, he walks TOWARD the soldier like oh hey dude hows it going, and then the soldier shoots at him. It only then clicks that its a German and he starts running. Jesus wept.7) The German misses him and doesnt see him scramble into a hatch underground, and then meets a French girl with a baby, puts down his gun, sits down, and chills. The German soldier is obviously looking for him and is not far away, and there could be more, but yet again reality goes out the window for some reason. I won't even bother with a milk bit.8) He;s back on his feet and more Germans spot him and shoot at him, missing. Posh boy sees a German soldier drunk and puking up, then runs into a German his own age, pinning him up against a pillar and puts his hand over his mouth then lets go. The German predictably yells to his drunk buddy so posh boy strangles him. Seriously, you are alone surrounded by Germans and think you can barter with them to shut up? What did he think the German dude was going to do even if he kept his mouth shut? Where is posh boy's survival instict? He's too soft and should be as brutal and unforgiving as he can in his circumstance, but nooooooo.9) It's at this point I really was fed up with the dire writing. Posh boy leaves his gun, his ONLY gun on the floor, where as he had time to pick it up and EASILY bayonet the incapacitated German to death but instead shoves him over and legs it! Hahahaha. So he runs and runs while more Germans shoot at him and jumps off a ledge into rapids which didnt exist there in real life.10) You still with me? God bless ya. Well, posh boy is washed down the river til he reaches a load of dead floating corpses, climbs over them, crawls onto the embankment and has a good cry. He can't beleive he gave his munch to the French bird as hes starving. He then walks through a woodland area and hears singing (you couldnt make it up). And how lovely, the battalion he has fought so so hard to reach are all sitting there listening to the soothing voice of a soldier singing. Cringe.11) He runs above the trench dodging shells like Mr Invinceable to deliver a letter to Bend-a-dik Cumber-B!tch, who tells him to eff aaawf after receiving the letter and reading it, and calling off the attack. Posh boy meets his dead mates olde brother, then the film ends with him leaning up against a tree, just like at the beginning of the film, except fat boy is dead.The end. Utter guff and grossly over rated. Platoon kicks 1917's a$$."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"War is a horrible act, there is no escaping that. Films have depicted that for a number of years, many making sure they capture the true horror of war for all to see. With 1917, Sam Mendes delivers a war film like nothing I've ever seen before, throwing the audience right on the frontline with a truly immersive experience.Two young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.1917 is a feat of filmmaking within the war genre, filmed to look like one continuous take, and it may just be the best film from Sam Mendes yet. The long take can be quite gimmicky however, its use here aids the storytelling in such a way that you can't help but feel as if you're in the middle of the war yourself. You're there with the two young soldiers, whether it be cautiously crossing No Man's Land or running from enemy troops, up close and personal throughout, and it's just such a relentlessly thrilling film that left me breathless by the end.The camerawork in 1917 is utterly stunning, Roger Deakins proving once again just how much of a genius he really is. The closeness of it all lets us get to know just who these men are and what exactly is it they are fighting for, all while portraying just how suffocating war can be with some exhilarating yet anxiety inducing set-pieces. Accompany that with Thomas Newman's beautiful score and 1917 becomes an even more powerful beast, the soaring crescendo towards the end in particular hitting me with a wave of emotion.1917 may be technical marvel but it wouldn't be anything without the two lead performances, George MacKay in particular. Both he and Dean-Charles Chapman make this a story to really care about as they deliver performances of both bravery and fear, the latter making this quite a tough watch at times. Other than these two, 1917 is a who's who of major British talent making up the numbers, Mark Strong being the one I just know had to make an appearance.It's only January but I doubt many films will come close to topping 1917 in 2020, a true masterpiece that will no doubt be a future classic. I would certainly be happy with this walking away with Best Picture at the Academy Awards and for George MacKay to be getting a Best Actor nod for his great work here."
1917,8 April 2020,1/10,I started this movie by thinking another saving private Ryan and it turned out sh..t
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"I hate the word 'gimmick' as it relates to filmmaking. Gimmick is an unconstructive word, something that can be tossed off to cheapen actual visions. 1917 is no ""gimmick movie"". It's an experimental grand slam that takes a chance on a unique visual structure and successfully moves cinema into new directions. The conversation around Sam Mendes' World War One drama has inevitably revolved around its audacious, single-shot framework. That technical feat is worth discussing. But so is the film itself and the way Sam Mendes weaves both camera and story together into a brilliant tapestry of beauty in the most hellish war ever fought.The bones of 1917 are familiar to those who have seen their share of war movies. It's World War One and there is a mission that has to be carried out. The British Army are preparing for an all out charge against the Germans. Little do they know, they are running into a trap. With communications down, two young soldiers, played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are dispatched into enemy lines to deliver the message to stand down. This type of story is not new territory for war movies. Saving Private Ryan chronicled a very similar mission, and Dunkirk involved similar themes of the affecting nature of battle. In the hands of a less capable, less creative director, 1917 might not do enough to separate itself from those towering films. That's where 1917's visual style comes into play. The movie is designed to look like one, continuous tracking shot. A gamble to be sure, but one that pays off.Cinematographer Roger Deakin's camera is 1917's ace in the hand. It moves fluidly through each set piece, keeping the action clear, informing key moments, and only drawing attention to itself when it should, in the grand emotional climaxes that litter the trek. That said, there are certain things you can't do as well with the one-take approach. It's harder to get those iconic, stand out images when the camera is so often in the same position; following the protagonists from behind or back tracking in front of them. Mendes can't as easily put the camera in interesting positions or angles when the characters have to be in frame 99% of the time. But what that apparent disadvantage does, is make the few memorable images there are, such as a cherry blossom ""snowfall"" or a ruined town lit completely by flare light, more special because they seem to spring organically from the world. We don't have the expectation that we're going to see art, so when it's there, it stuns.The real advantage of the camera is in how it intensifies the pressure of the mission. Being so intimate with the characters makes the explosive beats shockingly effective. I jumped out of my seat on more than one occasion. Also, the movie takes place in real time, making the major point of tension, the countdown to the dawn attack, all the more impactful. Here, the passage of time isn't imagined through age old editing tricks, it's really there. From the first five minutes, we get a refreshing sense that this movie is going to provide feelings unlike any other war film. You're locked into the mission immediately. The clock starts ticking and the movie never lets you out of its grip until the very end.The reason this novel experimentation never wears thin is because underneath the visceral excitement it creates is a major emotional ride. Chapman and MacKay are a solid step above the average young British actor, exhibiting welcome restraint in moments that could slide into melodrama. Thomas Newman's rousing score does most of the heavy lifting in that department, but the balance never tips to schmaltz. That is due to an authenticity rivaling Saving Private Ryan, the best ever cinematic approximation of war. The ubiquitous little physical details in the trenches and on the battlegrounds seem to inspire the actors. No one player feels out of place. There is an overwhelming sensation that this is what The Great War was like. The relative attention to realism, combined with thunderous sound design and real time tension, make for incredible immersion.To discuss this movie based on its cinematography alone, ignores how stunning the rest of the movie is, and the way every element works together. Forget the ""gimmick"" talk. 1917 is simply a brilliant, harrowing war film. The most unforgettable image, MacKay's character sprinting through the battlefield, with mortars exploding around him and hundreds of soldiers charging forward into certain death, is momentous not because of what the camera is doing, but because we were there with him in every moment leading up to it, and we feel its significance in the story. See 1917 for its exhilaration, its horror, and its beauty. There's no other film quite like it.92/100"
1917,10 January 2020,,"1917 is flat out brilliant. It's one of the best war films of the 2010's and of all time. It's a great war film and feels slightly fresher due to how well executed it is.On a technical level, it is amazing. It's wonderfully directed and the choice to make it the film appear to be in one take is remarkable. There is a reason why Roger Deakins is one of the best cinematographers of all time of all time and this film once again proves it.On a story level, it may not be that complex or deep but it's non stop intense and that's just brilliant. Throughout it is just thrilling and engaging.Both the main leads are utterly fantastic especially George McKay. The supporting cast of people like Scott, Cumberbatch and Firth are good as well.Overall it's a great film and one hell of a experience. It's seriously terrific and although it might not be as good as Hacksaw Ridge it is still outstanding in everyway."
1917,30 May 2021,9/10,"1917 is visual storytelling at its best. Director Sam Mendes and DOP Roger Deakins delivered a film that actually makes you feel being in the trenches of WW1 yourself. The acting by the two newcomers in the leads is solid, as are some surprising cameos from well-known actors. The sets look amazing but this is really a tour de force of Deakins. The film contains of several extremely long takes. This gives the film a sense of rawness and urgency. The lighting of a hellish nightscene, the sudden horror of a collapsing cave or crashing plane, the final run of our hero...these are scenes that stay with you long after the credits roll. This is cinema at its best and therefore 1917 should be seen on the largest screen possible."
1917,21 March 2020,8/10,Oscar best photography reservation. Long shots do increase tension on the battlefield
1917,15 December 2019,7/10,"Saw this film at tiff's secret movie club which was also the film's north American premier. This is a well made war film with technical aspects being really stand out. It is a towering achievement for cinematography, the sound work is top notch, the depiction of front lines, trenches, the mud filled with rotten corpses was incredibly powerful and Sam Mendes did a masterful directing here.However I've had some issues that I think really hurt the film and leave a bad taste:1. There are a few scenes here that probably belong to James Bond flicks than a realistic world war film. I won't spoil anything but I wonder how Mr Mendes would have made this before Skyfall.2. Again there are some events that are highly dramatized and some of them feel just dumb/unrealistic. I don't know how much control did Mendes have on this production but I was really annoyed at certain times.Overall I think this is a worth-watching, expertly made war film that would've been a great one but it's still enjoyable."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,So many parts of the movie were extremely frustrating. So much time walking and talking but not really interesting dialogue about the characters or creating a storyline other than heading to give the note. I watched it but didn't enjoy it and would not watch it again. Im still waiting for an Academy Nominee to really stand out this year...they have all been about a 5 for me. Except Bombshell..that was awful it was a 1.
1917,28 March 2020,5/10,"The written story would, perhaps, have been interesting. But the film, for me, was farcical. As it travel through time, every 7-10 minutes or so, it became less and less realistic to me. Just glad it didn't win AA for Best Picture. So much pre-awards chatter that it could likely become the film most chosen. So many ""cool"" moments--war is not cool. So many coincidences. Listening to the ""bonus"" features is quite misleading. Sorry! It felt like a waste of two hours to me.
On the other hand, I very much enjoyed the productions of ""The Joker"", and after seeing 1917, ""Once Upon a Time...."" , certainly gained more appreciation from my perspective. Go ahead and see it and make your own opinions."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"First of all Happy New Year to you all. This is my first movie review of 2020. Sam Mendes directed one incredible film. The one Shot throughout the whole film kept me on edge. This movie had all kinds of emotions, it had intensity, gripping, action, and very well thought of. The characters made you feel like you are in the movie. Some scenes made you feel scared for them. Their element of surprises and danger. Especially when you have to hear what is going on the background. Personally I don't think this movie is boring. I was on edge of my seat for the characters. 1917 is awesome."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"I wanted to like ""1917,"" but it did very little for me. Among my issues with it:For the first hour, the camera work repeatedly gave me motion sickness. That has never before happened to me at a movie.The CGI is horrible.To call the characters one-dimensional is to be charitable. They're not even characters so much as game pieces.The suspense scenes did not fill me with suspense; the scenes depicting acts of humanity struck me as emotionally manipulative.If delivery of the message is so important, why send two inexperienced corporals on foot instead of dispatching a pilot to fly the message to the front?Who milked the cow? And how did her milk magically become drinkable between the udder and the bucket?Since Corporal Schofield spent so much time immersed in a river, how did the letter he was carrying stay dry enough to be legible to Colonel MacKenzie?And don't be fooled by Benedict Cumberatch's being second billed. He appears on screen for all of three minutes.""1917"" is not a bad movie. But with all the hype and advance praise (not to mention its two Golden Globes), I was expecting much better than this poorly written (though beautifully photographed) cliche fest.Sorry, Golden Globes, you got it wrong this year. Best Picture should have gone to THE IRISHMAN, and Best Director to Martin Scorsese. Here's hoping the Oscars won't repeat your mistakes."
1917,19 January 2020,,"Don't get me wrong, I love films that exhibit long continuous shots, like Birdman, or Touch of Evil or Hitchock's Rope. Even that Goodfellas tracking shot through the club is fascinating from a technical level.Unfortunately, 1917 - although ambitious on many levels is simply not much more than a VideoGame first person shooter run through.It's exhausting watching this effort to carry out a mission, but it fails to really give us substance.Sorry, kids. Only 5 out of 10."
1917,26 December 2020,8/10,"Possibly the best war movie and well deserving of all is praise and awards. The camerawork is the best I've seen in any movie ever, the one shot works so incredibly well and really makes you feel apart of the movie. The characters were pretty weak, the acting was good, but nothing was told about them. It's quite tense throughout as well but has a very very simple story, two men have to deliver a message to stop people from dying, but it works soooooo well. The challenge to deliver the message was challenging enough but was made even harder when his friend died, this is outstanding writing but does mean that there is a lack of dialogue for the rest of the movie may seem boring for some. 9/10"
1917,30 December 2020,9/10,"Make sure you have the undivided attention before going into this movie. It is intense, insane, with so many jawdropping moments. It absorbs you and your full emotional depths into living the experience of World War I by depicting it through two cinematographically-made-to-seem-like single uncut scenes.Everything is on point, regardless to some minor plotholes and goofs, this is one of the better ones at portraying and manifesting the horror of wars, the agony of soldiers, the suffering and the sacrifices. I can't say much without spoiling much.I am not even a British guy, nor a European guy, I do not belong to any of the sides of this war nor has my country ever partaken in one. But I got emotionally-invested, this is a gem and a must-watch. The only downside is that the non-rewatchability since the style of the movie doesn't really root for it. 9/10"
1917,27 April 2020,9/10,"A movie that proves that the best efforts are those that can take a unique story and build it around outstanding character development. A carefully crafted film with outstanding cinematography. It draws you in immediately and keeps one engrossed throughout the ordeal of two soldiers sent on a high risk mission to deliver a vital message.It never exceeds the bounds of good reason, and stays sharply focused throughout. The amazing achievement is magnified by the knowledge that it sought to tell the entire two-hour narrative in a single take.Only at the very end is something extremely personal and poignant revealed, as the lead statement in the end credits. This film is loosely based upon the personal experiences of Lance Corporal Alfred H. Mendes, the grandfather of the director Sam Mendes, who crafted this film.The film does not try to be a documentary, but instead uses a blank canvass to weave a compelling story of intense personal interest. The audience is heavily invested in the fate of these two soldiers.That the effort was a labor of love was obvious throughout the film. That it was a valentine sent by a grandson to his grandfather only becomes clear at the end, but by no means does it surprise anyone. That's how beautiful the story is, showing intense courage amid vast carnage. Somehow the film manages to weave love and horror together, without failing to show proper respect for each.In that measure, the film achieves perhaps a singular impact, worthy of all the awards it rightly earned."
1917,2 June 2021,9/10,It has a beautiful told story with amazing cinematography. The acting is on point. The one shot style was perfect for this movie. My mind was blown after watching this movie.
1917,10 November 2020,7/10,.....these were the recollections of Mendes maternal grandfather. Not sure how credible the encounter 2/3rds through with the child and female but all in all a good story.Captain Smith (Mark Strong) insightful advice to Corporal Schofield (George Mackay) was a laser sharp piece of advice.One question - why didn't General Erinmore (Colin Firth) order a plane to drop the orders to Colonel MacKenzie? That makes the story somewhat suspect especially the horrific odds of successfully completing the mission.
1917,29 April 2020,10/10,"""There is only one way this war ends. Last man standing.""1917 is a masterpiece in many diffrent ways.
Hell, it's a masterpiece in every way.
The cinematography is great.
The music is terrific.
It is so intense that I had to hold my breath many times and got goose bumps everywhere.
It is emoitional so i had to cry multiple times.
My favourite war movie ever made.
A perfect movie."
1917,28 January 2020,6/10,"While 1917 may have its attributes, it has a serious problem. Although based on a true story, it deviates so much from the story that the film is more fiction than fact. As a combat veteran of two wars and a military historian, I find the deviations ridiculous and misleading. If viewers believe that the film is realistic reenactment of a battle during WWI, they are badly mistaken.As the reviews stated, the story was about two soldiers who were ordered to send a message to a regimental commander whose Brigade was deep behind enemy lines and was about to lead his troops into an ambush that would have caused the loss of 1,600 men. The messengers were to tell the commander to call off the attack. One of the two messengers was the brother of an officer belonging to the endangered regiment.In fact, there was only one messenger and he was not a brother of any of the attackers. Furthermore, the actual orders given to his company commander were,""Should the enemy counter-attack, go forward to meet him with fixed bayonets."" Nothing about calling off an attack. The messenger's task was to locate three other companies and pass on the order. That necessitated him traveling through no-mans land which at most was a mile deep.As the film tells it, the Germans withdrew to set up a trap. In fact they withdrew to eliminate a large bulge in their lines. From Feb. 23 to April 5 of that year, the Germans were moving their troops to the Hindenburg Line. The Germans withdrew along a 27 mile front and caught the British completely by surprise. As a result, the British were very cautious in moving forward which negates the film storyline that the Brigade was isolated. In fact, the entire British line moved forward, not just one Brigade. The story of 1917 takes place on April 6 (which incidentally us the day the Americans entered the war.)The first noticeable flaw in the film is that the messengers are told to proceed southeast to find the Brigade. That would have sent them behind their own lines. Because the messengers had to travel westerly through their own trenches to reach the point that they jumped off into no-mans land, they had to be at a point at the easterly end of the bulge in the German lines. So they had to travel in a northerly direction. Also, they figured it would take them at least a day to get to the Brigade so the Brigade had to be located a considerable distance from the front lines. The day was cloudy and there was no sun or landmarks to guide the messengers and that was compounded when nightfall fell. However, in the true story, the messenger was in fact, much closer to the missing companies.Otherwise, the film realistically depicts the WWI battlefield conditions and it does the best job of depicting a man dying from a wound that I have seen in any film. But what keeps this film from being a best film is its failure to realistically depict the manuevers involved. It could have been told better."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"Sorry to repeat something said by other reviewers: I'm not a great fan of war movies, though some I do like.1917 was a breathtaking film. A lot can be said about the 'single shot' concept, but I would more say that the cinematography was a masterclass, the performances were remarkable by the entire cast and there was something so real and realistic about it all.It deserves the best picture oscar as much as it deserves a place in movie history. Might not be one to watch twice, but the grit and realism combined seamlessly with top grade production qualities to deliver a film that turns a fairly straightforward and believable plot into a magnetic piece of cinematic history."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"A film that takes risks, not only in the presentation but also in the story of it. A well-performed war drama which has a unique one-shot style.It's always nice to see a film as refreshing as this one. It reminded me of Birdman in the way it looked. Amazingly, they used this filmmaking style for a war film.The use of World War 1 as the stage is another breath of fresh air, I feel like we don't see that as often as we should.Roger Deakins is the star of the show here and only confirms, yet again, that he is Hollywood's most talented cinematographer. The film's shot and art direction is perfect and will be a shoo-in for a lot of awards, no doubt.Sam Mendes is a very talented director and this is one of the best war movies in recent memory. A breathtaking experience!I won't give this film a 10/10 because the characters aren't entirely compelling. They provide emotional weight but not an incredible amount of it. A small nitpick for sure, but enough to say that it is not ""perfect"" film."
1917,14 March 2020,8/10,"What a Amazing cinematography, Sam Mendes made it Great. I Love that. it was the first time I saw such Amazing cinematography for a big production like this with very vast sequences of battle.some times you need stay with dialogs to better understanding a movie but this one didn't need any special dialog to tell you what's going on. I admire this masterpiece of Sam Mendes it some how it could be the best picture of the year. and of curse I prefer this one over many other production of this year and certainly it's on the top 5 of the year."
1917,7 August 2020,4/10,"Amateurish script resulted in a boring movie that was at least 50% filler. This could have been a good, but never a great movie...not enough ""show me the meat"" for a feature film. It would have been helped by, and I can't believe I am writing this: commercials.Back to the failed Edsel parallel. Ford was so excited by the new technology put in the Edsel that they failed to pay enough attention to the resultant product. Like a boring computer programmer, the director of 1917 was obviously obsessed with the technology he was employing instead of the end user enjoyment. The Movie's grand promotion was putting lipstick on a pig. And besides being a disappointing result, like the Edsel, it was just a sad experience. Technocrats are boring as was the movie 1917. That is truly sad. It gets 4 stars since it was in color. Wearing my WWI Doughboy helmet while watching didn't help."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"The one shot trick really worked for me, I couldn't take my eyes of the characters and my attention and emotions were always with them, even though I did not know any of them very well. It's one of the most beautiful movies shot this year, the cinematography is breathtaking, the suspense is high and the tension heavy. It's dramatical and so engaging with the viewers. Should win pratically everything in the technical categories and even perhaps best movie of the year."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"Wow what soldiers have to deal with in times of war is unreal just to watch a film about the horrors they had to endure is almost unbearable to watch never mind have to actually go through , well played by the two main actors and all supporting cast a very good film ....... 8/10 .....!!!"

1917,27 January 2020,10/10,Go see this movie on the big screen. It's amazing. Absolutely breathtaking piece of art. I was holding my breath for two hours. Such great filmmaking.
1917,16 August 2020,7/10,"The movie has very beautiful camera filming (nice pictures and music). Special effects is also good. The storyline is simple. A team of two deliver message to frontline to call off an attack in order to save life. The movie pace is kind of slow, but filled with intense. It depicts the war is cruel like meat grinder and soldiers are missing home and loved ones."
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"The amount of work that goes into shooting this movie alone should convince people to watch it. Preferably in a cinema or a very large TV where it can be truly appreciated.All is filmed to appear as a single shot, always following the perspective of two British soldiers. The Oscar for Best Cinematography is guaranteed and I even dear to say that Best Director should be as well.The story is simple - two soldiers must deliver a message to a Batallion deep in enemy lines in order to prevent an offense which will result in certain death. As simple as the premise is, I was on the edge of my seat every step of the way. Always living the same emotions as Corporals Blake and Schofields.When a movie is stunning to watch and keeps me glued to the screen for two hours simultaneously... well, I can't ask for much more.A solid 9/10, and one of the best war movies I have ever seen"
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"It has too many questionable historical situations (see the list of goofs). Also, the ""single shot"" cinematography asks us to believe that everything happened in 2 hours, plus the time the soldier was unconscious."
1917,2 February 2020,8/10,"To talk about ""1917"" is necessary to distinguish between the technical department and the plot itself. Technically ""1917"" is awesome, from the direction and the cinematography to the score, everything is stunning. Sam Mendes was fantastic and the fictitious long-take was incredible and it provided all the tension of the movie: not knowing what is to come and following the protagonists in their journey makes you live the experience with them and share the same emotions. And in all of that there were some memorable scenes as far as the aesthetics that are a statement of the excellent work from the technical department. Also the cast gave great performances even if they had very few to work with. Indeed the plot was uninspired and the least original it can be, with a lot of situations seen a million times in other war movies and there wasn't nothing fresh. The tension as I said was provided by the long-take and the score, while the plot couldn't build some of it too. In theory there were high stakes but I couldn't perceived that and this is the major problem of the movie. At one point I came to the realisation that the whole plot is written only to serve the beautiful long-take and nothing more. And I also realised that this movie is a great display of style and technique that has no substance as far as everything else. And while I was coming out of the cinema I listened to other people talking as it's usual after watching a movie and everyone was praising the direction and how visually beautiful the movie was, but I didn't hear a single person talking about what happened there or the shock they had in that scene, or that unexpected twist or something like these. All they talked about was the technique. And the fact that the first impressions weren't about the emotions the movie conveyed but about how the movie was made, that is what I think is the biggest flaw of the movie.
In conclusion ""1917"" has an uninspired plot and it doesn't manage to provoke strong emotions, but it is very very stunning. It's no doubt worth watching because Sam Mendes and his crew did a fantastic job in order to make this movie looking so great. If only the story wasn't a pretext to shot the movie the way it was, ""1917"" would have probably reached the status of ""one of the greatest movie ever""."
1917,13 January 2020,,"War/combat movies are hit or miss for me. 1917 is a hit in my books. If you really dislike war/combat movies and/or the depiction of death makes you uncomfortable, then give it a miss. Otherwise, I'd take it in if I were you. See it on a big screen if at all possible."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"One must imagine Sam Mendes wanted to make this film after watching Dunkirk. Mendes not only makes a film similar to Dunkirk but also rectifies the flaws we saw in it. The cast would give you an impression that it's an ensemble but Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Mark Strong just appear in very short cameos.The characters in the film aren't very strong but still George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman give commendable performances. Unlike in Dunkirk we do not see the stories of multiple characters here, the entire film is from the POV of lance corporals Scofield and Blake. On a technical level this film is absolutely stunning, Thomas Newman, Roger Deakins and Lee Smith deserve as much applause as Sam Mendes. It is bound to win Oscars in atleast 4 or 5 of the technical categories.The main plus point of the film is the way the emotional content balances the action. Mendes gives huge scope for the soldiers to vent out their frustrations and loss. One could just wish we had more scenes of the French nurse with Scofield."
1917,20 January 2020,5/10,"I've never enjoyed WWI movies so take that into account when noting I only gave this movie 5 stars. I'm a huge WWII fan though. But my son saw it and said it was good. He and I have similar taste in movies so I thought I'd give it a go. In the end it was a meh for me.The sets were well done. I felt as if I got a good feeling what it might have been like being there. The acting was fine too.I think the single shot style did add something to the movie, but not enough to make it worth all of the extra effort and expense. There were a few times when I wished the camera would pan around but that would have broken the one-shot theme.The theater attendance was pretty light today (Martin Luther King Day), I'd guess about 40 in attendance in a theater that must seat 250."
1917,29 January 2020,6/10,"I sort of enjoyed this ... more or less. Interesting story, good production values and intense at times. I wasn't there but at no stage did I get the impression that this was an accurate representation of what it was like to be there. Maybe there was too much unspoiled green grass, where I had an expectation of seeing a battlefield or bomb craters. The contrast between fighting scenes to surreal peaceful country landscapes continually nagged at me as not to be relied upon. The overall impression I had, was having someone else's idea of humility packaged in such a way, to mask over what I sensed was a compromised movie. Compromised in the sense, that here is a story that might have been profound, were it not for lots of ideas that I suspect were half developed."
1917,16 March 2020,10/10,"Together with ""Birdman"" one of the most beautiful camera works I have ever seen. If you know something about the cinematographic technique, you cannot fail to reward this film. How they put together an excellent photograph and an amazing shooting almost without interruption, and in this flawless amazing way, so detailed, it's beyond my imagination.10/10"
1917,16 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is the latest Oscar bait war movie to come out, though this time set in World War 1. Most of these films like to be set in World War 2 or Vietnam, or even Iraq. The only other film in recent memory set in WWI is Wonder Woman, which barely counts as a war movie. I'm personally not the biggest fan of war movies. They can get boring, and many of them tend to feel the same. The last war movie I saw in theaters was Dunkirk, which everyone adored except me. I thought movie was a boring slog. There are some war films I really like though, such as Apocalypse Now and We Are Soldiers. The ones I enjoy the most tend to be ones like Wonder Woman and Overlord where the war is just the backdrop. It isn't the main story. Apocalypse Now could fall into that category as well.Is this movie good? Yes. As war movies go this one is definitely solid, if not above average. The performances were good. The cinematography is amazing. The score, coupled with the set pieces, give the film a very eerie and tension-filled atmosphere.The thing that stands out the most about this film is the way it's shot. This film is made to seem like it was filmed in one take, or at least two takes, even though that's not the case. I don't know how they did it, but they truly made it look like they shot the entire film all in one go. I don't think I've seen another movie shot like this. This sets 1917 apart not just from other war movies, but other films in general. Because of this it truly feels like you're taking this journey along with our lead characters, and it almost never gives you time to breathe.If you're looking for lots of action, which is typical for a film like this, you're not going to get much of it. While it has its action, this is much more of a thriller than an action piece. I find it funny that a movie like Dunkirk had much more action in it, yet I was more engaged by this movie than that one. This probably because you're with the characters much more in this film and you get to see them constantly struggle against overwhelming odds all alone. Dunkirk was much more focused on its massive action that the characters got lost in all of it.There's not much characterization here either. However, because we're with these characters for literally the entire film I was able connect with them and their plights much more. The performances by the lead actors helped as well. I felt the acting was pretty flat all around in Dunkirk.Overall, if you like war movies then this is definitely a must see. If you just want to see a good thriller then this is worth checking out as well."
1917,22 March 2020,8/10,"Admittedly, I have never seen such a poetic war movie. For example, although full-length shooting may break the connection of certain scenes, and I can't help but think of the way to shoot the shot, the director also played a lot of new tricks in this way. In terms of scene scheduling, this is perfect and amazing. Switching different perspectives can move the viewer's sight. In a way, it completes the space Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk wants to explore. The plot is not particularly outstanding, so the technology must be excellent. I still like this movie."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"Great movie, great direction, great story, great acting. This is a MUST see.Two men are giving a task to deliver a message to another camp 8 miles away, this message will stop 1600 men from death if delivered promptly, and the enemy are are trying to hinder their every move.Thrilling, engaging and brilliant."
1917,28 June 2020,9/10,"Pros:This film is phenomenal in its direction and narrative.Performances of George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman are fantastic and the emotion they bring as soldiers in their situations is very realOf course, the one-shot take is stunning to see on screen, it completely immerses you into the story and for me, It worked a treatThe last 20 minutes of this... WowRoger Deakins's CinematographyCons:I would've liked to have seen a bit more action in some parts of the filmOverall, '1917' was a remarkable tale told personally by director Sam Mendes and I was emotionally invested all the way through, while also connecting with our two main leads. Cinematography, Score and set design all came together to provide me with one of the best war films in recent timeQuote - 'I hoped today would be a good day, Hope is a dangerous thing' - Colonel MackenzieScore - 9.5/10"
1917,2 May 2020,10/10,"This film ... is a masterpiece. Every year I see films in the cinema, but none was like this film, with realistic action scenes, beautiful cinematography and a spectacular soundtrack. The film industry needs to make more films of this kind."
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,"For better or worse, 1917 is a film in which seemingly all the creative energy was focused on its technical elements. The extremely long takes are impressive, the fluid shot compositions arresting, the sets beautifully realized and convincing. But once that initial sense of awe inevitably wanes, it becomes naggingly clear that the film has nothing to offer beyond its visual splendor. It plays like a theme park ride, stringing together setpieces that offer superficial thrills but ultimately fail to engage on any emotional or intellectual level. It appears to be going for a hyperrealistic, you-are-there experience but never comes close to capturing any real sense of chaos or pandemonium. Everything feels too tightly-controlled and manicured to translate as the real thing, especially with the conspicuous direction constantly drawing attention to itself. It doesn't help either that the film seems to have an inflated sense of self-importance, as if all the theatrics are in service to some grand commentary on humanity, friendship, life, and death. In reality, it's a popcorn film that fancies itself a fine work of art, ultimately lacking in any real thematic or emotional depth. That isn't necessarily a bad thing; if you're primarily looking for a visual spectacle you're likely to be satisfied. If that's the case, I'd even recommend it. I fully applaud the effort and skill it took to make, though wish I could say it was in service to something more than killing two hours nursing your calorie-dense snack of choice.Solid 2.5/5"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Wow. This movie was so damn good. I have no words. The cinematography, acting, all were great. And the action scenes are all in 1 take. That is a big achievement right there. The actors were great in this movie everyone felt like a real soilder in 1917. Which can I say I am glad they did a take in World War 1. So many movies always do the same damn World War 2 story all the time. So I am glad they did World War 1. The film was everything what I wanted it to be. I went in with no hopes but when I started this movie it was from a 0 to the end with a 100. That's a great thing to do in cinema. It was also unpredictable and this movie did do just that. Brilliant movie of 2019. 10/10"
1917,18 January 2021,5/10,"If the movie is real time with an 'uncut' shot how did he walk 9 miles in 2 hours? Kinda dumb and light on action.
It was like watching someone else play a video game."
1917,20 May 2020,6/10,Visually it was extremely good but it was just that the story was a bit boring .
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"When I write this review, this movie had already 1.323 reviews, wow this is amazing response! But I hope my review is still useful for Sam Mendes loyal watchers. This movie had one long shot with one story only, but this is masterpiece. I would like directly say that Sam Mendes created story of a short journey of a English soldier, who represents the history of WW I itself. On the movie, you can see the trenches during World War I, the problem of being soldier, the ambiance of war, and the most important thing is that how from the beginning of the scene, the audiences can follow the journey of a soldier like they experience it by themselves. That soldier was supposed to give important message to other regiment, but on the journey there are many circumstances and events that he cannot deny. As an audience, I still remember all the scenes in one united story, and this is Sam Mendes expertise to make all scenes united in one single shot camera. Thank you also for camera crews that make this idea happen and perhaps become trend of scene language in the next 10 years in movie industry, especially war movies. This movie had lightened my day and although it receives some negative critics, I just do care about what is improvement for war movies. Sam Mendes had casting several figures that all have experiences in war movies and I think this wipes all the doubters. I mean, there are Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Ralph Fiennes. Thank you for this movie, Sam Mendes!"
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendez did it! I was taken into the reality of WWI in an amazing way. The growth of the 2 main characters from start to finish was awesome. The movie industry seems to have gotten away from reality with its love of CGI. In this movie we are taken back to reality. How wonderful. I was pulled into the trenches with all the death, respect, and fear of men."
1917,21 January 2020,6/10,"I see all the ""OMG OMG 10 10"" reviews and I feel most of those people got caught up in the ""one shot"" aspect of the film, and not the film itself.Yes, the long cuts (because YES there are cuts...when the camera passes by a background object and when it cuts to black) are very awesome ...at first, but by the time the soldier gets a ride with another group of soldiers, all I kept thinking is ""ok...we could use with a few time jumps here..."" and by the time he ends up in the water, I was squirming with a desire for the fast forward button. It's like watching a REALLY awesome 3-D movie...you love it, but sometimes you just wish more was done for the script and less for the stunning shots. I hesitate to use the word ""tiresome"" but yes...So my issue ...the options for modern films on WWI are very far and few between that aren't low low budget ...(lost battalion is AMAZING and a better film imo) and we don't really seem to get any glimpses of the horror that that war truly was (disease/pain/the water/cold/gas etc etc) and I had hoped this film would highlight some of that...but instead they went with a visual treat, which is fine...just not what I'd hoped for. They TRY to show you trench life, and life in the mud, but you never at any time really feel ""what a nightmare"" like Full Metal Jacket/Saving Pvt Ryan, etc etc. which again is fine. It's still a well made film, with many visually awesome shots, and some very slow moments as well. The problem is I don't believe any of these slow moments were intended to feel slow and boring.As long as you keep one thing in mind you'll be alright. This is NOT an action movie, I'd dare say it's not even a ""war"" movie...it's about a movie set during a war is all. This film should've been marketed as a drama imo. And no I don't believe you have to show heads blown off or buckets of blood to make a good war film. ""Final Journey"" is a GREAT example of a WWI film with maybe 2% of this films budget that shows the hell of that war without gore.Still a good film, but I don't believe this one will one day take its place among the all time Great War films.."
1917,30 January 2020,7/10,"OK loved the movie, but couldn't forget the incongruities.0) Couldn't stop thinking 'Saving Private Ryan'
1) Why does an aeroplane not drop a message to the front-line troops?
2) The soldiers don't behave/speak like they would have in 1917
3) Why are just two soldiers sent?
4) I Don't believe a pilot would stab his rescuer? ( I don't know if we were meant to understand that he had gone mad with pain)
5) That German sniper was a terrible shot.
6) Surreal bits in the open countryside. British troops wandering around
7) That raging riverThe best way to understand this movie is that it was based on the memories of Sam Mendes grandfather. So you have a set of different scenarios that his grandfather experienced during his war patched together into a 24 hour sequence."
1917,8 May 2021,8/10,Can't believe I haven't seen this before. One of the best cinematographies and productions I have ever seen! An exciting edge-of-your-seat experience this movie was.
1917,10 March 2020,5/10,"You need to watch Gallipoli (1981) first to appreciate how incredibly BETTER the Mel Gibson flick was than this one. Under the guise of a drama Sam Mendes has actually concocted a lecture. I understand why film-buffs have marked this one up - because of the complete lack of other good movies. I did not appreciate all the ""wokemon"" stuff. For me it marred what could have been a regular, good war movie."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I know that everybody who has seen and reviewed this movie has mentioned this one aspect of the movie but it's the best thing in this movie and that's the way it was filmed and edited to look like a long one-shot. While I was watching this movie, I was playing a fun game in my head of find where they matched the scene up and some parts it was obvious where they ended one scene and matched it to start the next but there were a lot of ones I couldn't figure out where they stopped filming and matched it up for a new scene. This just goes to show how great the editors on this movie were and when it comes time for the Oscars, they get a nomination for best editing. Despite this movie being a war movie there isn't a whole lot of action happening, sure there are a couple of scenes of action but it's not reliant on action, this movie is not boring in the slightest. There is so much to look at and admire about this movie like the cinematography and set design. Just like with editing I hope this movie gets a nomination for best cinematography because there were some outstanding shots that encompass the lighting. I wish I could go further into this but sadly I can't and you just need to see the movie for yourself to understand why. The set design helped bring the audience members into the movie with how accurate the sets looked. When they were in a trench you felt like you were in there with them and when they were out in the open you felt scared for them. In other words, you felt like a fly in the air following them on this journey. In the end, 1917 is just a spectacular war movie and is perfect for people who both love and or hate war movies, this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of them. I have a good feeling this movie will become a classic war film."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"As usual Sam mendes brings us a great work, so smart, it is a good too much gret, well narrated and very good performances
I guess Sam Mendes will be again the best director and again his movie will be the winner.just wonderful"
1917,21 March 2020,8/10,"The whole film is relaxed, with both the scorched earth of the ruined walls, the deafening gunfire and the quiet and beautiful European fertile soil. I have to say that Roger Dickins, the ""Uncrowned King"" of the Hollywood photographers, gave this film a doomsday aesthetic, which turned the ugly battlefield of the battlefield into a beauty we have never seen before. Of course, the real top war movies are essentially ""anti-war"" themes. This ""1917"" through the rancidity of two soldiers along the way, French women and newborn babies lingering in the basement, and the courage to march in the hellish ruins tell everyone: war is too terrible, peace is too important ."
1917,25 March 2020,9/10,"I rarely watch war movies because I can't stand the monotony of color, the shelling, and the helmet blindness. This movie is totally different. It was not the fire that attracted me, but the spring fields, the cherry blossoms by the water, the bright light on the scorched earth, and the soldiers' songs in the woods. I venture to predict that it may be one of the most oscar-worthy movies ever made, at least by far."
1917,4 December 2020,7/10,The movie is not so good or not so bad. You can watch it once
1917,3 January 2020,5/10,This movie is by no means better then saving private Ryan it is slow there are 2 action scenes and and there are less then 20 shots fired from the 2 men who are delivering a message most of it is walking with heavy breathing there are a few points that did get me a little bit interested but for me I was hoping for more this is not for everyone and and I will not be watching this again
1917,18 December 2020,9/10,"This was something else! I have never seen a movie quite like this. The camera angles were so effective at flicking from a front shot to a back shot back and forward the whole movie, with next to no close ups or long shots. Because of this it brought such a tension and focus. It allows you to clearly see what is happening around the soldiers, especially in the trench scenes. Whilst also providing such an intense sense of direction, mission, drive, and courage. I love the cameos from Benedict and Colin. They cast the main characters so well in that they really did their best to tell the story. They are very easy to like and connect with right from the start. I am sure that this is an authentic WW1 story, you don't even have to be in the war to know that this seems like it does justice to the story."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"I'm going to say this right off the top, this is my 4th favorite war film of all time behind Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, and Black Hawk Down. With that aside, this film is spectacularly beautiful and pristine all in thanks to one man. Mr. Roger Deakins. I've followed this man's career from his early days with the Coen brothers, to his amazing camera work in How to Train Your Dragon, to now this. And to me by far it is his best work. It kept me glued to the film as I loved watching the colors and camera work by Deakins, and he made this film sing like a opera choir. However, Deakins isn't the only major contributor, Sam Mendes makes what seems to be a rather personal story to him considering his paternal grandfather told him this story. This is his best work, even better than American Beauty. It's not filled with mindless explosions, or unnecessary violence and blood just for the sake of it. Every scene, every shot was seemingly carefully crafted with masterful direction. There were some twists I didn't see coming, with a sprinkle of some suspense and tragedy, while displaying the true brutalities of war. This film has been nominated for many of the major awards including the Oscars, Golden Globes, and others, and rightfully so. Like I said earlier if you are looking for a bloody, violent, and explosions then this is not for you. For anyone else, please check this out, it's worth the money."
1917,21 January 2020,1/10,"Ponderous and trite. Poorly directed, totally predictable. Hard to understand the buzz. I forced myself to watch the entire movie as I always do when I review. Recommend you skip this one. Totally panders to the PC anti-war Hollywood lefties ... don't get drawn in."
1917,25 January 2020,5/10,"Watch it for the amazing camera work, great sets etc. Apart from that it's that that great and quite boring. Full Metal Jacket + One Shot...Now that's what I want to see. Some of the continuity doesn't work e.g After they leave the trenches they go straight then take a hard left. When a plane crashes next thing we know there are a platoon of soldiers to the right of them that seem to have been there all the time.The acting of the two leads leaves a lot to be desired too.Oscar Hype & Bait. San Mendes is overrated ever since the DULL best bond ever Spectre.Long shots are impressive but not a good movie they make."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"Filming a movie in one continuous take sounds good in theory, but as 1917 shows, doesn't work in practice. It shows that this style should be used sparingly, and in just some scenes, like the amazing waterfall scene, which looks fantastic.Overall the one take makes for a very slow journey which at times is just boring.Another problem is that once again we have the curse of written and directed by the same person. Noooo!
This means there is no one to tell the writer where they have gone wrong. And it also looked like there were no military advisors either.At times the visuals were amazing, but there were numerous script errors.Why would two soldiers who have been bombed and machine gunned race to pull a German pilot from his crashed plane? Why would the pilot (who has been badly burnt) stab his rescuer?How could a soldier with hob nail boots walk across a metal hand rail on a bridge - he would have slipped off.When fighting a sniper, if you keep popping up from the same spot you would be quickly shot - unlike the hero.When you are being shot at you hear the impact of the bullet (it doesn't explode like in this move) and at the same time the crack of the bullet, and then the sound of the gun being fired - depending on how far away the shooter is. Unlike depicted here.Please stop showing soldiers before the 80's walking around like SWAT with their rifles at the shoulder - they didn't do this! They normally carried their rifles at the port.And why didn't our hero swing and hit the German soldier with the butt of his rifle instead of grabbing him and telling him to be quiet? The butt swing was part of basic bayonet fighting drill back then.Why wasn't there continuous gunfire in the background? Especially at the end when at the aid station where there was total silence.Why were the men sprinting once over the top? They weren't running a 50 metre race, but having to walk maybe 100 metres through mud and shell holes and fight at the other end. historical footage shows the troops walking.And to finish, there was too much energy at the aid station at the end. These would have been exhausted troops. Just carrying a body on a stretcher for 50 metres is hard work enough. Yet extras are running everywhere.1917 should have been so much better. Such a shame."
1917,8 May 2020,7/10,"1917 is visually and auditorily a masterpiece. Won 3 oscars 7 baftas, deservedly so. It's the movie that will makes you want a new sound system and a giant tv .BUTY the story is super simple, and it's highly, painfully historically inaccurate for the sake of pleasing 2020 audiences, sinning to the point of screaming 'revisionism'.Think indiana jones meets saving private ryan. I thought the end product was average because of these issues, but I think most people will rave about it because how technically impressive it is."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"This is one of the best war movies ever made. You follow along 2 soldiers on a mission to save 1600 fellow soldiers.
The musical score, the camera, the amazing actors, the sets all felt raw and powerfull to me.
In the end is a story of two young man following orders like other young men on the opposite side because someone decided so, they are all just doing there best to stay alive and have their mates backs. You follow their journey."
1917,4 April 2020,9/10,"A true gem of a war film, perhaps one of the best. 1917 deserves to be immortalized for its jaw-dropping cinematography, but the story and characters are near flawless too, the amount of coordination is unbelievable. The journey taken by Will is one that is imbued with artistic value, yet it is entirely grizzly and gruesome, showing the true colours of war. The film skims over so many aspects of life, courage, and one's growth and fear around death, and in the face of it, how one is able to overcome by a sense of purpose. Will is by no means an embodiment of heroism, as he didn't even seem like the protagonist in the beginning, he didn't even want any of it, we don't even know if he would be commemorated for what he did, but seemingly realistic stories like this exemplifies what it means to be a human being. As for the Oscar debate, the film does not lose out to Parasite in any way, though I would still prefer the eventual winner as it felt more relevant and ringing to me personally.Wish we would never have to witness another tragedy like the WWs."
1917,30 August 2021,9/10,"1917 should've won Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards. How's that as opening? But seriously, not to take away from Parasite's deserved success, and politics aside, 1917 in my opinion was the best movie of the group, this coming from someone who is a) not into war movies and b) feels that war movies automatically gets a nomination even if there were more deserving movies instead (I'm talking to you, Hacksaw Ridge and American Sniper.) It is just unfortunate that 1917 and Parasite were released in the same year, otherwise they would've easily won the award if they were nominated in different editions of the Oscars.1917 is based on director Sir Sam Mendes's grandfather's experience as a messenger during World War I and because of this you can feel his investment in the storytelling. There's a 11 minute featurette available online where you can see the massive undertaking that went into making the movie. In it they talk about the 6-month rehearsal needed in order to get everything perfectly timed because they wanted to give the impression that everything was done in just one take. The concept of doing the movie in one shot and real-time allows for an immersive experience, letting you to go through the story along with the protagonists. The choreography of the shots were impressive as not one second is wasted because there are details to keep you glued in while waiting to see the actors again. Cinematography was impressive as well for a movie that kept going forward and no location was repeated. Cinematographer Sir Roger Deakins has won 20 awards for this movie alone, including the Oscars.You will root for George MacKay, you will get annoyed at Dean-Charles Chapman's naivete (as we also did when he was in Game of Thrones.) Cameos from Colin Firth, Andrew Scott (you just knew he was going to play that kind of officer) Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch (again, you just knew he was going to play that kind of officer) did not distract as they all seamlessly made their way in the movie."
1917,13 September 2020,8/10,"This film has been rightly lauded from one side of the world to the other. The cinematography is outstanding, the films matter is delicately and respectfully handled, the lesser known actors are shining lights among the much bigger stars who pop up occasionally.This is a story of two soldiers trying to reach the front lines during World War I in an attempt to stop a doomed advance into enemy fire and save as many men as they can.It has all the horror and shocks you'd expect if you knew but a small amount about trench warfare, it is visually stunning and the story is gripping as well as occasionally being soul-destroying.I personally felt the film was probably about 20 minutes too long, one of many sequences could've been sacrificed and the film wouldn't have lost anything but would've gained a bit of pace.Dean Charlies-Chapman and especially George MacKay are superb and it would be a travesty of their careers didn't flourish because of this. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong to name a few powerhouses pop up for just enough time to move the story along and not take away from what is happening.A 1917/20 from me, I feel disrespectful giving it a grade due to its subject matter. It is a fascinating film, superbly made but like any film it has its flaws. But you'd be missing out on a cinematic experience not to see it. Well done Mr Mendes!"
1917,24 July 2020,10/10,"The cinematic production is a masterpiece by itself. It goes to such a point that it takes the story into a different level even though the movie premise is pretty simple. It shows some events in such a way that otherwise would not even be important. I loved the style and I hope there will be more movies alike. There is a lot of CGIs but it's so well done that you don't notice. By the way, if you are afraid of rats be aware."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,Saw it last night and loved it. It was so natural and beautiful. Felt like I was there on the field. Beautiful direction by Sam Mendes.
1917,29 January 2020,8/10,"Prior to watching this film, I had heard some people complain, saying the cinematography was impressive, but there was no story. I beg to differ. The script of 1917 is great. It basically has the structure of a road movie, in which the hero has to get from point A to point B, while encountering obstacles that increase in complexity at each stop. Everyone of this obstacles is greatly crafted, with great tension and conflict. The journey never feels easy.
The film has some surprising, very emotional moments. The struggle of the hero is real, tangible. It's a fascinating protagonist because nothing can stop him, but we can still see the pain, the suffering and even the fear.
The cinematography is, yes, no doubt, very impressive. But so is the script. I really liked this film and I'd recommend it to everyone who loves a good movie."
1917,9 August 2020,7/10,I expected more battle scenea and action. It was a slight disappointment.
1917,17 April 2021,9/10,"Even though the speech is clear it helps to have subtitles on. Sometimes it is too quiet or muted to make out without subtitles.It starts in a hurry. The only observation is that everything is too clean. Even the dirt is clean. It may be a high-resolution display, but it is distracting. Even though it is in a hurry it seems slow and has gawd awful instrumental noise in the background.We travel throw several anticipated obstacles. There is a tad of potty mouth. During our travels, we get bonding and challenges. On we go on a hero's journey.You will eventually get wrapped up in the story and action. Even if no two wars are alike it is easy to relate and even do a little kibitzing.Will the mission be completed?Was it worth the effort?Thank you for traveling with me through this movie.You may need to watch twice to pick up the nuances.I watched this movie because it won the Oscars. While I do not agree with many Oscars, I had to agree this time. Other than the instrumental noise in the background, it would be exceptional. Where there is a ""Will"" there is away."
1917,20 July 2020,8/10,"I had no idea what to expect, and wrongly assumed this was a movie of large-scale battles and troop movements. Instead this is a personal journey through the battlefields of WWI, with a very impressive -and athletic- actor in the lead.By now so much has been said of the cinematogrpahy that I won't go there. I will reluctantly point out what in my opinion could be considered flaws: when the corporal meets up with the first truckoad of troops, and informs them of his mission, wouldn't they immediately cease their current mission and ferry him to his destination, considering the importance of success? I also have to say I found the scene with the girl and the baby to be a bit cliche'. Would civilians really still be lingering in a completely bombed-out city?These are very minor quibbles. '1917' is a beautiful film to watch. It's a testament to human endurance and power and in my opinion a fitting tribute and one of the greatest war movies ever made."
1917,18 April 2021,8/10,"A film that was showered with awards has surprisingly little to offer in terms of acting. The performances of all the actors are good, but don't knock my socks off. I also believe the story only to a limited extent. What is really outstanding, however, is the camera and music. For that, I give it my many points."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"The previews made 1917 look exciting, and I was told it was a good movie. All expectations were surpassed! This brilliant work of art was immersive, realistic, and emotional. I spent the movie in suspense, on edge, watching carefully as my instincts told me to be prepared to help the characters survive at any moment. I found myself crying more than once, uncertain if out of anguish or relief. Every single thing was ON POINT. Bravo!!!"
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"SYNOPSIS:
Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given a mission to deliver a message through enemy territory to stop advances on the German's as they are walking into a trap masked as a retreat. If the message is not received in time, 1,600 men including Corporal Blake's brother will be killed.REVIEW SUMMARY:
There is so much in this film to love. Obviously, although it's been done before, the form of directing where it appears to be one continuous shot throughout, really adds to the intensity of the film. The sound editing is done really well and the score is so good except for one scene where it feels like a very misplaced fantasy-like score. There are so many memorable moments in this film, but for me the film gets a bit slow for me. It's understandable as you can't have constant action from beginning to end for a film like this, but it doesn't disregard the fact that it does cause the film to get slightly boring for me at moments. If I was one that could get past those slow moments, this would probably be my favorite film of the year and so if you can really get on board with both the intense and not-so intense moments, you will love this film. The ending really topped off for me as well. A really good film and I definitely recommend this film especially in theaters and if you can, Dolby. 7.9/10.--------------------------------------BREAKDOWN-------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
Sam Mendes truly did something special with this film. Going with the one-shot illusion added SO much to this film. You feel part of the battle with the characters. This directing style for a war film really immerses you with the battle. The intense moment become that much more intense and it makes it feel that much more real. There's one moment where it fades to black and then continues right where it left off and continues the rest of the way as one continuous shot and it amazing to feel like your watching a live stream of two soldier's struggle with fear and courage while trying to get a very important message across enemy territory. Bravo on the direction here and I definitely feel Sam Mendes deserves Best Director at the Oscars.WRITING:
Normally, I'd go into detail with the writing, however, I feel if I were to get too deep with the writing that I'd be potentially spoiling the movie so I'll leave something short. I think the decisions made with the writing were delivered very good. As I've mentioned, there are intense moments and they are written very well. You don't know when things are coming and that leads to impressive payoff. There was a point during the movie where I thought of a story idea, based off a film like this, but then they literally did what I was thinking so... scratch that I guess.ACTING:
The acting in this is phenomenal. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were incredible in this. There was one moment where MacKay was supposed to be crying and it was an impactful moment, however, it wasn't the best as far as a cry goes. Damn, I must sound like a nit-picky b****, but hey it's important in my opinion. When someone cries I want to feel it and I could empathize and understand why he broke down, but I just put myself in that position and it wasn't really because I felt his pain specifically. Anyway, he was still very good and I really enjoyed Dean-Charles Chapman performance. I wouldn't put either performances up for Best Actor this year and that's really just a testament to how stacked that pool is this year. So many amazing performances including these, but I really feel this film shined through the direction. There was an incredible moment that did hit me in the feels at the end of the film with one of the actors and although it was very short, I loved it. I can't really expand on that here."
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,"Considered one of the best films of 2019 and a serious Oscar contender, 1917 tells the story of two British soldiers in World War One who have to save 1,600 of their fellow soldiers by informing their commander of a German trap being laid for them. The stakes are raised by the fact that one of those 1,600 is the brother of one of the two messengers. 1917 is intense, tragic, and a pure adrenaline rush.The thing that has garnered the most attention with this movie is the fact that it gives the illusion of being done in two takes and it looks like it is happening in real time. The result of this is perfect immersion. When you see from this camera's angle, it feels like you're really there and that you're going to deliver the message with them. It raises the tension greatly, in a movie that is tense by the nature of its premise. The cinematography, editing (how did it not get this Oscar nom?), design of sets and props, and sound are perfect. From a technical standpoint, it is quite possibly the best film of 2019.Throughout the film, we see various aspects of the reality of WWI, and all of it seems very plausible in its presentation. We see life in the trenches at the beginning, a relatively calm place all things considered. We see the deathly hell of No Man's Land, complete with a plethora of partially decomposed corpses, humans and animals. We see what civilians had to go through in the scenes in Ecoust. We see a battle, but not exactly the heat of it. And it all ends calmly. All of these factors combine to make it seem very real. When you watch this movie, you feel like you are part of it. Director Sam Mendes has said that the inspiration for this movie was a story told by his grandfather about his experience in World War I. That being said, you can imagine this being an old man's story of war, how he and a dear friend went on a mission together, and it adds a layer of authenticity to it. 1917 is exhilarating, heart-wrenching, engaging. It is one of the best films of the decade and a worthy contender for Best Picture."
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"1917 accomplished something great. To film a movie in one whole take is very hard, especially a movie like this. So to be able to present the film as if it was one take was great. It made the film very immersive and you went through the film with the characters. The movie was just way too slow in my opinion. Most of the movie is just the 2 main guys walking through different obstacles. The best thing about the movie was the whole one shot aspect. End battle was quite intense though, and the end of the movie was very emotional. There was also good acting on display and a good plot. Movie was just very slow."
1917,30 June 2020,9/10,"I feel that the little dislike for this film comes from people who are too used to the over-stimulation of modern super-hero type films, where characters vomit emotion onto the screen and the story tells you what to feel rather than letting you take it in.The film transports you through time to the fields of France. The characters all feel believable and ordinary, not heroes, just people doing their best to survive and fulfil their mission. Knowing how important it is yet still showing us clearly the human cost of war. Every moment seems like failure is just around the corner, with a sense that safety is only an illusion.The film doesn't pull any punches, it mixes a heavy air of futility with a very bittersweet taste of hope. The cinematography complements this perfectly, seeming like a single continuous cut that makes you feel the weariness of the characters. I could talk about this film for hours, but enough of me, just go see it already"
1917,3 June 2021,8/10,"The film is brilliant in its technical achievements primarily in the ""continuous shot"" approach (which is not actually one continuous shot but made to look like one). The acting is superb. The effects are, well, effective. The sets are authentic. The score is appropriately haunting. The situation engages the viewer and keeps them on the edge of their seat through the whole show.Still... if felt like something was missing that really should be there.It took a few viewings to pick up on the fact that there is virtually NO reference to religion or a higher-power except for maybe the occasional blasphemous swear. Most people may not see this as an issue but as the saying goes, ""There are no atheists in foxholes.""Having served in the army infantry myself, I've seen how difficult and potentially life-threatening situations cause men to seek (and find) a higher power to provide comfort, reason, courage, motivation and assurance when suddenly they are faced with the fact that they might die or at least be severely wounded... much the same way many criminals ""find God"" when put behind bars, but in the case of war, much more rapidly and acutely.There were no chaplains to be found. There were no occasional shots of single or groups of men knelt in prayer or praying over their fallen friends. Even before the climactic attack on the Germans, the British group of soldiers about to attack sits solemnly in a wood line listening to a single soldier sing a traditional sad song but one that has no mention of God or religion... only a vague ""I'm going home"" refrain which alludes to an afterlife but it may as well be Valhalla. There was no chaplain or even another regular soldier leading the group in prayer which would have certainly been the norm for this particular group of soldiers facing what might well be their doom. Not even as wounded and dying soldiers are stacked up back in the rear is there any chaplain giving last rights.I just found the complete absence of religion in such desperate situations to be inappropriate, unrealistic and suspicious especially back in a time where religion was much more a part of people's lives than it is today. ""There are no atheists in foxholes"" but you wouldn't know it from this film."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"Best movie in years. Thoughtful, well acted, and incredibly well filmed. Should win an Oscar."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"People call this film ""The Birdman of WWI"" and to be fair that is a justified assessment. This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME!
Positives
+ Amazing cinematography
+ Great acting
+ Gripping moments and action
+ The amazing props and set design are realistically done
+ The music elevates the scene very well and great sound design
+ A simple but investing storyNegatives
There is a fair amount of obvious cuts which isn't major but can take you away from the one shot scenarioThere is a scene halfway through the movie where they use a cut. While necessary it does technically not make the film a one shot looking film.Honestly my negatives are just nitpicks. This movie is amazing and it is definitely worth watching right now"
1917,29 February 2020,9/10,"People call this film ""The Birdman of WWI"" and to be fair that is a justified assessment. This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME! think one of the most impressive thing apart from the one looking shot is the AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. This shouldn't be no surprising since it is the legend himself Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 Cinematographer). Every scene feels like a painting and it is absolutely stunning. There is a scene at night where the lighting was done in such a creative way that heighten the tension of the scene. On that note there must also be praise for the score by Thomas Newman who somehow manages to make a score that somehow manages toe elevate every scene and help tell the story. There is also some amazing sound design that manages to make the War actually scary with moments that give horror movie jump scares a run for its money. Additionally, the props and set design should also get praise for creating such large,realistic but elaborate sets to accommodate for a more natural one shot scene. Everything in this film just feels like a technical achievement. We haven't even touched on the acting or story yet but just for the way this was filmed is already engaging enough. Nevertheless, the two main actors George MacKay as Lance Corporal William ""Will"" Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapma as Lance Corporal Thomas ""Tom"" Blake manages to do a phenomenal job in showing the horror of war and giving authentic,believable characters. The story, while relatively simple, is engaging enough to keep you invested in the objective of the main characters. They must send a message to allies stop them running into a trap. It's simple but works well for the aim of one shot as now it makes the audience a part of the journey.There isn't much negative to this movie but I guess if I have to be quite nitpicky it is the fact that halfway through the movie there is a obvious cut. So this movie is actually really a two shot film. The cut was necessary to make the situation more desperate and allow for a unique change in scenery even though it was a bit of a jarring cut. Another sort of nitpick is that we don't really get much info on the main characters. We get their names and we know what their mission is but their backstory is just given in tidbits. It goes in a Dunkirk route in which we care about these characters because of the situation they are in rather than the fact that we are invested in the characters. It can be argued that the tidbits more than gives you enough info about the characters but it's really up to the audience in the end. Personally, I don't find it too much of a fault but can see how others could consider it so.Honestly my negatives are just nitpicks. This movie is amazing and it is definitely worth watching right now."
1917,27 April 2020,6/10,"I just finished watching this and while it's not the worst war movie ever made it's not the best either.
The novel thing about this movie is the non-stop linear action. It's a style that's rarely been done before and in this movie they make it work. Most of the movie is suspense, muck, mud, mire and fear and this movie does a good job of portraying the squalor of WW1 trench life.For all that though there's surprisingly little action. The long lulls in between action do get almost dull and when the action happens the payoff isn't enough for putting up with the rest of it.The movie rates high for telling a story seldom told in the 21st century, that of the first world war - a war almost forgotten and practically eclipsed by the second. Other than that though, I can think of the far superior remake of ""All quiet on the western front"" starring Richard Thomas from 1979 that tells the story much better than this, really minimalist war film."
1917,11 March 2020,8/10,"It starts off strong, at least a 9/10 is the beginning, but once a important character becomes left in the wind, it becomes a little bit stale, but I guess the movie needs it to redefine what a war movie means. I just feel there isn't that much to tell the only thing pushing it forward is this guy, who had something terrible happen to him and his friend, a letter, and the camera movements. if the camera movements were just same old Traditional shots we have gotten before, then this movie would have been less than a 6/10 below average war movie, but the camera work REALLY hold this movie up. Films like birdman reminds me of this, however birdman had MUCH better captivating story to be told, the one shot technique didn't hold the film, it was just there for dramatic effect, the film itself is a pulp. This film seems to be WAY too reliable on this technique, and that's ok, because the film wins for this benefit. However if it had better narrative with a better approach it definitely would have remained a 9/10, it just looses its touch, honestly it's barely even a 8/10 but I'll give it the leverage for that camera work, plus IMDb doesn't allow 7.7 7.8 type of scores."
1917,31 January 2020,5/10,"As WW2 movies go, this is pretty poor. The story ain't that exciting, it's no Fury or even a Dirty Dozen.
Fancy camera work doesn't save the fact that it's pretty much a non-event."
1917,20 January 2020,6/10,"Why the huge hype? clever use of camera etc,but just rather dull. To many contrived moments, just to fit.
It was all rather slow and forgettable. I think the scenes in Wonderwoman add more power and show the state of war."
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"I saw 1917 in a theater. I have not seen a movie in a theater in a while and I felt a bit of sticker shock at both the ticket price, and the price of popcorn. Furthermore, about halfway through the film I realized I had to go to the restroom and I found no good way to pause the movie. Anyway, about the movie. ""1917"" reminded me of the movie Dunkirk in that there was plenty of action and very little character development. I would have opted for some more character development in both films.Martin Scorsese has said that a lot of today's movies remind him of video games. Scorsese was referring mainly to superhero movies but to some degree ""1917"" might be included in that, a battlefield video game with potentially dangerous structures everywhere.I've said the negative things, now a few positives. The acting was good. Everything seemed realistic in that it felt as though I too was walking down through one of those WWI frontline trenches. And there was a lot of time and effort spent on the sets. They were detailed and realistic.I gave ""1917"" 8 Stars. With just a little more character development, and the subsequent additional empathy for the characters, ""1917"" could have been a 10. On the other hand, maybe they made exactly the movie they were going for."

1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"1917 was brought to us by Sam Mendes and tells the story of two British soldiers during World War I who are sent off on a mission to stop an attack by the Germans on another base.War movies seeemed to have had a significant impact on cinema over the last few years with movies like Hacksaw RIdge and Dunkirk. 1917 continues this trend by giving us a unique, breathtaking and riveting experience. As a matter of fact, I consider this to be a masterpiece. The techniques used to tell this story work brilliantly to deliver intensity, excitement, discomfort and a sense of atmosphere.If you've heard of this movie already, odds are that you've heard that it's shot with the illusion that it's entirely one-shot. This fact turns out to be entirely true. There are no montages, no random cuts or anything like that, save for one cut at around the halfway mark. I think that what makes it work so well is that this technique makes the journey that these 2 soldiers go through feel like it's being done in real time. It helped the movie feel more engaging and interesting as it showcases everything that the soldiers go through in order to accomplish their goal.As a war film, it is rather brutal in many instances. There are many scenes and aspects that point to this being true such as the fact that there are dead bodies everywhere, there's a plane that looks like it's about to crash, and that's just from the trailers. I also really appreciate how the dialogue is very minimal. It's trying to be a story that relies mostly on its visuals, and considering its visual style, I think it really works.It mostly comes to the film's visual style working so well to tell this story about these brave soldiers hoping to stop an attack from the Germans. All I can really tell you guys is to go see this movie if you want a very real look on war! This movie is a masterpiece in my eyes.10/10"

1917,11 February 2020,9/10,I found 1917 a lot more emotive than Dunkirk and yet the films are remarkably similar. This is is compliment of the highest order.This is a thinkers film.
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"I was confident this was going to be brilliant, and well... It was!Sam Mendes does it again with that famous. continuous shot make you feel you're really part of the story as it's unfolding.Cinematography is also very on point!Compelling, brilliant action, intense .. gripping, heart felt .. A lot to be said for our young war hero's from WW1 that we take modern day for granted.Go see!"
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"I would like to start by saying...so sick of people comparing the new films with past films that they love. Stop, please. Take it as it should be, new films. If you don't like it it's alright but stop comparing.Sam Mendes did a masterful work with this simple but very emotional story. As I was watching the intensity of emotions started to fill me with incredible sorrow, sadness that I couldn't stop crying. I have seen so many movies in my life and I have cried in so many. But in 1917 film created in me an incredible uncontrollable moment of sorrow. I wanted to cry out loud. I believe, this is what is beautiful in this movie. Sam Mendes created a short story profoundly emotional. Masterful Direction, breathtaking cinematography, beautiful musical score, great acting, just love it! This movie does not need character development as many people keep saying. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.I'm just feeling wow with this year's masterful movies. My top eight:
1917
Little Women
The Irishman
Ford Vs Ferrari
Rocketman
A Hidden life
Uncut Gems
Richard Jewell
These are Amazing films!!!"
1917,5 January 2020,7/10,"It's beautifully made and has just enough action to keep tensions high and tug at the heartstrings, intimately depicting the human cost of war. I got emotional a few times.I do caution that as a War movie, it's more of a drama than an action film. Sure there's action and suspense, and some thrills, but this isn't Saving Private Ryan or Dunkirk from a visceral standpoint. It's smaller in both scale and scope.1917 follows a couple of soldiers as they journey to the front line carrying information which could save over a thousand of their fellows soldiers' lives... if they get there in time.It's in the aforementioned scale and scope where 1917 falls short of being great. The main plot of the movie suffered for not being big enough or feeling important enough. There's no storming of the beaches at Normandy. No rousing Winston Churchill speech at the end. The film doesn't connect the events it depicts into their greater significance in the war. Again, it felt small scale and narrow in scope.But to reiterate, I very much liked it. It's a lovely film filled with tension and emotion, think Kubrick's Paths of Glory without the 10/10 ending. Great work by all involved: Director Sam Mendes, Composer Thomas Newman, the whole cast and crew.One of the years best films, probably at the bottom of my top ten."
1917,3 April 2020,7/10,"This level of long lens can only be the product of this era. I think he has gone beyond the traditional so-called lens movement and scheduling techniques, because it is impossible to achieve this long lens from that perspective. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have the feeling that after the only shot in that movie is cut off, the whole plot becomes surreal. The sun like flares, the virgin like girls in the basement, the river full of corpses, the homesickness song the soldiers heard before going to battle, and the gallop in front of the trench. All this is so dreamy that I doubt whether the protagonist has actually died in the cutting Black shot."
1917,7 January 2020,7/10,"The Stream: The storyline is completely unimportant.The Big Screen: Tremendous filming, scenery and intense moments.The Final Bill: Travel down the intense path less traveled in 1917.Let's get to the nitty gritty of this World War I spectacle.Let's get the plot out of the way, as it is the most forgettable part of the movie. 1917 features two young British privates during the First World War. Of course, the ""powers that be"" give the most expendable pawns with the most to lose the ""impossible mission"". The privates must deliver a message deep in enemy territory that is necessary to save the lives of 1,600 men. And yes, of course, one of the privates has a brother among that 1,600 that must be saved from walking straight into a deadly German trap. Now that the first 5 minutes of the movie are out of the way, we can get to the brilliance.To me one of the most awesome feats of this movie is the single shot filming. Now, we all know it is impossible to shoot a nearly two hour movie in one shot flawlessly, but truly the editing and camerawork is amazing. The single shot view enhances the feel of anxiety and urgency. Throughout the movie, I felt as if I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. One thing I can be certain of is that this movie will definitely receive consideration during award season, especially for the cinematography by Roger Deakins.The filming was great in the execution but also in the setting/scenery. While most of the movie is flat and barren due to the war-torn wasteland, yet the actors take us on the path less traveled. Seriously, through the ups and downs of bunkers, craters, farmlands, waterways, etc. the film moves us. Speaking of moving us, Chapman and MacKay provide a few moving moments, lame ones as well. Both do a very good job conveying the emotional rollercoaster that 1917 and war in general provides to our brave soldiers in the field. The viewer truly follows the ebbs and flows of the privates from beginning to end. We see you King Tommen.Long story short, 1917 is an intense, watch your every step, war epic that will garner Oscar buzz from its incredible camera work and set management. The storyline is the most basic it can get but that's not why you're going to this movie in the first place. Get a bucket of popcorn and chow down while you race (pensively) to the end."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"The Battle of the Somme is long gone in the stark April sunshine of 1917, as Sam Mendes directs a desperate dash through No Man's Land, with the historic still images of the Western Front vividly brought to life. Colin Firth's General Erinmore has an urgent message to send to the Devonshire regiment further up the front line. Do Not Attack, he has seen aerial footage that shows they are walking into a trap. But the German have cut the telegraph wires, and the only way to get through to Écoust-Saint-Mein is on foot.The orders are given to the boyish Dean-Charles Chapman's Lance Corporal Blake, and he picks George MacKay's Lance Corporal Schofield to accompany him. The Germans have retreated out of their trenches, and the path will be clear, but the two young soldiers are given hand grenades in their pack. Just in case! In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam's chances of reaching Mordor were slim. 1600 men's lives depend on Blake and Schofield's game of life to get the message through. But like our Hobbits, their chances are equally slim, and to add urgency to the journey, one of the soldiers due to go over the top is Blake's older brother. They have until dawn to stop the attack. And will have to cross No Man's Land in daylight.As they force their way through the trench to the front line, the camera follows at their shoulders, Andrew Scott's Lieutenant thinks the journey it's madness. Fighting for every inch of the land and then to suddenly have the Germans pull back. But he 'blesses' the two soldiers with his whiskey, riffing on the 'Hot Priest', and tells them to send a flare up if they make it. Otherwise they'll try and pull them back when night falls!Cutting the way through the hostile barbed wire, cinematographer Roger Deakins sweeps the camera across the stinking mud. But the landscape is silent as Blake and Schofield creep their way across. While the words of the WWI poets ring distantly in our ears. What tolling bells for those who die as cattle. Wilfred Owen's lament, past the bloated soldiers submerged in mud, past the horses unable to outrun the guns, past the ghosts of once trees. As clouds of flies fill the air and scurrying rats feast on the dead.The action plays as a single shot of the day, immersing the viewers in the real time carnage of the story. The pock marked battlefield is the star, with Production Design by Dennis Gassner, as Blake and Schofield face the eerie horrors, and eventually tumble into the German trenches. These were well made for the men to dig in, but now empty save for a lovers photograph. But the Germans have not made their retreat easy, with leaps of faith in the pitch black booby trapped potential tomb. And a later aerial dogfight brings the fight to the ground, with an act of mercy that leads to catastrophic results. Sam Mendes isn't afraid to show the PTSD among the men, with George Mackay particularly good at looking shellshocked. I've followed his career since Sunshine On Leith, in that joyous musical he was happy! But here his face is perfect for misery.But the message must get through, with the camaraderie along the way of those brave young men and boys going off to fight who knows where. Mark Strong almost unrecognisable, but full of support and help as his men are also headed towards the Devonshires, but must divert when a blown up bridge bars their vehicles route. A sniper taking shots halts the rhythm of the film, throwing us into darkness, until we stagger round for the final push. Écoust-Saint-Mein is within reach just downstream, but in a nightmare town Germans are blowing up the remains in their retreat. The camera following any way they can as we run to the river, bullets whizzing past while red flares half light the ruined town. And with dawn breaking the tension is relentless. In exhausted relief we hear the sound of silence and a lone singer. Jos Slovick and his soulful Wayfaring Stranger.But it really is a final sprint to deliver the message, with Deakins incredible filming again and shells exploding over men just to our left, and the force knocking us down in those last moments of urgency to stop the whistles blowing.Among the terrific ensemble cast were cameos including Daniel Mays, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch. No one stealing the limelight though, just getting on with the job in those precious hours, and hoping to live another day. Watching the film felt like a lifetime in the blink of an eye. All those lives that didn't grow old, and those that grew old far too early, but came home. Very poignant with a tight crew that deserve all the awards coming their way."
1917,12 November 2021,9/10,"It is quite surprising to learn that if you actually look at the numbers, there are not many films made about WW1 and certainly not the trenches, anymore. It is long enough ago now that all living grandparents and great grandparents who had experience of it, even if only as a child or through their parents, are no longer with us. So, unlike the 2nd World War which still more firmly feels part of the cultural and political fabric, WW1 is now a true 'historical' event. So when 1917 was released I was actually looking forward to it as I thought the time was right for another really good film from the trenches. And this certainly did not disappoint, in fact it was impressive on all accounts. The technical proficiency is absolutely amazing - it is largely single take which means that you live and breathe the few hours of one soldiers life with him without being able to take a break or switch perspective for a moment, just like the soldier. The pace also marches along rapidly, backed by an incredible score by James Newton Howard. The final 20 minutes are some of the greatest in cinema history. I truly felt like I lived and experienced the trenches like no other film, fiction or documentary, has allowed me before. It was very emotionally affecting and makes one grateful and proud of all the sacrifices made for our freedoms, regardless of one's political and philosophical stances on war."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"Real movie magic. Amazing - timing, scenery, character movement and everything. It was like watching an actual story that happened in 1917."
1917,1 May 2020,10/10,"This movie was shot to make you feel like you're accompanying the main characters. No wonder it got the Oscar for best cinematography.
Great acting, great action, great story. Not your average war movie with just killings. You feel for the characters and relate to them. Need I say more? Oh, did I mention that this is a masterpiece?"
1917,24 January 2020,8/10,"Mendes' directorial style shines in this fairly ""paint by the Spielberg numbers"" lean yet big film. It's quite literally a one at right line approach in filmmaking and storyline.The score, pacing, and the nearly impeccable camera work drive this nearly non stop sequential film about a young pair of soldiers sent into enemy fronts to deliver a message to abort a major military move that the Germans have actually planned on.If you like the pacing of Dunkirk, enjoy the cinematic camera lens of Malicks Thin Red Line and the simplistic premise of Spielbergs take, Saving Private Ryan, you'll find a lot here on all fronts.War is violent, so theres the expected war time violence but nothing too exploitive.Best Picture? I lean towards Parasite, as the premise of the script is fairly predictable as it is...not even sure spoilers are a thing in this film---but direction has to considered for Mendes for the scale alone and the ""in the bunker"" camera work. Sound and editing are spot  on, which makes for a very enjoyable war film.8/10"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"I am probably not qualified enough to write a review about this classic. Especially considering almost how all the making videos surfacing on the internet have already described the brilliance of the movie.Most of the war movies happen to be critic favourites and also go on to win awards. 1917 has been topping many charts along the same line. But what makes 1917 stand out is not just it's script and making but it's attention to detail which is a treat if you are a movie observer. As most of you already know the movie is shot in the same sequence as the script. The movie's journey through its lead characters makes the audience also experience the same with the one shot technique. Great acting from the young actors, special appearances, epic background music and the special camerawork add to this wonderful cinematic experience. Despite being a war drama, the movie can cater to almost all age groups.1917 is a cinematic experience like never before and puts 3D movies to shame with its unique filmmaking."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Following a pair of young soldiers Blake and Schofield, attempting to carry out the impossibly tall order to deliver in person a message across no man's land, through trenches reportedly abandoned by the Germans, to save 1600 Allied soldiers from obliteration by falling into the trap of attacking enemy forces believed to be weak, but in fact reinforced by the withdrawal. Blake has a strong incentive to succeed, because his brother is a Lieutenant among the 1600. Schofield has the misfortune to be chosen by Blake, because he happens to be dozing alongside when he is summoned.The film has made the news with what is described as a ""single camera shot"" approach. This cannot really be the case for a two hour film covering a period of something nearer twelve hours. In fact, long shots have been skilfully joined to create a sense of continuity. The intended effect is to make one feel immersed in the experience: when Blake and Schofield force their way towards a crossing point through no man's land, pushing through a flow of men going the opposite way, the trenches feel like a dizzying maze. Similarly, the muddy struggle through a wilderness of water-filled bomb craters, the putrid carcases of horses and twisted human corpses feels done in ""real time"" giving the audience a virtual experience of this as close to ""shellshock"" as one can suffer at the cinema.Each of the scenes are portraying a different aspect of war: the aftermath of the downing of an enemy plane, the experience of being stuck in a lorry convoy which ought to be faster than going on foot but isn't, crossing a broken bridge under sniper fire, fleeing pursuers through a devastated city lit by fires like Armageddon and so on. Those who love films of dangerous action will enjoy this.Even when the horror is offset by something of beauty there is a sting in the tail: cherry blossom surviving on felled trees or floating on the river beside murdered villagers; a young woman in hiding caring for an orphaned baby whose name she does not know; a soldier singing a haunting spiritual for men many of whom will die later in the war, if not immediately should the message fail to reach the commander in time.The film captures a little the horrors of war and how it made many involved weary and wishing for it all to end."
1917,5 September 2020,7/10,"Incredible cinematography and atmosphere. The movie kicks off straight away, with introducing the characters and the story. The cinematography is captivating and so is the acting, but the characters and especially their relationship is disappointingly flat. The attempted emotional scenes were not very successful, but the conclusion really could have been if the characters were further developed. The conclusion is also quite hasty, especially compared to the drawn out and disorienting section in the later half of the movie."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Everything about 1917 was spectacular. The quite breathtaking photography, the wonderful acting, the list is endless. This was a rivetting masterpice that held my attention for its entirety. Incredibly powerful and extremely moving."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"The first ten minutes or so is fantastic, the one shot thing works and suits that part of the film. But for the rest of the film all it does is get in the way. It prevents you from getting into the film and you can almost see the actors and extras have been waiting for the camera to come to them so they can do their bit. The story is flimsy and empty. Some of the sets, especially the bombed out buildings at night, are so obviously sets this even more takes you out of the film. Aside from the opening, I was aware every minute that I was watching a movie. The acting is fine though under the circumstances, the action sequences are limp and unbelievable as are many of the events that happen along the way - these mostly feel like fillers to pad the film out and many are very heavy handed visual bits that simply do not come off.
It isn't a bad film by any means, but it isnt the masterpiece it is being made out to be and there are many better war films out there that do not sacrifice so much substance for style. Even the music in many places is inappropiate and intrusive. By all means go see it, but remember you don't have to think it is the bees knees just because the critics say it is."
1917,19 January 2020,,"Everyone has said it all. Technically this is incredible.But... I don't really go to movies to be blown away by their technical prowess.It matters, of course, and I fully appreciate what was done here with the ""one take"" aspect of how it was filmed. It contributes to the environment the audience is living in. Someone else wrote it as ""immersive"" and that is as good a word as any.But I guess what I go to moves for in part are characters and story. And in this respect maybe the film falters a little. I don't really feel like I ever emotionally connect with the main character. It could very well be that the way he acted his role is intentional. It's like he's only 80% there, and the remaining 20% he is hiding or protecting. Regardless, I just don't really feel like I ever know him or (to be honest) like him all that much. He is to be sure a hero and does amazing things. But... I'm just left kind of cold by him.Anyway, the one character I did totally connect with is played by Andrew Scott. Yes! Andrew Scott! Our friend Moriarty from ""Sherlock"" who plays a relatively minor character named Lieutenant Leslie in this film. He's maybe on for 5 minutes. I would love a movie about him. He's fascinating and where the main character is only (and at best) 80% there, Lieutenant Leslie is 150% there. His presence is that enormous.This is not to detract from our main character. The actor who played him is in nearly every scene and I can only imagine the physical and mental challenges he went through to make this film.The music is good but at times became overwhelming. I don't need the score to help me know that we're in an emotional scene. I am mindful that I may be in a minority here. Most of the time the music was not intrusive, but at times it was.I wanted to mention there are some scenes that visually disturbed me greatly. War is awful and WWI and the trenches was just... awful. I did not get the feeling that there was gratuitous violence, but to be honest I wish I could unsee some of what I saw.Still, I'm glad I saw it. I recommend it."
1917,25 May 2020,3/10,"The one continuous shot and effects are great, but the story is nothing more than a shameless pandering to glossy feel-good entertainment.There's a scene involving a French maid all by herself with baby (not hers) and a fireplace. Our awkward hero stumbles in and they have a nice moment where she patches him up, as you'd expect. But... he can't stay, he has a mission. He must leave the French woman behind and run out into certain death. But certain death won't come, because this is a cheesy movie.He will navigate around bullets and bombs and waterfalls and more bullets, emerging in a forest where he finds the group he's been looking for sitting watching a man sing, like school children. As he approaches, they don't look or flinch even when this guy creeps up behind them. They're in middle of war zone, but everyone is seated listening to the singing. Ridiculous.The shameless ""Saving Private Ryan"" rip-off plot element is disappointing too, it's the same thing, different movie.I had heard good things about this movie, but once again am let down by the mainstream appetite for implausible popcorn rubbish.The only reason to see this movie is for the continuous shot and effects. If that doesn't interest you, then avoid."
1917,17 January 2020,2/10,"If you want good cinematography in one shot watch Birdman or Charlie's Work (Always Sunny). I haven't even watched the entire movie yet, but I already don't care for it. I don't like war movies, but Dunkirk and Fury are proper war movies for people not into war. I'm not gonna say much more before i watch it all cause i might be wrong..."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"I don't like writing reviews that would give a spoiler so I hope you can kind of follow along.I waited months for this movie to come out, it didn't come out when I thought it would release, and now that I finally saw it, it wasn't as wild as I anticipated.Think, following Frodo and Sam from the Shire to Mount Doom, but only them. There were quiet, intense parts and loud in your face parts, but in the end it's a journey of love, courage, friendship, and the never quit attitude.Overall, I give ""1917"" a 6/10. The whole continual shot was cool and fun at times because it's from their perspective, but at times the continual shot got slightly annoying because it felt too much like a virtual tour. The story is well written, well acted, and emotionally driven, but not it's fullest extent. ""1917"" is worth seeing once, but not necessarily in theatres IMHO."
1917,18 February 2020,3/10,There was hardly any action in this movie. Nothing even happened during the first 30 minutes...just 2 idiots walking around. How the hell did this win 3 oscars??? Unbelievable...
1917,25 March 2020,8/10,I hope today is a good day.Hope is a dangerous thing.That is my favorite line.
1917,7 May 2020,8/10,"The story itself is simple: in the spring of 1917, on the battlefields of world war I in France. Two soldiers were chosen to pass on important information that would save the lives of 1,600 British soldiers, including the brother of one of them. The problem was that the task seemed impossible: the enemy front, the trenches, the scorched earth... There were only two of them, and less than 24 hours."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"It's movies like this that make me appreciate the creative minds in cinema!On a saturated topic, Sam Mendes creates an experience, that for two hours takes to an immersive ""single shot"" adrenaline pumped journey of two soldiers during one of the harshest periods of modern historyInspired by the stories told by his grandfather, Mendes proves that great movies transcend genres and topics.Deserving of all the award buzz, no doubt!!"
1917,20 April 2020,8/10,"Because of its unique way it was filmed of one giant long take (well, a few obvious cuts big scenes), you either are going to get really bored or you are going to love how it feels non-stop and engaging. I can see it getting an Oscar for sure. At least for cinematography. I am surprised I liked it as much as I did since I always find WW1 movies kind of boring since its always about trench warfare. But the story was well written and actually made drew you into the movie."
1917,26 October 2020,10/10,"If you like war films, this is for you. Historical films? Also for you. Drama? Yes. Action? Yeah, and you see where this is going."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"I watched this in theaters yesterday as my birthday present. It is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Great cinematography, looks as if (almost) the whole movie was shot in one take and focus on the main characters on their journey/mission. And wonderful directing. Sam Mendes did fantastic. I know his great granddaddy (lance corporal Alfred mendes) would be so proud.Besides my other favorite movies, this one's a rare gem. Its original, unpredictable, outside of the box, full of risks and one of a kind. Love it!!!.Give this movie 10/10.Two soldiers trying to reach a battalion to stop where they are, before charging into a deathtrap. And have until tomorrow morning to deliver the message... No pressure!!!"
1917,24 May 2020,9/10,"The cinematography in the movie is extremely effective. You actually feel like you are on this eventful journey with the two soldiers, whose mission is to take a life or death message to the frontline trenches.
Very well acted allround with also Firth and Cumberbatch doing their notable scenes.
There is no time wasted here. Each scene has a purpose which makes it engaging from the very start until the end.
The scenery is barren but scattered with the horrors of war.
Its essential viewing for war or thriller fans, although not action packed. It's not that type of movie, its showing the horror of war through the eyes of very young men.
It's an Oscar winning movie and so it should be, its excellent film making."
1917,17 February 2020,5/10,I get it. Praise and awards for single shot etc etc. As a war film many have gone before way superior. The acting is satisfactory but by no means demanding or outstanding. The storyline is inferior to Private Ryan and generally tame. The special effects whilst real and not computer generated are sufficient but again not noteworthy. I would love to give film a higher score but simply can't. Had it not been for the single take etc etc I doubt this film would have created any attention. Art for Arts sake. Judy on the other hand well deserves its place in this year's awards.
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"This movie is suspenseful. Impending doom looms from scene to scene. The realistic setting is enthralling, as is the pacing. My only complaint is the storytelling. It relies too heavily on beats and themes we've already seen in War movies."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"No doubt, this is actually how you all supposed to experience war movie that I think Hollywood needs to set this as a standard of the highest order on how to film a story about two or more nations sending their youngsters in an unknown treacherous land to have them kill each other until the gods and goddesses of death leave no one behind to their eternal realm of nothingness. The weak and vulnerable side of humanity in the face of their uncertain fate despite being promised of everlasting but meaningless glory and fame that somehow, in a frightening way could relate to us to the point that we, instead of 'watching' it, we actually 'experience' the war itself by our own point of view. We were there, with Blake and Sco, as the ventured no man's land, the german booby trap, the filthy trenches, the abandoned ruined city, to reach another field of battle where every single of those brave but ignorant 1600 young soldiers are going to be executed by the enemy in the most brutal way possible in an armed conflict.'1917' is basically 'Saving Private Ryan' remade with a sequence of long shots that the cinematographer intelligently put smooth transitions in between that we hardly realize that in some parts they actually change shots, giving us the illusion of one long shot for the full 1 hour 40 minutes from the beginning until the end credits (props to Roger Deakins). I certainly don't have any idea how Sam Mendes pulled this all of, how he made Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mckay endured such a long scripted act that gave us the impression of a real two young trained brave soldiers in the field of battle, this is definitely their best performance so far, not to mention about the beautiful shots of the terrains, how they prepared the set and the other actors to play on their own roles in the story at the precise moment to appear on the camera or interact with one of the main characters, this is definitely a magic at play here. One the two only movies I give a perfect score on IMDB (the other being 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'), a kind of movie that I need at least once in a year in the middle of the dull and mediocre money-making Hollywood products these days. Best of 2020 so far (It was released really late in my country, so yeah, 2020)."
1917,9 May 2020,9/10,"The film is not boring, do not look at those who say time loss.
It's a good movie for me. A movie shot with the single-angle method, so it puts you directly into the movie as a third person. You feel like one of the actors in the movie. Don't expect an action like Saving Private Ryan. But it really has a breathtaking immersion. You don't understand when you started the movie and when you finished the movie. I watched it without getting bored."

Well, what to say? It is phenomenal! One of my best all time cinema experiances. The ""one take"" is really enaging an captures the feeling of the film perfectly. It is a horrific and emotional movie with great acting. Watch it! I was left in awe when the end credits began.The bad:
I will have to think about it, nothing at all at the moment."
1917,29 March 2020,9/10,"This movie is absolutely stunning. It looks like it's one single shot, a la Hitchcock's Rope. McKay is a phenomenal actor. He's not upstaged by any of his scenes with bigger names, like Strong, Firth, or Cumberbatch. I've heard others complain about the story, which I don't get. The story is not 100% true. But it honors the memory of those who fought and died in that horrible war. It lays bare the reality of trench warfare without gratuitous violence. It's not a cookie cutter happy ending. But it's satisfying. And really, the cinematography is just mesmerizingly beautiful."
1917,8 December 2020,8/10,"Cinematography outstanding. Spoilers. Lost his buddy, lost his rifle, got shot at and they missed., lost his helmet, lost his way, fell in the river, fell over a waterfall, floated down the river. I had to pause. I guess he made it."
1917,9 February 2020,6/10,"A sombre and humble WW-I film. If one has read even an overview of the battles of the WW-I, the horrors of trench warfare aren't unknown and this is where the movie begins. The sets of the trenches, the state of the hygiene, living conditions of the soldiers, the horrid views of the no-mans-land and the barbed wires etc. are depicted well enough to make the viewer uneasy. The landscapes of the French countryside, the devastation caused by aerial raids are captivating. The dogfight scene came as a pleasant surprise! The supporting actors leave an impression, even if their roles last barely a few minutes on the screen. MacKay has played his role immaculately, in fact I could relate what I read about the transformation the wars bring in men. With a runtime of barely 2 hours, the movie offers a lot.
Since my primary parameter of evaluation has always been the screenplay, I hate to say that the screenplay was unimpressive. I have no idea of the frontline battles but even if one wants to avoid detection of large groups, fast pace and secrecy, I can't believe that such a crucial task can be enlisted to just two soldiers. The incessant background score reminded me of the similar exasperation that I faced while watching 'Dunkirk'. The background score makes sense only if used sparingly.
Overall, the presentation, acting, cinematography and the overall execution of the movie is commendable but these strong elements can't salvage the screenplay."
1917,9 February 2020,7/10,"My wife and I both enjoyed this movie acting by both lead characters were top notch along with the direction and cinematography.
We both agreed on a 7/10.Recommend!"
1917,28 May 2021,7/10,"It is natural that if the script is interesting, the movie will be interesting. If you can make a very interesting movie out of a not-so-interesting script, you are a great filmmaker.If it hadn't been for this camerawork, I probably would have been too bored to watch the movie. I probably wouldn't have been drawn in at all. The fact that the film boldly starts with this camerawork from the very beginning is what drew me in and made me feel for the main character without question. I wonder how much opposition the director must have faced when he said, ""I'm going to shoot the whole film in one cut from start to finish..."" It must have taken a tremendous effort to make the film, but it was worth it. The director's sense that this script would only come alive with this kind of direction, that this script must be directed in this way, was spot on.As I watched the last credits screen, I felt that something was being conveyed to me, even though I did not understand what the film was trying to convey. I guess that's what movies are all about. But maybe the emotion of the last scene was mostly created by the music. I'm not sure about that. I guess that's what movies are all about.For those of you who are interested in camerawork after watching this, I recommend Hitchcock's ""Rope,"" a milestone of one-cut films. I also recommend ""Young and Innocent,"" where the intention of the camera work shines through."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"Following the trend to give movies 10 on 10 if one enjoyed it, this film gets a simple 1 on10.For a proper war film, watch Gallipoli, easily more authentic than this expensive propaganda."
1917,14 February 2020,8/10,"The cinematography is absolutely amazing with the movie appearing to be one continuous shot while the action is well choreographed and realistic. The movie is never excessive and while it has its fair share of action, it takes its time to not rush the quiet and more human moments amidst the carnage. It is a gritty depiction of war and all its horrors, not for spectacle's sake but to tell the story of two men given a mission to deliver a message. It's a race against time to save 1,600 men from a surprise attack during the World War I.I found myself immersed in this and felt like I was with the two mains on the battlefield. A fantastic technical achievement in cinematography and one of the best movies of 2019."
1917,25 February 2020,4/10,"Was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed and knew better, sigh....Definitely over-rated as the script & acting wouldn't even make it a good TV movie. The visual effects were above average."
1917,9 February 2020,2/10,"Why not drop the message from their plane ... what was a major use for them in WW1? Germans had a planned strategic retreat, you would think they take their guns with them. They were only destroyed when they had no time to take them? All those empty shells? My grandparents were asked to give pots and pans for the war effort! All these single Germans getting drunk and not able to aim properly do not strike me as an organized new front line. He came upon the truck with Brits and did not tell the officer about the new situation but the soldiers? Coming to find the group he wanted to warn, they were in hiding in a forest but singing... yeah right! The whole story is so unbelievable and besides a story line that can be told in one minute, I did not find the cinematography that great."
1917,6 March 2020,6/10,I enjoyed this more than I expected. I kind of thought I'd had my fill of WW 1 & 2 films and mini series but the opening of this film really drew me in.The opening production and sets were fantastic and the simple following of the two characters worked well to put you in their place. Unfortunately as the film went on it became a harder and harder to suspend disbelief. Until toward the end you were getting every single Hollywood trope which took away any sense of realism the film had built up at the beginning.It still has a lot of wonderful moments and is well worth watching I would say just for the production values and sets. I just wish things would've not got quite so silly toward the end.
1917,3 March 2020,1/10,"First, I usually love war movies. They are among my favorite genres.My criteria for judging isn't about accuracy. It's about plot, character development, and the usual good story telling.I loved Dances with Wolves, Saving Private Ryan, Midway. I even liked Hacksaw Ridge even though I thought it was pretty stupid for a person not to carry a gun in a war.But this ""1917"" movie was just stupid. It's poor copy of ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Hacksaw Ridge"". Probably a copycat of other war movies too, but 3 examples is good enough.Dances with Wolves - remember the beginning scenes where Kevin Costner gets on his horse and rides across the battle ground where the enemy could take open shots at him? Yeah, just watch toward the end of ""1917"" and you will see what I mean. So stupid.Saving Private Ryan - remember how they were on a mission to save private Ryan? In ""1917"" it's another brother they want to find.Hacksaw Ridge - remember how the main character doesn't like violence so he refuses to shoot anyone or even carry a gun? Pretty stupid in a war? Yeah? What would you do if your ENEMY's plane came crashing down in a flame of fire in front of you? The same ENEMY that would KILL you in a heartbeat? Would you try to SAVE your ENEMY's life and risk getting blown up or catch on fire or something else? Yeah. 
No wonder that stupid ""Parasite"" movie won at the Oscars. There are just too many stupid movies being nominated."
1917,27 March 2020,10/10,"1917 is one of the most immersive movies that I've ever watched. I felt like I was with the lead character every step of the the way, and it's all due to the incredible amount of effort from everybody involved in this film. The direction, cinematography, score, script, lead actors, extras, visual effects, locations, stunts, ect. are all perfect. Also, this movie isn't just a technical achievement; it has surprising amount of emotion and heart injected into it as well. 1917 is the type of film that we just don't get that often, and it's a cinematic achievement."
1917,10 February 2020,6/10,"Basic characters and story structure with a little bit of expectation subverting. The ""one-shot"" technique used comes off as gimmicky to me. I like how they actually made the soldiers look young like they should."
1917,17 October 2020,4/10,"To start with, if this film wasn't so completely overhyped, I would have given this a 6 or 7, but the fact that this film has been given stratospheric reviews, raised my expectations. The people that put together the montage to advertise the film, did a very good job, as they used the absolute best clips, which pprtrayed the film as a must watch. With regards to the best war film ever made, seriously? What idiots write this utter nonsense? Better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, yes those are vietnam. Well its not a patch on Dunkirk, saving private Ryan, the longest day, battle of the bulge, where eagles dare, guns of navarone, the list is endless but for a modern day adaptation of WW1 or WW2, this isn't a patch on Dunkirk. Maybe as this is based on WW1 and there hasn't been many examples to compare, this might be why people are raving about it? If that's the case, warhorse was way way better. I just don't get it as to why this is so widely acclaimed. I was so so looking forward to this and I was left utterly utterly disappointed to say the least. Worth a watch but nothing more"
1917,25 July 2020,7/10,"In terms of camera technology, it is a masterpiece that features actors and scenes, but ultimately fails because of a meaningless script.7,0"
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"Because this movie deserves to be Best Picture of 2019.
Because writing - check.

1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Blockbuster Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall) knows how to deliver gut punches through action and he brings an emotional roller coaster with this real time war thriller, where a few men stand tall in the impossible circumstances and find a way to triumph through sheer faith and will.The movie is shot with one take, seemingly in real time, which gives it a bizarre dreamlike quality. This experimental filmmaking goes far beyond what Hitchcock had in mind with his movie ROPE and the final cinematic result of 1917 would have made the king of suspense proud.They say the simpler the story the better it relates to the viewer, and the plot of 1917 is simple enough. All the complexity here is given through the imagery. The movie's name is 1917 and the visuals do give us the taste of what that year was really like. Senseless, impossible and terrifying, where the masses had been driven to insanity, but where a singular spirit still shines. ""There's only one way this war will end,"" says the bitter colonel played by Benedict Cumberbatch. ""With one last man standing."" Which sums up the movies main theme, as one man's courage stands against incredible odds.1917 leaves a long-lasting impression and takes along time to digest. This is also a film that will appeal to many tastes and ages, as with all its dramatic complexity, at its heart it is no more than an adventure movie."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"Capturing a full length feature in one continuous shot is a rare artistic technique utilised by filmmakers, with very few films in existence eligible to boast such a technical accomplishment. For his epic World War I film, Sam Mendes (director of Skyfall) and cinematographer Rodger Deakins employed long takes and swooping camera shots in order to project the illusion of a single continuous shot. While it's not a cinematic technique serviceable for every feature film, it most certainly compliments a project with the scale of 1917. On April 2nd, 1917, two soldiers, Schofield (MacKay) and Blake (Chapman), are instructed to deliver a message to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment that will subsequently terminate an attack that would result in the deaths of 1,600 men. In an ultimate race against time, Schofield and Blake courageously venture behind enemy lines to accomplish their mission, encountering many perilous obstacles along the way.
1917 is a staggering accomplishment. Utilizing the one continuous shot illusion, Mendes and Deakin's craft an epic, mesmerising journey into the heart of war, carried by an outstanding central performance by MacKay. Deakin's cinematography is fantastic and utterly immersive, complimented tremendously by Thomas Newman's brilliant score. It's a continuously riveting descent into treacherous territory. Factoring in the gritty authenticity of the set design captured by the one shot illusion, much of 1917 feels almost documentary-esque in it's sense of realism. Up there with Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Dunkirk (2017), 1917 is a must-see war effort that is breath-taking in scope and emotionally exhausting in its resolution."
1917,29 March 2020,7/10,"""1917"" is Oscar-bait of the highest caliber. Which means is technically astute, highly pretentious--especially for a war movie--with director/writer Sam Mendes wanting to attract attention by filming it in a seemingly singular shot and employing cinematographer legend Roger Deakins to give extra-polished sight to his vision. The movie is clever in this way, as what we see covers its superficial emotional shortcomings with success--it's like watching someone play a highly-detailed video game.Don't get me wrong, ""1917"" is emotional. But it also uses tear-jerking as a method of extracting emotion. It is filled with shock value. In particular, the scene in which Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) begin their journey through no-man's land. From afar, it looks like muddy terrain, but the closer we look, the more we see horrifying dead bodies just barely sticking out the mud which undoubtedly hides even more horror. Yet even when there is beauty surrounding them, there is no time to stop and admire it. The message must be delivered otherwise 1600 men will die--it doesn't get more blunt than this.Emotionally, ""1917"" is not a deep movie. Mendes took the inspiration from his grandfather who fought in the war and he fell to juvenile fascination. But while it doesn't delve into psychological and emotional complexities, the tragedies that ensue are candid. Mendes constantly keeps the clock ticking and pushes his characters into the maw of death again and again and we follow them helplessly. MacKay's constant tense face, his wide-open eyes, living in constant fear and agony, shows an inescapable fervor.A scene which caught my eye is when Schofield meets a French girl with a new-born in a war-town house. For once, he stops, plays with the baby, almost as if he imagines him a father and husband and life is good. But quickly his expression changes, and he wakes up from his ""dream"". The scene in itself is, again, pretty standard but it is also a template for the common dream for every man and its vividness invites us to contemplate further--since the movie doesn't do it itself.""1917"" makes the unseen pleasures of movies take a step back--things like emotional depth and complex, focused philosophies which permeate great movies and make us think about them over and over again. But even if it lacks greatness, its sudden blunt force trauma hits hard despite not lingering."
1917,5 December 2020,10/10,"When I was young, he told me about his experience. I don't think my parents would have approved, but it stuck with me. I had actually forgotten most of it as an adult. It made a huge impact on my life, as I would never see war in a romantic way again.As I watched this, I remembered his stories of dead friends, blood and the smell.I remember the tears that streamed down his ninety year old face as he told a seven-eight year old boy about how horrible it was, and that he wouldn't wish it on his worst enemies.I remember my dad asking me what is wrong, and telling him grandpa told me about the war. I remember my dad's shock, because he had never told anyone else in his life. And I don't think he ever did after that.When it ended, I knew these were the stories someones grandpa had told them, because they were like a memory I had forgotten.I will honor the memories of your friends for you grandpa.This movie had me weeping.
It is perfect in a horrible way."
1917,26 January 2021,10/10,"This is maybe the only film I've seen that when it ended, I wanted to say so many things, but couldn't open my mouth. It literally left me speechless! It has to take all of the Academy awards, otherwise it will be a blasphemy."
1917,4 January 2021,7/10,"Apart from the cinematography this movie feels empty and shallow.Once the end credits start rolling, you feel no emotional connection to the characters, nothing.
Very forgettable."
1917,15 March 2020,8/10,"The movie begins very good but becomes worse with every minute. the plot is very simple, its starts with a military general finding the worst candidates (viewer couldn't have known it back then but the general should have) for a critical mission. although camera had some very good angles and moves overall abuse of close distance shots is vertigo inducing. the burning town episode is just a fiasco reminding the latest Jumanji. multiple star cameos are ludicrous. outstanding costumes, props and makeup, along with unfading hope for a happy ending, carry this movie to the finish."
1917,15 January 2020,,Just another war story... there must be many millions of them. I saw no great revelations in this one.
1917,26 February 2020,10/10,"Abasolutely spell-binding - the script, the cinematography, the acting.So good that more words fail me."
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"Here's my review of 1917. So 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes , and I've been looking forward to this movie ever since the trailer dropped cause it's from the minds behind The war movie Jarhead which was also directed by Mendes and shot by frequent collaborator Roger Deakins. And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was blown away ! . The story is set amidst world war 1 and it's about these two soldiers who have to get through a lot of German territory and notify their camp to stop the planned attack for the next day. The journey to the camp is filmed to look like a one shot with no edits like how birdman was shot. And the man who shot it was Roger frickin Deakins , the man who shot the Shawshank Redemption , Blade runner 2049 and pretty much every movie which is worthy of being your desktop wallpaper , and this movie is no exception. The way it's shot makes you feel claustrophobic and also like you're watching a first person shooter game. The score by Thomas Newman was great and added a lot of weight to the story. The gripes I had with this movie was that you don't really care much for the characters cause you don't know much about them and since it's a warzone it's no surprise if anyone dies really, and the dialogue felt very bland in b/w convos , but I guess that's how people really talk at a time of crisis and quotable dialogue would've made it seem more fictional. In the end 1917 is more of an experience than a movie and to sum it up , it's the Revenant meets Dunkirk ."
1917,27 December 2020,8/10,"Couldn't wait to see this one last year but missed it. There certainly was much deserved hype behind it. After many 1000s of movies I have faced this situation many times. After two viewings it is difficult to give this movie anything short of perfection as a rating. Yet as I have learned even in perfection the 5 star may be denied , not for lack of effort in this case by any aspect of the product. More after so many films you just know what five stars should be. With regret I cannot give this spectacular effort such.All the ducks lined upPlot - Straightforward with no points where believability even entered in my head. This in itself is a rare achievement for writers in any script. Acting towed the mark.Direction - Well if Mendes had not written the script there might have been a flaw . However , the project leader shooting his own work should yield a superior result and did here.Cinematography - which was all the talk the entire year , the "" one continuous shot "" . Lensing in this film both firmly defeated disbelief and held rock solid attention contributing to flow. As it should.Flow. Again back to the camerawork which held the attention of the viewer tightly with little respite for stray. The Writing again leaving little time for your ass to be numb.Technical. As best as it can be with good detailed attention. Nothing out of place or really inappropriate for the setting. A good score for the times when needed.At its face a five star movie. I know better.
4 of 5 Stars ( really only by a hair)"
1917,24 January 2020,1/10,"Well acted and literate, and elevates history, all of which are good, but I found it crassly manipulative, with too many scripted coincidences that amounted to unwitting parody of the genre ""single mission war movie."" For me, it became unwatchable. I walked out."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"1917 is a good film that consistently holds the attention of its audience. However, it frequently does not engage the emotions. The main gimmick of the film can be a distraction that takes the audience out of the story. This film is a spectacular production that undoubtedly was difficult to create. The cast lend considerable credibility to the film."
1917,10 January 2020,,"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The director, the actor, and the cinematographer. Sam Mendes, George MacKay, and Roger Deakins.This trinity of artists has achieved something truly special with their World War War I masterpiece '1917.' There are good movies. There are great movies. And every so often-perhaps once a year at most, if we the audience may be so spoiled-there are movies that advance the art form beyond its present state, towards a loftier plane of existence. '1917' is indeed one of these movies.Upon seeing the film, words feel trivial in trying to characterize or describe in any meaningful way the experience that this movie provides. Give director Sam Mendes a pen and a camera and there isn't anything he can't do. Afford him the privilege of working with lead actor George MacKay and sublimity follows. Pair them both with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins and transcendence awaits.The ""single take"" effect in which the film is presented is not new. Others have also done it to great acclaim, such as Alejandro G. Inarritu with 'Birdman' or Ilya Naishuller with 'Hardcore Henry.' But no other film has done it better than '1917' and quite frankly there are few, if any films in recent memory, that have been so thoroughly exceptional in every other facet of the filmmaking process."
1917,17 February 2021,6/10,"Gorgeous cinematography. While the continuous single take is nice I think maintaining it throughout the whole movie isn't effective.What really bothered me was the many things that were just too impossible, bordering ridiculous.For some reason I could not connect with any of the characters. At the very end I felt some emotion but before that nothing."
1917,10 September 2020,8/10,Watching this movie is like watching a game of Call of Duty
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendes' 1917 is a visual war poetry, both ambitious in scope and grandeur in scale where two Birdmen try to Save sixteen hundred Private Ryans and Corporal Blakes.The plot sounds like the 'saving the world' journey of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee of the Shire from the Fellowship of the Ring, particularly from its end where they are left by Aragon to be on their own to the Return of the King through the lifeless no-man land, perpetual trenches, ghastly rapid rivers and bone-chilling grotesque remnants of the war. Though the comparison to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is inevitable, the scene involving the German fighter pilot, might feel less original as it borrows elements of character arc straightaway.For utmost every ebb and flow, writing commemorates this epic voyage of Blake and Schofield, realistically played by both actors portraying these roles. Before every major obstacle/storm, there is some room for calmness where these characters come across something evocative so they get to have a brief chat about them which for most parts is likeable or at least, puts the morale of a soldier before us.Roger Deakins' cinematography is heralded as one of the greatest of all time, which in fact is true, can still be put in an infamous, not well-known debate. There are numerous 360° panning shots in open fields and tracking shots within trenches, which might leave an audience disoriented as L.A.Times critic Justin Chang states in his review. Yet the greatness vastly outsmarts this negligible irritation.There are two particular sequences in the film, that can easily be considered as two of the greatest cinematic moments of the decade. Thanks to the gut-wrenching score (sixteen hundred man) of Thomas Newman, the light men and the production designers!In the end, staging like how the story unwraps under the trunk of a tree and winds up on a similar note, is what makes this cinema, an art-house and not just another blockbuster entertainment."
1917,10 March 2020,8/10,"1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non stopping war shootings genre. The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking.Sam Mendes use of almost continuous filming aids the overall story. Two young n.c.o.s picked for what looks like a suicide mission.Cinematographer - Roger deakins, was fantastic, absolutely, some stunning.
It is designed as two extraordinary long, unbroken shots, itself is worthy of an Oscar win.The cast is also brilliant, with each actor giving stellar performances and countless cameos from well renowned figures such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Richard Madden.The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.Overall I think this is worth-watchable, expertly made war film."
1917,28 January 2020,8/10,"At first, I wasn't all that buzzed to see this movie; continuous one-take movies weren't really my thing. But then the more I thought about it, if any genre of film fit the found footage genre it'd have to war movies. Getting inside the mind of a soldier in the middle of the war and experiencing what they're experiencing is a great way to help us appreciate what real life soldiers do for us, and understand what they've gone through.The story focuses on two soldiers, Lance and Will, who are giving a mission to deliver a message over enemy lines in order to stop a deadly trap that will wipe out 1,600 British troops.Both Dean-Charles Chapman (Lance) and George MacKay (Will) do a great job in this movie. I've known MacKay was an amazing actor since his roles in Captain Fantastic and Pride. And Chapman has certainly come a long way since his role as Tommen Baratheon in Game of Thrones. Not once in their interactions was I checking my watch, and you believe their concern for one another. Their reaction to seeing and being near dead, rotting bodies above the trenches were just great, exactly how the real life soldiers saw and felt.Director Sam Mendes is a master at directing, and its amazing to know this is his first continuous-shot movie. The costumes, the sets, the atmosphere are all great.My nitpicks are few as well. My first nitpick is something that happens around half way through the movie, when Will is hiding in a cellar below the ruins of a city, and he meets a French girl, and Will only speaks English and can somehow understand French, and the French girl can't speak English, but can somehow understand it. It's a nitpick that I've seen in a lot of movies, and it sorta puts it to shame when you know Christoph Waltz learned Italian to prepare for his role as Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds. My other nitpick is some of the marketing material, specifically (spoilers) at the end of the movie when Will is running through the field to get to the army commander with the message; I already saw it in the trailer, and after the opening trench scene ended I knew one or both of them would make it to the end anyway, so some of the tension disappeared at that point.It was also nice seeing Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden in this movie too. I'd even say this movie gave me more than Saving Private Ryan did. 9 out of 10, definitely give it a see while it's out in cinemas."
1917,21 March 2020,7/10,"I believe that this movie is just good , not too bad and not great at the same time , to be fair the cinematography in this movie is possibly the only thing that was amazing, rather than that i didn't feel i enjoyed it , the cinematography itself has flaws , some scenes are soo long , you see those two soldiers walk for 5 minutes and they just talk and tell some random boring stories and almost i fell asleep in some scenes, plus some plot holes , i don't know about explosives but with that explosion in that narrow room i think it would cause more damage to the two soldiers than what we saw in the movie , this movie in my opinion deserves no more than 7,5"
1917,11 March 2020,6/10,"How many times do we need to see the same story ?
Poor acting from the two protagonists,
mediocre dialogs,a forgettable movie."
1917,2 May 2020,4/10,"The usual: very well done, very good special effects, the travelling of the trenches, the music, etc, etc ...
But then the movie is totally spoiled by the cheesy script, the intention to over-dramatize, and a lot of cliches ...More examples from this era, when the spectacular is on the same level as the false, the cheesy, and the artificial: Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, Flags of Our Fathers, Dunkirk, Lone Survivor, Windtalkers, Crimnson Tide ... .These directors should see again the great films of this genre, which seems to have been forgotten: Apocalypse Now, Paths of Glory, The Deer Hunter, Der Untergang, Das Boot, All Quiet on the Western Front ..."
1917,6 January 2020,1/10,"Only the settings of the battlefield looked pretty good, but asking two young men without enough battle experiences instead of ordering two battle-seasoned old guys to infiltrate behind the enemy line, trying to deliver a warning to another British Battle group was just too ridiculous to swallow. What we saw in this movie was nothing but watching two guys trudging through trenches, bombed holes filled with filthy rainwater and corpses, bob wires...followed with the boring camera for most part of this boring movie. The only tension was when they met a German pilot after his airplane crashed next to them, then.....nothing.Compare to ""Dunkirk 2017"", this movie really sucks big time, don't know how this boring movie would win the Best Picture of the 77th Golden Globe award.
Not worth a penny."
1917,5 March 2020,6/10,"Technically it's amazing but overall I find it an overrated movie. It's not the first one shot movie and it's not also the best war movie. I know that it's a war movie and like the most of it's genre the objective is to portray war and visually it does it beautifully, but the little plot this have is ridiculous and non-sense in a lot of ways. So they're in war against Germany and they've been probably killing german in the battle field and when they see that a german soilder is going to die on a plain crash they proceed to help him? Really? A soldier that probably killed lots of them comrades and was just minutes ago in a battle with one of they're planes? And that causes one of them to die... Not to mention when in the beginning one of the soldiers got buried by a wall after a grenade explosion and yet he came out of that like it was nothing and only a few dust upon him but that trap in real life would've kill them both but no, dying after trying to help an enemy soldier is more realistic right... And that encounter with the lady with the baby? That really seem forced to me, not to mention that she was surviving with a baby without food and milk and guess what the soldier had? Milk from that stupid cow encounter scene. The scene when he was running and the german were close and shooting at him but yet he didn't got hit was just stupid. The problem of this was that they thought that just because the visuals were amazing they could give us any kind of non-sense plot and it would be cool, well, that doesn't work with me."
1917,8 June 2021,6/10,"Could've done without the scene of the soldiers on the truck and the one with the French girl but other than that, it was pretty great but certainly doesn't meet the same heights of excitement after Blake dies.Deakins outdoes himself in the cinematography department and the blocking of this film was immaculate as it had to be because of what Mendes was going for. Technically impressive which is why the story suffers if you think about it."
1917,7 February 2020,5/10,"Those who have never experienced an exceptional movie (milennials, I'm referring to you), will likely dub this example of mediocrity exceptional, but, in actual fact, this movie is just OK nothing more."
1917,30 July 2020,6/10,"Impressed by:Most of the long sequences, especially through the trenches and the final assault. Alas some (e.g. tunnel, run through 'village' lit by flares) were over-longMost of the CGI, but some (E.g. rat; collapsing tunnel, run through 'village' lit by flares; waterfall) were pretty dismal.Most of the acting (but why, oh why Cumberbatch again? I just don't get it. Surely he's just included to add to box office takings?)A film worth watching, but not a game changer for me."
1917,3 February 2020,5/10,"Everything looks real, it was very good. I like the fact un known people were in the lead role. Story was unfinished, so many unbelievable things happened. He found a fresh milk( no poison in it, Germans even cutted the trees why the hell leave the one bucket of fresh milk), airplane just came to on them, some how they decided to save the enemy, all that ghost town houses, he found a woman hiding with the girl.( you cant keep baby that happy if no milk no breast milk. Baby would cry non stop and cant survive very long. Why couple of Germans was in the village? Where are the left of it? Why other soldiers didnt help the our hero, when they hear the shooting, why theydidnt give him any help 2-3soldiers withhim maybe, maybe some food!. First of all they shouldnt be survive from the bunker trap. Whole storie is big nonsense following each other. But; Dup, makeup, costume, decor-set, ar lt director, music ( mostly was very stressful because music was carrying that war stress very successfully) after movie mostly i think about storie and back stories of the people who plays in. This time i didnt have any emotional feelings in my mind. Just nice, good, technical pictures. In 1600 soldier he found the guy in 2 minutes .sorry scnerio was not good that reason 5"
1917,22 January 2020,2/10,"I thought this movie would show some action, there was none. I was very disappointed. Watched the whole thing hoping to see some military fighting, but none. This is Truly a waste of time movie."
1917,6 September 2020,7/10,"1917 is proof that movies do not have to bombard us with VFX to make a visually stunning movie. It captures the mundane horror, stress and anxiety of war in a more real way than any war film. The attention to detail makes you feel everything. Not the kind of film you can watch over and over, but a film in a very classic sense that needs to be seen."
1917,24 January 2020,8/10,"This film pulls you in and doesn't let go. You'll experience everything of the horror of trench warfare in WWI. Last time you felt this immersed was 'Saving Private Ryan'. Beautifully filmed, well acted, with as basic a plot as could be: get through enemy territory quickly or a lot of men will die.The POV perspective throughout can be a bit unnerving, but also helps pull you in. Same for the extended shot takes. You'll feel you're along for the ride. One to see over again.Only thing that cost it a 10 were some ""Huh?"" moments. If the mission is so critical, why send only two men? A squad can move just as quickly - they're walking after all - with more chance of success. We see airplanes throughout. Why not have them fly over and drop the orders? The plane crash was unbelievable; one plane, into the one building around and on top of the men?? The killing then was not at all the way at the time, when there was still a sense of chivalry - as evidenced by them saving the pilot - particularly among pilots."
1917,12 March 2020,6/10,"""1917"" sits somewhere between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Revenant"" story-wise, even if can't match the sheer dramatic ferocity of either of those two films. The first half hour or so is essentially an exercise in perfectly executed tension, but after that the film becomes a bit more uneven. Basically, the movie could've used a few cuts to propel its sometimes slowing story (e.g. scenes in the truck, an encounter with a French woman, etc). While this movie is pitched as a single shot, it actually has a deliberate edit roughly midway through (involving a blackout), and could've used a few more. Still, Deakins's cinematography is stunning and even when the story lags the images we see are quite striking. But ultimately, in its two hours, the movie doesn't generate enough dramatic tension, particularly as it inches towards its ending, which kind of fizzles. The payoff to this cinematic feat is, without any spoilers, unsurprising, familiar, and typical of so many other war films - it's unfortunate that so much work went into the craft of its production but more didn't go into developing the characters and building up the story."
1917,1 February 2020,7/10,"The story is nothing. Everything was made to make the movie look like it was one shot. So because of this everything else was sacreficed. Sadly..But the point is that, why on Earth do you think the DP has anything to do with this?????? The cinematography was nothing. A guy was following the actors and that's all. There was one shot that looked amazing. The rest was nothing.What you saw, how they recorded the whole thing was made by the director. It's not cinematography. You're terribly mistaken.The cinematography is (in very basics), the angles, the way the camera moves (I said basics!). None of it was special at any point of the movie!Making it look like it was one shot was done by the director and not the DP.The director deserves an Oscar for making this movie. No doubt about that.
BUT the movies and it's creators deserve no awards.Every other nominated movie ever in this theme was better in every aspect!
Almost every nominated movie is better than this one.Just because you can't see, it doesn't make it better."
1917,16 February 2020,8/10,"Not many films can achieve locking the audience in within the first few minutes, but 1917 does and takes us on an unforgettable cinematic ride.The way the director successfully obtains the feel of an uncut film is beautiful. AWESOME MOVIE!!! It's more than a movie. It's an experience.

1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"World War I has been a topic of interest to me for a very long time. Naturally, when I first heard about this film, I took the first opportunity I could to go and see it.I haven't seen too many war films, but one of the things I noticed with a lot of the films that I've seen is that most of them focus on a single moment of action. They build characters either before or during in breaks between the action but generally with many of the war films I've seen, you always end up down and dirty in the middle of the action almost the whole time once it commences. This film is much different and it's one of the reasons why I like it so much.This film is very unique because it doesn't really throw the viewer in the middle of a battle the same way a lot of other films do. Of course, the films that do that are trying to portray the horrors of the violence of war, which is important, but I think this film shows a different side of the grit of war. The mission at hand is simple and doesn't really require any grandiose acts of violence. Yes, there is still violence in this film, but what makes this film so successful is the constant suspense it puts you under. You never feel like the characters are entirely safe. They might be in a great, open field that's completely empty, but you never really know if they are safe or not unless they are in their home trenches. Somehow, the film is able to paint the trenches, which we are all told the horrors about in our history classes, are the only real safe place from sudden danger. This film is constantly tense and the way that it was shot- being made to look like it was all one single shot- helps to directly contribute to that constant tense feeling.The cinematography of this film is fantastic. Many scenes are so uniquely lit and the movement of the camera during the long tracking shots help to keep this film visually interesting.The soundtrack for this film is as awe inspiring as the cinematography is. I don't want to go too much into a music review, but the soundtrack only adds to the experience.I think this is a war film that is definitely worth seeing even for those who don't like them very much. I can't speak highly enough about this film."
1917,12 January 2021,8/10,"One of the most realistic films I have seen in a while, especially being in one singular take. And even still having beautiful cinematography that really captured a grey and depressing image of that time. The story, acting and soundtrack were very nice too with an amazing moment at the climax.SPOILERS BELOW!!!:
Looking back on it I personally would loved to have seen a dark and bad ending to the story, one where the main character does not succeed, right at the very end with no one believing him on what he has to say. Although that is just personal preference and think this is a very good film the way it is."
1917,7 July 2021,10/10,"This is a true WWI masterpiece!Movie transformes you right there and then, in the heat of the battle. You are there, with those soldiers and nowhere else. It is directed and filmed briliantly. Actors are great. Great from the first moment.Highly emotional and intense movie till the last minute."
1917,20 January 2020,,"This film was just incredible, this is arguably the finest cinema experience I've had, I felt fully invested in the story, on the edge of my seat as these two soldiers dodge bullets and artillery as they strafe across No Man's Land and through burnt-out towns. This is what IMAX was made for.Regarding the story, it's rather simplistic, two soldiers are ushered to the frontlines to deliver a message that will prevent the slaughter of 1,600 British soldiers, it sounds rather basic, but its the character development of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, who both deliver stunning performances, that sells the story. The banter and heartfelt backstories that cover the interludes of battle add realism to these characters, they make them relatable and therefore make us care for their outcome.On a technical level, this is where the film shines. I'm quite biased as Roger Deakins is my favourite cinematographer, Thomas Newman is my favourite composer and Sam Mendes is one of my favourite directors, so watching these 3 come together (for a fourth time) instantly garnered my attention, and I'll be damned if I can't say that this is Deakins' magnum opus, the way the camera moves fluidly to create the illusion of a one-shot take is just incredible, it places us as an audience in the trenches with the soldiers, in the thick of the hell they have to endure. Newman has crafted better scores (with my favourite being 'Road to Perdition - coincidentally also a Mendes film) but this one is undeniably brilliant, the scores during the sequences set in nighttime Écoust-Saint-Mein and the final push across No Man's Land are phenomenal. And whilst I would love to see Newman FINALLY win his Oscar, it'll likely be another heartbreaking snub.Finally, Mendes has for a long time retained his position as one of my favourite auteurs, with 'American Beauty', 'Road to Perdition' and 'Skyfall' being some of my favourite films, but this is something truly different, this is his homage to his grandfather, and therefore feels more personal, it feels more grounded and is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and I couldn't ask for a finer film to end the decade with."
1917,1 January 2020,10/10,"Director/Writer Sam Mendes and Cinematographer Roger Deakins produce the best war film of the 2010s. Truly stunning visually, the story of two soldiers' race to the front lines of WWI under direct orders to deliver the message to stop 1,600 British soldiers from entering a trap set-up by German forces to massacre them, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and inside the soldiers' boots, through amazing Mendes/Deakins directing/cinematography techniques.This is film art in its highest form, and is at once incredibly beautiful and horrific.A runaway certain Oscar winner for Cinematography (Deakins), and nominations (at a minimum) for Best Film, Director, Visual Effects, Screenplay (Mendes), Film Editing (Lee Smith), and Actor (George MacKay)."
1917,27 January 2020,8/10,"Undeniably a great visual feast, especially the bombed out church, but someone seems to have forgotten the script. A lot of the speaking is very on the nose. This distracted from the feel of the film.But credit to Roger Deakins. He makes the film what it is. My recommendation is to look at the making of videos on YouTube, then watch the film. It will give you a greater understanding of the technical process of film production."
1917,6 September 2020,7/10,"I watched the movie thinking it's a real story...
After seeing it, I thought it was dragged AH, and anyone with no witnesses could create a totally heroic route to deliver the messege without ever encountering any difficulties.
Then I read the comments and saw it is based in a real story and enlarged...
If I had known that from the start, I would give it a 9...
Still... Great movie, amazing shots.
Totally a must see."
1917,12 January 2020,3/10,I was expecting the next Saving Private Ryan. The story is about a soldier bringing a message across desolate war torn landscape. There were only about 4 Germans in the movie and no combat scenes. If I would I would have fast forwarded through a lot of it. Don't listen to the hype.
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"Im in shock of this masterpiece, im going to be honest, first when i saw that 1917 was nominated for many academy awards and it won the golden globes for best picture and best director i was a little bit confused cause i think that the director doesn't deserve that, and i said to myself, is it that great?! I dont think its that great, its just a movie about a guy who wants to deliver a message to save 1600 of his fellow comrades. but after i watched this movie im proud to say that this movie is one of the best movies that i have ever seen in my whole life and its for sure on the list of my top 5 favorite movies.1917 is a movie that shows you every single thing that every single soldier used to go through during world war 1, really enjoyed every single thing about the movie from the music to the customs to the cinematography to scriptwriting. The movie shows us the disgusting stuff that they went through. This movie is so deep and emotional, 2 hours passed by so fast i didnt even feel it, i didnt even want the movie to come to an end. And i saved the best for the last, the fact that the movie is a ""one shot"" is just unbelievable, you are literally there In every single thing they are going through or doing, some people will say that its boring (because of the one shot), but the director wants you to be there in every single scene and every single detail thats why its a ""one shot"". A perfect movie that u have to watch in the big screen (Would be way better if its IMAX) unless you wont have the perfect experience. I wont be surprised if this movie wins many academy awards because it really deserves it. Hats off to all the cast & crew, Thank You for this masterpiece."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Spectacular! It was riveting, tense, and the most singularly visceral war movie I may have ever seen. It was a cinematographic tour de force. What could have been a gimmick of single-take shot, instead provided incredible verisimilitude and for the first time I could begin to imagine what trench warfare might have been like in WWI. The score by Thomas Newman was propulsive and as much or greater part of the film all around, but FWIW, my pulse was still racing thirty minutes later in the lift on the way up to our apartment. I highly recommend seeing this in the theatre, even if war movies aren't your thing."
1917,4 February 2021,2/10,"I really wanted to like this film, but there's just too much wrong with it. There are too many plot holes and historical inaccuracies, and the script is lacklustre at best. The story is frankly stupid, and seems like something some drunk studio execs dreamed up over a boozy dinner after watching Saving Private Ryan.It's a shame because an awful lot of people put an awful lot of effort into this, and the two main actors were great. The cinematography is excellent, but there are several important scenes which are spoiled by badly composited CG elements, particularly the climactic running shot which is just a mess.There are some amazing films set in WW1, and so much scope for making more, but this is not one of them. Paths of Glory it ain't.Finally, the soundtrack was really distracting at times. Some of the incidental music was highly anachronistic, and I really don't think anyone from Devon would have sung Wayfaring Stranger in 1917. There are lots of English hymns and Westcountry folksongs of the period that would have worked just as well. It was nicely sung, but a very odd choice of song."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"War movies are only made for the emotional part in recent years, then some directors gives us an original vision with a real different approache. After all the years watching movies that only repeating what we already seen i thought i'm done with it, i'm only looking for original ideas, finally i had one with Nolan ""Dunkirk"".... a rare one! Then Mendes did it again...... i almost lost breathing in the first 25 minutes, so intense none stop action without cut (at least i feel it that way), it gives you some break and..... here we go again, till the emotional and brilliant end. Nothing to say about acting and actors they are simply excellent ( especially Mackay ). 1917 is a most watch if you love cinema...."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,Yes a fantastic piece of technical film making but actually not very involving. Quite slow at times and no real stand out moments. Were was movie set? France? Belgium? Didn't really explain. Will win Oscars but does not compare to Sp Ryan' Dunkirk or Hacksaw ridge. That said it is something to deffo see just lower expectations.
1917,28 February 2021,7/10,"If you're the artistical type, and you enjoy great cinematography and the fact that it is 'filmed in one shot', you will probably adore this no doubt special piece of cinema.
However it is almost always my experience that excessive gimmicks like overly great cinematography and filming in one shot and stuff like that, usually just chip away at good, driven story and compelling characters.So if you're a bit of a cultural buffoon like I am, and you really NEED an ongoing interesting storyline and compelling characters to keep interested, this might just not really be your thing.But here's where this movie really lost it for me:At the end, when the struggling corporal finally gets to the officer he has to deliver the message to, OF COURSE, like it is tradition ONLY in movies: the officer is not willing to even look at him a moment and just goes: ""Piss off silly idiot, we are attacking here!""Lol to me that was WAY to weak for this movie man. It happens in almost every movie with this similar storyline while I believe that would NOT happen in real life! Ever! Not today, and not in 1917. If you're a leading officer about to send hundreds of men into deadly battle, unless you're a complete and total moron of course, you will at least take a quick look at what the messenger has to say. That scene just made me laugh out loud man."
1917,4 February 2020,8/10,"1917 gives viewers, even those who watch war movie films on the regular, a different perspective. The one shot film does a beautiful take on war and its effect on those around them as we dont follow a legion of soldiers but 2 only and how their mission effects them. The only real bother for me would be the starting point, it's a bit boring but it does pick up pace after 20 minutes or so. If you like war movie, you should give this one a try."
1917,21 March 2020,8/10,"From the field full of small yellow flowers to wake up, to slowly sit down can finally breathe a sigh of relief, the cattle in the grasslands, gradually become smaller houses, forever left there friends, the river drifted cherry blossoms, the night under the fire of abandoned town, from the sound of gunfire and silhouettes feel the enemy. Delicate and magnificent."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"My review of ""1917"".
There are very few movies which successfully pull off illusion of being shot in one continues take.
Alfred Hitchcock's 'ROPE' (1948) comes to mind, as well as the opening shot of Orson Wellse's 'Touch of Evil' (1958). More recently ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" (2014) directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu earned the best Picture and best Director among other categories back in 2015, which shows how much the Academy appreciates this stylistic yet technically difficult choice of story exposition.
By now everyone knows that Sam Mendes's ""1917"" has yearned the Golden Globe for best film and before seeing it I was bit unsure of this choice leaning towards 'JOKER' as the best movie of the year. Potentially Mende's movie has all the ingredients to be special. First, an acclaimed director in Sam Mendes, second arguably the best director of photography who paints with light in Roger Deakins, the budget of close to 100mil, so what could go wrong? Well perhaps setting a challenge of trying to convey movies full story in real time using what appears to be one continues take.
Magician does not explains how he achieved particular trick same as filmmaker usually doesn't show how he created film sequence. By doing so, he is demystifying the process which should only be known to the initiated. However there are widely available online behind the scenes footage, where both director as well as DP explain the challenges of creating whole movie using continues tracking shoot, which follows two protagonists who are Lance Corporal Blake played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay playing Lance Corpal Schofied. Both young army man during the First World War are given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. As the story unfolds we are following them through the trenches and obstacles trying to fiulfil their mission.
At first when I though that this movie will be shown in real time using continues take with edits hidden in wipes (movement of the camera which lingers on wall or other objects permitting seamlessly to connect two scenes together in editing making it look as one continues take) I was unsure. When I first heard that ""1917"" employed this technique I feared that it might be used as gimmick, however when I find out that Roger Deakens is involved in the project I knew Sam Medes's picture was in good hands. Most people will not understand how much work it takes to create movie this way. The control of focus and the light alone is a very difficult task. However if one take tracking shot technique isn't used for the narrative purpose, then whole film potentially could fail. That's where Sam Mendes directing comes in to play, who also co-wrote the screenplay which he based on a very personal story of his grandfather's experiences in WWI titled""The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991"".
Sam Mendes is a special director, we could point to many movies which prove this argument. From ""American Beauty"" to my favourite Bond to date in ""Skyfall"". He is a director who is able to convey emotion, without being overly dramatic. There is a subtleness within which he is able to covey inner emotions of the character by using not only actors performance, but utilising blocking (movement of actors in relation to camera) in a landscape scope of the composition. Film of this sort only works if the audience truly feels like they are on a journey together with our protagonists and big credit for doing so needs to be given to musical score which is used to convey danger, emotionality and melancholy when needed.
The reason why this film works is because all of the above mentioned techniques are utilised to tell the story and forward the narration to an emotional impact on the viewer. Yes, the performances are strong, with cameos from Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and charismatic as always Mark Strong, not to mention both leads, but it's the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic. After watching ""1917"" I can honestly say, I strongly believe this picture will receive an OSCAR's for the best film and cinematography (in any other year I would pick the ""JOKER"" for the best film and cinematography, but this year Roger Deakens should not be denied) and possibly Sam Mendes for having an overview over all these elements, to create arguably best movie of the year, which up to that point this distinction belong in my humble opinion to the ""JOKER"". I strongly feel Sam Mendes has made his grandfather very proud, in his attempt to bring all the creative pieces together, creating in it's entirety a masterpiece of a movie, which film students will study for years to come."
1917,2 May 2021,10/10,"This story is about two soldiers that are sent on a mission to deliver a vital message to save thousands of men from a certain slaughter. To do this they must travel thru enemy occupied territory. The visual impact is stunning. My complaints are technical in nature; given the urgency of the message a smart general would have sent multiple, larger squads to ensure that at least one got thru. Secondly, a pilot could have delivered the message in a matter of minutes. So, you have to suspend disbelief on these accounts. Trench warfare was an ugly, messy affair which the film does a pretty good, but not perfect, job of depicting. Clearly one of the best films of 2019."
1917,24 March 2020,1/10,"British accents are so unbearably annoying. Walked out the theater, couldn't take it."
1917,14 February 2020,10/10,"Usually I find that user ratings on IMDB of movies are a bit too high. In the case if user ratings for this film, currently at 8.5, the overall rating is 1.5 points too low! This is simply a cinematic masterpiece, period. No movie in history has ever been filmed as if in one long, uncut scene! Genius and ground-breaking film making. Breathtaking cinematography. Grit and beauty and reality of war, through the lens of the Director's personal knowledge passed from his own grandfather. Tear-jerking, heart-wrenching, pulsating tension, individuals persevering through an ever changing and huge landscape of war and the unknown - this is an epic brilliantly made for the big screen experience - bold yet nuanced. There was no better film released in 2019, and the fact that overall IMDB rating is anything less than 10 can only speak on behalf of those persons rating this film who have not closely followed and watched films from the silents to today, evaluating story first and foremost, then in close conjunction with directing, acting, cinematography, sets and sound. This movie is exquisitely detailed in every aspect of story-telling and film making. Thank you, Sam Mendes!"
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"A beautifully directed movie. Cinematography was unreal. Cast, incredible. Music is hauntingly beautiful. George MacKay should of been nominated! Sam Mendez, you're amazing. Better win best picture."
1917,16 December 2020,10/10,"A feast for your eyes, tracking shots and long takes are brilliant for immersion and this film got it near perfect, actors were obviously under huge pressure due to this technique and the acting does have a different feel to it but they pulled it off. Simple story done right."
1917,8 May 2020,8/10,"A journey through the tranches would be a great title , it describes well the horror of the world war 1 through the eyes of a young soldier, what a remarkable movie"
1917,31 March 2020,7/10,"I am probably one of a few who thought the movie was just OK. It kind of like the British version of Saving Private Ryan although the story is one-dimensional and it takes place decades earlier during WW1. Yes, the directing was great, the acting was also excellent, but the storyline was not that great. Suspenseful, yes. But you pretty much know where it is going the whole time. Sam Mendes wrote it based on stories he remembers his grandfather telling him, and he also dedicated the movie to his grandfather. If you like war movies you will enjoy it. For me, I like a variety of movies and while I do like war movies , this falls short. Sorry. Although when you compare it to the garbage coming out of Hollywood (they cannot make a good movie) 1917 is Great by comparison!"
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"Sam did not disappoint! A master of the visual, Mendes once again uses every inch of the screen to its fullest potential. The much spoken of ""gimmick"" aside, the film is brilliantly written. Never heavy-handed, the script is wonderfully efficient in its dialogue. It is a masterclass in show, don't tell. Back to the gimmick, it does not work if not for the performances from the two young actors. MacKay, especially, excels as a worthy Virgil in our trek through the hell of war. This is not a traditional war film. Like it's predecessor Jarhead, Mendes deconstructs war from the perspective of soldiers not to glorify or denounce war. Instead, it is a apathetic study of soldiers (humanity) in war. It is a must watch!!!"
1917,27 May 2021,10/10,I was never a fan of war movies.... but 1917 changed everything..... what a stunning piece of art this movie is..... no words can describe it... wonderful. :)
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,The first perfect movie I've watched since the godfather part 2.
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,"Great movie to look at, beautifully shot by Roger Deakins and well directed by Sam Mendes. But it is not the masterpiece they want us to believe.I was struck by the sililarities with that other recent war epic ""Dunkirk"". Ofcourse that was in WWII and based on a real event, but bear with me on this one.
1917 and Dunkirk were highly praised on their release and 1917 will undoubtedly also rack up some Oscars. Both movies are made by high-profile directors, Mendes and Christopher Nolan for ""DunKirk, and both movies are shot in the ultra-widescreen Imax format. They are also both serious British flagwavers. Also both stories are full of plotholes (remember the Spitfire in Dunkirk that could fly without petrol).
But my main concern with both movies is this : where are the bloody Germans ? In ""Dunkirk"" we see a few German planes from a far distance and in the very end a few shadowy German soldiers. And it is almost the same in 1917 : we only see dark flashes of them, even the downed German pilot is quickly disposed of (after he in true Hun-fashion has stabbed one of his British saviours). What is it then : can't we have a fight, would it be to gruesome on the giant Imaxscreen or is it maybe Hollywood won't allow these days German troops in full regalia on such a big moviescreen ?"
1917,16 February 2020,6/10,"The story is written by Sam Mendes based on what his grandfather told him. Mendes' grandfather was a soldier in the Trench War, and this offering is in his honour for his heroic act of treading through the dangers of the enemy-line and the perils of Nature to pass over a piece of vital information to the advancing army. His deed indeed saved the day and many fellow comrades.I am a little perplexed. On the one hand, I am taught that violence is the primitive way of settling an issue. Violence can never solve any problems but instead, create new ones. An eye for an eye leaves the whole blind, they say. Yet in the same breath, the same people proclaim that turning the other cheek is stupidity.All through our civilisation, war has been part and parcel of our evolution. With each significant catastrophe that we go through, the human race seems to go up one notch in terms of scientific achievement. War propels the world forward. War stimulates the economy, and the desire to dominate is one thing that gives pride. We form tribes and fall in line under a piece of cloth to provide us with a sense of pride to uphold.In a war, we say, everyone loses but yet, we are ever ready to justify the mother of all battles to end wars. We know where it led us.The promise of wealth and power is good enough reason for us to get up in the morning and plunge ourselves into the conveyer belt that would send us all to the hole of destruction. We repeatedly justify our resort to extinction as a means to settle scores by putting the blame on Nature. Even our Universe is rough in its actions. Scorching expulsions of magma, destructive clash of meteorites, earth-shattering movements of tectonic plates and extremes of temperatures proves that the world is no pleasure cruise."
1917,3 April 2020,4/10,"Cinematography very well done, and evocative of the Great War. The plot is, militarily pitiful. Time and again, choices and events - even for officers and men of the ""New Army"" - are idiotic. Several times there are escapes from catastrophe that strain belief. The German landsers couldn't all be such terrible shots! Having paid to see it, we held on to the end.....not sure why."
1917,5 March 2020,7/10,"Let me start off by saying that this film in my opinion does not deserve the credit that it gets. It does however very well deserves the cinematography oscar it won, because it was beautifully shot. In my opinion there were some oddities with this film, that's why I don't find it like an 8+. Despite that it was a really interesting film to watch."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"1917 has shown audiences what really made those men go over the top! It is all centred as one shot, and the director with such an inquiring mind really has made a cinematic masterpiece! 1917 will be remembered as one of the most, in the top three, best war movies ever made, with the protagonist Schofield losing his friend and ally, to reaching to his brother, in a certain amount of time under complete heavy fire.Surprisingly, Richard Madden is the brother, and its worth a wait for him to show up. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch nails his leadership skills with a two-minute one shot scene. These ambitious and incredible actors are able to pull off such talent with the little time they have left on screen. But with George MacKay running to send a message, IS the soldier in this one cinematic adventure adventure! There's hardly any fighting, which allows you to concentrate on MacKay (Schofield's) plan... and his plan works!The film is indescribably well-created, the beginning at a tree-to the ending to a tree. It's pure Oscar buzz, and the pressure engages the audience from the first tree to the last.Every trench, field, and house scene is pure cinema gold. It's absolute gold! With Schofield escaping every minute and time running out, you're money would've been worth spending.1917 is a masterpiece; Oscar material, a future classic, and the 2000s Saving Private Ryan.10/10"
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"The cinematography and acting is amazing.
the long shots tells the stories better than the dialogues!!
It also shows the emotional part of the stories so well"
1917,16 July 2021,10/10,"I went into this movie knowing that Sam Mendes can make really good movies and Roger Deakins is a master in cinematography. But I got absolutely smashed. The power of this movie, the suspense and the brilliant cinematography has absolutely blown my mind. Only a few days later I went to the cinema again, having the desire to experience this movie once again in theatre and in OV (I'm german, so englisch is not my mother tongue and I normally watch the german tranlated version first and after that the if I want to watch the movie a second time in the original englisch version). And both visits were hell of an cinema-experience I only had a few times in my life. So of course I immediately bought the Blu-Ray to have the audio-commentary by Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins because I just want to know more of the cinematography and the incredible shots and sequences created by Deakins and the power of suspense and the power a war-movie given to us by Sam Mendes. Masterpiece.**Sorry about the language. I'm not so good in english and I get very excited when talking about ""1917"" ;)"
1917,26 March 2020,4/10,Nothing happened... Ever! Guy trots thru stuff... Guy beez scurred!
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"This movie works on so many technical levels that it's a must see in theaters. This is the reason you go to the movies. I'm a sucker for the one-shot format and this movie is excellent at it.I do think this movie works because of the directing and cinematography. If the directing, cinematography, and one shot wouldn't have been there, I don't think this movie would even be talked about this year.The story is on the lighter side because it's about delivering a message. We've seen this before. The film comes alive with these master filmmakers doing what they do best!The only thing weird about this movie is when the soldier stumbled upon the mom and her baby. That entire scene seemed a little weird to me. It didn't seem to fit the movie for me.The Oscar slate is stacked this year but if you see any movie in theaters this Oscar season, this is the one to see."
1917,3 April 2020,7/10,Alright now this was a good movie but there are definitely some problems with it but we'll start with the good stuff obviously the directing was amazing by mr.sam Mendes I really enjoyed the concept of pretty much a 1 take film even though it's like 5 takes and I liked how they ended them like when the guy falls down the stairs the take ends then he wakes up to s firey blitz this movie had a whole lot of effort put into it to with all the action scenes alright the bad stuff this movie was pretty much only getting people to see it for the whole one take thing the story was not really the most investing of things near the end it feels a bit rushed to I didint like how his friend died so early it surprised me or they could of had some more bonding and chemistry for us to really know the characters before his offs one off because I was really enjoying their scenes together overall a good movie but im happy it didint get best picture at Oscars I would say good recommendation definitely should of seen it in theatres when it was out or I hope you have a good TV
1917,22 April 2020,9/10,"1917 won the Oscar for best cinematography and it 100% deserved it . It is action packed with great acting , great special effects . I really liked this film"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"There really isn't more I can say that others have already said other than just about every scene or encounter was suspenseful, and/or emotionally charged and or/ hauntingly touching. Excellent chemistry throughout the entire movie! This movie will touch you. See it!!!"
1917,12 January 2020,4/10,It really was a fairy tale. The Scofield fellow got mortal wounds all the time and made it fine nonetheless. His success in finding the troops he needed to find was unlikely in the real world. I would have been embarrassed to have written this movie and to have produced.
1917,10 March 2020,8/10,"1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019.Mitchell Bulfin"
1917,16 March 2020,7/10,"Honestly,One Shot is really cool, and the lens art is great, but its plot did not impress me deeply. After watching this movie, I only remember that long, well-conceived shot."
1917,28 January 2020,6/10,"If one already knew war is absurd, this movie will preach to the choir. If one did not know it, the movie will not convince otherwise. And, the First World War provides the most indisputable evidence of how absurd and pointless war can be.But this movie is unique in that the stars of the show are not the actors but, instead, the unbelievably amazing skill, organization, professionalism, care and technical filmmaking excellence required to pull-off a two-hour movie in what is two long takes. I think there were three takes with an unseen ""cut"" in the water halfway through the second half of the movie. There is an obvious ""cut"" near the 66-minute mark that goes to black for several seconds allowing for the next long shot to start ""hours later"" and a less obvious cut in the water around the 85-minute mark. But I cannot write enough, or stress the point enough, of how fantastically difficult this technical undertaking was and how brilliantly they pulled it off. The detail required and achieved, the flawless timing of camerawork versus action as it happens, takes the audience by the hand and never lets go.The flaw I find in all this is very simple. It's the question ""Why?"" Why is the one-shot necessary to the film? Is the technical excellence obscuring the fact that the story and the point are in fact rather mediocre? A great actor can take a mediocre script and turn it into a masterpiece. In this case, the actor, the star is not a human, but many humans, all behind the camera, delivering the film-making excellence that covers-up the mediocrity of the story. Yes, one has to find the courage to ask ""so what?"" even at the expense of lessening the overall hoopla this movie has generated."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"Meh at anyone who can rate this film low, I can tolerate difference of opinion but not blatant unfairness just because the viewer was having a bad day . Its an outstanding film and with outstanding performances from all. Its not an Hollywood special effects extravaganza but a realistic look at life, warts and all when faced with war.In amidst a time of loss and desperation 2 young soldier are given a huge task to carry out, for one of them its personal but it inspires the passion and endurance of the human spirit in both of them to face the sum of all fears even though the odds are hugely stacked against them. If you ever wanted to watch a real super hero film without the Hollywood special effects, this is it."
1917,19 March 2020,7/10,"Superb editing. Almost looks like a one-shot movie. Deserved at least a nomination in the Editing category at the Oscars. Roger Deakins' fascinating cinematography is a perfect treat for the eyes.Before the Oscars 2020 ceremony a large number of people was saying this film would win Best Picture. Well, in my opinion, this film is nowhere near to 'Parasite' in terms of story, score, direction and screenplay."
1917,11 May 2020,10/10,Beautiful film. Takes off from the start and doesn't let up. I was in tears several times. They don't make films like this anymore so seeing a picture like this is so refreshing.
1917,15 May 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes' 1917 is a masterclass of filmmaking. With an Oscar-winning director and every famous British actor in smaller roles, 1917 does something unprecedented in a genre filled with masterpieces. It manages to tell a fresh story with breathtaking bravura. Featuring impeccably executed tracking shots, amazing soundtrack and beautiful cinematography - courtesy of the legendary Roger Deakins - 1917 stands as arguably the best World War I film, as well as one of the best war films ever made.The element that makes this film so unique is the long tracking shots. The film is made to look like one continuous take. Thanks to modern CGI, there are unnoticeable cuts in the film. But the execution of the film cannot be understated. The long takes, the authenticity, and practical sets add so much realism and intensity to the story that they make every frame immensely gripping. Never has there been a film about war, with such incredible and ambitious camerawork like 1917. Films exist to show, not tell, what an experience would be like. They emphasize tricking the audience for a split second, making them think they are there too. 1917 manifests this near perfectly.A drawback to the tracking shot format is that it does not capture the whole scope of battle. The format makes the audience's vision into this world limited, albeit, that vision is still epic, and breathtaking nonetheless. A film that showcases a truly epic scope with edits to multiple camera angles is Dunkirk. Though that film would have felt more complete if CGI was used to enhance the background and further surroundings. The only real complaint is during the night city sequence, George Mackay's character is running from German gunfire. He zigzags and evades bullets. The aim of the German soldiers is unrealistically bad. Perhaps a case of stormtrooper aim, but in a film so dead set on authenticity and realism, this did require a suspension of disbelief, if only for a brief moment.Two scenes that illustrate the power of the filmmaking craft are the night window scene, and the running scene. These two scenes showcase that transportive and magical feeling that the cinema can provide. The night window scene features beautiful cinematography, breathtaking visuals, and an amazing score. When those three things come perfectly together, an operatic sensationalism floods the screen. The running scene may be the most epic running in cinematic history. Yes, even better than Forrest Gump and Tom Cruise. The build-up to the running felt as realistic as the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan. These were two truly magical scenes.1917 is movie magic. It captures the thrilling, intense, and awe-inspiring resplendent of war. It truly felt like we the audience were in this moment. 1917 is more than a gimmick, but a powerhouse of filmmaking and raw visceral power."
1917,16 February 2020,9/10,"A gripping war story based on the real life account of two World War I soldiers given orders to cross the battlefield into enemy territory to deliver a message to a commander unaware of the trap his 1600-man contingent is walking into.No cuts to other characters were used here. The focus was solely on the two soldiers and those they came into contact with along the way. Friend and foe alike. This gave a very real 'third person' feel to the experiences these men would have felt undertaking such an immensely important task.The scenes were captivating in the sense that the natural environments untouched by war were remarkably beautiful. Yet, their journey takes them through war-torn stretches of countryside which is anything but.On top of the experience of following the soldiers on their journey is the musical score. This set the mood for the peace and tranquility of the beautiful countryside, undertaking the burdens of responsibility and traversing the war-torn landscape littered by death and destruction.Not to mention that the characters were truly memorable. Just like the people we meet in real life. Each of their own uniqueness."
1917,29 January 2020,4/10,"It's very peculiar type movie , nothing is new in this movie."
1917,4 March 2020,9/10,"""1917"" (2019) is a stunning war drama within the frontlines of World War I. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:1917 is - as it has rightly been advertised as - a movie that's supposed to look as though it was taken in one shot. This causes an immersive experience that is very rarely found in mainstream movies, and because of this, it needs a very different approach and preparation.First thing first - the movie is absolutely gorgeous. Roger Deakins is in charge, so expect stunning cinematography and environments feeling both beautiful and raw. 1917 begs for the biggest screen around, and while at it, a powerful sound system to complete the experience with. Thomas Newman's score enhances the emotions and makes for an impactful viewing experience, further amplified by the great acting showcased from start to finish.Second, this is a big movie. It has stakes; it is intense, and it is psychologically raw enough to really hit at certain moments. It does feature violence and gore, but more so of corpses rather than other gore-heavy movies like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. Together with the plot - which does have a surprising depth and multiple interpretations - it might not be possible to take everything in at once. Certain plot elements along the way certainly has the power to make a second viewing just as powerful, if not even more.1917 does have some sore spots, though. At some points in the movie are a few details which can break the immersion in terms of logic and consistency. This would not be a big issue at all if not for the immersive qualities which makes it feel slightly more ""off"" than it would otherwise do, however, the movie does hint that the story at certain moments might not be told as objectively as first thought. If those moments are viewed more subjectively from the protagonists' point of view, those issues can fade away as those details are not likely to be expressively or accurately perceived in the heat of the moment.Another important factor is the sheer force of the movie, which might also feel uncomfortable at moments, but then again, it is a big movie. Almost too authentic, it creeps under your skin, it grows on you, and it stays with you emotionally long after it has ended.And rightfully so.My personal grade: a forceful 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
1917,28 September 2020,10/10,"1917 is the prime example of any great war flick. It's quick to join Letters from Iwo Jima, Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket as one of the greats. It's one of the best technically minded movies of the year, with some of the most amazing cinematography and camerawork around, great locations, production and set design, special effects and sound editing. Roger Deakins is the best living cinematographer right now, and everyone should be kissing the ground the man walks on. Sam Mendes pulls off an almost impossible feat of a single-take war film, and while has its trickery and smoothness, it's still an amazing accomplishment, and you're left wondering how the heck they pulled everything off. A great cast peppered throughout, and the two leads deserve all the credit for pulling the entire film. It's a rather simple story like Saving Private Ryan and it feels too long since we got a good WW1 movie. It's in a league of its own, pushing forward the technical aspects and focusing on the big epic spectacle of a war movie. It's quite something to witness in the biggest theater you can with the best surround sound system. Don't even think about watching it on your phone."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Beautiful, haunting, breathless, nervy, eye-catching, terrific movie. One for the ages.I gave it nine stars because no movie is without flaws but it deserves ten."
1917,8 March 2020,10/10,"A great movie will leave you with a feeling, an experience, a moment on screen that's etched deep in your memory and stays with you forever. A scene or two where your heart rate rapidly increases or tears feel up your eyes. A score that matches perfectly with what is being portrayed on screen.In Lord of the Rings, it's the 'Wolves of Isengard' scene.In Fight Club, it's the final explosion scene.In 300, it's the slow motion fight scenes.In Godfather, it's the final shot.In The Dark Knight, it's the voice over of Gordon while Batman is making a run for it.In The Matrix, it's the 'he is the one' scene.In Braveheart, it's the 'Freedom' shout scene.In Joker, it's the scene where he is cheered by the mob and he gives a bloody smile.In Private Ryan, it's the final battle scenes where the heroes make their last stand.In Kingdom of Heaven, it's the 'surrendering of Jerusalem' scene.In Terminator 2, it's the 'robot self terminate' scene.In Drive, it's the final scene.1917 is a great movie. Enough said."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"One of my most anticipated films of 2019 was 1917. What makes this film so grand is it's emotional power, technical innovation, and unforgettable attention to detail. What has attracted so many audiences is the camerawork. The camerawork has been praised so much it might seem like overselling it. If anything, we're underselling it. It is designed as two extraordinarily long, unbroken shots. It puts you directly into the film as though you're the third person in the mission. But this film does something very special and that is how you often forget about the ""gimmick"" because of the masterful story and the tour de force, starmaking performance from George MacKay who brings so much physicality and emotion to each and every sequence in the film.The writing is straight forward. It's about two British soldiers' treacherous mission across enemy lines in France. It excels in realizing its scenario with each set piece. Simple and straight forward to be sure, but shows how to do simple and straight forward the right way.The technical work is outstanding work all across the board. The sound, the visual effects, and of course the sheer size, detail and greatness of the production design. It's amazing work throughout such as the mine, No Man's Land, or the destroyed town. Beautiful stuff. The cinematography is one of Deakins' greatest achievements. It brings you into every shot. Every shot that is so gorgeous in its visual details of so many kinds. I mean he has amazing scenes of the grey No Man's Land, he also somehow finds the most photogenic way to show foxhole gridlock, it is fascinating. He creates just one painting after another He creates a beauty to every time or type of day. The shot of the changing flares/bombed out city is one of the greatest shots of all time and in itself is worthy of an Oscar win.The score might be one of the most underrated aspects of the film. It's tremendous and it's Newman's crowning achievement.This in creating such gorgeous pieces of work, that does definitely owe a debt to Zimmer's work for Thin Red Line and Dunkirk, making use of every bit of his orchestra. This in creating work essential to each scene in building the tension of every sequence, while also just being incredibly beautifully grand pieces on their own.Sam Mendes does not waste one thing at his disposal. Everything matters. Everything clicked.. Whether it be the production design, Deakins, the sound, the score, the effects and even the editing that makes it all invisible. This is a must watch for fans of Mendes, war films, or just great movies in general. It brought me chills and left my mouth wide open several times. Anything short of an Oscar would be a disservice. I can't wait to watch it again."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"I met extras who worked on it last summer and heard many great things about it, and it is good how they made it so quick.Soldiers walking out in the open really irritated me, not that I am a war expert.There was an electronic music cue at the start I felt was out of place and then I was mad because I had already ordered the soundtrack, but the score got much better.Some of the soldiers were considerably older than I would have thought, but I am no expert on the era. Chubbier faces than would be there I am sure.Otherwise I loved it and will see it again in a week or two."
1917,19 January 2020,4/10,"A boring movie about two guys having discussions while walking through trenches and the camera is just in front of them. Great.. it doesn't show the grittiness and gruesomeness of the First World War at all and the plot makes no sense while the main actors survive explosions in a tunnel with their plot armor.
If you like art style boring movies and want to feel like a critic this is for you. If you like action/war entertaining movies this is not for you."
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,Amazing cinematography. Amazing plot. Cast was great. Really puts you in the think of it. I love tense movies like this. The fact that it is based on a war many don't really know too much about is great. One thing I wonder though is what happened to that beautiful French woman and the baby...? Great movie overall! I highly recommend it. It's like saving private Ryan but for wwi.
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"Try and see it on the big screen. The 'one continuous shot' method works very well thru the trenches but is probably not necessary elsewhere, apart from a few chase scenes. I came out of the theatre feeling overwhelmed but found I'd just about forgotten the film by the next day. Why was that? Because you never actually make an emotional connection with the main characters. Actually, there is no real character development. It's gripping at times but more a case of style over substance - worth it just for the style though."
1917,12 February 2021,10/10,"There have been some incredible war films in the past, 'Saving Private Ryan', 'All Quiet On The Western Front' and of course 'Schindler's List' but the 2019 release, both written and directed by Sam Mendes, '1917' is easily one of the best.
George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman star as two soldiers in the middle of World War 1, who are sent across enemy lines, and deep into enemy territory, to deliver an urgent message that will result in the saving of 1600 lives.
My first mention has to go to cinematographer Roger Deakins. This is an outstandingly beautifully shot movie. It has been filmed to look like one continuous shot, following these two soldiers through a war.
Obviously, there are moments in the film where I'm sure cuts were made, darkness obscures the screen for a moment, but despite that, this is a massive technical achievement and the brilliance of it can not be ignored. As they progress from the open graveyard of no man's land to the abandoned but still dangerous German trenches, the unexpected fallout from a dogfight to a burning town in the dead of night, most audiences will quickly stop thinking about the technique at play and simply give themselves over, entirely, to this journey into hell.
The production, costume and pace of the film are simply perfect. It takes you along on their mission as if you are with them and there are some seriously edgy moments too.
The thing I loved about the film, well one of the things I loved about the film, is the feeling of 'realism'. It isn't a sweet, sentimental, predictable jaunt, it's full of problems for these guys. They come across trip-wires underground, deserted villages where you're not sure if they are actually deserted. It's seriously nerve-wracking, you never feel like they're safe, this is done so well in this film, they always feel like there's someone just around the corner.
One sequence, in particular, is so intense. One of the characters is running through this rubble and flares are going off, and gunfire can be heard in the background and you think at any second, one of these bullets could hit this guy, and the music is rising, along with the tension, it is 'edge of your seat' stuff.
The acting is, well simply outstanding. Director Sam Mendes wanted to make sure the lead characters were not 'big names' and relatively unknowns and this was an excellent choice as it made you care more about the actual characters.
There are a few 'names' as cameos, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Andrew Scott make appearances but it's the leads that you invest in.The direction from Mendes is exceptional. The score from Thomas Newman, who has scored films for Sam Mendes before, including 'Road To Perdition', 'Skyfall' and 'American Beauty' to name a few, is so good in this film.
The visual effects are incredible.
If I had any 'niggles' it would be that the character development of the leads was a touch weak, and as much as you are invested in what's happening you don't care as much as you could.
This is a remarkable film though, and with all, it's technical brilliance, it's amazing acting, atmosphere, tension and incredible visuals the 'niggle' I had is insignificant.
Easily one of the best films I have seen in a very long time."
1917,10 February 2020,5/10,"As stated in the title, the camera work is very good but the movie is spoiled by some unbelievably stupid plot twists. I don't want to ruin the review by adding spoilers but just give the movie a look (it is watchable because of the great camera work) then, as it progresses watch all of the things that happen which defy logic, from the truly implausible to the comic. It ruined what could have been a great movie."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Ever since I've watched ""American Beauty"", the directorial debut/beginners luck charm of director Sam Mendes; I've trusted the craftmanship of his films to be top-notch even if the stories aren't as strong (""Jarhead"", ""Spectre""). How does ""1917"" currently hold up?This film gives us a fly on the wall perspective of a couple of days during World War One (a war that's rarely touched upon in mainstream films). Two British soldiers Will Schofield and Tom Blake must race against a time to hand-deliver a message to a fellow bettalion in order to save them from impending doom by German enemy forces.This has been touched upon by everyone who knows about this film; but I can't help but mention how making this film look like one take is done masterfully, helping it stand out from other well known/recent war movies.Those who were disappointed by the lack of characterization in 2017's World War Two juggernaut ""Dunkirk""; no need to worry because the two main characters are upheld by their charming chemistry and bravery against all odds. Other ally soldiers, supporting characters and special cameos weave in and out of their journey for a short amount of time; but are unforgettable.Standing among my top 10 for 2019, ""1917"" is also one of the best of the decade.Grade- A"
1917,9 January 2020,8/10,"It features a realistic portrayal of a true remarkable story following the appalling journey of two soldiers having to call off the attack against Germany.1917 is a massive technical achievement done right. The camera tracks this pair of individuals with a smooth good-looking one continuous shot for 110 mins! Despite it's not exactly one shot, the slick technique where it manages to trick the audience's eyes when a one shot jumps from the other is brilliant.Cinematography is riveting to the eyes. There are so many important close-ups that picture a thousand words of these two soldiers about their past and their emotional trauma of the World War 1 effect. The better thing is it knows when to pull back from those close-ups to reveal the true scale of the horrendous and the shock of the battlefield.Immersively done, 1917 sucks you into the sheer horror of experiencing the daunting moments of World War 1. You will feel as if you are walking with these men.1917 is a highly suspenseful film from the front 'till the end of the line. I can assure you, the intensity is greater than 90% horror movies in the last decade. Sam Mendes escalates the tense atmosphere little by little before he uncovers everything in the final 20 minutes.The set feels very much like a breath of air back in the early 1900s. It is unrelenting seeing objects, locations and soldiers are bombed into pieces, excellently enhanced by how specific the layouts are to justify the maddening era of bloodbath.Though feels gimmicky, the music projects a powerful influence in increasing the gritty war moments and giving the sense that every scene should be appreciated as much as possible.George Mackay & Dean Chapman's performances are great however, I wish they could give more. The former expresses his raw emotions clearly but sometimes, he falls flat and the latter's way of characters feels quite unbelievable due to Chapman's failure to construct expressions that is substantially connected to the impacts of war. For mega-awards like Golden Globe & Oscar, the lack of creativity to create nuances details on their face, resulted in them not nominated for Best Actor/Supporting Actor.1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non-stopping war shootings genre. The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.1917 also hurts by putting in dialogues that does not drive the story further, but only to give a sense of what personality the characters embody.Verdict: 1917 is a warfare that feels immersive and nerve-wracking with its glorious cinematography and visual designs however, it occasionally steps into the landmines which is forgivable as the whole movie transmits an experience that is substantially novelty and worth living for."
1917,1 April 2020,10/10,"WOW! What a brilliant movie. Every second and scene in this movie is intense and valuable. Every face you see tells a story. What a amazing cinematography as well. All the cast played their parts amazingly.This movie is one of the best war movies I have seen.Somehow this movie reminds me of Dunkirk.Not that they have similar stories, but somehow it reminds me of that movie.
Be brave, be determined, never give up and keep on going. These are words I would describe this movie as. Everyone should watch this incredible movie. Truly a moving, sad and a beautiful movie."
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"The best film for a long time, well filmed good script, good actors, no left wing woke snowflake crap in it."
1917,17 September 2021,5/10,"Or Saving Private Ryan meets Apocalypse Now.Surprisingly low on action/gore for a war movie. Not that I need gore or anything, it's just surprising considering today's standards. This is like Dunkirk only more surreal. That's not a compliment. Dog fights aside Dunkirk was mostly forgettable.Low on story/interesting characters. To be honest, when that soldier died I was quite relieved because he talked so much up until that point and nothing he said was either interesting
Or amusing. I was grateful for the relative peace and quiet.Surreal and bizarre. Someone takes a booby trap mine full in the face and is in one piece.I didn't see the point in it. It wasn't original as it straight up rips off Saving PR. There was no story. No character development. No 'moral' if you like. It just seemed like a personal tribute to Sam Mendes' antecedent and the stories he told. That's great for Sam but what about the rest of us. This is not a film I'd watch again.PS - note to filmmakers: I don't care about single-take camera shots. I have never watched a movie and thought 'wow that single-take shot was great'. I do, however, care about good story/character development. And I have often watched a film and thought, 'wow, that was a great story with some great character development.'"
1917,4 June 2020,10/10,"I cannot say enough good things about this film. I've watched it twice in the last three days and could watch it again right now. It's that good.While the trailer made it look enticing, I thought this would just be another lauded film that I ultimately found to be boring. I couldn't have been more wrong.The camera work alone is incredible. Many films have done the ""one shot"" gimmick but here it is superbly done. At times you completely forget that you've been watching a continuous take (and you stop looking for the hidden cuts). The way the camera moves is so impressive and you are continuously engaged. Before I watched this I thought, ""How can this movie be a continuous shot and everything happens in just two hours?"" But somehow it just worked. I can't imagine how much hard work was put into this movie, but it was worth it and totally paid off. And Thomas Newman's score is absolute perfection.I admittedly am not a fan of war-related movies for the sole reason of how uncomfortable they make me. I don't do realistic, brutal violence and suffering. But 1917 is not your typical war movie. While it does show the horrors of war it doesn't base its story on that. Instead you have a dramatic thriller of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, rooting for the hero. Even when the pace slows down it's never for long, as time is of the essence. Also, the acting goes above and beyond here. I can only imagine how grueling it was to be in such a physically demanding role. Running, climbing, jumping, shooting, etc. for such long shots over and over. Everyone must have been exhausted.I truly think 1917 is epic and is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's been so long since I've watched a movie that I didn't feel was a waste of time.I wish I could personally thank everyone involved in the making of this."
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"1917 is art. It's that simple. It's art. From the opening shot to the last, not one second is boring, or unnecessary, or anything less than masterful. The horrors and beauty of war are all expertly shown, without feeling sentimental or cliche in any way, which was an achievement in its own. The cinematography was, obviously, a true marvel, with a gorgeous soundtrack to accompany this composition of cinema. The story switches seamlessly from loud, intense, and anxiety inducing, to quiet, reflective, and almost tender at times. 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan was to WWII, and is one of the best movies ever made. I can't lie, with the majority of movies and shows nowadays being absolute trash, like the new marvel movies, or shows like Batwoman, it is movies like this that still give me hope, that there will always still be some directors and writers that actually care about telling a story, without feminism or sjw nonsense to get in the way. This memorizing composition is a true work of art, and I give it a full 10/10 stars."
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"Nothing could prepare you for the beauty, fear and the picture painted here Medes direction, Newman's score. Deakin's fantastical cinematrography shine like the brightest stars in the sky. The performnaces of the leads are wonderful and MacKay deserved an Oscar nod at least. However. the honesty and true emotional core is its greatest strength. This is truly one of the greatest films of war (not a war film) ever made. Beautiful, horrifying, terrifying and upliftingly emotional. It is an astounding achievement."
1917,8 November 2020,2/10,2 takes for the entire movie? So what !I can hold my breath for 30 seconds and hum the Ride of the Valkyrie. So there !Nonsense.The movie ended in an unexpected abruptness I found annoying.The footage and authenticity were decent. Storyline was blah.On the whole not worth the time. Much ado about nothing.
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I'm positive they watched a different movie because this movie is a great achievement and the greatest war movie since Saving Private Ryan.I've read a few reviews that say the one shot style is a gimmick and I 100% disagree. The one shot style draws you into the story like nothing else. You are there the whole time with these 2 men in one of the worst times in history. The level of tension you feel the whole time wondering if a sniper is going to take them out or they get shot by a random German at any time is why it works.You feel the emotion as they do, the tragedy, the sorrow and everything else that happened along the way. Personally, a movie is a great movie if it can move you emotionally. This movie moved me many many times.Once the movie finished, we all just sat there in silence while we thought over what we had just seen. I know war is hell and I know WWI was way worse than what we saw. But that doesn't take anything away from the masterpiece that is 1917.Thank you to all who made this and to the great men that fought and sacrificed their lives for our freedom."
1917,12 January 2020,6/10,"Much has been made of 1917's cinematography which, through very skilful editing, makes it appear that the film is shot in one continuous track. It's done extremely well, although there is a very clear, deliberate and unambiguous break slightly over halfway through.1917 is the latest film from director Sam Mendes, who co-wrote the script with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Its story is of World War 1 lance corporals Schofield and Blake (George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman) who are commanded by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to run a message to a battalion of 1,600 men to call off an attack the following morning which will result in their massacre.The film takes on the character of a portmanteau piece as the two messengers run into each episodic scene before moving on to the next one. Some of these scenes work better than others. And it has the drawback of too many shallow cameos from actors unable to bring any depth to their part. The one exception to this is the excellent Mark Strong as a gruffly benevolent and politically-savvy captain who clearly knows the best way to keep his men alive is by being supremely efficient at his job.The plot has soap opera elements to it - lance corporal Blake is told his brother's one of those about to be slaughtered. And there's plenty of contrived happenstance; suspension of disbelief is sorely tested more than once. The lingering doubt that the mode of delivering the message isn't perhaps the first option that would come to mind is never really dispelled. But perhaps the film's main failing is its emotional sterility, only at the end is it moving.Sir Sam is a director of deserved renown whose two recent films for the Bond franchise, Skyfall and Spectre, are amongst the best of that canon. And his skill as a director is shown in 1917; despite the negatives it remains a film with some great merit. I feel Sir Sam has simply allowed technical wizardry and the bait of Oscars to take precedent over storytelling. He's a good filmmaker. He has more good work inside him."
1917,27 June 2021,10/10,"I can't even express my rapture while watching this awesome piece of work! Roger Deakins did a hell of a work! In fact, one of the most noticeable things in this movie was editing! It seemed like the whole film was endless without any other correction! It's so impressive and authentic depiction of the nature of war. This picture was permeated with terrible affliction, constant rivalry, eternal losses and living in an ineffable fear. Sam Mendes nailed it!"
1917,17 May 2020,8/10,"Cinematography masterpiece. Makes you think about the luxury world we live in, and how our forefathers were dying in the trenches so we can now have this luxury world...If you're expecting epic battle scenes as in ""Saving Private Ryan"" - you will get disappointed. This film has different approach, and despite some flaws - it presents the hell of the frontline very well and keeps your attention on the screen.Simply amazing how they did it, never seen so technically complex film done in one shot.My rating: 8/10"
1917,5 July 2020,9/10,"I loved this film, had me riveted from the start, to the unending end. Twice characters got into trouble for not immediately killing an enemy. Is this to show that they still have their humanity intact, or are they just ignorant? And that cow didn't milk itself. I expected a farmer to jump out at any moment. Anyway, this is another film showing how, through out history, men are inhuman to other men in war. Fascinating, but such a shame. Robert E. Lee supposedly said ""It is well that war is so terrible, otherwise we should grow too fond of it."" Well, I'm fond of a good war movie, that shows the extremes of human behavior, both good and bad. And this film is extremely well done."
1917,5 January 2021,10/10,Poignant. Harrowing. A film that describes what true horror WW1 was.
1917,10 January 2020,5/10,"If you want to use relative unknowns in your film, do not then litter some Hollywood heavy-hitters in bit parts through out the film. Be brave and go with a complete cast of ""unknowns"". Don't just throw in Benedict, Mark Storm and others as it serves no purpose other than to pull the audience from the film. Not that it's a problem here because, the film isn't exactly brilliant anyway... Stilted dialogue, some shoddy performances, lacklustre music and what we have here is nothing more than a technical masterpiece because, credit where it is due, it IS that.The film looks as though it is shot in one take, which is great. It pulls you along with the soldiers charged with a mission and you see what they go through and the horrors that surround them but - after 20 minutes, we get it. We've seen it. The film is nothing more than a one trick pony. A disappointing one trick pony baiting the award season (fair enough I understand ""Best Director"" but ""Best Picture""???) This film is NOT the Best Picture by a long shot. To call it that is an insult to the other films which have better messages, better stories and have already broken records with monies taken.The biggest problem with this film is, you just do not care about anyone. Literally anyone. The two leads have little character about them and nothing to really endear you to them (hardly surprising given where they find themselves) so when they're in danger - who cares? The people they're going to try and deliver a message to? Again, we don't care. No one really shows compassion (again,, hardly surprising given the circumstances); everyone is aggressive, grumpy, miserable and so - why should we care about them?!I regret this film."
1917,14 July 2020,1/10,I did not even want to give this movie one star. It is SO BORING. NOTHING HAPPENS. NO ACTION AT ALL. Thank god i only paid 1.80 to rent it. I could of bought a pack of gum instead. Would of been more satisfying
1917,27 March 2020,10/10,This movie is beautiful and shocking. I feel the cruelty of the war.I hope there is only peace and no war in the world.
1917,25 May 2020,1/10,"From the narrative to the acting it was horrible,
The direction of the camera seemed like a video game
Didn't seem authentic what so ever, as a history buff I was very disappointed, I was hoping to a sequel of saving private Ryan wich was a master piece. This seemed like a HBO series of band of brothers
The starting actors didn't seem believable and their up to date haircut wouldn't match to ww1 typical soldier they were to clean cut. One of my least favorite war movies I've ever seen.
The attention to detail was mediocre, for people to rare this a high score, tells me they wouldn't know from a good movie to a bad one if their life depended on it."
1917,22 March 2020,8/10,"Film has won the best cinematography award in Oscars 2020. I would also unanimously agree on that as it is a real treat for the eyes. Camera work , Angles , Colors and Scenes are really top notch. Change of one scene to another was perfectly handled without becoming a harassment to the viewer's eyes. Most of the films does not have this much of beautiful pictures unveiling in front of your screen which is again reminds me of the commendable work by Roger Deakins.Back ground music is another great aspect of this film. It kept edge of the seat every time and added that little sense of suspense to every scene. It is not too much and not barren as well.Story line is a basic one which does not have a huge amount of depth. So it will not have all the elements at the right place to become an epic . There are no twists and turns in the story and one could imagine what would happen right after 10-15 mins from the start. Director should be able to relate the story in a more cinematographic way. But this is a flat story in a movie perspective.Acting is average and I cannot stop comparing Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan with these new actors. Yes it is bit unfair. But I see that is the bar they have to touch. It is set at a great height but these actors should try to get close to that.Film is not a treat to watch as it depicts the sorrow, uncertainty and brutality of war. But it rather signifies the sacrifice made by the front line soldiers who are fighting this war. It also invokes the discussion of power struggle in the world which lead to these wars , humans killing humans. We , Humans , are the ones who make our own graves."
1917,20 January 2020,4/10,"This was as Boring with virtually no battle scenes as Dunkirk. I take it back, Dunkirk had more action. Hollyweird can't do a good war film anymore. Always an overload of unnecessary drama."
1917,8 January 2020,9/10,"I have a lot of hesitation about films that try the ""one long take"" thing. Often it comes across as a gimmick that doesn't do anything for the story. And they usually suffer from poor pacing as the characters have to spend half their time just walking from place to place. But this film really pulls it off well. It's briskly paced, and very exciting. The central performances are all really solid. And the production design and cinematography are outstanding. It a gorgeous movie to look at, and well worth experiencing on a big screen."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,What a powerful film! This movie is so well done... you really feel like you are there with the characters as they go out on their journey.. not sure if they will make it. Every level of the film is just masterful. Actors were all great.. but the way the story was told it's just so powerful. Looks simple.. but so much work must have gone in to pull that all off. Just flows so well and you are in the story from the beginning to the end.I'd vote for it for Best Picture for sure! So well done... congrats!
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"I haven't seen tension this good since Sicario's crossing the border scene. Most horror movies lack the tension this film punches.To be more specific, the movie gives payoff. Where most films middle about in the carrot-on-a-stick, promising things that never play out, 1917 actually delivers. You're never quite sure what will happen because the movie actually makes things happen.Furthermore, though you're rather sure the mission will be accomplished, you're not quite sure how. There's a genuine fear that they might not make it in time - something that isn't just a timetable issue like most films with a clock, but an actual fear.All in all, it was great. Well acted, fantastically shot, excellently paced, and masterfully told."
1917,4 February 2020,8/10,"Interesting concept of shooting in as few takes as possible, and definitely a technological feat, that works pretty well and contributes to the immersion. That being said, there were certain points where I feel the film could've used some cuts (those sharp turns in the trenches were fuggen' rough, bro.)I'm thoroughly impressed at the insane scale of the set they built, and therefore the fact that we never see a location twice.The character pulls some real BS ""i'm the protagonist, so I live"", which irked me a little bit. But alas, twas still solid!the acting was excellent, definitely helped move me while watching it.Music was somewhat overbearing at times, but otherwise did the job.Spicy film. Worth watching."
1917,17 January 2021,7/10,"I saw only 2 things in the entire film that were accurate: heavy, non-stop smoking by the soldiers, and leather dog tags.
Absolutely every other aspect of the military, and warfare, was inaccurate at best, and supremely stupid at worst. But the director-writer has no experience in uniform, even though he based the movie on tales his grandfather told him.
That said, the soundtrack is terrific, the cinematography superb, and the acting and directing excellent. The movie looks and sounds great! It does its intended purpose of pulling at the heart of viewers and honoring the soldiers who bravely fought, endured incredible hardship, and often died in order to provide the life and freedoms we enjoy today because of their sacrifice.
I would have rated it higher if only it showed what military service - and war - is actually like, thereby rising above a cliche-ridden fairy tale and allowing the audience to experience a semblance of the horror. A movie like Dunkirk or Saving Private Ryan did the job much better."
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"Nicely directed and edited. Fine acting and camera work. The set design was wonderful. The story was Swiss cheese.I enjoyed 1917, but I wasn't blown away by the film. Mendes is a wonderful director and I'll pay to see his work any day of the week. All that being said, he cheated. The one shot gimmick was used well. They managed to hide the cuts in post and in camera. I was impressed. Then Mendes cheated. He had the character lose consciousness, fade to black, fade into several hours later. This could have easily been avoided if the characters just left hours later in the day.As for the story, well, it's pretty straight forward - Guy must deliver a message before it's too late. Not much room for anything else. Yet, we still ended up with the usual war movie tropes. I found myself rolling my eyes at times. Additionally, there was a poor use of time and space in the film.It wasn't enough to make me dislike the film, but this is not a Best Picture or Best Director. Maybe Best Production Design. Maybe Best Editing. However, there are far more superior films nominated. 1917 is worth a look in the theater, but don't go in with big expectations. The 10 and 1 reviews are out of their minds."
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,I enjoyed the film..due to it being in ww1. I appreciate what it was aiming for. Some of it was pretty engaging but it's not a masterpiece. Reminded me more of a really expensive well shot BBC drama.Don't get me wrong it was ok to watch I wouldn't call it Oscar worthy though
1917,1 May 2020,9/10,"As far as war movies goes...But I feel like it is LOTR, where instead of sending the ring to the mount of mordor, it is sending a message to an army general asking them to stop running into a trap.Storyline is some what similar - on their journey, one of them were killed. Much like when Frodo were stung by the giant spider.Overall entertaining. Worth to watch."
1917,4 May 2020,8/10,"Although ""1917"" is nominally a war film, it does not contain any political tendencies. It can be simply understood as a story of ""stopping the war"" and ""saving people"" after all the hardships. From this perspective, the film has a positive significance"
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"I have been an avid WWI history buff since I was an undergrad. I have felt that the horrors of this war were often overlooked and never found interesting to the public. Enter Sam Mendes.His grandfather was in WWI and used to tell him the stories of the war. I am a frequent critics of movies, rarely finding them of value, but this film was amazing. It follows the two young Lance Corporals as they occur. It's intense and gripping. You will not be disappointed."
1917,15 January 2021,10/10,"You don't have to be a fan of war movies to appreciate thisThe single shot movie from start to finish is nothing short of majesticThe closest thing I've seen to this is a 15 min opening fight scene In JCVDThis is just amazingThe rehearsal and choreography that must have gone into this earn it a 10/10 for meIt just so happens to be a fantastic story and movie as well
Awesome"
1917,8 August 2020,4/10,"A very cliche film and one where the novelty soon wears off and you start to pick holes in the story/casting direction (there were no black serving with any front line british unit), the soy boy nature of the main characters etc.Overall not great"
1917,5 February 2020,7/10,"With all the noise that critics made for this movie I had to see it, and let me tell you upfront, I got a bit dissapointed.Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. It has great acting and the continuous shoot provides a fresh technical aspect, but all in all it's a story we have already seen (in one form or the other). The pace lets no room for character development, so you don't get to actually care for them, which I think is important in this kind of movie.Would I recommend it? Probably. Would I see it again? I doubt it."
1917,13 February 2020,8/10,I like how the camera follows the actors throughout the movie non-stop. And thumbs up to George Mackay who managed to carry the story flawlessly.
1917,26 February 2021,10/10,This is a movie you will watch over and over . The Ballad will haunt you. It is a movie full of realism depicting an overlooked War when it comes to good theater. The brutality is struck home in the scenes of no mans land and the river. The River also sets a haunting prelude to the end of the movie.
1917,16 May 2020,10/10,"Can't say anything bad about it, maybe have a little too much away in the trailers but what a film."
1917,3 April 2020,9/10,"I enjoy a good war film once in a while, in fact some of them end up becoming favorites of mine (Apocalypse Now, Ran, Tae Guk Gi, Platoon, etc). Sam Mendes initially got the idea to do a World War I film after hearing war stories from his grandfather Alfred, who had been a runner in the British army during the war. Not many films have been made about the First World War, as destructive as it was it was later overshadowed by its even more destructive successor. There have certainly been a few, like Peter Weir's Gallipoli and Paul Gross' Passchendaele, itself an under-appreciated effort, that come to mind. But none have managed to reach the mainstream like 1917 has managed to, with big names like Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins being a part of the project. But man does it work.While Deakins' cinematography has received the most attention, an aspect of the film that I found being underplayed would be the phenomenal acting from the cast. In particular, we have George MacKay carrying the film through his magnificent performance, I might go as far as saying this might be one of my favorite performances that I have managed to see this year. One moment in particular shows Mackay's character sitting in a truck reeling over what has happened to him as of this far and the raw emotion that he shows on his face conveys everything that he's going through and it was magnificent. We also get appearances from other actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Game of Thrones' Richard Madden, and a nearly unrecognizable Colin Firth (I say nearly, as his voice gives him away), though there's not much to talk about in terms of their characters or performances. MacKay's character is the focus, as it is his story that we follow throughout the film. Another aspect of the film that has been overlooked is its masterful handling of suspense and tension, there are plenty of scenes throughout the film that drip with tension throughout the entirety of the film. If I recall correctly Chris Stuckmann mentioned that the film takes from the so called 'Breaking Bad handbook' that things go wrong a lot during the film, and I would agree with that statement.If I didn't talk about the cinematography from the great Roger Deakins then I wouldn't be able to get away with this review. While I thought that the one shot gimmick was quite pretentious in Birdman, it works well in the context of this film. There are visual nods to other war films, in particular Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. It also goes to show that Deakins is the most accomplished cinematographer working in Hollywood today, his composure of shots throughout the film have a truly eyegasmic quality to them, particularly during the nighttime scene.No film is perfect...well maybe there's a few, but that's an entirely different conversation for another time. The point that I'm trying to make is that this film has problems, as many films do. My main issue with the film is the lack of proper characterization. Sure, the characters do have personalities that we see throughout the film, but I did want a little more from them. That being said, the physical acting from MacKey speaks more than words could ever put. His actions and drive to keep living is what determines his character, and there is something to be admired about it.1917 is a dark film, but there is still hope and light that can be found within it. It's a love letter to the countless men who gave their lives without becoming gimmicky as some other films can do."
1917,27 March 2020,7/10,The filming of the movie was so unique and well done. i enjoyed it
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,I watched 1917 yesterday and I gotta admit I am delighted. Loved it!
1917,29 March 2020,8/10,One of the most unique films I've ever seen which is a compliment it's so hard for a war movie to stand out from the rest. The best cinematography I have ever seen and it rightfully earned an oscar for it. Amazing performances by every actor. Very tense and keeps you biting your nails on the edge of your seat. A must watch.
1917,30 December 2019,2/10,"I don't care if the story is good. If a bomb blasts right beside you and you don't even shake/move, you do not deserve a decent rating or an Oscar nom.Besides, this seems sorta like a remake of Idi, Smotri."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"This is one of those war films that is truly different from the others, having watched JoJo Rabbit the other day & then watching 1917, it totally changes your view on what war films can or cant be about, where as JoJo Rabbit had comedy in it along with some dark moments, 1917 was all grit & dark from the get go. The film is visually & musically simple but simple in a way that is really good at portraying war in a dark way, theres no crazy upbeat music, theres no cool camera angels or slo mo to change the picture, the way the film was made to look like it was done in one shot is really smart & cool, because it follows the soldiers every move while panning through the various trenches, looking past everyone that is there, waiting for a attack, waiting for next orders, everyone just waiting for that next uncertain move & that is what gives the picture such a beautiful presence. throughout the film. The camera work is spot on at showing the surrounding effects war has had on the land, whether its panning in on people buried under mud that have died, or birds pecking at a corpse or even the ton of barbed wire that is blocking the way with dead people stuck in them, or just the insane amount of mud. It's really obvious where they had to cut the film in places for obvious reasons but that doesn't matter.The film its self is based on a true story which is incredible that the message actually got through to the other regiment to stop the attack to save countless lives, it just proves how important & vital things were back then & how anything & everything was set out to stop the message being delivered yet some how, with everything in the way & all the chances they could of died along the way, they managed to succeed, along with this & all the other messages that are sent in the war, it makes you really think that how on earth did they do it.The film really does keep you on edge throughout the whole film because it keeps saying to you that every move is uncertain, you are literally wanting them to win & stay alive. At one point a nazi plane gets shot down & crash lands near the protagonists, then they proceed to help the nazi solider get out of the plane but you know what is going to happen, it blatantly shows a knife on the nazi solider & that he going to stab the English soldiers, i literally sighed & shook my head because it was so obvious that one of the English soldiers was going to die, now yes that may be the real part of the story but in normal films its normally a cheap way to get rid of someone so it kinda bugged me but it was real so whatever.Overall though it is a brilliant film & 100% worth watching & also do watch in 2D iMAX because the picture is way more filling that what it would be on a normal size cinema screen so it can give you the most effect while watching the film.Age - 25

1917,13 February 2021,8/10,"The cruelty of that German warrior who stabbed the chest of the one who rescued him and gave him water without looking like an enemy when he was glowing from a crashed aircraft !! Victory in war is crazy excitement.World War I was raging. 1917 April 6. German troops withdraw from the front lines in northern France.
Knowing this, the British forces in the Allied forces planned to attack the German army at the right time. But the German army did not actually retreat.
That move was a great trap they set for their enemies. It was too late for the British army to realize this.
The proposal to attack the German army was gone. All telephone landlines were cut off during the war.
Thus, two British soldiers were assigned to rescue 1600 soldiers from the death trap. William Schofield and Tom Blake.
Tom's brother Joseph Blake was one of those 1600 soldiers.
They both set out to meet Colonel McKenzie, in charge of the Second Battalion, with the General's letter, ""Retreat from attacking the German army.""
The camera goes with it.
Putting a war movie in one shot, In a single word this was the movie. I can say and editing by Lee Smith was amazing.
But it was the talent of director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Dickens who never compromised on its frames or anything."
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"Hollywood and their artsy fartsy gay means can go straight to hell!!! They play favorites and pick whom they want, and rarely have the best movie win THE BEST PICTURE!!!! It's happened on numerous occasions and they still have not learned... But without question, this was the best movie of 2019..... It was brilliantly made and shows true courage.... and EVERYONE should watch this and enjoy this masterpiece!!!"
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,I LOVED this film and everything about it.. I got lost in it and there were several times my eyes would start burning and I had to remind myself to blink.. The cinematography was absolutely amazing and I thought it was well written.. For those who rated it a 3 your either a German or I think you watched 1918 because you surely didn't watch what I just saw.. Then again you can't please everyone.! The lead actor was superb and put up an Oscar worthy performance..
1917,26 August 2020,10/10,"I don't really enjoy WWI movies, this one being the 2nd or 3rd I watched. But it was a GREAT surprise, even with only 3 known(for me) actors, which may be part of the surprises.
The story is good but very simple. The development is brilliant. Right in the beginning there are surprises and a scene I didn't see coming. Furthermore, it is full of action, suspense and drama, a brilliant cinematopraphy, beautiful images and so on. So many reasons to watch..."
1917,16 November 2021,8/10,"It's been on my ""to watch"" list for some time but I kept putting it off.In hindsight I don't know why because WOW. Literally gripped from start to finish.WW1 often gets overlooked in films but Its These films that remind us just how lucky we
Are to have what we do today thanks to all those amazing service men/women/animals who put their lives on the line all those years ago, twice."
1917,8 April 2020,10/10,"""1917"" is probably in my top 3 war movies that I have ever seen. I thought I could find some weak spots, but I didn't find anything, because the movie is absolutely astonishing. The atmosphere of the whole movie is very tensioned and it creates the macabre sight of war. Just from the beginning, when Blake and Scofield are assigned to inform MacKenzie about the trap they will got into, you can find continous suspense moments, without to know what will gonna happen next. The movie creates the real atmosphere or war, where anyone could die in any moment. I was really amazed by the scene of the rat and the exploding bomb and the scene where the plane came down in flames, almost killing the protagonists. Brilliant movie."
1917,4 December 2020,10/10,The movie is created so amazingly that - as an audience it gets so easy to connect with the emotions of every character. Awe-struck!
1917,5 April 2021,8/10,"I watch this film as a part of the top 100 list of IMDb (I've got the poster), and it comes right after Fullmetal Jacket. I think that I might've expected too much something like FJ, but it was nothing alike. Yet, a great war film.1917 is a film about two messangers in WWI, trying to warn the soldiers in the new front lines that the Germans set a trap, and to cancell the attack. It's quite minimalistic in terms of dialogue and plot, but it doesn't take away from the whole experience.I have very few criticisms towards 1917, so let's start with that: I find the pacing a bit weird from time to time (seldom, maybe twice), mainly because It's made to look like a one shot. I also found one or two scenes a bit cliche (in the aspect of war films cilches), but not something awful.Now, to the things that I liked - the film is visually amazing. The one shot thing absorbs you into the battlefield completely, and every little item on the set was carefully crafted and placed. The acting is also great, and the score is good as well. I love the subtle ways in which we learn about war's nature and the personality of our two main characters.And also, the way that the film ends, and the focus on two soldiers makes everything feel like ""another day on the battlefield"". As one of the characters said, more or less: ""On sunday they'll send a letter telling us to attack on dawn"". The one day in which the film takes place is just another day.To sum it all: A great, immersive war film, with amazing production and creative film making techniques.P.s: I wish I saw this one on theaters instead of home, on my PC. Just feels like a movie that deserves the whole Cinemtaic experience."
1917,25 March 2020,7/10,"It is not a bad movie at all, it's just that the constant overwhelming portrayal of the evil of the Germans, such as when the downed German (dying ) pilot, fanatically stabs the person trying to save him, and other small things, such as the fact that they walk around with fixed bayonets at all times just got to me after a while. I give it a seven regardless, but as a person interested in military history as well as in the psychology of wars and interaction between enemies, I spent more time annoyed than the time I spent enjoying."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"War films were made in large numbers in the decades of 50s and 60s (mainly set in World War 2) were a staple for audience's along with Spy films. You had classics like Dirty Dozen, Guns of Navarone, Kelly's Heroes & Where the Eagles Dare and comedies like Operation Petticoat made during those period. Unfortunately audience's preferences declined and the only memorable war films since then were the ones like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk & Hacksaw Ridge according to my opinion. This year we got to see a mediocre yet entertaining Midway and a gem like 1917.Based on the events partly narrated by his grandfather, director Sam Mendes offer the greatest tribute to his grandfather with a gem like 1917. It describes the story two soldiers who have to deliver a message to their battalion in the enemy territory before they fall to enemy's trap.Some might find the pace of the film a bit slow but it effectively showcases the difficulties the two soldiers have to encounter in delivering the message. The director excels in showcasing the emotion of the two soldiers which was complimented by CGI free cinematography.All actors enacted their parts well and the direction of the film by Sam Mendes (A comeback of sorts after a mediocre Spectre and has added another gem into his kitty along with films like Road to Perdition and Skyfall) along with excellent cinematography by Roger Deakins.Hope this film earns the Academy Award for the Best Picture and make the genre of War films more relevant.(Rather than relying on big budgeted Franchise films the Hollywood studios should take an initiative in supporting more such films which will be appreciated by audiences)"
1917,5 February 2020,9/10,"I spoil basically the main plot points of the movie in this review so if you haven't seen the movie I advice you to not read this.Not for the highly sensitive person. The soldiers walk and crawl through mud and rotting corpses that couldn't have been picked up due to constant fighting and there are crows pecking at human remains etc. Depicts War in it's most gruesome state in my opinion. Never been to war though but I have to say that this is what I have always imagined WW1 trenches to have looked like.Then the hiccups. Noticed only two though these aren't that bad in my opinion.
1. The dude swims/is carried away by the river quite some time and the message he carries is still readable in the letter? They must have had some waterproof ink during WW1.
2. Umm...the German sniper shoots the main character from a short distance so that the main character flies backwards. It's never told to the viewer what stopped the bullet from a sniper at that distance. Plus, can you survive flying down a flight of stairs and getting hit in the head? I assume you can so that just leaves the bullet. When stopped it. (Plot armor of course but let's be serious here)But all together a great movie."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"We all know about the horrors of WW1, here's the best tribute to all who lost their lives.
A realistic portrait of one such heroic mission to stop the Devon Battalion from suffering a massacre at the hands of 1600 Germans.
Brilliantly acted by our two heroes bringing performances of
passion and daring treking across the wastelands of France.
The memories of a time where men became heroes will never be forgotten thanks to this masterpiece."
1917,5 April 2021,9/10,"OK so... 1917 is a technical masterpiece. From its incredible locations, pacing, superb actor performances and impeccable sound design, everything just screams quality. My only gripe is the limitations to storytelling the one shot, one camera technique places on the creators, but for this particular story I truly believe the positives far out way the negatives. This is a masterclass in film production and an absolute blast from start to finish."
1917,6 June 2020,5/10,"I do not think 1917 is that great a movie critics and audiences make it.I really like to explain why I think that.This film actually FEELS like the depiction of a third person shooter (TPS). I like this kind of games and play them maybe too often.Nonetheless the movie uses no cuts. Very much like any TPS. The decision to film this movie without any visual cuts seems to be bold at first. But any TPS basically has to do this. This is no groundbreaking cinema. In fact it hinders the cinematic possibilities.There is no deep storytelling. The main character feels threatened from start to end. And he doesn't change much. A story driven movie would have shown us why he gave his medal away. And how he got it. Nothing here.I think audience and critics take the way this movie is filmed as a unique decision of the director.But it isn't. TPSs like Uncharted, The Last Of Us have all the necessary ingredients and are interactive. The thing this film fails the most."
1917,30 November 2021,8/10,"This is a super great war movie, not only for people that like war movies but just in general, the acting and music is all great, the music is pretty heroic and even when not to much is happening, the music is good.This movie also really decently depicted the hell of being in war, and how our main characters have it under the war, the movie also beautifully depicts different scenarios of being in war, and how it is to go up against different wespons used in WWl. Generally a Great War movie, visuals are also great:)"
1917,24 January 2020,6/10,A fantastic experience! A superb portrayal of the Great War. A trully masterpiece that deeply depicts the horrors of war. Though the movie has its flaws (yes it has!) Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins managed to create a classic.
1917,15 October 2021,2/10,"This had to be one of the most boring films I have ever tried to watch. Could not finish it, this is a technical spectacle with nothing else to offer. Weak storytelling overlooked for the sake of the technical prowess of the one shot camera work. I will never watch this again or try to finish it. Not all war stories are worth telling, this one and Dunkirk take the cake for being some of the most boring and unnecessary films about war ever made. Coincidentally, they are also the most overrated and overhyped."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,You have to see this movie. You feel like you are in the movie.
1917,5 August 2020,8/10,"Highly entertaining. Great movie. And I'm easily distracted. I'm only giving it an 8 because I don't find myself desiring to watch it again. Which makes the best of films an instant 8. - I'm not a huge fan of the director's previous work, but there's something distinctly different about this film. Perhaps more 'style ambitious'? Not quite sure. But he's definitely on my radar now. Like this one, Jarhead and American Beauty were entertaining the 1st time through, but nothing I needed to watch ever again. Perhaps that is the level he'll break through next. A film that you can't wait to watch again."
1917,16 March 2021,10/10,"This is one of the best movie experiences I have ever had. Go watch it, I promise it will be an experience like no other. The cast was great, the script was written and performed perfectly and the effects and music score was amazingly crafted for the setting and tone. Enough said! Go watch it.But here's everything I love about the movie non the less.
I love the cinematography, the sound mixing, the performances - Everything about it just seems perfectly crafted. The music starts to play, and you feel the chills on your arms as your senses begin to take over as you travel back in time to a World War 1.It's a simple yet effective plot. We follow two soldiers on a simple quest, they aren't ""The chosen ones"" or has some prophecy to help them out, no. These men are soldiers fighting for their country, for family and for their fellow men far away whom is preparing to go into battle. The two soldiers are put on a mission, to deliver a message. They know it's dangerous, we as viewers know it's dangerous, but we collectively know it's the right thing to do.The decision to shot the entire movie in one shot was absolutely brilliant.
It's different and unique, which makes it stand apart from every other war movie and it assures us that we succumb to the realism and immersion the movie wants us feel as we follow the soldiers in to battle, like we were there with them.
We feel the mud under our boots and the tension as our hearts pound through our chest knowing full well that we are slowly crossing further into enemy territory with no knowledge of what lies behind the next corner or in the water down below, and you quickly find yourself not being able to rest, but looking into the distance and over the ridge, as your body tenses up and the feeling of uncertainty fills your mind.If you are able to watch this in a theater, I recommend you to go, as that's the best experience you can possibly have, if not, you almost have an obligation to your self to lower your curtains, turn off your phone, and truly be immersed.
Make it as much as a theater experience as possible, and enjoy this great piece of filmmaking.10/10"
1917,28 March 2020,8/10,"Really a good film, the ruins from the night to the dawn, the director is really good. And Benedict is great. All the actors who play British officers are so good."
1917,20 January 2020,6/10,The sets and depiction of trench warfare are intensely realistic but this story has been told many times before. Although the film shocks the viewer with its non-stop shots of WWI butchery it is much too long and the shock wears off just when it should climax. Although it is not a comedy by any measure I compared it to M*A*S*H for its depiction of the resignation of the soldiers and the uselessness and horror of war. It is not a reboot but the story sure seems common.
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"Shot in three big takes, the movie has got an excellent image and a superb staging"
1917,31 January 2020,6/10,"Finally caught this film. Some fantastic, often surreal, cinematography. Acting was also on point. That said there were a few things that just didn't add up for me - maybe I just didn't set my autopilot to max level. The front lines, even during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line, did not have breaks in it - that would have been inviting disaster in itself; therefore, the need for these two to cross into no man's land, isolated from allied forces, and then into German-held zones, only to get to another part of the British front made zero sense. More, a pilot attempting to crash land would not aim for a building to smash into when there is vast open fields... After which, a full company of motorized British soldiers show up out of nowhere despite these two being at the highest level of alertness. When he winds up in the river, sopping wet with the papers containing the general's command to stand down, he arrives shortly after at the colonel with a dry, easily legible piece of paper. The better way to have handled that would be to have had the orders illegible, and the attack to go ahead, to illustrate the absolute absurdity of the war itself (for France and the UK, and later the US, had no business in joining the war to begin with - as it kicked off between Austria and Serbia, with Germany solely countering Russia joining on the side of Serbia). Though with all that said, the film was entertaining. Entertaining to the point of being worth a $20 or greater trip to the theater? Not quite. But, in my opinion, good enough to rent or to catch at the cheaper tier theaters."
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"With all the hype that is surrounding this film being nominated for best picture I expected more. Some of the scenes made me question why were they done in that manner. Overall it's a good solid (7) with beautiful scenes and fantastic cinematography. Personally, I could see it getting a couple of nods for some lower level awards at the Oscars, but I do not see this taking home best picture. I would definitely recommend seeing the movie it has the major components of a good war film."
1917,31 August 2020,10/10,"You'll have all heard a lot about the way this film is filmed to look like one continuous shot... and for bloody good reason! The way this is filmed is so effective and puts the focus on the characters and their story as opposed lots of big action sequences (it still has a few). It reminds me slightly of Dunkirk in the way that both focus on the fear of being in war and how the soldiers within it deal with this rather than lots of explosions and gunshots. This film will be hard to beat in the war film genre and there is something for everybody in it - whether its cinematography, storyline, the characters themselves or if you do just like some explosions this film has it."
1917,7 February 2020,9/10,"1917 is a hell of a ride and for shure the best cinematography of the year. Mendes keeps the pace over the whole film and the sound editing is also great.Esthetically 1917 reminds me a lot of a first person shooter where you always follow the protagonist, each scene seems scripted for maximum thrill. its a film ernst jünger might have enjoyed.But when you compare 1917 to films like all quite on the western front, paths of glory or full metal jacket it lacks the portrait of the enemy as a human being. the germans are most of the time absent, and when the protagonists encounter them, they are sneaky, unthankful and -deserve- to die. shure in one of the last dialogs its said that war is meaningless, but what the viewer sees is a hero that survived the stahlgewitter. so its a good movie from the crafts, but it fails when you compare it to classics of anti-war-cinema, because in the end its all spectacle, non the less."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Just see it, anything I write won't do it justice. It deserves to win all 10 Oscars that it's nominated for."
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"""1917"" is perhaps the most ambitious film set during the Great War. Director Sam Mendes and director of photography Roger Deakins took a risk in presenting this film as one long take. There decision paid off in the most brilliant way. Deakins once again shows his mastery of light and lens. What he's done is he's crafted a visually stunning world without sacrificing story. There are multiple key moments that are told beautifully through the lens and mind of Deakins. A lesser cinematographer would have simply filmed the action on screen without taking into consideration the language of film through the visual medium. Nearly every frame in the film reveals something about the characters and the position they find themselves in. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay deliver engaging and thrilling performances. MacKay commands the screen every moment he is on it. This is a film that feels both large and small simultaneously. The intimacy of the story of the two young men aiming to send a vital message to Colonel Mackenzie is entirely brilliant. At the same moment, the massive scope of what their failure or success will ultimately affect can be felt all the way through the film. At its core this film is a story of brotherhood and humanity. It's an absolute gem and is no doubt worthy of remembrance."
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,"The movie mainly tells a story about two soldiers delivering a letter to an isolated regiment which is needed to cross through enemy's territory. The plot is simple, but the beautiful screens were unforgetable and the movie only used one shot ! It was amazing. I have some problems though,that how did George change his cloth? Did the director edit it when he passes by the tree?"
1917,16 January 2020,5/10,"Well shot but poor story and poor characterization, l am sure the cast and crew had some huge technical obstacles to cross but I think it was all lost with the poorly developed characters"
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"I enjoyed this film. At times I found it very frustrating, without spoiling it by that at times I mean that, you want the main characters to take a certain action and when they fail to do so or do something else you think just do this or that. The film is beautifully filmed and the war and battle scenes very realistic. The horror of the trenches is recreated but I'm sure in reality it was much much worse. Well worth seeing and worthy of the plaudits that have been bestowed upon it."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is a masterpiece. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The entire movie uses extraordinarily clever camera tricks to appear as though the entire feature was shot in one take. The way that Sam Mendes and his team shoot the film makes you feel like you're there with the Lance Corporals. You feel their claustrophobia when they're almost buried by a German booby trap, experience the same relief when they reach daylight again and react to gunshots with the same surprise and fear. Towards the end, the shots speed up with the characters, expertly portray their urgency to complete their mission. The stubtle ways the camera shows the harsh realities of war and unnecessary loss of life is masterful and the two main characters are three dimensional, real people, who didn't deserve to be in such a harsh situation. This movie absolutely deserves its best cinematography and best director nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards and I sincerely hope that it wins in both categories. This movie is a must see."
1917,20 March 2020,9/10,"There is a kind of amusement project in the theme park. Sitting in a car and enjoying the artificial landscape along the established track, the event mechanism will be triggered continuously, and there will be a roller coaster like dive experience at the final climax. This film is basically like this. Everything is carefully designed and manipulated without any disguise. Dozens of scenes are forced to be stitched into one mirror to the end, as well as those special effects and settings. Such a superficial visual technology display is just like the Mcbeth movie, which is meaningless. Several famous actors in the game like NPC for the protagonist's card clearance is a play. A few perceptual strokes are quite eye-catching, which are the few perceptual moments for the characters to break through the technical rolling. The light and shadow design of the scene at night is wonderful."
1917,14 April 2020,9/10,"""On June 28,1914, the Franz Ferdinand of Austria was shot dead in Sarajevo, triggering the first World War, "" a critical phrase more than 101 years after the end of the first World War, has become a cold line in the history books, a necessary piece of common sense. More than a century on, as the survivors of the disaster leave, the story of this unforgivable blunder in human history, the tragedy that claimed more than 35 million lives, is coming to an end, as a digital and macro lesson, rather than the worst nightmare experienced by an individual and his family."
1917,9 February 2020,8/10,Cinematography is First Class in this film. A few jumps and scares which were well acted. Some scenes a bit unbelievable but otherwise a solid watch.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Twenty years ago Sam Mendes changed story telling by doing a film around a dysfunctional american suburban family winning an Oscar with American Beauty. In 2020 he may have struck Gold again with this beautifully shot and inspirational story in 1917.Done entirely in what seems to be three seperate shots (not seen to this detail since Rope) we are with our characters throughout the whole story of two British military officers charged with the operation to deliver the message to stop an assault on the German Army. The realism is there as Mendes puts you there with every heartbeat and breath felt as they feel it.The fact is, this film potentially will get best picture and deservedly so."
1917,28 October 2020,6/10,"Do not believe the hype.This film is average at best, started ok but soon became a bit of a bore.Not the best war film i have seen, far from it"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing stuff, not only the story but the acting and the cinematography were beautiful, it gave you a feeling of the gallows humour that must have been prevalent at the time and the love between the two main characters was well crafted and the story keeps you gripped all the way through"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,1917 is excellent. The single shot style filming was amazing. Thomas Newman's score carry's they film beautifully. dean Charles-Chapman was great and George MacKay was masterful. There were a few instances where it felt dreamlike and the timeline was far fetched but overall I loved this film. See Mendes delivers yet again. Can't wait to see what he does next. Go see this film!
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,"Absolutely brilliant one-shot execution during the whole movie. Visually very powerful, georgeus sound and setting. However, it lacks of a better plot, characters and depth to become a war movie classic."
1917,9 April 2021,9/10,"You don't need to be a war film fan to watch and enjoy this... You just need to be in the mood for a great film with excellent production design, great acting, directing, storytelling and the editing, my goodness the editing... So good when you feel like you are along for the ride with just two mains actors, in the very tense world they are in.Just watch and enjoy, it's that simple..."
1917,21 February 2021,10/10,"The long ""one shot"" approach is cool, although not super unique. Not sure if it added to the story at all. But there are some scenes in this movie that are so visually spectacular that I could watch just those scenes again and again. A true masterpiece in filmmaking."
1917,3 February 2020,8/10,"Gorgeous cinematography, scenography, music and costumes. A wondrous depiction of war, rich of details. It's just beautiful to look at. Technically brilliant.
The story though is linear, as linear as it can be and the characters are just...ordinary."
1917,3 February 2020,6/10,"The ""one shot"" aspect of the movie was indeed well made, some individual great acting also, but the overall impression I got was nothing more than an ok but predictable and pretentious attempt to win a whole lotta Oscars. And I bloody despise the oscar w**re awards. It was worth the watch, but not more."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"From the first trailer, 1917 mesmerized me in a way few movies have. My husband and I waited with almost comical anticipation to see this in the theater; both of us are lovers of history and find World War I to be terribly undervalued in modern media. After having just come back from the theater, I am left shaken and utterly moved by the experience.1917 follows two British soldiers who must deliver a message by crossing perilous ground to save not only one of their brothers, but 1600 men walking into a trap while under the impression the war is nearly won. Never before have I seen a war movie so effectively grounded and clinging to the perspective of the leads; this first-person perspective delivers a brutal raw, gritty, personal feel that I wish more movies would emulate. This intimate perspective is aided by continuous shot film-making; while the movie is not, indeed, one shot, the majority of it certainly feels so, keeping us gripping on to the task at hand with merciless abandon as if the viewer is the one delivering the message. The majestic yet dark tone of war is consistent, gripping, and enthralling. Often we are taken through the post-apocalyptic feel of a ruined battlefield; the camera passes over masterfully placed corpses of both man and beast without much thought to linger, giving the lives lost just as much attention as the shells, shots, and foes that snuffed them out. It is utterly devastating and depressingly gorgeous, and that's not even touching upon the battlefield scenes at night, where the moving lights of flares and fire kiss the wasteland of mud and stone with such grace I was brought to tears.As someone who rarely cries even when a person close to me has passed, I am somewhat embarrassed to say 1917 brought me to tears three times, unlike any movie which came before it. It's not an intentionally heartstrings-tugging movie; however, as a lover of history, this absolute love letter of a film filled me with such wonderment I was left feeling a sense of awe and overwhelming sympathy for the men who were once asked to do unspeakable crimes and heroic actions for their fellow men. The two leads here are interesting and likable, though they are just developed enough so that it feels like they could be anyone's child, lover, brother, or father. In this way, 1917 manages to be both deeply intimate and all-encompassing, succeeding at an immensely difficult task that few other war movies--if any--have accomplished before it.Rarely have I watched a movie that has affected me to this extent. I will be thinking about 1917 and its lasting impact for years to come."
1917,17 February 2020,9/10,"Almost faultless. A moving, nerve wrangling rollercoaster of a movie, superbly and cleverly directed."
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,"That's what war does to all of those young soldiers: turning them into alienated wayfaring strangers, just trying to survive in all the madness around. Sometimes the technical aspects of creating the illusion that everything we see is being shot in one take, dominate the story and the human implications.
But Mendes manages to keep the balance most of the time, supported of course by extraordinary young actors, who make the journey believable.
What i liked most were the moments of silence, of grief, of melancholy, the singing soldier in the wood, the surrealism of huge burning buildings at night, the loss of orientation in life-threatening situations. This exciting experience wouldn't work without Deakins brilliant cinematography, which is the real Oscar-worthy part here in my opinion."
1917,2 April 2020,8/10,"This movie has certain brilliant aspects, the cinematography is absolutely striking and the performances are excellent.This is, undoubtedly, one of the best movies portraying WWI.However, the incredibly-long-shot, which was supposed to make this an even more immersive experience, had the exact opposite in me. I couldn't stop thinking that it was just a movie, that I was seeing that through lens and not actually running besides the protagonists. Opinion which seems not to be shared by most people though."
1917,22 March 2020,10/10,"Intense,thrilling, unrelenting, heartbreaking. A well made movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"This is set to be 1 of the greats. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, the score is haunting and everything about this movie is great!!In the later days of the great war. 2 British corporals are given the task of delivering a message to a battalion miles away before its charge will end in disaster by the awaiting German trap. 1 of the Corporals brothers is in this battalion making it a much more desperate mission for the Lads. This is a story of the difficulties the men face on their extremely treacherous mission.Might I add that the scenes in no mans land are the most horrific I've scene to date. This film manages to capture to true horror that was the great war. Nothing great about it. Just anguish, horror, grief and misery that our forefathers endured. A couple of touching moments too but the true star of the movie was the genius of cinematography that is a true feat on it's own added by great performances by Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay accompanied by an acceptional script. The best ww1 movie to date."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"The film is very well made. The cinematography is great. The way it is presented as a one take film is amazing. The suspense is kept well. But in the end it's a bit boring. They run nine miles. One dies. One meets a French girl with a baby that is not hers and that just seems unnecessary. The soundtrack misses now and then and then the film is over. Beautifully shot, but boring in the end. A 6. A big 6 but not a 7."

1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Pros: The ""one-shot"" film concept is incredible and extremely immersive; Captures the constantly dangerous atmosphere, the horror and emotion of war perfectly; Beautiful cinematography and music; Direction, casting and acting are all well done;Cons: None!Verdict:
It's one of the best war films I have seen and it's definitely the best war film of the decade for me."
1917,23 July 2020,2/10,"I thought I was going to be in for a real treat, but sadly It was so bad! Cinematography sure it looks cool (looks as if it's all filmed in one shot) but It could have been a better movie with cuts. The plot is absurd. That the only way to save all these men, is that two men go on ahead to said group and hand their leader a piece of paper?... They carry all these supplies hardly none that can help them (bayonets & shovels) never stopping to actually read the map, or a compass. No military dialogue. They point their gun barrels at each other whilst traveling. Not shocked over the dead bodies everywhere (rats crawling out of) but actually stop the take Jesus' name in vain when they see cherry trees chopped down. Not looking to see who squeezed the milk out of a random cow, but hap hazard fills the canteen (that later comes into play to feed a random baby) Where is the girl getting kerosene for her lamps, by the way? Single chopped down trees that block the road way, when a child could just drive around them... Or swimming through dozens of dead bodies when you could have swam another few feet and avoided all of that mess. A random guy singing in the woods whilst a whole platoon is entranced by his angelic voice... The ""F"" word through out this movie does not fit at all, and Christ name would have been said out loud in those times, but more because of prayer that they might be going to meet their maker. The more I think about it the more I disliked it. This was a complete mess, filled with inaccuracies. How in the heck is this movie rated so high?"
1917,13 April 2020,10/10,It is a wonderful masterpiece that depicts the brutality of warfare and a quest of two individual to discover the dark truth of war.This film has the best Scene Detailing and Direction I have come across in years since The Bridge of River Kawai .It has won three Oscar that what depicts its true brilliance and creativity.For those of whom who haven't watch the movie yet are missing a brilliant masterpiece behind.Do watch and enjoy and let me know if my review was useful.
1917,28 August 2020,1/10,Why in the world are people raving about this film? I love a good film and I'm pretty open minded but this was just terrible and way over rated. . I'm using the DVD as a coaster.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"There is no question this movie will win multiple Oscars. The acting was phenomenal, as was the cinematography. There was very little CGI thank goodness. CGI has ruined modern cinema, but this is real acting. So refreshing!"
1917,11 March 2020,9/10,"CONS: The movie starts out with the usual antagonists trying to persuade the protagonist to do the wrong thing for no reason. Then we have the cynics saying the mission can't be accomplished and add the typical fear mongers to complete the storyline.PROS: Thankfully there weren't any 80 pound supermodels to save multiple times, car chases or gun battles dispensing thousands of rounds trying to kill 3 bad guys from 50 feet away etc..
The cinematography, lighting, sound, directing, sets and editing are stellar. Should have won best picture but as we all know, Oscars have become political.
It has adequate character development, original scenes of suspense and obstacles keeping the viewers on edge. I was impressed with the many twists and surprises.A note about the negative reviews; this film is less entertaining for young viewers looking for constant action (Avengers). I've been around for over 6 decades and I get tired of the same old screenplays getting used over and over. I enjoyed this original film, especially the absence of typical melodramatic/action hero writing."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"Nothing new to say on any of the plaudits, except that context is needed. Private Ryan didn't get best movie Oscar, but was 100% better than this movie for lots of reasons, Tom Hanks being the main one. Dunkirk didn't get Oscar for best movie despite being 50% better than this movie. This movie didn't need to try and outdo Dunkirk on the musical tension, in fact, the village fantasyland suite was misplaced. Definitely an Oscar for screenplay, and best British cameos (lol). I recommend to see this movie, but after all the hype, and bearing in mind some of the truly outstanding war movies of the past 20 years, it didn't move me as much as others. And it didn't need to. It's a superbly executed narrative, and the final 10 minutes is worth the buildup. But be careful of the hype."
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"The one-shot look of this movie was interesting. Wasn't sure if I was going to like that that approach to filming but it worked for this film.The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking. Sound and music score really helped a viewer on an emotional level as well.While I was engrossed and drawn into this film from start to finish, after it was over and I had time to reflect on it, I found it not the profound masterpiece others have stated it as.The plot in general was unrealistic - there are better ways to deliver a message than sending two soldiers across enemy lines and relying on luck and hope.Some of the scenes dragged as well, which caused the movie to lose momentum for me. Felt the build up often yes, but then there would be scene that made me lose interest (truck ride. French woman & baby).Acting wasn't spectacular either, from anyone in the film. You can have all the explosions and battle scenes you want that look great, but if the actors can't carry the script along it won't work as a whole. This is why the comparisons that mention Saving Private Ryan don't work for me - those actors drew you in with their performances. That didn't happen here, and between the acting and the momentum losing scenes, is why I cant rate this film any higher.Close, but missed the mark for a perfect film, but a good watch none the less."
1917,9 January 2020,9/10,"1917, is a war film that adds something completely new and unique to the war genre. The idea of making it look like one take is genius, the cinematography is by far the best of the year, as it immerses you deeply into the film and the characters that make you almost feel like you are there on this journey. The film also has a moving ending that had me mesmerised by the time the credits rolled, that is due to the cinematography and the performances given in the film which were very strong, ending on one of the most nicest shots I have seen this year with a quiet moment that says so much when speaking so little. The production, and costume design were also fantastic and the score only enhances your immersion which is exactly what you want in a score.The weak parts to the film however, were there wasn't the greatest character building, especially in moments early on in the film, where I was supposed to feel some kind of emotion I didn't because the character development early on isn't the greatest. I believe as the film progressed this issue eventually sorted itself out which was nice, and also there were quiet moments in the film that felt they dragged on for way too long and needed to be shortened down a little to make a tighter packaged film.Overall 1917 is a film that I found used its cinematography in fantastic fashion and creates a war film that stands up with some of the best, due to its incredible 3rd act. This is pure film making class and will be something that will be studied for aspiring cinematographers in the future."
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,"1917 Is A Masterpiece - Stunning Cinematic Experiece Through A Single Continous Shot.Film Will Give You Bone Chilling Experiece With Captivating Screenplay And Mind Blowing BGM.

1917,3 January 2021,7/10,Watched for a third time as really want to know how to film in one shot. Not a bad film and upset when the actor was stapled. The fighting scenes are also quite good although not understand why that French woman can survive under the war. And interested to see the three famous actors appeared!
1917,11 March 2020,7/10,"Although beautifully shot and a technical masterpiece, '1917' left me dissapointed. Like Nolan's 'Dunkirk' there really isn't any tension between the characters. Guess that warmovies nowadays just have to be a visual spectacle. Like a cutscene from a computergame.And the ending.... so Hollywood. Wrong message there.The shortmovie on YouTube called 'Coward' is a much better and true presentation about what happened in the trenches."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"One of the frontrunners for this year's Oscar for Best Picture is Sam Mendes' epic World War I film, 1917, starring Dean-Charles Chapman, George MacKay, Daniel Mays, Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch among others.Mendes (Director of Skyfall, Road to Perdition and American Beauty) helms this film, which has been nominated for ten Oscars including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup/Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. The film already took home wins at the Golden Globes in Best Picture-Drama, and Best Director.The film is a taut thriller filled with non-stop tense moments as Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield, officers in the British army are tasked with going through no man's land, behind enemy lines, through a web of peril to deliver a message to their fellow soldiers to call off an offensive as where they plan to attack is a trap. The attack is planned for the following morning at dawn and time is short.One of the most unique parts of the film is how it is shot as a ""single shot."" Meaning the entire film is one continuous scene. It shows the soldiers on the run through the multitude of dangers without stopping. There are a few places where the scenes were ""cut"" when it transitions from outside to underground in the trench, but the feel of the movie is a non-stop, pulse-pounding, action-packed stream that never lets up.Mendes, who also had a hand in the screenplay, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, is based on stories of the Great War from his own grandfather, Lance Corporal Alfred Hubert Mendes.Mendes commented on his inspiration for the film:
""Our film is fiction, but certain scenes and aspects of it are drawn from stories he told me, and ones told him by his fellow soldiers. This simple kernel of an idea-of a single man carrying a message from one place to another-stayed with me and became the starting point for 1917.""The film, like many modern war films that precede it, focuses on both the hellish nature of war, especially trench warfare, but also the heroism and willingness of soldiers to sacrifice their own lives for the fellow countrymen and the cause. There are also some similarities to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan set in the First World War.I really enjoyed the film. I think the cinematography and the single shot approach was unique and impacting. The story was compelling. The acting was superb. There were a lot of things the film did well. The score and sound brought an atmospheric feeling enhancing the drama and tension building on the screen.Definitely recommend this film for anyone who enjoys action, thrillers and war films."
1917,9 January 2020,6/10,"Once again looking at at the 9 and 10 reviews of this one cant help but think the majority must be company shills pushing their company's product. 1917 is an OK movie perhaps maybe even a good movie but certainly not a great movie. A great movie has as its bedrock a great story line and plot. This comes up well short in the plot department. WWI was chaos without doubt but the military was not commanded by complete idiots as the plot line would have us believe. There is no possible such an incredibly import job would be handled in the way portrayed. The movie was full of cliches and the usual war movie tropes. 1917 has been promoted as a ""one take"" movie but ........it isn't. Dont get me wrong, the camera work is outstanding but the rest ...... not so much. The settings just failed to achieve realism in most cases .... trenches too clean for one thing. Even the No-Man's land carnage didn't look ...... right! The is a solid 6 and maybe I might be convinced to stretch it to a 6.5 but it certainly isn't a 10. An Oscar winner? Given the hype it could be a chance but the right movie quite often doesnt win the Best Movie Oscar, afterall Hollywood has always been politics over substance. One final note. The Helmets the Brits were wearing ....... something about them was not right and that was a distraction throughout the movie. A great movie would get the details right."
1917,23 February 2020,9/10,No words to describe that i was dying to see another movie like saving private Ryan .. this movie made my dream come true. This movie is how you make a war movie with heartbreaking moments.
1917,9 January 2021,6/10,"Cinematographically I get the praise. It's beautifully shot, but that shouldn't be enough to rely on though. I personally prefer some realism in a war movie. And that...well was quite hard to find in this one. When scene after scene unrealistic coincidences and occurances happened my mind was pretty much like ""ehm...ok..."" *frowning eyebrow* most of the time. The short (I'd almost say cameo) appearances of wellknown actors like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden were nice, but didn't really add much to the story either since none of them really had much screentime.
I know the main protagonist from the movie Marrowbone, good actor. To see Tommen Baratheon...no just kidding, Dean-Charles Chapman as a corporal seemed a bit odd for some reason. Just not a chap you'd expect to see as a soldier in a war movie I guess. Funny though eventually Robb Stark (Richard Madden) turned out to be his brother lol."
1917,9 August 2020,1/10,This is a political statement I have tried to leave an honest 3 star reveiw on here 3 times but IMDB for some reason don't allow it??? Someone at IMDB that checks these before publishing does not like my view. So 1 star. Boring.
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,This is insane. I have no idea how did they shoot this movie? How did they plan the sequences? Do we have man power or technology to accomplish a task like this in this planet? I just don't understand. How? I just can't believe it. This is absolutely brutal success. Well done. Congratulations Roger Deakins for your upcoming academy award. Well done to every person who worked in this project.
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,The movie was a bit disjointed. While the visual effects and the scenery was stunning I didn't feel that the emotional connection of World War 1 was strong enough. Some of the scenes were a little far fetched and the reality of war was a lost towards the middle. The plot was well structured. I only wished the flow was as strong as the plot.
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"1917: A different kind of war movie: Up close and personal. Opening shot: a bucolic field of wild flowers, a lovely, calm day, blue cloudless sky, quite, serine, slowly pulls back to reveal a bivouac of British troops, sleeping, smoking, eating, refreshing, resting, waiting. It's WWI. The phone lines have been cut and two British soldiers are called to the Commanding General's bunker and are given the mission to deliver a message to the commander of another regiment a few miles away, that they must call off a planned attack scheduled for dawn the following morning because the German army has set a trap that will ensure the massacre of 1600 men, one of whom is the brother of one of the soldiers. We go along with them through enemy territory, through the mud and over the bodies of the dead, determined to complete their harrowing mission. The entire film looks like it was shot in real time in one continuous take with a hand-held steady cam. The cuts are nearly imperceptible. Birdman employed this technique wonderfully, but this endeavor far surpasses that in artistry, complexity, scope and length. This is a technical achievement without comparison. But technical achievement means nothing if there is no compelling story and investment in the characters and 1917 delivers. We are drawn in to the action so closely that we almost duck when bullets start flying. We care deeply about these two young men. It's edge-of-your-seat tension. The score by Thomas Newman enhances every moment and is profoundly moving. We're aware of it, but it doesn't call attention to itself as our pulses race along with the action. The production design is brilliant. Roger Deakins is probably the greatest cinematographer of all time. He was also the A camera operator and I can only imagine how he and director Sam Mendes managed to pull this off. I read they were in rehearsal for six months planning every shot. Score: 10. GO! Well deserving of every Oscar nomination it's gotten. 1/22/20"
1917,8 January 2020,6/10,"I enjoyed this film, but not as much as I was hoping I would.There were a number of things which took place that absolutely would not have happened during WWI, or any war for that matter.The acting is superb, and the dialogue is well written.The cinematography is amazing, and the visually are stunning.It is slow paced, but not in a terrible way, yet also not in a great way either.It's right in the middle.I recommend seeing this movie and deciding for yourself."
1917,14 June 2021,8/10,Damn they do a lot of dilly dallying and yapping for such a crucial mission. However... still fantastic.
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"Just saw this film, and I have to say that it was visually stunning. As far as winning in the the Oscar for best cinematography, this film sould walk away with it hands down. The casting and acting was definitely top notch as well.
The only thing that made me twinge just a bit was the character of Blake, (played superbly by Dean-Charles Chapman). I found his character, while noble and brave, to be extremely naive. From his almost over zealous additude towards going into enemy territory, to his foolish empathy towards the enemy which eventually cost him his life- in the most careless way possible. The character seemed unfinished, perhaps a bit too young, which is probably what the writers intended.
Otherwise a great war film."
1917,3 February 2020,5/10,"Films like 1917 focus so much on style that they leave behind any narrative strength. 1917 plays like a Video Game, and would probably make a great 10/10 video game like Call of Duty. Now, from a cinema point of view, the cinematography, production design, and wardrobe comes together very strongly, you should probably wait h it for the ""single shot"" method employed. What doesn't come across at all is any sort of tension- any sense of true danger. Compare this with Birdman, where you actually feel emotion+tension despite the one continuous shot. The one-shot in his film is a gimmick a does not add anything. It is often distracting."
1917,19 July 2020,8/10,"Very well directed and scripted movie and acted well by the lead stars. A must watch for all thriller, war, adventure movies lovers."
1917,16 May 2021,10/10,"An edge-of-your-seat war drama that barely gives you a chance to breathe. It's near impossible not to feel like you aren't emotionally invested and physically there every step of the journey, thanks to the engaging camera work consistently utilised throughout the story. Cinematographer Roger Deakins work shows, as there's never a dull frame. Truly jaw-dropping scenes throughout. A masterpiece all round."
1917,13 March 2020,10/10,Loved the every perfection of the movie was waiting almost to watch it and it liked it.. Cinematography makes it to next level of the movie it's soo pure the music and the shots beautiful.. 1917 is picture perfect movie
1917,13 May 2020,10/10,After a long time I saw a movie which is as compelling and spell bounding as the Spielberg's saving private Ryan.. The emotions involved in this movie are so damn real..
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Breathtaking. Visually breathtaking. That's probably what I would use to describe the film. 1917 is a film that use a continouously long one-shot in its entirety, like Birdman. And the efforts to make that alone should be applauded. Using a simple story settings, 1917 soars in the technical aspect as well as the narrative.The film uses a very simple and easy to understand settings: deliver a message. The protagonist is basically a messenger. However, the mission is no easy task; making it a very good story to told. The film waste no moment in introducing its main characters and their mission, making you feel the importance of the mission at hand.This film is very gripping to say the least. The layers of the film is slowly peeled off, making it a very slow steady ride at first. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, just to occassionally push you back to the end of it. The sequence is well thought and set up, so much so that you'll feel the build up rising little by little.Another thing that I liked is the film uses very close shot to shoot the film, making you feel like you're there with the characters. It feels like you're riding a roller-coaster, and a very frightening one. Or like you're playing a World War 1 horror video game. Coupled that with the IMAX superb surround sound system, making it a very satisfying viewing and listening experience.The score of the film is also a main component in influencing your emotions. Whether to be sad, suspense or makes your blood pumping, Thomas Newman's score is there every step of the way. He knows when to use any cue to make you wary of the lying threat surrounding the main characters. Hats off to him.All in all, 1917 is a very immersive experience. This is maybe a once in a lifetime chance. I highly recommend you watch the film. Definitely watch this in IMAX if you have the chance to do so. It makes a world of a difference. Guaranteed you're not going to regret it. A 5 out of 5.P/S: I liked this film better than Dunkirk. But having said that, both aren't the same type of film and should't be compared because both are masterpieces in their own regard. Take that as you will."
1917,18 March 2020,9/10,"The war itself is a tragedy, and even in a senseless war like the first world war, even if the two soldiers ended up with nothing, I still saw over their heads the crown of thorns of the human spirit, that is, courage so great that it has exceeded individual lives."
1917,8 April 2020,9/10,"A very shocking war film, I saw tears in my eyes, the scene is very touching, the actor's expressiveness is also good, it is a very good film, it is recommended."
1917,4 April 2020,8/10,"Sometimes the word cruelty doesn't sound deep. When we experience it, we feel too shallow. We live in this world, not as a group, but as individuals. Everyone has their own thoughts, and everyone has their own pursuits. These thoughts and pursuits are put in front of the group, projecting only a beam of light, a beam of light made up of thousands of beams of light, not a person's cry can be changed. It is not a person's loneliness that can be responded to, not a personal pain will be sympathized.anyway just thx for the peace now"
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"Not a bad movie, but kind of boring. I would rate this about a 6.3. Midway was much better, even though it has a lower rating. How this movie has an 8.7 is beyond my imagination. Again, nothing wrong with it, just kind of boring."
1917,23 January 2020,5/10,"I found this unbelevable, silly and predictable. The attempt to make it look as if it was made in one single shot was distracting."
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,"A film is not only photography and some beautiful footage. With that I do not want to mean we can find this in 1917 at all because it is only a good attempt at photography sometimes but others filmmakers have done much better before. The film is only entertaiment and nothing else. Long time without seeing so many mistakes in a story and in what any normal human behaviour would be. For a large list I would have to write spoilers everywhere. This is the big issue.A few good actors without any deep lines or chance to pronunce themselves. But it happens so fast that you don't even realize it. It sounds like a few ones maybe realized the bad situation but someone in a hurry said ""no way...let´s the war begin""."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"It is April 1917. The 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment is poised to attack the Germans near the Hindenburg Line in northern France. General Erinmore has learned that the 2nd Battalion is walking into an ambush. He sends two British soldiers to warn the Devonshire Regiment not to go forward with the attack that would decimate the more than 1,600 men of the Devonshire Regiment. They have less than 24 hours to find the regiment and deliver orders to Colonel MacKenzie to stand-down.The film is produced by Sam Mendes whose grandfather, Alfred Mendes served in World War I. The film is based on a narrative by the elder Mr. Mendes about two young British soldiers that crossed enemy lines to save a regiment that is walking into an ambush. The film stars; George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch. The cinematographer is Roger Deakins who is known for creating long continuous shots in one take. He is a master of using zoom, pan, and tilt technics with a steady-cam that follows a character through numerous scenes in one single shot.The film opens with Lance Corporals Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Will Schofield (George MacKay) napping on a grassy hill when they are summoned to report to General Erinmore (Colin Firth). If you remember from history, World War I was called the ""trench war"" because both the British and German soldiers dug deep elaborate trenches on the battlefield. This would allow soldiers to move around freely while protecting them from small arms fire, artillery shells, and mustard gas. The land between the two opposing armies or fronts was referred to as ""No Man's Land"". Anyone crossing into this zone was considered, dead. A barbed-wire ran parallel to the trenches was usually littered by dead bodies both human and animal.The two soldiers set out running through a labyrinth of trenches, then crossing ""No Man's Land"" into the German front making their way through the German trenches and finally behind enemy lines. Along the way, they run into trouble but they manage to keep one another motivated with one goal in mind; to save the men of the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment as well as Corporal Blake's brother, Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden).The film is a cinematic masterpiece. Sam Medes managed to take the audience into the trenches. We were made to feel the corporals' cold and wet as they crawled in and out of bomb craters. As well as the smell of death that surrounded these two brave men. We experienced the fear of Corporal Schofield as he ran from German snipers and other soldiers as he hid in the bombed-out village of Écoust-Saint-Mein. There Corporal Schofield comes across Lauri (Claire Duburcq) a French woman and a baby hiding in a bombed-out building. As dawn came, the corporal had only hours to find the 2nd Battalion and when it was time to leave it was heartbreaking to watch him walk away from Lauri and the baby as he had to move on to complete the mission.We cheered Corporal Schofield on as he sprints through the battlefield as soldiers from the 2nd Battalion poured on to the field amidst the artillery shells raining down on the troops. The corporal finally makes his way through the trench to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) to deliver the orders from General Erinmore. The battalion is ordered to stand-down and the corporal is left with one more mission to complete. He finds Corporal Blake's older brother, Lt. Joseph Blake, to give him the sad news about his younger brother, who was killed by a German pilot they saved from a burning plane. As the two stand there, we feel the pain that both of these men shared.""1917"" received 10 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director and of course Best Cinema-photography. This is a definite must-see if not for its historical value, but for its photography and storytelling from the point-of-view of someone that was there slogging through the mud in the miles of trenches."

by armen pandolaDo you like war movies? What are your favorites?If you like war movies and Saving Private Ryan or The Paths of Glory or even The Longest Day are among your favorites, then you will like !917, directed and co-written by Sam Mendes. If you don't, chances are, 1917 will not make a believer of you in spite of the fact that it is an odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for Best Picture.Mendes won an Oscar for his first feature film, American Beauty, which no one watches any longer because it starred Kevin Spacey and because his character, a middle-aged man on the brink of a breakdown, has sexual fantasies about his teenage daughter's friend.Since then, Mendes has directed a couple of good movies (Road to Perdition and Revolutionary Road), a couple of so-so movies (Jarhead and Away We Go) and a couple of Bond movies (Spectre and Skyfall). He comes from the theatre and continues to direct for the stage. 1917 is his first co-writing credit.So, what does 1917 bring to the 'war movie' table that wasn't there already?Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old has all of the horror of World War I, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory has all of its despicable commanders, All Quiet on the Western Front (1931) has the folly of its 'patriots' and Gallipoli (1981) has the tragedy of senseless slaughter. What else is there to say or show?Mendes brings us a war movie that follows two soldiers for one day, keeping his camera on only these two and what they see and experience. Shot in segments several minutes long, the movie is stitched together seamlessly - or seemingly so. From its opening to its closing, the camera stays focused on the two protagonists. What does this add to the movie?'Tracking shots' are shots that go on for a minute or more without the action stopping in order to set-up a new shot. Alfred Hitchcock shot one of his least successful movies, Rope, the story of two rich kids who kill someone for the fun of it, in a few very long takes. Orson Welles starts off Touch of Evil with a three and a half minute tracking shot that ends in an explosion. Paths of Glory has a shorter (91 seconds) tracking shot of a general walking through the trenches. Scorsese's Goodfellas has a three minute tracking shot of Henry Hill and Karen walking through the kitchen of the Copacabana to front row seats. If you have noticed such scenes, then you are probably a film buff.What do tracking shots add to a movie? In the movies I have mentioned, long tracking shots have furthered the story. For example, in Goodfellas, the long tracking shot shows us how Henry, a small-time mobster, has special privileges because of his insider status, privileges that impress his date, Karen.What has filming 1917 like one long sequence added to its message? It has focused our attention on two soldiers and two soldiers alone. This is a view of war from the bottom up. The stench and mud and rats are brought to the fore as two young corporals, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), undertake a mission to save sixteen hundred fellow soldiers from a senseless slaughter. Sadly, Mendes decides to add to the mix a few 'special appearances' from famous actors a la The Longest Day (1962). The movie stops dead for brief appearances by Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, taking us out of the gory frontlines and into the world of make-believe.There is not much depth in 1917. Two soldiers are given what seems to be a suicide mission which one of them is eager to undertake because he has a personal motive - his brother is one of the soldiers who may be saved. Along the way, we are told small bits and pieces of their lives. They are not especially memorable, and the self-imposed technical limitations make it impossible for us to have a fully rounded portrait of them. In the end, they are just two soldiers, much like millions of others who were fighting on both sides - and dying. And that is 1917's virtue and its limitation. Given its narrow scope, 1917 can only appeal to our most sentimental feelings.The best war movie that I have ever seen has not been in circulation in years - there are some pirated versions available on Amazon. The Victors is a 1963 British-American WWII movie written, produced and directed by Carl Foreman, starring George Peppard, George Hamilton, Melina Mercouri, Jeanne Moreau, Elke Sommer and Eli Wallach - yes, an odd cast, but an excellent one. The movie dares to be an anti-war movie in an era when such feelings were suppressed. WWII was the 'good war,' yet there was no sentimentality in The Victors - in fact, it showed the execution by firing squad of a GI deserter (a scene inspired by the real-life 1945 execution of Pvt. Eddie Slovik).In The Victors, war didn't make the men 'better' or more 'giving' or 'caring.' War did to the young men it trapped exactly what violence does to young men - it makes them worse, not better. There is a scene in which a new member of the squad finds a dog and starts to take care of it. When the squad pulls out of its camp, the sergeant tells the young soldier that no dogs are allowed on the trucks. As the young recruit sadly sits in the truck with his fellow soldiers, one hardened veteran tells the recruit to call the dog, so the recruit whistles to the dog, thinking they will hide it on the truck. Instead, the veteran shots it. That's what war does to young men, at least those who survive. The Victors won no awards for presenting war as it is - and The Victors has been forgotten. A great loss."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"I still want to give this film 8 stars despite its obvious and implausible plot contrivances. I won't spoil the experience by identifying them , and the point is that while you are watching the movie, they don't matter, as that is the best thing about this movie, in that you are fully absorbed in the ""one take"" experience. It is only after watching the film, after you have come down to earth again, that your logical brain starts to say "" hey wait a minute...""But even with the obvious stylishness, it is a very good film and you know what, it just goes to show other directors of how CGI and special effects can be used to support the film's narrative and they don't become a dominating factor in their own right to prop up the story line - no caped american superheroes or marvel costumes here - just a ripping good story filmed for adults. Go see it."
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is very intense, pretty much nonstop action. It has elements of Private Ryan with very realistic and horrifying special effects during the battle sequences, as well it has the ""First person"" POV (Point of View) made popular in such recent films as ""Dunkirk"" (as well as many video games).There's a bit more to the story than it seems at first, as the desire to fulfill the ""Mission"" becomes an all-consuming drive for both the protagonist and the audience. It drives hard to the finish and never stops making the point as so many have pointed out in history: ""War is hell"".We gave it a 9/10 and feel it is a likely contender for several Oscars.To address the silly critics who say that it ""Looks like a video game"". Silly people - video games were given the ""First person"" POV so they could simulate REAL war! If you've not been in combat, you might not know that, but don't pretend you know something when you don't!Other critics I've seen have said ""There's so little character development"". My goodness! Do you want to double the length of the film and see his birth and childhood too? It's not necessary for the plot of the movie. The movie presents us with REALISM and ACTION, as well as the fact that in war, there's no time to grieve, you simply gotta keep moving, or you're dead.Even if you do keep moving, you may wind up dead. Ask the guys who stormed the beaches of Normandy, they'll tell you: ""The guy on my left was killed. The guy on my right was killed. I didn't get a scratch."" That's called ""Survivor's guilt"" and is quite common.This movie grips you, and puts you in the trenches with the men who were there. That should make anyone shudder!"
1917,13 April 2020,8/10,"Rating: 8The movie no doubt deserves the Oscar it received for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mixing. The camera movement in this movie is first-rate.The Good - I loved the visuals in the movie. The actors put up a great performance too. The narrative of the story was gripping. It keeps you on your seat till the end. Moreover something that caught me off-guard was the cameos!The Bad - I could only cringe at the moments when the lead was making stupid decisions. The movie could have ended quite early but they had put in drama to increase the running time.I would not say this movie is a must-watch but it is definitely a good movie. I appreciate the cinematography for this movie. A tip - Please watch the movie on a big screen, the visuals are so similar to Dunkirk. And watch out for the cameos!"
1917,7 March 2020,7/10,"Visually a superb watch. That's what my 7 rating is for. Narrative and plot wise leaves much to be desired.1. Isn't wireless telegraphy already in use in 1917?2. Even if there's a need to send a critical written message (to save 1600 lives) by foot as if it's still ancient Mesopotamia - wouldn't one pick much more capable experienced soldiers of the hundreds available to do the job instead of two young uns lounging under a tree?3. And for 1600 lives wouldn't you send out at least several separate small teams to Ensure at least one would get through?4. Germans supposed to be planning it for months! Yet for some unexplained absurdity only a few mid-tier generals know about it and at the so very last minute? And these guys and their troops are supposed to have been cut off in No Mans Land and somehow have the means to suddenly discover this major German project but yet can't get a that critical message through except via two scrambling young uns? Come on!5. Booby trapping the position you leave behind is as old as war gets ... yet two supposedly trained soldiers saunter in gaily without a care?6. An underground explosion that could bring the structure down would mean near fatality. Even if not, ones eardrums would be a goner. Yet moments later the that same two could be gaily sharing a joke about a rat bitten ear? Huh?7. And of course that ridiculously miraculous grazing cow and fresh pail of milk out of nowhere, the on-target crash landing plane, all that silly missed shots at close range. Wow! Gadzillions huh??!8. Frantic frantic message to deliver frantic ... yet you sit down and listen to a lullaby with hundreds of your own troops around without raising a sigh?! Supernova huh?!More and more huhs?! Go watch it and you'd find at least another dozen more.It's basically a 2-hour music video suspend your belief visual feast."
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,"We've had so many World War 2 movies but hardly any World War 1 movies. The last one I can think of is Wonder Woman but that wasn't an official World War 1 move. But now we've finally got one in the form of 1917.The story itself is decent although you could argue its not one of the best. But the way it is captured is what makes this movie a very good one.The single shot take works very well. It makes the journey throughout the movie more realistic and making it look like its in real time. The movie also had a lot of intense moments which worked better with the single shot technique.The movie deserves more credit for its cinematography, intensity and realism rather than the story and the history behind it. That was what made it a very good movie but just not one of the best. Having said that though, I do feel this is more in line with director Sam Mendes's forte compared to the James Bond movies. What he tried to do with Skyfall is achieved much better in 1917. Glad hes gone back to where his strengths are."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"What a magical 2 hours this movie delivers...and it goes by fast!
I have never seen a war movie that better telegraphs what it's like for young men in combat, and tells the story through characters you care about. While the horrors of WW1 are there, images are darkened so you can keep your eyes open rather than shutting out in-your-face gore. The acting is superb, soundtrack gorgeous, and cinematography amazing. All four of us loved the film, saying after to each other, ""everyone should see this"", and feeling inspired to read up on WW1 history."
1917,16 February 2020,9/10,"I've watched only a few war films (mostly Vietnam War and maybe one or two WWII pictures) so I can't really compare this to other WWI films. Having just watched this film, I'm glad I haven't watched any of the others because this was quite an experience. Everything about this film was epic-Roger Deakins' smooth cinematography, Lee Smith's seamless editing, Thomas Newman's great score, and Sam Mendes' realistic directing. The concept of a one continuous long shot really fits this film-it really felt like being in the frontlines of a battlefield. The performances, especially George MacKay as Lance Corporal Scofield was captivating. Lance Corporal Blake's death scene near the midpoint was probably one of the best acted scenes I've seen in recent years. It is definitely a cinematic experience that can only be felt by either going to the theater or watching it on a huge screen."
1917,18 February 2020,9/10,"Continuing my ride on the post Oscar bandwagon, I watched ""1917"" a couple of days ago. I was excited because Sam Mendes and the great technical crew from ""Skyfall"" made it-my expectations were high. Having finished the film, I was truly moved. The one continuous shot illusion really made me feel like I was in the frontlines. The beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins was smooth, Thomas Newman's score was daunting, and most of all Sam Mendes' direction was truly epic. For a film that's hyped for its technical achievements, I was more impressed by the performances by the actors. Lance corporal scholfield (played by George MacKay) was a great character, I was able to identify with his mixed feelings about going on this detail. The midpoint scene involving his friend's death was probably one of the best acted scenes I've seen in recent years. Overall, ""1917"" is truly a cinematic experience-go see it on the big screen."
1917,11 October 2021,9/10,"Amazing movie. Of course the most impressive part is the sense of a continuous clip, but this movie has so much more. There is so much value in reading into each line. There is a lot to reflect on historically and from the perspective of lessons to be learned. It's hard to give any movie a 10. This is close, but I can find some places where it could have been improved. Highly recommend this movie."
1917,22 February 2020,10/10,"Just saw this movie last night and it was so good that it's easily one of the top films of 2019 along with Parasite. It richly deserves all the three Oscars that it won. The story, the cinematography and the visual effects all were impressive and amazing and the cast did wonderful job. Recommended for everyone."
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,Some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. The movie itself is fairly boring and slow. Not a ton happens but I think that is the point. To show that war isn't just constant gunfire and explosions. There is a lot of travelling in between those more violent things and more too the soldiers involved.This will win best cinematography at the Oscars for sure.
1917,22 January 2020,8/10,"What is depicted on screen is a work of art than a delineation of war. Sam Mendes 1917 is a visual war poetry,
Other than the technicity of the work, The film is badly written, the number of plot holes and unnecessary coincidences is unforgivable .A solid 7,5/10"
1917,17 January 2020,1/10,"Among all the wars World War I was the worst! Human lives were worthless! Two lance corporals carried a stupid order to the God forsaken front line to stop soldiers from dying? Hell no, these men were doomed no matter what!There is no honor by carrying the message because nobody cares! I can't see any friendship either! So what is left for us to see?"
1917,7 February 2020,10/10,"Immersively done, the movie sucks you into the horror of World War One. The camera tracks these 2 soldiers all the way through their mission with a smooth one shot for the entire length of the movie. According to the director Sam Mendes, it allows you to live with them and breathe every breath. And that feeling of never seeing further than the characters, always being trapped within their immediate environment, was an important reason why they decided to shoot this way. From the acting, to the cinematography, editing, score and overall direction Sam Mendes creates one of the best pieces of film ever to grace the silver screen. Congratulations in advance to 14 times Academy Awards nominee Roger Deakins for all the visual and technical brilliance - guaranteed Oscar for Best Cinematography. And for the critics who complain that there is no character building moment in the movie, it's because the motivation here is to save lives and not focus on characters. #1917 leaves you breathless, with an uplifting feeling (and some tears) when the journey comes to an end.
Only to be seen on the big screen, preferably IMAX 2D."
1917,14 February 2020,10/10,This decades Saving Private Ryan.Plain and simple. 1000 times better than Parasite. No idea how that won over this.
1917,20 April 2020,6/10,"I know some critics fell over themselves praising this movie, but I was very underwhelmed. I vastly respect the men who actually fought in one of the most terrible wars in history, but honestly, this movie falls short of honoring their memory. The acting is very rigid and I honestly had a hard time caring about him or his quest. When he finally delivers the messages, neither the colonel or his partners brother receive the news with much emotion. Rather anticlimactic.
Good cinematography is the main reason I rated it as high as I did."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Every now and then a war movie comes around that does everything it can to place the audience in the reality of the topic, even if the actual plot is a little bit hokey. Saving Private Ryan famously did this, especially for the Omaha Beach landing sequence.1917 does it again for the Western Front of World War 1, in a way I can't remember ever seeing before. It's probably the most accurate depiction of WW1 since the original All Quiet on the Western Front. The attention to detail as the two main characters make their way through the story is incredible, and reminds me of some of the most horrific stories I've read of the war- of soldiers finding themselves laying in mud surrounded by the bodyparts of their mates (and enemies), or of a buddy getting so stuck in the mud in a dangerous place that nobody could rescue him, and he slowly goes insane as he starves to death and is eventually shot out of pity. This last one doesn't happen in the movie, but you could certainly imagine how it could.The way the movie is filmed, famously as a single sequence/shot with only one or two real cuts, makes it extremely immersive. That, plus the attention to detail, turns the film from a typical war movie into more of a horror story. You are seeing the action from the characters' eyes, and it is impossible to know what is coming next. The tension and suspense are as thick as Passchendaele mud.What a great film. It is a masterpiece."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"Not getting all the hype here I'm afraid.
Ok, the Cinematography is excellent but I think we've all seen the story before, it was highly predictable - I can honestly say I saw EVERYTHING coming - no twists in it at all.
Acting was average.
Nothing more to say, wasted enough time watching it without wasting more time writing about it"
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"May be a tad overrated. I don't want to give any spoilers but if it's going to be seen it has to be in the cinema. If you're looking for a film that you're taken aback by the cinematography that looks realistic this is it. That's about it in my opinion.
Don't go in expecting a drama like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge"
1917,24 January 2020,7/10,"Undoubtably a very good movie.
In todays climate of trashy politically charded progressive agenda set pieces, this was a breathe of fresh air..
No gender baiting no race baiting just a story.
Well made and has some great imaginary, a stand out set piece was when our hero was entering a ruined town, the shadows and subtle almost subliminal imagines of German soliders gave expostion as to what was to come and the dangers that lay ahead.. it was masterfully filmed.. blink and you missed the.A few silly little plot holes here and there still didn't ruin the experience, the milk from the last cow in France that had survived German machine gun fire(obvious a set piece for the baby sence which was not needed) the none lesson our hero picked up from the second German that shopped him!! He actually HAD FOOD in his rigging, why was he chuntering on about have no food? The Enfield ammo clip he had only holds 5 rounds, he shot way more than that.. even the scene at the sniper in the building he fired more than 5 rounds without a reload.. im just picking now..Great movie no the less.. and those few points are just me being picky."
1917,22 October 2020,10/10,"I've been putting off seeing this movie for a while - I think largely because I feel that British cinemas golden age with big budgets was in the past, and where as many years ago a Lawrence of Arabia or Zulu wars could demand a massive spectacle and a huge array of extra - Modern, poorer Britain has for me, a tendency to make paltry looking movies, which tends to rely on the superior acting rather than Hollywood style budgets.Hollywood - tends to suffer from the opposite extreme, which is massively too much money, slapped unrealistically onto scenes with cookie cutter costumes, and paint by numbers, buildings. In Hollywood you feel someones just gone to a giant warehouse with the year you want to portray on it - and rolled out all of the correct bric-a-brac.So I imagined I knew what this film would be like, before I'd seen it.So putting it on, I was absolutely blown away.There's not many movies where I could say that I kept rewinding and rewatching the first 6 or 7 minutes ,three or four times before continuing simply because I couldn't believe the staggering set design, the imerisive camera. This was even before any shooting starts.There was none of this close up camera work, to hide the lack of extras and protect the budget. There was none of that scooby doo running down corridors thing, with the same things going past every few seconds.Instead - what we get is something that feels immense, authentic - and you spend a lot of the movie - just thinking HOW in gods name did they do that.It also didnt suffer from any of that British vanity, that all of its soldiers were cheerful cockneys with their chums, or stiff upper lip stoic officers - so you get a measured feeling that this could be taking place now, and a little part of me thought that perhaps it would have been nice to have had the actors date their accents a bit to be more authentic.
As it was the actors could be anyone you met in the pub - where as the reality is, you've only got to listen to a movie of people talking from the 1940s and you know absolutely that they talk differently.
That for me would have improved the movie, but I guess viewers may have felt less involved.But a staggering technical achievement that I've never seen in any movie before.
Loved it"
1917,9 May 2020,10/10,"This film is dedicated to the grandfather of the film's director and co-author, Sam Mendes (nominated for Oscars in both the director and original screenplay categories). The grandfather was a messenger for the British army in World War I and told Mendes many stories about the war. The two main characters, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are ordinary infantrymen, both lance corporals, who are given a mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) cancelling an attack that is doomed to failure. (The telephone lines are not operating.) They have to walk/run nine miles through contested terrain, and some of the individual scenes are quite horrific. The film set is over the days of April 6-7, 1917. The Germans have withdrawn to pre-prepared positions later known as the Hindenberg Line, and the British are pursuing them, not knowing that the Germans have prepared traps. One of the personal touches is that Blake's older brother (Richard Madden) is under Mackenzie's command.
The film's gimmick is that it was photographed in such a way that it appears to be just two continuous takes. The break occurs when one of the main characters is hit on the head during daylight, and it is dark when he wakes up. All the other cuts were cleverly disguised. Nonetheless, this puts the film in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope in which all the takes were exactly 12 minutes, a limitation caused by using traditional film, but the cuts were disguised to give the illusion that the action was continuous. This film was the well-deserved Oscar winner in the cinematography, visual effects, and sound mixing categories."
1917,15 July 2020,,"The script for this war movie is nothing special, but the shots along the trench are very interesting and make the viewers protagonist in first person of the story"
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"I liked the soundtrack and great authentic scenery, and good acting, but long and drawn out, and less fighting than expected for a war film... Worth seeing..."
1917,16 February 2020,7/10,"I loved this right up until the scene where he gets a lift in the truck with a checklist of soldiers covering as many UK accents as possible, all in pretty hammy fashion. The fact that his new chums then left him to get shot at 30 seconds after he got out was pretty harsh, especially considering they all knew the importance of his mission. Throw in the fact that although, I liked the single shot effect they were going for, it gave the feeling of a couple of miles at most being covered, not the 10 or so they were supposed to. Despite my gripes, I would definitely recommend it as there is plenty to like besides the above. The things I've highlighted just took me out of the film too much to rate it any higher unfortunately."
1917,24 August 2020,8/10,"Having 7 nominated in Oscar, and won 3 of them, this fantastic war film 1917 is finally on the big screen in China. Although having Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 4K rescreening as its biggest rival which has earned 31 million dollars since the rescreening, 1917 has earned 9.7 million, a not bad grade.Even though China is one of the victorious countries, the main battlefield was not taken place in China, this film may not raise any emotional feeling or appealing audience by using emotional feeling in China. But its talented and well-known cinematography and screenplay did the job.Using long take is dangerous and difficult, which require many times of rehearsal in advance and all units, not only actors but also the lighting unit, camera unit, sounds and many others cooperating closely than ever. One tiny mistake could ruin the whole take and all unit need to reprepare the set for another take. So how about the whole film is a long take, no other takes, one take and one long take only? Of course, the film is not really a long take, it just looks like a long take, but still, it needs lots of long takes combining together, using few cameras and lightning tricks as the ""glue"" to glue up different parts, all of these are brilliant and brave. Thanks to the marvellous cinematography technique, the audience is like the third soldier in this ""suicide-like"" mission with other who, not as a watcher but more like a witness.Back to the story itself, comparing to the technique, the story seems too simple, the audience may be surprised by the long take but when the film over, rethink the story, it's hard to find a highlight in the story but all are talking about the technique. But the character building, especially some characters only have a few seconds scene, the writer and director know how to introduce a character in a very short time and did a very good job on this part.Overall, 1917 could be a phenomenon film, calling it one of those films which can represent the industry in the past ten years would be quite fair."
1917,14 February 2020,8/10,"Excellent movie, beautiful story telling, moving and excellent acting this is a 'must see' movie"
1917,3 August 2020,2/10,"The cinematography & all that but some things were just silly.An explosion in such an enclosed area & they just brush it off,the milk thing & while everyone listens to some singing someone sneaks in,I mean gee just lucky he wasn't German,theres more but too annoyed."
1917,20 March 2020,9/10,"Am Mendes created an excellent sense of immersion through the strengthening of the rhythm, allowing the audience to understand with their eyes and heart by walking with the soldier and the personal feelings of the soldier's mood change: a normal ordinary How are people gradually distorted, swallowed up by war, and lost all hope."
1917,29 April 2020,8/10,"Long shots of this level can only be the product of this era. I think he has surpassed the traditional technique of so-called lens movement and scheduling, because from this perspective, it is impossible to realize this long lens. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have a feeling that the story after the only shot in that movie is cut off becomes a bit surreal. The sun-like flares, the Madonna-like girl in the basement, the river full of corpses, the nostalgic song that soldiers listened to before going to battle, and the rushing in front of the trench. All of this was so dreamy that I doubted whether the protagonist had actually died under the black shot."
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,"Until today, my favorite war film of all was 'Das Boot'. Now it is my favorite war film about WW-2, because a few hours ago, I watched what, IMHO, is the best war film ever made. And also a masterpiece of modern filmmaking, by director Sam Mendes.On Oscar Sunday, I took my father, a Navy Viet Nam era Veteran, to see '1917'.
We both were blown away by this film. The actors, the cinematography, the way the camera never left the main characters... the realism of the sudden shocks, uncertainty, and horrors of war... not just WW-1, but of all wars, in all eras. ""War is Hell"" someone once said, and this film proved the point to me.If you like a gripping war or action type film, if you are a film student or budding filmmaker, love historical & period films, or just enjoy a great story... there is all of that and more in '1917'."
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"Terribly boring, you don't care about the characters, acting is poor, dialogue is so boring and the actors seem fake, nothing about this movie seems real other than the dead horses. Cinematography is bleak and just plain ugly. One of the most overrated films ever BY FAR I think people just think you are supposed to like war movies or something. The one shot trick does not make a good film. People in the theater were sighing, shuffling, then chatting, one man fell sound asleep. People seemed to go to the bathroom constantly, trying to kill time I guess. I finally just started checking my email. Painfully boring film, cold and emotionless, even with the cliched loud dramatic music. I hated this movie with a passion."
1917,18 October 2020,8/10,"I wanted to watch it on IMAX but could not. It looked great on home video as well.A fascinating story of a journey through the enemy territory to deliver a crucial message, the movie has been brillintly executed. They claim it to be a one shot movie, but you will feel the transitions somehow, though done very nicely. The very long shots are superbly done."
1917,25 October 2020,5/10,"If you are looking for yet another good war film, look no further: 1917 will keep you on your feet throughout and only someone completely heart- and mindless would not feel for what people on screen have to go through.Yet, why? Why are we making these films about war, where filmmakers and storytellers try so hard to make us believe how terrible and traumatic war must be? Listen to soldiers, civilians, all of those people who had to experience it, read history books, watch historical material.Film wise: great cinematography, acting, sets. The rest is the usual formula you will see in all other war films. After watching it I felt like, what did I expect, why did I even watch it?It makes me feel bad giving a lower rating for the film, reading that some veterans would give 10 because 1917 feels so realistic. No offence in any form. I guess if we would really honour the fallen from the wars in the past, we should stop making new ones in the present. This film made it absolutely clear for me: I don't need to see the brutality and senselessness of war anymore; I got it before, really."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"'1917' is a landmark in cinema history. Never before has WW1 been reconstructed and portrayed in such a terrifyingly honest and tender light from such an intimately human perspective. In fact, rarely have any films matched what Sam Mendes has achieved here.Continuous 'one-shot' camera work places the viewer in a striking first-hand point of view. Gritty, bleak, historically accurate sets immerse you in the battlefield. Whether that's in the haunted bones of a crumbling French town, seeing the pockmarking of cavernous craters, brushing shoulders with servicemen in cramped trenches, or pacing through the sheer accompanying volume of corpses, blood, mud, and dust. The imminence of death overshadows constantly.Mendes' focus on character development imprints a deep purpose for the events of the film; saving 1600 men, including the brother of one of the main characters, from a looming German entrapment.
The Germans have made a ""strategic withdrawal"", suggesting that they are on the run. In fact they're lying in wait, armed and ready to repel the planned British push. It's a race against time to deliver the message on foot to call off the push.
George MacKay and Dean-Charles are perfectly cast as Schofield and Blake. Each character's motivations are clear, at times shared, at times not. Mendes has developed above all believable, complex, and genuine human characters to colour the dark, dreary setting of the production. The outstanding score brings this to even greater heights."
1917,3 March 2020,9/10,"A must watch for fans of great movies.
Don't miss this one."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"On one hand we have; solid acting, great costume and production design and good cinematography (especially during the ""flare night"" scene). On the other one the script was effective, at times, but very simple, and directing and editing were going for a one take type of film which they didn't take It to It's logical extreme cuting in obvious moments.
However, the only things I'm sure we all agree will be the bad CGI and the overused and annoying music that was anything but helpful for the experience except for a couple of scenes.I have to say tho It is pretty hard get an immersive experience from a movie If you spend first 30 minutes smelling popcorn and hearing how people eat and drink like animals. And, ofcourse, not watching a great movie helps I guess."
1917,8 January 2020,9/10,"I got to see this film for a second time tonight, and it was even better than the first time. This film is a technical marvel. Roger Deakins is the greatest cinematographer to ever live, and he should win an Oscar once more for this film. I don't agree that the story and characters were surface level. I thought the acting was great and very underrated. I thought they were a step above most war films and because of that this made for one of the best war films I've ever seen. The cinematography combined with the score made for one of the most emotional and nail biting experiences of the year. It's not my favorite or the best out of the Best Drama nominations at the Golden Globes, but it definitely deserved the win as well as Best Director. It's one of the best films of the year, it opens wide this Thursday, go see it as soon as possible."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is a truly riveting war movie about a messenger who has to brave through enemy lines to deliver a message. The plot sounds boring, but being a war movie, you can expect a lot of action. The choice for long shot was good because the audience is there with the character and fully sees the world from the protagonist's point of view. This limits the visual scope and creates suspense. There are indeed many suspenseful moments. Sam Mendes brilliantly captures the grimness and unpredictability of war amidst plush scenery. Though our character is sent to prevent a rash attack by British soldiers, through the journey we can feel the exhaustion and just want our hero to escape alive and forget about the mission. The performances were great, needless to say. These are men in battle at the spur of the moment, and the time span is practically the runtime, so there is no time for detailed character exposition or development. What is seen is what you would see from a real person. Of course you may note that all British characters are decent people, even in face of death. So there is some idealization of World War 1 British soldiers. Interestingly, German soldiers are portrayed as people out there to fight, and they are human too. One even has a name. 1917 is a gruelling war adventure movie that balances action, spectacle, and drama. A definite must watch for all"
1917,28 January 2021,7/10,"Sometimes I watch a Film that comes highly recommended - and can find it a little disappointing. '1917' was more than that - it struck me very soon into the Film that, whatever story this was, it was so Fictionalised it bore no semblance to the reality of the Year it was trying to portray. Supposedly the 6th April 1917 two (yes, TWO) British Soldiers are ordered to make their way forward to make contact with a British Unit that is being led into a 'trap' with orders to stop any such assault. I would like to say that there is more to the story than that BUT there isn't. The Film is shot in an apparent 'one continuous take' pseudo-documentary way which occasionally rankles. Make no mistake though, the Cinematography by Roger Deakins FULLY deserves the Oscar it was awarded - it is just that the actual depiction of WW1 and story make no sense whatever. There are real issues - firstly, I never felt that the dialog or the actors were in 'period' being too 21st Century and not Early 20th (for how to do this see 'Gettysburg' where the lines and pace of the actors match the 19th Century). Secondly, the story unfolds across a landscape in which all the elements are there BUT you never get the REAL horror of what it was truly like to fight in this hell-hole. I'm not even going to comment on some of the more absurd aspects. A General in a front-line dugout? Not likely! Save 1600 men from an ambush - by sending TWO? A RAT setting off a booby-trap in a German underground bunker? I could go on but it is pointless.
The only 'enemy' to appear are not even stereotypes, just absurd - a German pilot who survives a flaming crash in his Albatros fighter because our two heroes pull him from the flaming wreckage - immediately decides to pull a knife and attack one of them. What?? The other German soldiers also conform to the 'Star Wars Stormtrooper Complex' - where, despite their military reputation, they simply cannot shoot straight. These would be the same troops who, the previous year, caused horrific casualties to the British on The Somme.
Overall, this is a very well-made piece of Cinema BUT simply is NOT accurate in it's depiction of the 'Great War' and feel an opportunity has been missed.
I even felt that it's award of the Oscar for 'Best Visual Effects' was undeserved as they just weren't good at all (that Oscar should have gone to Alita: Battle Angel).
Once again, too many British Film critics were happy to jump on the Mendes bandwagon calling this a 'masterpiece' - it isn't - Kubrick's 'Paths Of Glory' is WAY superior to this...."
1917,3 January 2020,10/10,An incredible movie which will leave you exhausted.The camera barely stops moving forwards for a second and you are propelled through a journey along with the soldiers that is worth watching more than once.Loved it!
1917,2 May 2021,5/10,"Not my cup of tea. Not ""Gallipoli"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" experience (since they are also war films). It lacked something in emotion I felt. Felt more interested in the technical aspect to make the viewer think it was done in one shot. Of course not and you can see it. Having focused on that, it wasn't ""Birdman"" quality.All in all, been done before. So nothing new here."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,A must see movie. One of the best war ever. I was crying like baby.
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Not a big fan of films set around this era and war so going into this I had no expectations.
But afterwards I could not fault this film at all. The direction of this was stunning and the continuous shot was incredible you felt like you were with the main character the whole way.
I'd give this a clear 10/10 a must see."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,I can only add what the majority of people have said which is to say awesome breathtaking rollercoaster ride through hell. This is a movie that must be seen and must be seen on the biggest screen. And prepare to be immersed in what has to be said the cinematic experience of the year. This has to seen by the young generation now so they can witness what many of their age sacrificed for freedom and democracy. Their comradeship and the sense of duty. This film had me gripped from beginning to end with some superb performances and worthy of oscars. I would also add as an ex serving soldier that I was impressed with the attention to details although there were some goofs notably pointed out on the site. I would also like to add that this was my feeling and if someone else doesnt feel the film was that good thats there opinion when they then decide to call people names because they dont aspire to their point of view they demean themselves and there review should not be posted - Can IMBD ensure that people posting comments have some decency and respect for people s opinion even if it doesnt reflect theirs and refrain from calling people cretins and brainless
1917,27 January 2020,6/10,"You have to admire the technical achievement and the art direction. It really looks like the actors are moving through endless trenches and battlefields. Some of it must have been CGI-ed, though you can't tell what. You soon forget you're watching ""one shot"". Of course it isn't one shot. It's just made to look like it.What lets the film down is an implausible, paper-thin storyline (the upper echelons of the British military were inept, but even they wouldn't have sent only two soldiers to relay a vital message calling off a doomed advance) that unavoidably glamorises WWI. It's as if the film-makers were still in James Bond fantasy land, and were primarily concerned with one question: what's exciting? Ooh, I know! A bunker collapsing! A plane crashing right on to the main characters! A chase through a ruined town spookily lit by swinging flares! A fall into a raging river! A ridiculous run along the front line just as the soldiers are going over the top, making such a thing more difficult to negotiate than the trenches themselves. Realistic this film is not. At least with a movie like Saving Private Ryan the action sequences were in service of an interesting plot that had some basis in fact. Here they're just shoved in for no good reason.To me, it's a shame. There must be a million actual, real-life WWI stories that haven't been told on film. Why didn't Sam Mendes tell one of them instead of going for this fiction?"
1917,2 January 2020,10/10,"Yep, if you're tired of watching a bunch of ill disciplined Yankee grunts running around and shooting at everything that moves then watch this."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"A simple plot with an impeccable storytelling and intense performances. It was a breathtaking technical achievement those long take shots, thrilling background score and flawless editing makes it an absolute immersive experience.
2 hours of an eye catching epic war drama from Sam Mendes which should be seen. This film will embrace every movie buff who are starving out there."
1917,11 January 2021,10/10,"So i watched the Parasitee first and is totally a great movie with an amazing screenplay,an excellent idea...Then the Oscar's came and it didnt happen to see the movie 1917 but i have heard that this movie is full one shot and i kept telling to myself...""It is a one shot war movie right? It cant lose the best cinematography Oscar right...The Parasites took the Oscar and i was sure that this has to be a bad movie to lose the Oscar after this clues...And then i gave it a try...Yea im not gonna EVER see the Oscars again...This movie is epic the screenplay is fine,the 2 leading actors are very good,the music is AMAZING,and the cinematography is far from PHENOMENAL like the best i have ever seen...I feel like is the biggest steal of an Oscar i have ever witness..."
1917,8 February 2020,7/10,"There is a lot to admire about 1917: The amount of detail put into all environemnts, the amount extras who elevate the atmosphere with their human touch, the way a flare can be seen falling after it was fired away from camera and off-screen, and the way Schofield bumps into charging soliders in his rush to prevent the attack. While not ""gritty"" the film is certainly grounded, which is a must for all good war films.However, 1917 is not without fault. Despite having an intriguing opening and tense finale, the second act of the film goes on to drag a little. For instance the scene where Schofield encounters a french woman and her baby is, while touching, ultimately meaningless as it does nothing but act as filler. The action in this segment of the film feels quite cartoonish too, with Schofield dodging more bullets than James Bond during Pierce Bresnan's reign. The poor aim of the Germans makes for a tenseless second-act, because Scofield's plot armour is impenetrable.So if you're going in looking for a war film with plenty of good action and decent pacing then you might be disapointed. But this film makes up for many of it's flaws through good dialogue writing, which really immerses the audience in this brilliantly realised world, and the performsnces of just about every actor involved.Overall I found more to enjoy about this movie than to critisise, so I would recommend you watch it. It's moving, well shot, written and acted and so certainly stands worthy of some of its oscar nominations."
1917,1 December 2020,10/10,"There a few films one can count as such. This graphic, stunningly scenic story sums up the horror of it all.
The absolute pit of human experience, yet the most supreme of character.
This is no glossy, heroic war film, although it has it's heroes.
Instead it is a realistic and brutal record of the times.
Superb."
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes takes a simple story and turns it into a technically stunning cinematic masterpiece. Likable leads, gripping action, and unrivaled cinematography come together for a movie-going experience unlike any other, and one of the best war films of our generation."
1917,11 February 2020,7/10,"As a synopsis is not required on such a splendid tense action film set in the murderous fields of the somme, story similar to Gallipoli where instead of Mel Gibson runner messenger segment in the end of the movie trying to relay orders of cancellation of advance push into a slaughter.
1917 entirety focuses on getting this letter order message to halt the advance of 1600 men to their deaths by next day, couriering by two lance corporals and one of them has a brother in one of the battalions!One of the main characters running across the field during battle towards the end has the worst CGI as you can see no shadows under his feet as he dashes
in front of charging men!"
1917,9 October 2020,10/10,"This is one of the greatest and well crafted films ever made. From acting to the score. From the unique editing and directorial direction. This film stupefies it's viewers into a hypnotic state where they can't look away. Whether beauty or horror, you can't look away, your heart racing the entire time."
1917,6 February 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins especially have truly out done themselves here.
The actors performances very natural, amazing cinematography, realistic locations, beautiful score and a true front line war experience, this movie truly lived up the hyped and is the next best movie since Hacksaw Ridge was released a couple years ago.As much as this was a war movie, I would say it is actually an action/journey adventure film since it's not about combat itself but a mission and the experience we go through with the protagonist.This is the type of movie Dunkirk should have been as Dunkirk was a huge disappointment.If you want a movie experience in the likes of The Revenant and a war genre film, make sure to watch this!!!"
1917,27 January 2020,7/10,"I would of given this film a 10 if it didn't have such loud, non-stop background music that usually drowned out all voices."
1917,17 February 2020,9/10,Being edited to show one shot was such a great experience. Really love this movie! Very well done!
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"1917 awesome epic of a thing. Todays youth should be made to view it. The cogent stench of death and arrogance is in your face. This is what transpires when peoples cut the dialogue off. The scene where the officer suggests to our runner soldier to have present some witnesses at the message delivery point is so apt then and now. Magnificient effort.
Patrick"
1917,22 March 2020,8/10,"Since the movie was announced, it was clear that it is a film that has its place in cinematic artifacts, especially with the announcement of the starring team, And with the appearance of the first trailer, it was well confirmed, Film 1917 makes you live through the events and feel what the soldier feels from start to finish, Also, the performance of all actors, especially George MacKay Who deserves an Oscar nomination. But the most important thing remains the direct and indiscriminate directing of the method of filming that would otherwise have been an ordinary film in my view It suffices to name the director Sam Mendes. What is wrong with the movie is that it is a little slow, as if you feel that there is no struggle with time.
1917 is a masterpiece."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"One of the few movies that will make you regret that you stopped doing something one day, but in the same time. However, it will teach you to keep you going forward. I saw this in 2020, and I still think that it is the best movie I've ever seen, the way it is crafted makes feel ambitious about filmmaking in the future, plus the feeling of being a soldier as a viewer is fabulous. Honestly, I don't know what to say more about it, easily Best Picture of 2019, not only for GG, but for everybody who watched it."
1917,6 July 2020,7/10,"I've been a hard-core James Bond fan since seeing Golfinger as a kid in 1964 and thought Sam Mendes directed the worst 007 action finale with the stumbling ""Home Alone"" shootout in Skyfall.
With that in mind I was curious to see how Mendes would direct an entire film set in a combat zone - and one with the gimmick of appearing to be one continuous shot.
And clearly 1917 is technically impressive as it seamlessly follows the two young soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force as they cross trenches, tunneled installations and burning towns.
But as I found with Skyfall, 1917 lacks real urgent credibility and bite. It's more of a technical exercise with flat characterizations instead of an engaging vision about the Great War.
First, the concept that British high command would be concerned about stopping an attack of a few thousand men is preposterous in a war in which many more were sacrificed every day.
There was also the cloying need for the soldiers to spend time interacting with the various people and scenarios the script throws in their path instead of hurrying to complete their time-sensitive mission.
And as others have pointed out, the scenarios with the sniper and the Germans in the burning town are not credible or satisfying
By the end it's an adequate war film - but those who say it is one of the best ever clearly haven't seen Battle of Algiers, Come and See or All Quiet on the Western Front."
1917,13 March 2020,,"The faux single shot gimmick was technically impressive but that's all this film has going for it, the rest is laughably bad.Our protagonist lurches from one ludicrous situation to another while German soldiers do all they can to rival Star Wars Stormtroopers as the worst shots in cinematic history. There are only so many contrived coincidences and inexplicably missed shots you can take before suspending your disbelief becomes impossible and all you can do is laugh.Let's not beat about the bush here, this film is appalingly written, relying almost wholly on utterly unrealistic situations, preposterous coincidences, plot armour, cliches and cheap sentiment and should have been laughed out of cinemas, but apparently a bit of technical wizardy is all it takes these days to be declared a masterpiece."
1917,10 January 2021,7/10,"A very moving WW1 film, supposedly inspired by the stories of Mendes' grandfather who he thanked the film war. A good piece to watch on rememberence day.Puts into perspective the harsh realities of war and questions the bureaucratic forces of the army that in many ways still hold today.Beautiful cinematography and fine acting. Definitely a big step up for Amazon Productions."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"I watched this in the comfort of my bed (award consideration copy), its a good movie with great shots. However, when compared to saving private Ryan or black hawk down, it doesn't stand well. Why? There aren't enough in depth battle scenes to be captivated with. The friendship of the two doesn't have enough depth or poignancy to really make you care. It's almost as though the film is a private was created by one person's recollection of a father's tale.
This is a 5 movie because it missed an opportunity to be bigger and better than dunkirk but gets an extra star for not being more sc superhero drab...
It's worth the watch, but wait until you too can do it in the comfort of your own home."
1917,8 February 2020,3/10,I found myself more interested in how they choreographed the shots rather than what was happening in the film. None of the characters meant anything to me and there's were too many cliches. Bomb explodes in their faces and not a scratch. Germans missing from point blank. You get the drift...
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,"We don't really know anything about the star of the movie and so there is no investment in him. Yes we want him to make the journey to warn the troops and we go along the run with him, but really that's it. It's an empty movie, by the time he finds the brother for his friend you have forgotten all about his friend and know nothing about him so you really don't care. Such a shame..."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"I have soo many thoughts on 1917 but I'll keep this short.
1917 is by far one of the greatest films I've had the pleasure in viewing and experiencing. The most immersive film I've experienced in my life. Not only was this a great war film but just a great film in general. Right up there with other great war films like Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, and Hacksaw Ridge. A beautiful artistic, character driven film, a journey I won't soon be forgetting. A must see in any premium format you can manage to view it in.
10/10"
1917,30 November 2020,1/10,"I love war movies but I was sorely disappointed by 1917. First, I expected a movie about the year 1917 in the context of WWI, but only got one day of 1917, so I quickly felt misled. Great cinematography... I guess? I noticed it was a single shot early on and from then on was distracted by it. The music was often too obvious. I know there wasn't much they could do aurally with so little dialogue but I hate when I actually notice background music because that means it's not blended well into the movie. The plot was too simple and without much background on the characters, I wasn't invested in them as individuals. The most interesting thing about the movie for me was that two Game of Thrones actors played brothers and I can now ponder why an A-list actor like Benedict Cumberbatch would bother with a small, insignificant role in such a boring movie."
1917,13 February 2020,7/10,"I was expecting much more. I have seen much better movies about the war and sacrifice etc. That one was quite slow, even boring in places. To be honest I have no idea why all those nominations and awards.....
I do appreciate the effort and the realistic side of showing how it was during a war.... So my rating is not lower than 7 but will not watch it again. Sorry, maybe I didn't get it....."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is the story of brotherhood and friendship during the war. What's beautiful in 1917 is that it's a very simple story, a basic plot but told with so much ambiguity and depth.
Like Roma last year, 1917 is definitely an immersive film, it enhances the conditions of human beings during war. The one-take technic makes it more immersive and easily brings emotions, suspense and tension to the simple plot.
Technically, it's 10/10. The cinematography is PERFECT. The set decoration is so specific and accurate. The score brings emotions and the sounds and effects are intense. It seems that all reunites to make it a good movie.
Now, why 9 not 10 out of 10. I think it misses something that could have made it the best of the year. And that missing thing is definitely on the plot which is too simple, and predictable for me. I think they could've had one more emotional climax of an intensity like no other scene in the film, it would've been perfect. Not saying that there's no emotional scene of the film (there are plenty actually), but those scenes are like on the same level of emotional degree. Another one with a little bit more would've fit perfectly.
Now, I think it's still a frontrunner for Best Picture, though there are so many great films in competition that I think everything's possible now."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"I liked the single shot narrative, which worked really well....the story is very simple....nothing too graphic...with a few surprises. Not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan though...in my opinion...Worth watching."
1917,6 February 2020,9/10,"Enough has been said about the apparently single shot in the movie. But the film is more than that. It is raw and explicit when it comes to showing the hopelessness people experienced during wars. Some scenes are really eerie while some scenes evoke dread. Over all, this movie is a masterpiece and should not be missed in theatres. If you have an IMAX screen nearby, do watch in that."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,I entered the movie thinking I was going to see another war movie. Another thousand bullets killing a hundred people. I entered with high expectations but low hopes. But I can't describe what I thought when I left. How can I?I have only been moved by two other movies as much as this movie; Shawshank and The Revenant. I almost never feel emotion other than excitement over a movie. But this movie was one that no man can describe in less than one hundred words. This was the best war movie I have ever seen.
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"1917 a film about a race against time,writing was clean and simple but conflicts was powerful,technical aspects are makes this film convincing and real,performance of lead characters was fantastic especially McKay writers,director Sam mended,dop roger deakins,music director,production designer all done their job very well a fine film given by Sam mended and crew"
1917,30 March 2020,1/10,So now we rate movies on looks alone?It might look authentic but everything that is happening is unrealistic. Want an example?If you go covertly into enemy territory and find a bucket with still hot coals you DO NOT kick it over and make a noise that potentially announces your arrival.I'm surprised all these ex military 10/10 reviews haven't pointed out more of this nonsense because the film is full of it.
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,"If you're going into this thinking you're going to get an all out bloody war story, you're going to be disappointed. The story is great, and the way it was filmed is awesome, but as far as action, you kind of saw it all in the trailer.
Story is filled with tense moments, and a twist I didn't quite see coming.
Overall, it was enjoyable. Sad at moments, but war isn't a happy thing. Kinda felt like it needed something more, but can't put my finger on what.
🎬"
1917,5 May 2020,9/10,"Is it a happy ending? I don't know. He convinced the general to let the troops go and avoid more innocent casualties.

1917,15 May 2020,8/10,"Sad songs, cruel war, beautiful world, people's lives! The peace of the world, the age of peace, the advance of the age, the world of advance! The war brought life to humans, and it started to feel boring, but when the flowers fell and the song of the woods came, the sense of involvement was super strong! The ruins of the war are in sharp contrast with the beautiful environment. Hope the world will always be peaceful!

1917,20 June 2021,9/10,"Finally gotten around to watching this and it was wonderful. Fully deserving of all its praise and awards.The production and cinematography is among the best of all movies I've ever seen. Stunning and technical camerawork. Beautiful colours even during the bleak scenes. Fantastic manipulation of the lighting especially during this one scene.Acting was first grade, story was cohesive albeit unconvincing in some parts. There's a subpar scene that stood out to me and personally, I do not care for it. It's just jarring and could be written better or even removed altogether. It just bothers me that scene after scene, it was good up until that point and all I could think about was ""well that was a useless scene"".Other than that, it was a good film and deserving of all its praise. Would recommend to all."
1917,12 February 2020,4/10,"First World War. Blake and Schofield, two British soldiers, have to deliver a message to an isolated regiment. If the message doesn't reach them, 1600 men are going to die. It's going to be a near impossible task for the two young men, but nevertheless they dare to cross the enemy line.Frankly, Sam Mendes' 1917 is a big disappointment. It looks amazing, that much is true, but everything else is severely lacking. Yes, the camera by the always amazing Roger Deakins is a highlight: The scope is unbelievably wide, yet it feels like Deakins is teasing and daring the audience to look beyond the movie screen. Fantastic stuff! But visuals alone don't make a movie.There's rarely a theme in 1917 that feels fresh and daring. It's a textbook war movie: There's a tragic death, a big shootout and a forced moment of tenderness and love. It's so predictable it's almost painful. The set piece at the end is truly breathtaking, but the ending itself is downright sappy.At the end of the day, 1917 doesn't bring many new ideas to the table. It tries to wow the audience with grandiose landscapes, but the two soldiers and their quest keep strangely one-dimensional."
1917,1 January 2020,8/10,"I could do well making a (Top 5 movie) copy, say Kindler's List, or 1915- and use the same premise... but how inventive and creative would that be? Already proven to be exceptional, the SPR formula is a War masterpiece- but to call this movie an achievement, well, not really, as it's been done before. I like the movie, a lot. It just seems that folks making the big bucks in cinema today, should be paid to 'Innovate'... not Imitate."
1917,8 January 2020,4/10,"I was fooled into watching this film expecting it to be something special by the ""Golden Globe"" award for Best Drama. In fact, I was so fooled that by the end of it, for a second I was almost convinced it was 'that' good since the final scene was touching. I ignored and overlooked many, many flaws throughout the runtime to give it a fair chance like I do with most movies that are decent. This sometimes includes pretending I didn't pick up on a flaw, an error, a bad performance, or an implausibility.However, after I slept on it and reflected on these things, I had to change my mind, and I just could not ignore the glaring flaws, which were somewhat juvenile and made it feel like the movie was written by a 12-year old.There are numerous scenes in this movie (and they are the ones that are supposed to be the 'most dramatic' and 'intense') that are actually implausible to the point that they can be ridiculed and mocked at how unrealistic they are. In fact, you can actually laugh at them, despite the movie taking these scenes so seriously. It tries to sell itself or pawn itself off as some realistic, gritty take on WWI (and it ""almost"" succeeds, and it does hit the mark at scarce moments), but you can't help but notice that simultaneously it also feels like some kind of unrealistic action movie with maybe Schwarzenegger as its lead since the main actor has laughable plot armor on him.Does it suffice for a new war movie for 2019? Sure, if you want to see a new war movie, then this will give you that genre. And yes, the cinematography is undeniably well-done and at times a marvel to look at. But if you actually stand this movie up against the true great war movies, it really is nothing special. It had a couple of good scenes and traits, but overall it's just not that good.Forget about SPRyan comparisons. It's not even close to that. But for a WWI movie, to even compare it to Atonement in terms of quality would be stretching it; it doesn't have any depth like that does.4/10"
1917,9 January 2020,4/10,"This movie is being shilled by the studio and producers. Any negative review is being brigaded. I liked American Beauty, but Mendes looks like the bully-type and they are probably sensitive since they have high profit-hopes for this to rebound after the GG. A 100 million dollar budget and the film only grossed about 2.5 million in the US..Questions:The camera work is awesome, but be warned this is not a great war movie. It's an average war movie with major flaws. The entire scenario isn't even sensical or plausible; like other people have said- if it was so important, why not fly a plane to reach them? Why weren't these two somewhat inexperienced soldiers protected and accompanied by at least a few more soldiers if it was so important? Why were the two soldiers so clean-cut and clean-shaven that they looked like female primadonnas in the middle of WWI? Why would they dumbly and naively try to save an enemy pilot without caution to the point one of them is stabbed (were they not trained properly in boot camp and the military?). Why are they so alone and isolated on the farm, but just so conveniently suddenly after the one of them dies, another battalion happens to show up immediately at that moment (for one-take, one-shot continuity, of course)? Why is the commander of the big battle so easy to reach by an unknown subordinate who hasn't proven to be trustworthy? Why is the soldier who prevails beyond the pilot saving scene so impervious to bullets and gunfire- is he Rambo or Commando? (He doesn't look like it). Why does it happen that the one little room he hides out in in the middle of such a horrific war has this perfectly made up young female with a baby in it (Oh and slap yourself in the head that you didn't think of it- yes, the milk he got from the farm is just so perfectly arranged to be used here; could you be manipulated for sentimentalism any more?). Why did the soldier who was chasing him just decide to give up when he jumped in the river? Why in the final scene are bombs landing all around him as he foolishly runs above the bunker, but he doesn't get a scratch on him? Why didn't the brother look anything like the other one, and why when he was told to look at the casualty area was the other brother perfectly unscathed?Again, the camera work is outstanding, acting suffices, but some of the scenes and writing is downright implausible and almost funny. Was there a GG sympathy award handed to this to help it at the box office or with viewership by giving it recognition or something? It's a decent movie, but other than cinematography, it's not award-worthy on that high of a level."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"A pure cinematic achievement. I was only born when the first The Lord of The Rings (2001) came into theaters and I truly believe I am feeling how the rest of the world did when they first saw Middle Earth.1917 is a breathtaking, heart pulsing and technically outstanding film that based on its creation alone, deserves your attention. This film is beyond words, direction, cinematography, performance, editing, sound are all at the highest of qualities.Recently knighted (and deservedly so) Sam Mendes has crafted a masterpiece, his magnum opus, a personal film for him that follows admittedly a simple story that follows war film beats that we are familiar with but the presentation of this beats are anything but simple.The direction and creation of this film is beyond anything I've seen, it is a true experience. Roger Deakins (if he hasn't already) cements himself as the best cinematographer of all time, aided by editor Lee Smith's crafty tricks.Sound is used superbly, at times it is loud, boisterous but Mendes knows how to use the nuance of sound and does so when needed. The costume and overall production is acute and precise with attention to detail being of upmost importance.The score was great although I did find a lack of cohesiveness with it.The performances are sublime, George MacKay proves himself yet again after star making turns in Pride (2014) and Captain Fantastic (2016). Dean Charles Chapman from Game of Thrones fame is great in his role but I believe he still has a way to go.Strong nuanced support from Mark Strong (as usual), Daniel Mays, Andrew Scott, Adrian Scarborough Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth. Whilst Richard Madden is the cherry on top appearing in the final scene.Historically it was great to see Sikh soldiers (my own religion) after being omitted from Dunkirk (2017) despite their relevance in the events.This film is just a great feat of filmmaking. At one point I cried purely because of how brilliantly this film was made. Sam Mendes has created a cinematic masterpiece, one that must be seen to be believed, I urge everyone to see it as it is some of the purest, brilliant and unbelievable filmmaking in recent memory.It will be long before another film, let alone a war film leaves its audience the way it did mine. Heart racing literal hours after viewing, hands trembling but completely and utterly appreciative of the gifted filmmaking we bore witness to.1917 is a gift to cinema."
1917,9 March 2021,9/10,"I've read at least 100 books on World War 1, watched several versions of All Quiet on the Western Front and most US pre WWII films on the Great War. I thought I had a fair knowledge of trench warfare and No Man's Land but nothing I've ever read or seen captures the sheer inhumanity of this conflict or the humanity of men who fought it like this film. The story is wonderful, the music powerful, the acting and directing first rate, and the cinematography cutting edge and breathtaking. It's as fine a war film as I've ever seen and I've been watching them for more than half a century. See it!"
1917,26 June 2020,9/10,"The first aspect that captured my attention was the outstanding cinematographic skills shown in the extremely long shots, beginning right from the start of the movie. I really could not help but marvel at this feat.
1917 is an anti war movie, and it has managed to get this idea across by the omniscience of pain and suffering. That is pretty much what the plot is about: loss and heartbreak in war, accompanied by extinguished ideas of hope and reunion. Aside from the cinematography, the grand scale and formidable magnitude of war is portrayed by the help of excellent sound effects. Of course I cannot say for sure how war really is, but 1917 makes it feel so real.
To me, the reasons 1917 is not to the degree of superlative is because the plot points are not new, and it lacks a profound social message."
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"This story is so well told and so heart breaking. I didn't know much about it going into it besides that it was a war movie, but after watching it it is so much more. It tells the side of the war that the people don't see. The compassion that we still give as humans even though there is chaos and death all around. The story of the men who went to war and what they experienced during it.
Honestly an hour into it I couldn't believe it because it felt like such a short time. I was so fully engrossed into the movie and it had my attention completely throughout the entire movie.
I would highly recommend that you give this movie a watch and see what you would take from it yourself."
1917,29 March 2020,8/10,"This is surreal filmaking with stunning cinematography and excellent performances from both leads, one of finest war films ever made."
1917,2 October 2020,9/10,"A deep dive into the miseries of wars, a magnificent masterpiece telling the story of two lance corporals in the first world war ..I really really *really* liked the cinematography, it's legendary the movie runs through as if it's one shot all running along without any pause or transitions a story running along for two hours ..And I also liked the soundtracks so much, it succeds on conveying the emotions of courage, fright, rage, grief ..It deserves the oscars ..

1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is nothing short of a technical masterclass and I'm really glad I got to see it before the Oscars. Roger Deakins cinematography mixed with an excellent score and terrific acting easily makes it one of the big fishes of 2019. Sam Mendes helming direction yet again proving why he is one of the best man still working.The movie has tons of big names but in very small roles and its totally fine. The relative newcomers Dean Chapman and George Mckay were truly show stealers. This could've easily been a war movie with just great visuals, instead it is a war movie with fantastic acting and a simplified plot. The plot is basically conveying a message to a battalion to stop the march. But what it lacks in plot depth it makes up with its luscious screenplay and extremely fitting sets and settings. The bleak visuals, a gloomy patch of grey and straw all builds the already neck high tension and keeps alleviating it.The suspense is just too much at times, the characters do get breaks but when it gets serious its almost heartpounding. The deafening score highly contributes to the increasing tension and it doesn't shy away from occasional surprises. I do have to say a few words about how it was shot. It was sort of edited to be one shot and although at times it doesn't add anything to the storytelling and strains your eye on the constant panning, it does infact grow on you and get you hooked in no time. Truly marvelous editing right there.All in all 1917 can and should easily grab a few of the Oscars and definitely make things a lot harder for the other nominees, that should be enough reason to give it a try before making your prediction list.RATING: 9/10"
1917,17 June 2020,10/10,"I am pretty late to reviewing 1917, I saw it as soon as it came out in theatres and by God is this a cinematic experience! If you didn't see this movie in the cinema, what were you doing? I mean seriously! What were you wasting your time on, because this movie is amazing! I've seen many great films this decade, don't get me wrong, but 1917 might be the best of them! The atmosphere and the cinematography of this movie makes you feel like you're part of the war, Roger Deakins is easily the greatest cinematographer working today and that is just a straight fact. At times, it can get a bit overwhelming, I must admit. There were many times during the film where I would burst into tears! The hype is real, watch this movie if you haven't! One thing that made me really sad is that this film did not win ""Best Picture"" Oscar, sure, you can say Parasite all you want, but at the end of the day 1917 is a practically flawless film and everything about it is perfect. Like I've said the feel to this film is mastered so well and Roger Deakins, VERY well deserved of his Oscar win for ""Best Cinematography"" category. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that Sam Mendes directs the sh** out of this movie! His script was amazing, the dialogue is fantastic, that little performance by Benedict Cumberbatch was awesome, everything about this movie hit the right note.I don't want to make this review too long, as I believe over the past few weeks my reviews have been getting more lengthy, so I'll stop right here and just say, SEE IT ASAP!"
1917,12 September 2020,8/10,"A very good movie technically, wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins, and very beautiful and touching music by Thomas Newman ❤"
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,1917 is the BEST war movie ever! Great job by the cast as well as great directing by Sam Mendes. I can see why this movie is nominated for 10 Oscars. I hope it sweeps the Oscars as it very well deserves to. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"I feel like i can write at least 4 pages about this movie but let's keep it short. First of all i love that the actors are 'real' i mean let's be realistic no one has the Rock as father, or Zac Effron at your school. The George Mackay is doing an AMAZING job. Like really full props to him, as wel as Dean-Charles. The movie is unique because it has just a few cuts in it. Like literally only three. You really get the pov but like as third person if that makes any sense. You get to see the realness of the character and really get a feeling of how things went down in WWI. And then we're not even talking about the music because oh my god, the music is outstanding. The violins really give you the full blown away feeling, maybe that's because i watched it in the cinema but i'm sure that with good headphones you'll get the same effect. Because the entire movie is almost one take you're really getting into the feelings of the character. You know just as much as the character. Nothing more nothing less. It was also a really good twist that Chapman died, i would've suspected that Scho would've died because he wasn't really in the spotlight at the beginning anyways. Really a good war movie and i would definitely watch it again! I btw saw this movie three times in the cinema so there's that"
1917,14 March 2020,7/10,"I loved the use of the ""one shot"" effect; I remember seeing for the first time in Birdman. The cinematography was amazing and credit to Roger Deakins and his crew but the screen play was really lacking in a lot of places. I never really got pulled into the screenplay; I just knew that the protagonist needed to deliver a message. Overall, a good movie but I felt Sam Mendes could've added a little more to it."
1917,20 March 2020,4/10,"Photography is beautiful, but can it not be meaningless to the end, the narrative rhythm that should have been due to ""no"" editing, resulting in the length and span of space-time transformation are distorted, take two steps to change the world, scene switching seems unreal, the pattern is like a third-person war of independence game. But the cruelty of war is also reflected in the small pattern: the fallen heroes can also be scattered everywhere. Some of the literary plays are also old-fashioned and cheap, especially the Anglo-French friendship play. But the fire ruins are so beautiful, the burning church is like the end of 2049, and the drifting drama is amazing, probably the most beautiful war film in recent years."
1917,20 May 2020,5/10,"For all the amazing cinematography and poetry evident in this movie, I was not impressed. I watched it in 2 sessions as I was bored after 20 minutes.Considering the Imperialistic European arrogance for starting a war that would cost over 50 million deaths, the movie lacks depth.I liked that the movie did not shy-away from showing the youth of soldiers and the horrors of trench warfare, however, it could not keep my attention.It would be nice to see any World War movie where the French countryside is not one of the actors."
1917,6 June 2020,9/10,"Long shots of this level can only be the product of this era. I think he has surpassed the traditional technique of so-called lens movement and scheduling, because from this perspective, it is impossible to realize this long lens. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have a feeling - the story after the only shot in that movie is cut off becomes a bit surreal. The sun-like flares, the Madonna-like girl in the basement, the river full of corpses, the nostalgic song that soldiers listened to before the battle, and the rushing in front of the trench. All of this was so dreamy that I doubted whether the protagonist had actually died under the black shot."
1917,5 March 2021,10/10,"Not that Dunkirk bore fest I had seen prior to this.
My girlfriend told me we should go watch this when it was in theaters, and I said I hate war movies anyway, that we shouldn't. Now 2 yrs and a breakup later, I wish I had.
Outstanding performances by all cool actors. Amazing camera work. Music and sound effects always on point A war film done damn right.
Tell Nolan to stick to his fantasy stuff."
1917,30 June 2021,,"His movie rocked. So moving and real. I felt like I was there! Great acting, great story and script, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. An overall perfect movie and Best picture snub!"
1917,4 December 2019,8/10,"Please dismiss anyone who criticizes 1917 harshly as overanalytical snobs, perhaps haters of blockbuster films, and assume that they secretly liked it, because really, how can one not. Sure, you can find fault with it; if I had directed 1917 I would have done a few things differently. Still, you just can't argue that it's not a masterfully-crafted film that is riveting pretty much every moment from start to finish.First, to anyone who might hesitate to go see the film because they think they will be subjected to the graphic violence and gore of, say, Saving Private Ryan, then don't hesitate anymore, and go see it. While 1917 is realistically gruesome, director Sam Mendes depicts the horrors of war - weird choice of words coming up, I know - beautifully. By that I mean, even the most horrifying and sad shots in the film, while highly stimulating in the aesthetic and emotional sense, are never extremely graphic, and you are never hit over the head with it. 1917, in this way, is a beautiful artistic masterpiece, never straying close to being shock art, but not holding back at the same time.What would I have done differently had I directed the film? I would have toned down the ""bad guys can't shoot very well"" cliché. I know, it's dark much of the time, the hero is running and zigzagging through built-up areas which offer a lot of protection to an elusive target, and I don't mean to imply that our hero does not elude death at times because he makes some sound lightening-fast decisions; it's just that, at other times, that cliché seems to rear its ugly head. Another implausibility in the film is, our hero spends probably a good ten minutes going for an unplanned, unintentional swim in the river, yet nothing seems to have gotten wet afterwards. Seriously nitpicking now for implausibilities, but as food in the trenches of World War 1 was scarce, and rations were measly, why then cast a chubby actor as one of the protagonists. There's a scene where he's grateful to be given a small crust of bread, and it's somewhat incongruous considering he looks so well-fed.What else? I'm not a fan of soundtracks that are seemingly intended to push the please-feel-something-now buttons, and 1917 has a button-pushing soundtrack. But at least the music is apropos, not sappy in any way. In general, I don't like the idea of war having a soundtrack, because soundtracks invariably glorify war.I'll be interested to read reviews from people who have had first-hand battlefield experience; I have not, so I don't necessarily consider above to be a credible critique. It's just how I personally experienced the film."
1917,23 January 2021,7/10,"Sam Mendes' second attempt at a war film shows us that there is still innovation to be had in this genre. The amount of planning and thought that went into this film is absolutely astounding. The long shot sequences without an (obvious) cut as great and the performances are fantastic by all involved.It is a very solid film with realistic writing, exciting and realistic events, and a pressing issue that we are constantly reminded of.My main issue with the film stems from the lack of characterization. There seem to be a lot of throwaway lines concerning the relationship between the main characters that I really wish we had seen more of. I realize that this film depicts these soldiers as just ""one of many"", but the mere fact that there are SO MANY of these intimate moments between the main characters makes the film seem flip-floppy on this decision.Besides this, it is wonderfully solid on all fronts, although the ending didn't really wow me the same way the rest of the movie did. All in all, a very solid film that did a lot right, but was a little emotionally muted for my taste."
1917,12 December 2019,9/10,"It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019."
1917,30 December 2020,9/10,"I watched this film with Very High expectations from all the awards it's won/recommendations ETC, however I was slightly bored whilst watching. Despite having won 3 Oscars along with another 111 wins & nominations the film wasn't gripping me like I thought it would. But the film was Very meaningful along with very good camera work and brilliant cinematography (Hence the 9/10 Star Rating) Worth The Watch."
1917,14 March 2020,8/10,1917 tells you the story of two soldiers who are assigned to race against time and deliver a message that will stop more than thousand soldiers from walking into a trap which may cause their lives..specially it shows you the journey of two soldiers through the enemy territory to their destination..and this movie totally made with one take..and you can always feel that you are also with these soldiers throughout this movie...all credit goes to Sir Roger Deakins and director Sam Mendes..I would like to give it one more star if there was little bit of more character development..though I will reconsider it..overall you should watch this movie...a visual and technical achievement in cinemas...oh the song near the end of this movie is just beautiful..love it.
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"Here's my review.
1..Cool story
2..Terrible actors
3..I was rooting for 007
4..Dragged on and on just like Dunkirk
5..Landscape/settings/effects were pretty good.Overall I think the actors ruined the movie IMO."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,He ruined the bond films by trying to bring back the nostalgia cheese.He's now tried to be quirky with the way he's filmed this film and in some scenes it works but like over people have said it looks and feels like a video game. The cast is excellent. And the main actor is a fantastic.The story line I believe is from a relative mendes had that would tell him stories of the war too. And Mendes had tried to squeeze a film out of it and it just doesn't stretch.It's ok it's certainly not a 10 maybe a 6 at most but as Mendes ruined my favorite Bond in Daniel Craig it's a bitter 5 stars for me.
1917,1 July 2020,8/10,"Gritty and realistic, authentic and encapsulating. Makes all the minor issues go out the window. I am biased though as I like most all WW1 movies, but happy that somewhere, somehow, people are actually trying to make movies instead of letting a test audience dictate how every scene should go."
1917,3 February 2020,9/10,"In addition to two ""James Bond"" films, Sam Mendes has made many moving and strong works, such as ""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Jarhead"". This time Mendes returns spectacularly and poignantly to the war theme with ""1917"". The undercover favorite at the next Oscars (he has been nominated for ten trophies). Well, the Oscars have long ceased to be as important as they used to be, but of course I'm happy when a film like this is honored. For me, ""1917"" is already one of the best films in 2020!1917: The British soldier Lance Corporal Blake, together with his friend Lance Corporal Schofield, is ordered to cancel an attack on the Germans. To do this, they have to travel a long way to get to the western front. It's about saving hundreds of soldiers from a massacre. The order is all the more important for Blake because his older brother is among the units ...The film got into conversation quickly because ""1917"" is arranged so that everything looks like one shot. Of course there are some hidden cuts here (as with ""Birdman"" from 2015), but visually ""1917"" stands out right from the start. A beautiful and breathtaking looking film and the reason is quickly determined: Roger Deakins. He is the best camera operator for me in his field. One of his most recent projects, ""Blade Runner 2049"", is one of the most powerful and beautiful films of all time for me.
In Mendes' film again he creates unique images and scenes. Like how a city lights up in dark flames and tranforms into a real hell. Then it gets really intimate again when the camera follows the two soldiers into a mine. One spectacular setting chases the next. For this reason alone, you should see this film. Thomas Newman underlines the visually stunning epic with a moving score. Perhaps a little too sentimental for some, but I found Newman's score to be very moving (which funnily fits the visual style of the movie), no matter whether it were the emotional or the dark, atmospheric moments.Fortunately, the film can also convince in another area: the story. For some it may just be a film in which two soldiers have to achieve a goal, but for me it is exactly this simple story that leaves a lot of space for visual storytelling. There are also longer dialogue scenes, but ""1917"" often also works as a very calm war film, which is more about the physical challenges. But a figure can also grow on it, which in my opinion is shown stunningly.The cast is wonderful: George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both great as protagonists. In addition, big names shine, such as Colin Firth or Benedict Cumberbatch. I appreciate the fact that many of the characters, both meet along the way can only be seen once (which also applies to the locations!). Mendes creates the feeling of having to go a long way with the two main characters, where you don't look back, you just move forward.Conclusion: ""1917"" will surely remind many of Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"". Both films have a similar structure and similar themes, but each film is something different. I was a little afraid that ""1917"" would try to be the new ""Dunkirk"", but Sam Mendes made the film something special (like Nolan did with his movie). A moving war drama that is completely convincing both visually and with its history!"
1917,4 April 2020,8/10,"The lack of insight into the characters' dilemmas and the dangers of this extremely difficult, near-suicidal mission makes it seem as if the film is piecing together pieces."
1917,25 April 2020,7/10,"I wanted to wait and watch the movie online. I did n't expect the epidemic to last so long. I ca n't wait. The story itself is very simple. Knowing in sync with the protagonist, the tension increased, but I still regretted not watching it in the cinema!"
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,"Not what I was expecting, visually fantastic but didn't real care for the characters, bit like COD game. No rewatch value or thought provoking study of war, more dumbed down history for tge generation. Plus points looked good."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"1917 wasn't your average, soldiers-are-heroes, flag-waving, god-bless-the-military, good-guy-vs.-bad-guy, propaganda piece. This was a cinematic work of art. Roger Deakins is a god among men and will win his second Oscar. Thomas Newman deserves his first for his soaring, amazing score. Dennis Gassner's sets, well - no words. George McKay was terrific in the lead role and the supporting players were all excellent.
I once read that the top two reasons people go to the movies are to laugh and to scream. Those are probably the blithering idiots who gave this film one star, calling it ""boring."" You people have no idea what you just watched."
1917,10 January 2020,5/10,"Listen, it's not a ""bad"" movie at all; in fact, it is pretty good and pretty well made. Mendes is a good director so you wouldn't expect anything less, but wow this movie has major issues and flaws. I really did like watching it for ""one time"", but I won't ever watch it again, and that alone is the sign of a movie that is not very good, certainly not a ""classic"". Some parts are really frustrating, and that's never a good sign.The cinematography is brilliant and ambitious, but the story's implausibilities, poor character development, lack of realism, and deux machina really were a surprise to me since it won the Golden Globe. I was not expecting such an unrealistic film after it won the award. I actually now question the Golden Globe's motives and authority in handing out awards after this won. Cinematography, yes, but story and plot absolutely not.This is a big fail of a movie if they are taking it seriously and pawning it off as award worthy. It just does not suffice. In a nutshell, take 1/2 (half) of Saving Private Ryan for its quality, and nothing more."
1917,17 December 2019,10/10,"I just saw the film and I was mesmerized by the cinematography by Roger Deakins. It is so perfect and spotless. I liked both the actors, David Chapman and George Mackay. The casting was amazing because these two guys had their own looks which worked very well for both of them. One was innocent looking and other was stern looking. You keep rooting for one in the beginning and then later it changes. When I went to the theatre I told myself I am not going to cry and stay strong but at one point I just could not hold it anymore. A tear fell when he meets the brother."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"This is an incredible film.. beautifully shot with amazing lighting,hauntingly beautiful score & great acting..please see this as it's a monumental experience..10/10"
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,Ignore the implausible 'boys own adventure' premise and just let this amazing film immerse you in the horrors that must have been WWI trench warfare. Magnificent cinematography and choreography take you on a seemingly unending 'ride along' with our protagonists as they negotiate a terrifying journey through a ravaged and horrifying region of war torn France. A must see.
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,Brilliantly executed from a cinematography point of view. The story can only be described and beautifully haunting as it takes you on a journey of hope despair grief elation and the bitter truth of war. Set in WW1 it tells the story of a how an almost impossible mission is handed to 2 soldiers to avert a disaster in the front lines. Emotionally draining this spectacular piece of cinema will be most appreciated on the big screen and if possible IMAX is the way to do it.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917 will captivate you from the beginning to the end. There is never a dull moment in this journey of a film. The movie was filmed in one shot so you reallt feel like youre travelling with them. From the walks towards the horizon, to the explosions, you will feel what they feel and love the movie as a whole. Truly mesmorizing and definitely recommend worth watching."
1917,14 February 2021,7/10,"""1917"" is technically perfect: sound, cinematography, directing, acting. Perfect. A great audiovisual experience of immersion in trench warfare. But ... that's all. The formal aspects of film production are everything the film offers - at the level of excellence, I repeat. The plot, however, is as simples as this: two soldiers have to deliver a message in the midst of the First World War, going through shots and bombs inside enemy lines. Unfortunately, what is essential for me is missing: a good storyline and wonderful characters."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Very realistic. A spectacle, a thriller, a character piece. Top script, direction, acting, cinematography, costume, sets. Should have beem required viewing for Tony Blair and George Bush before the 2nd Gulf war. Pity it wasn't made then."
1917,23 February 2020,10/10,Lest we forget those that have fallen! I cant describe in words how compelling this film is. This is a film you watch and take in the devastating trauma these people lived. The cinematography of this film is the best I've ever seen! This is film that will be remembered forever in history and will always be the best we can get to reliving these horrific moments these people experienced in history most devastating war. Watch this film!!! You will sit there in silent as I did as the credits went on.
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,How war took place for our heroes they gave their lives for freedom how they made world as it is today best action based true film of all time deserves rewards so much action thrill hanger dr strange actors best yet go see it worth it so much 1917 style wish it was 215 minutes instead or longer felt quick rush though great film thank you
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"One of the most unbelievable, jaw-dropping, gut-wrenching, beautiful films I have ever seen. A film that is an experience, a film that sweeps you through an absolutely brutal, yet beautiful journey. Sam Mendes's screenplay (co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns) is absolutely terrific, matched by his brilliant direction. The acting is top-notch; George MacKay (Schofield), Dean-Charles Chapman (Blake), and every single member of this incredible cast play their roles to perfection. The cinematography is astonishing and unbelievable; the entire film is two shots. (Not one, but two; at one point the film cuts to black). Two. Shots. Let that sink in. What Mendes and Roger Deakins have done here is absolutely astonishing. You feel as if you are pulled into the trenches with Blake and Schofield; in No-Man's-Land and German territory alongside them. Thomas Newman's score is beautiful, along with the incredible editing of Lee Smith. This is an absolutely glorious masterpiece, and not only the best film of 2019, but one for the ages."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Struggle, struggle and struggle. That's what comes to our minds when we hear of war. And 1917 horrifically just showcases that in the most appropriate manner. With a compact cast, beautiful cinematography and cracking background score, 1917 remains as one of the finest contenders for Academy Awards 2020!"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was brilliant and shows the horrors of the First World War and how brave the men was at the front and behind the lines. My favourite part is when he meets the French woman and sings to the baby it's so nice, 10/10 from me."
1917,23 May 2020,10/10,"Simply incredible. From the single-shot approach, to the performances and commitment of the actors, to the score, to the realism and intense ""ticking clock"" device in use - this movie has it all. A heart-pounding and tense experience and BEAUTIFULLY shot. The awards were well deserved."
1917,4 December 2019,8/10,"The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works."
1917,8 February 2020,8/10,Superbly shot and edited. A beautiful film to watch. The film has suspense throughout and was throughly enoyable
1917,21 February 2020,7/10,"Personally I thought this movie was not great or amazing but i do think it is a solid good film. What I enjoyed was the way the story was told using the ""all in one take"" way of filming the movie. The acting was very good but some of the actors that were featured in most of the trailers such as Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch had barely any screen time and only appeared in the beginning and end of the movie.Going back to the one take way of filming, it does make the movie a bit more dramatic but overall I do not think it is a game changer"
1917,3 April 2020,9/10,"This is a depressing but very brave war movie. A good war movie is like this. It can depict the cruelty of the battlefield, make people afraid, have excellent anti-war effect, but also show you the beauty and shackles of the world, let people full of courage. Regrettably, the story of several desperate situations is carried on in a manner close to ""the coming of god"", but it is also moving. The director, the cinematography, the music, the performance, if the film wins an Oscar, that's acceptable."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,And them some. Shame that George MacKay didn't get a Best Actor nomination.I was absolutely stunned by the turn of events in the middle of the movie. I just didn't expect what happened after the plane crash.
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"A move from WW1. That is a wonder!! The ""one shot"" deal was brilliantly completed. This move is a jewel and will go down in history as a one of the best in cinematography ever made (together with Ben Hur 1959, Star Wars 1977 and others).The story...straight and simple. But...the actors and director makes you feel the battle, the tension, the fear, the desperation.Extremely watchable."
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Wow! Just left the cinema and I'm in awe of Mackay's performance! What a fantastic film, one of the best war films of the decade if not my lifetime (I'm 27) a must watch! If it doesn't get Oscars I'd be SHOCKED!"
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,When you're watching this movie you really feel like it is the year of 1917. Acting is fantastic and the cinematography is oscar worthy for sure!
1917,19 June 2020,9/10,"This film was phenomenal! It was intense at times and emotional when it needs to be. The cinematography and the way this movie was shot like in one take is amazing as you would expect. It feels like you're in the movie along with the main characters. No movie has made me feel that way and to do this in a war movie, gives such a surreal experience. It feels so real! The story was simple but effective. It is about getting from point A to point B but it's epic."
1917,10 May 2020,9/10,"Incredible cinematic experience . 1917 sets up the main plot quickly and from there just moves. Even in the ""slower"" portions the audience is left wondering what issue is going to arise next. I might've thought I was actually watching World War 1. Watching the movie you can really feel Sam Mendes's passion for the movie that he's creating. This film should be on every movie buff's shelf at home."
1917,6 February 2020,7/10,"A visually and technically impressive, gripping until a certain point but then the holes in the implausible storyline weaken the overall impact, to the point where it feels unsatisfying and not engaging any longer.Instead watch Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a visionary cry of despair from the depths of hell -as a reviewer wrote-, and rewatch Coppola's epic masterpiece 'Apocalypse Now'"
1917,26 January 2020,5/10,"It seems like the writers and director had something to prove by making a movie that appears as if it were filmed as one continuous take. Mission accomplished.But the movie provides only a mediocre experience for us, the audience. It offers nothing new about war in general or WWI in particular. There is very little that it has to say; in fact there is hardly a story beyond the obvious one of two corporals in a race on foot to get a battalion to stand done. And it gratuitously drops in A-list actors who barely add any value.And, yes, it has the look, feel, and engagement of a video game.If all of this sounds good, go see it."
1917,23 March 2020,10/10,"1917 is a perfect film. It's not only captivating, moving and thrilling but it's also one of the best crafted movies ever made. My favorite things about it is how easy it is to remember all of its scenes in a chronological order. Every single scene is an element and a tool for the progression of the story. It doesn't matter if it's a crossing of a battlefield, pushing a cart or having a one on one shootouts with the enemy, it's all beautifully done and an example of how continuity should be executed. My favorite scene is the one in which we see the soldiers sitting in a big circle and listening to the Wayfarig Stranger. In this scene, one of the most touching I've ever seen our hero finally reaches the soldiers he's trying to find, but he finds that out only after the end of the song, because it's so electric that nobody really notices his presence there. The death of one of the main characters also serves as an example of a wonderfully crafted picture, because it's as sudden and realistic as none of us expect to see. Another interesting feature is the pain that the characters go through. Its constantly present on screen with characters putting their bleeding hands in a rotting corpse, being blown up, shot, beaten and chocked to death. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that it never addresses the physical pain and the injuries that William Schofield constantly sustains. Every once in a while he sits down for a moment, touches the back of his head, which is bleeding of course and at the next moment he is back on the road. The fantastic Oscar worthy cinematography, direction and effects add the finishng touches to this timeless masterpiece."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"I just feel as though no matter how much I say this movie was brilliant, real, 10/10 blah blah, whatever description I come up with doesn't even come close or do this movie any justice. I have to give credit though to the cinematography of this film. They've made it appear to be shot in 1 take from start to finish which makes it feel very raw and real. Absolute must see! Quite possibly the best war film of all time."
1917,13 May 2021,3/10,"Wow this is a long movie. I kid you not. Watching two guys you don't care about on mission that makes no sense and running into ridiculous situations left me wanting to go home and watch some paint dry. Oh, and I dare you to NOT roll your eyes when they run into a magic cow that can milk itself. Germans who couldn't hit a target four feet in front of them. The luckiest ride down river rapids that somehow puts the main guy mere yards away from the battalion he needed to find AND walks right up behind them without a single person noticing him. Great security guys! This and so much more. Well I guess some people liked this dreck. Me? I think I died a little inside. See it if you want. May God have mercy on your soul....."
1917,26 January 2020,7/10,"This is a movie that you really have to see in the theater to be fully immersed into the story and see the incredible details. I was at awe frame to frame and felt like I was there in France, on the front lines, in 1917. It's incredible to think what it must've been like living in a trench with a single action rifle waiting for your commanding officer to tell an order that could be your last. These men just did it and without questions, raised their rifles together to fight an enemy. It's something that I question if I had the guts to do myself if places were switched.What was more incredible was the cinematography that appeared to have no cuts. It was as if the story was told in real time, through one fluid shot. The way they transitioned the flow time while keeping the perspective of the characters as a linear shot was beautiful. Hands down awesome.The story had some slow parts, but it was easy to follow and flowed nicely, which made the action scenes feel more intense. You felt as if it was life or death. I rate this a 7.9/10, is it the next Saving Private Ryan? No, even though the story has similar characteristics; it is it's own thing."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"Here we go
1917 is the war movie I've been waiting for I think that this was very history accurate and really showed what happened in ww1 I loved the visuals the story the cinematography the music all was great It was a great movie 1917 gets a 8-10 amazing movie what a way to start the year for movies I hope there are more like this this year"
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"How amazing it was from the first scene to the end( to me)! There're lots of world war movies out there and many are perfect though, but this one to me and for sure many others till now; was one of the best among all, this kind of non-stop narration that rarely the scenes seem to be changed like it doesn't change at all and the process goes through the end from only one view( I don't know if there's an specific word for this kind or not) makes it a perfect movie that forces you to sit back and follow the story and feel like you're the third person of the scene as a soul beside them and feel everything they do! Maybe others would say: ""oh! Come on, this is not all that!"" But it really is for me and the fans maybe. It could feel even better if more action scenes would come across, for sure.
So, Everything was good; it has some faults of course, in some scenes like when Blake was dying and was talking to Schofield and then two soldiers came through, and at the road, vehicles and soldiers were struggling with the trunk, I asked myself how fast it could happen and none of them could hear the voices, I mean that was really fast! It could take longer for all those vehicles to arrive there and spread over that land, so that they wouldn't seem to be acting obviously after the director allows them when the camera came through the road!!
But anyway, totally it's one of the best.
I loved it!"
1917,15 February 2020,9/10,I like war type movie.. This movie is having very awesome story... Very much realistic.. Background sound is very nice... Camera position is very good... Nice plot.. All have done very good acting...
1917,21 April 2020,9/10,"During the climax, my whole body muscle was locked in the theater seat, and the lacrimal gland began to collapse involuntarily. This movie represents the purest audition shock, the most extreme play of the movie language, and my back was completely wet when the subtitle was released."
1917,5 May 2020,9/10,"Movie about WW1 shot as if it was only one shot. Gripping moments where you are horrified you do not know what is going to happen. good acting and beautiful scenes is like a lord of the Rings adventure great movie, great to see in the movies, not sure if it would hold up on rewatch on small screen"
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"This would be my favourite to win quite a few Oscars. We cannot forget the First World War. We just must not. Never. Our Western society is built on certain values and we faught and died for it. We defeated the Ottoman Empire with great difficuty so we may enjoy the freedoms and values we have today. This movie captures that. Well done for a gripping, edge of the seat movie that I can never forget!"
1917,4 February 2020,2/10,"Story is idiotic. The way the two soldiers go about their business is laughable, no logic at all unless the lads are complete morons. Props are stupid e.g flashlights that exceed anything that existed during that time. Acting is not good so casting gets zero points. There are much more idiotic and infeasible things to this movie but see for yourself, by all means."
1917,10 February 2020,9/10,"The plot and the story of the movie is very intense, dramatic and suspenseful. The complete idea of filming the movie in one shot just adds a strawberry on the top. There is not much to say, except that I would recommend everyone to watch this movie.
The dramatic score, acting and all the surrounding of the battlefields and reliving all the intense situations pulls you deep into the movie, where you feel all the awfulness and distress of a war."
1917,14 July 2021,9/10,"S 1917 a masterpiece? That's the question I've been pondering. I'm not sure of the answer. Time will let us know. But the fact that the question is there at all is a telling one. This is a profoundly affective film.Two boys are tasked to deliver a message, through enemy lines. DO NOT ATTACK! The battle is a ruse, a deception of the enemy. Many men will die. This is the call to action, propelling into motion a story that is really quite simple. It is a hero's journey of sorts, and quite classically so. There is a quest, there are trials and monsters (or enemies, rather), helpful guides, and imagery of descent, all framed in the hellish chaos of World War 1, in the trenches and beyond. We will return to the narrative discourse a bit later.It might be, and has been said, that 1917 is something of a style over substance movie, a sort of intense rollercoaster moreso than a complex meditation. I can see the argument. It is a ""one take movie,"" wherein the conceit is that the entire film is shot in one incredibly complex take, with no cuts. Cuts, of course, do exist, as it would have been impossible to shoot otherwise, and you can pick them out if you're paying attention, but my god is this glorious technical filmmaking. The way the camera operates in 1917 is thoroughly stunning, some of the best I've ever seen, and I think the relative simplicity of the story in juxtaposition with the complexity of this visual device is what has led to some critics dismissal of the film.This is why I think they're wrong: Yes, it is a rollercoaster. Yes, the story is relatively simple. But what surrounds and informs the visual splendor is so thoroughly evocative that it envelops the simple narrative in a relentlessly profound way. Put more simply, you really feel that you are there, in the trenches and fields and burnt out cities, and the dirt and the grime and stories written on men's faces imbue the film with the reality of war in a way few others have managed to achieve. It's a strange balance between acrobatic filmmaking and ruthless realism. For some, I believe, this is problematic, as the filmmaking itself, for them, surmounts the content, and becomes the focal point rather than what is being filmed. I acknowledge this argument, but do not agree. The lack of cuts, instead, lends the camera a curious authorial voice, like a fluid and omniscient ghost, and the experiential nature of witnessing this war, from this vantage, involves the audience in a very special way. It does not matter if the story is simple, because the experience IS the story, drawn in agonizing detail.It's funny, because I tend to hate movies I would describe in this way. Movies that act as theme park rides (I'll draw your attention to most modern horror) are generally devoid of substance and depth for this very reason, feeling like those haunted houses where people pop out of the walls, shriek, and whatever minor thrill this elicits is immediately forgotten. 1917, owing to how painstaking and wrenching the context of it is, and the complexity of the production, transcends this and becomes something wholly more.FINAL TAKE: 1917 succeeds for me on all fronts. It is a small yet marvelous human story surrounded by horror and chaos, a hero's journey with touching characters and an unshakeable sense of place. It is also a technical marvel, which, far from being diverting, excels simultaneously in eliciting that cinephile thrill of a thing well made and in drawing you in to the gritty reality of its world. Whether you end up in agreement or not, it is definitely worthy of your time and attention. There has never been a film quite like it."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"1917 really blew me away, and i came into it with high expectations due to the numerous nominations and awards. The fact that the whole movie is manipulated in a way to seem as a seamless continuous shot really helps with the delivery. The connection between lance corporal Blake and Schofield seems so natural, and we are truly following these 2 for a good chunk of the beginning until we lose Blake to a downed German solider. The raw emotions of this film in my opinion outclass a lot of other war movies, as this is built on a true relationship that is tested and broken. There was also an eerie feeling to this film, and i was quite tense throughout it not really knowing what to expect next. The pacing is quite slow overall and this is not a movie you go and see if you expect a lot of action. It to me was more of an adrenaline rush and a patience game, as we are following only 2 soldiers that are trying to get past a multitude of defenses. Lone Survivor is a movie i felt like i could relate this to, but again 1917 is a lot slower and has more 1 on 1 battles that show the real emotions of war.
This movie is truly a treat and will be a top of my favorites for 2020, as i was late to the party on seeing this in theaters.
A real masterpiece."
1917,7 November 2021,8/10,"This is a good war film, the story is engaging and is a good balence of action and drama. The way it is filmed draws you in and you end up genuinely routing for the guy. I can see why it got awards and I'd recommend it."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"This was a good movie, but incredibly long and slow. Not enough to make you want to keep watching. The filming was amazing but it didn't do the slow moving movie enough justice.
This movie could have been 100 times better. Definitely a disappointment."
1917,20 April 2020,10/10,"Anyone who is whining about this pandemic needs to watch this to reprioritize. George Mackay is phenomenal, as are all of the supporting actors. I was actually standing and shouting at my TV by the end."
1917,5 January 2020,6/10,"I saw the high rating before I went to see this and hence my expectations soared. No doubt, the movie was beautifully filmed but it was just that. A thin plot and as I write this, I can't recall the ending even after watching it only yesterday."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,I'm not keen on blockbusters. We always know the heroes will get the job done at the end so we just sit back and enjoy the ride. Nothing is different here aside from the fact that the journey we go on is a total mind blowing visceral experience that will keep you enthralled from start to finish. The sets are so immersive you feel as if you are actually on this journey yourself and the story moves along at just the right pace with a good mix of danger and tenderness woven in. The music is top drawer and the acting too. Rarely will you see a film with five of Britain's top actors in where each of them only gets two minutes screen time. Oscar will love this one.
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"Everyone says that, right? And they aren't wrong, but it takes more than excellent cinematography to make a complete movie going experience.I have to be real, I love war films and I love slow films but this film is mostly dull with a few outstanding moments. It is in the humble opinion of this movie goer that Dunkirk was a similair but more riveting experience.I liked the movie, don't get me wrong, but too many reviewers are setting up readers for disappointment with their ridiculous praise. I wholly recommend you go see this movie if you enjoy films like Dunkirk, just be sure to check your expectations at the door."
1917,17 March 2020,7/10,Great cinematography and I love the way it was shot. Could have been better the movie could have done a better developing the characters and their relationship. The movie was pretty short and ended pretty abruptly.
1917,19 May 2020,9/10,"Wonderful long lens, take me across the big river, arrived at the ideal country of life.Probably the most beautiful war movie of the 21st century, the perfect combination of technology and art.The description of the war environment, especially the site, is rich and sculptural.Some of the visual impact of the scenes are unforgettable, such as the muddy mess when entering the battlefield, the night chase in the ruins of the church in the fire, the exhausted body in the river, the vertical charge in the flames of war...Mr Mendes may simply be trying to tell the story of a grandparent's first world war, a battle that is awe-inspiring."
1917,31 January 2020,9/10,"I have seen this movie 4 times already. It blows me away every time. Attention to detail, the acting, the cinematography, the direction.......I could go on and on. It's not a Saving Private Ryan movie.....but it's every bit a classic in the making."
1917,19 May 2020,10/10,"What a movie!!! I truly haven't seen a movie like this in a ling time. The setting, the acting and the directing are marvelous. You'll just flow with the, you' movie as the movie progresses. Then, you'll feel attached to the characters.......an attachment that'll take you to the climax and you'd lay hoping that the movie would never end.Mind Blowing cinematography!!! You won't forget it. A 10/10."
1917,23 March 2021,9/10,"The UK need to make more films on it's history. It's history is some of the richest in the world, and yet we leave it to Americans to make tell the stories of WW1 and WW2 (as two example)"
1917,8 February 2020,5/10,"Its seems in this day and age, the key to making a ""good' movie involves having great technical aspects, which allows everyone to overlook any shortcomings (such as the MCU).The fact that 1917 was filmed in a single scene is analogous to Boyhood being filmed over 12 years. Both technical ""marvels"", but it doesn't mean that there is actually any substance to either of them.That doesn't mean that 1917 is bad, it's just another typical movie that happens to have an interesting gimmick."
1917,27 January 2020,6/10,"Well shot and acted. Some scenes look a bit phony or surreal, especially those shot in the town at night.
Basically a rehash of a one minded plot like Prvt.Ryan but to my taste, not as well done and not as interesting.
People that say the film puts you into the battle, but so did Prvt. Ryan, Dunkirk, and a slew of other war movies.
Yes, very few movies about WWI but after All Quiet on the Western Front, you don't need any more.
Remember, this was a ridiculous war based on alliances, not a war to save mankind from a lunatic mass murderer.
The leaders of Germany and England were cousins, daughters of each other's royal family.
The reason very few movies are made about The Great War is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place.
Most historians agree that it would have been better if Germany won the war. If the Germans won, Europe would not have changed drastically, but the reparations that Germany was forced to sign at the Treaty of Versailles led to the rise of Hitler and Nazism and might have never taken place.
The the first ""modern war"" the Great War was the last gasp of Victorians. the war to end all wars still has negative reverberations today and it was a shame millions had to die for nothing.
That is the biggest blunder of history. The WAR and this film both never had to happen."
1917,30 November 2020,10/10,"Visually stunning, has great characters, the acting is phenomenal, and it shows the reality of war without glorifying it. Everything Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" does wrong, this movie does right. I rarely give any movie a 10, but this one is well deserved. Job well done."
1917,4 February 2020,6/10,"1917 is overall a very generic war movie. The only redeeming quality is the ""all in one shot"" thing, which at times was able to build up tension and make for an interesting and unique shot composition. I would say that the first half of the movie uses it to its advantage while after a certain point of the movie everything went downhill, with lots of cheesy moments, plot conveniences, weird character choices and overall not being able to keep up the tension. But the second half at least tried hard with having some nice shots and sets.The movie also feels more like a typical action flick, instead of a proper portrayal of WW1. I mean it does a better job than ridiculous movies such as ""Hacksaw ridge"" or ""saving private ryan"" do with WW2, but it has this typical feeling of ""character making it out against all odds"" and if someone dies it must be an elaborate set piece, which feels just so unlike real WW1, where the horror was rather the unseen enemy, the mustard gas, the constant artillery shots, the rats keeping you awake at night. It doesn't have this realistic feeling of WW1 like ""All quiet on the western front"" or maybe ""Paths of Glory"" has. It also doesn't help that a year earlier the very nice documentary ""They shall not grow old"" came out which gives a by far better vision of WW1 than this movie could ever do.I am also not a fan of the idea of trying to make a movie in only 1 shot. I didn't like it in ""Birdman"" and I didn't like it in any movie I have seen it in since. There is a reason movies have cuts in it and its not only a technical one. A story normally needs things like: different sets, time in between scenes, scenes following each other with vastly different tones to build or reduce tension, etc. Ofc you could make a movie that still is enjoyable to watch even if it has only 1 shot, but is it difficult to achieve? Yes.
A rather character driven story like ""Birdman"" only suffered from it and the idea of everything being one shot was not an artistic vision benefiting the movie, it was basically the gimmick that tried to sell tickets. The idea of one shot was utterly pointless and made the movie even more boring.
""1917"" however seems to be the best example of a movie that tried to do the ""one shot"" thing, since it actually achieved something with it. Like I said before it did a decent job of creating tension in the first half. The problem is 1917 would have been better if it had a few cuts in between some long shots, but it seems even more in this movie that the "" one shot"" gimmick was heavily used to promote the movie rather than being a much needed addition to the film. Oh and just to point it out, the advertisement of just being in one shot was also a lie because it cut to black half way through the movie.So in conclusion the movie has a pretty interesting opening sequence and later some great sets, but story wise its boils down to a generic war drama which cant keep up the tension all the way through to the end. It involves many cheesy moments and overall nothing really challenging or anything to wrap your head around. Its entertaining though, and at times very visually pleasing."
1917,12 February 2021,8/10,"Complete movie with action, comedy, and drama but lacked a fulfilling ending. The style of a one take camera that followed the two boys around was interesting and made the personal connection between the characters and audience enjoyable. Action seemed realistic and not too over the top. Just wish the ending was better."
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,I can't believe how boring and schmaltzy this film is. I gave it a 5 for technical expertise but the story was ludicrous and beyond belief. Maybe it's Mendes' turn to be it but all these 5 star reviews in the press just don't add up. There is no way thankfully that this will win the best film Oscar.
1917,18 March 2020,10/10,The best film I saw..
1917,17 October 2020,9/10,"This film was absolutely heartbreaking, but probably the most realistic war film I have ever seen. The acting was seriously brilliant and the cinematography was incredible - to the point where some scenes actually made me feel nauseous. Was great to see some big names with minor parts and the two leads are lesser known but very talented, making it feel much more authentic. This was a real pleasure to watch."
1917,13 April 2020,9/10,"This is a film about faith. The first scene at the beginning of the film shows two leading men in a field of wildflowers. Blake lies down and Schofield sits against the tree. Someone came up to Blake and said the commander wanted to see you, and he wanted you to take a comrade with you. So Blake called Schofield to see the commander. The commander explained the mission to them and they set off at once. After Blake's death, Schofield finally completed his mission through thick and thin. The final scene of the film echoes the opening scene, which is still a meadow, but with no wildflowers, just dog's tail grass. Schofield still sat against a tree, remembering his fallen comrade in the sunset."
1917,22 April 2020,9/10,"The whole film consists of two super long lenses. But the long lens of this film is not used to show off skills, but to make you unable to escape from the most personal senses, unable to watch, unable to choose the grand perspective of history, unable to treat everyone in the film as the statistical data in the war. So a unique technique with a unique narrative way is excellent."
1917,17 May 2020,7/10,A harrowing tale of the futility of human conflict and comrades in arms.
1917,16 July 2020,9/10,"Many of the themes of the film are tonality-the despair of the fog of war, the difficulty of communication and the difficulty of rational decision-making caused by the stubborn task priority attitude. Some officers give priority to arbitrary strategic decisions, and do not care about the life safety of the soldiers under their command- All lost in the mist of the film's narrative skills. The film does not give the audience an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the dilemma faced by the character and the dangers of this extremely difficult, nearly suicidal task, which makes the film look like it is barely putting together some fragments."
1917,22 November 2020,9/10,"After watching this several times, I have to say this is an excellent movie. I've never watched a movie that portrayed trench warfare from WWI. What an amazing experience and truly an original as far as storyline and pacing. A must see for fans of war cinema."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"Brilliantly made. The one-shot thing comes off a lot better here than in other films I've seen it used in, and creates a genuine sense of geography and immersion. It does feel a bit like playing an on-the-rails video game at times - but a very good one - and emotional engagement remains strong throughout.I've never been much of a fan of Mendes before, but I thought this was some pretty exceptional filmmaking.Always known cinematographer Roger Deakins is a genius - and this further confirms it.However, 1917 just falls short of being a 10* film for me - because some of the creative choices felt a bit too borrowed from recent movies (e.g. Dunkirk and The Revenant) - especially Thomas Newman's score - which sounded like a shameless rip off of cues from Hans Zimmer's scores for Dunkirk, The Thin Red Line and The Dark Knight - which I can only guess were all used on the temp track.Still - an excellent film, well-worthy of joining the canon of Great War/anti-War movies."
1917,29 December 2020,1/10,"So glad ww1 was fought with well spoken boring assed soliders. Considering ww1 was full of soldiers from all over the uk, the only ones you see are well groomed southerners, no soliders north of london. I found it hard to feel sorry for the main characters, they were soulless and stiff. It all just felt like a bbc drama, it could of been so much better. I turned it off after an hour."
1917,3 February 2020,9/10,"The story of 1917 was simple, about two WWI British soldiers with a mission to carry a message to another front to stop an attack that wind up to a trap costing over 1,000 lives. Bears in mind, this took place in 1917. We are used to the instant communication. They did not have that luxury. The soldiers had to go through dangerous and hostile territory to get the message delivered. The visual, the setting, and the way it was shot was so incredibly realistic that I was totally immersed into the situation like I was with these two soldiers. Like the soldiers, we don't know what is ahead.The movie was very intense, and the two hours went by quickly. The two actors were wonderful in their portrayal. Through their conversation, I got to know the kind of people they are. Another strong point was that musical score, which intensified the suspense. My really only major criticism was that there were few scenes seemed to over reached a bit for their plausibility, but it was relatively not as a big deal as compared to rest of the movie. Because of the great cinematography and setting, if you plan to see it, don't wait for it coming to video. See it on the big screen. Seeing in a small screen will missed out the incredible detail this movie offered. Powerful experience that most of us fortunate enough not to have to experience in real life."
1917,18 April 2020,5/10,"Don't believe the hype. 15-20 minutes of story with 1.5 hours of fluff. The continuous scene aspect of the movie was done well but obvious use of CGI and green screen technology detracted from it. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of female characters, which is contrary to today's progressive thinking."
1917,19 January 2020,6/10,"Great cinamaphotography but come on !
Ex veteran here too but an average war movie.
Should not be mentioned in the same sentence as some of the classic war movies like SPR or ATRL.
Wasn't even a true story !!"
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"The strong point of this film: It's a stark reminder that Hell is on Earth and we humans are responsible for creating it. In that way, it is a successful and haunting movie.Another, more neutral way of describing the movie would be as a WW1 battlefield landscape tour. We're taken around in all kinds of environments resulting from artillery shelling; from the trenches, bunkers, no man's land, artillery dumps, destroyed farmsteads, burning town ruins, and ongoing assault and what else. The amount of engagement with these surroundings, or even depth of characters, is however relatively limited.There are two archetypes of ""war movies"": one type that tries to accurately portray military actions, and another that uses war as a backdrop for something else, such as psychological studies; 1917 belongs to this second category. Drawing comparisons, a similar recent movie is Dunkirk, but 1917 is far more low key with the threat often lurking in the background rather than asserting itself at every moment.Ultimately, I had been wanting more of an active take on the subject matter, i.e. WW1 military history, and it seems I will have to wait longer."
1917,9 February 2020,4/10,"It's said that ""Dying is easy; comedy is hard."" Well that can be said for War Movies as well. This film might be technical and visual perfection, but it's a one trick pony after 15 minutes. I had a sneaky suspicion from the trailer how it would play and it lived up to expectations."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is genious. The way they present the environment and they way they picturized it, is a work of art. Even though there were not much gun fire going on like typical war movies, you will not realized how the time passed so quickly. This movie is about how the real war looks like and the emotions of it. And the only way you will not like this movie is if you watch Ramboo like movies."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"I wanted to see this movie for three reasons:
First, it is a Sam Mendez movie who never disappointsSecond, I read 500 page book about the English experience at the Battle of the Somme (""Into the Breach"" if you're interested). It was historical researched and contained multiple excerpts from journals of people that where there. One of the excepts went like this (I paraphrase):"" I sent my brother and another to call back an attack that would fail. They reached the companies, but where was my brother when they cane back? I was told he was in No-Mans-Land. What?!. The reply was "" No old man he didn't make it"".The writer wrote that in the end he sent his brother to save others brothers, and lost his own.Third: the soundtrack was composed by Thomas Neman, who is without a doubt the most inspired artist of his generation.There is a seen in this movie that is so emotional that it will put you on the floor if you're not sitting. The music at first seems wrong, because it is so majestic.The reason being, people in big events see things we will never see. A P-51 pilot described following a 1,000 B-17's on their way to a bombing mission in Germany. In the early morning light, the sunlight glistened and dazzled off all the planes. WE will never see that wonder.In the previously referenced book is a description of the writers experience of being at the front for the first time. It is described as beauty and awe, another world in this world which was unworldly.And then finally, there is Kitchener, the English ultimate commanding general, who experience in Africa showed him the power of that eras ""modern weapons"". While others were excited, he said, ""It will never end, it won't end until we have plumbed our last million men"".Anyone that didn't appreciate this movie is obviously illiterate when it comes to history, and most likely has an IQ that is in the single digits."
1917,30 March 2020,10/10,"Basically a 'road movie', this is a very good depiction of different faces of war, changing one another, as the road goes on. And masterfully done, too! Great acting, good visuals, coherent story, good direction, and feels very truthful overall. Really touches your emotions, too.Nothing much to say here, it is a great movie about war. Full stop."
1917,12 May 2020,9/10,"This is the best film for 2019. A long shot in the end the ghost axe God's construction site renders the cruelty and sorrow of the battlefield. With careful composition colors and scene details, the whole movie is full of immersion and enjoyment"
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,If the men who died in ww1 fighting for our freedom knew that today we would be crying about gender pronouns and political correctness they would be rolling in there graves. take note liberal cry baby's
1917,19 December 2020,10/10,"What an a amazing movie. Everything to the way it was shot to the acting, everything in this movie makes me wish it was longer. Actually I watched it in theaters with friends then told my GF that we had to watch it, brought her to go see it the next day! Just got better10/10 No Bull"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"To say this was a huge Surprise would be an Understatement, I had seen 2 or 3 different trailers before seeing it last night, nothing could have prepared me for what I experienced, it's as close to a tense yet incredibly enjoyable 2 hr Roller Coaster ride as you could get, This was the greatest one continuous shot type Film I have ever seen, The Pacing of the Film is like no other I've seen, the amount of onscreen story telling you experience feels way more than just the 2 hrs run time, it's just the perfect economy in motion pacing, a pause for just a minute and off to the next main objective, you'll see what I mean, the pacing is just masterful, the tension building is also phenomenal, Best Film by Far this Year in January of all months, can't imagine any other topping this Masterpiece"
1917,1 February 2020,8/10,"I had great expectations for this movie because of the strong casting of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch , Andrew Scott and Mark Strong. I was sad to find out their scenes were very specific and not much. Dean- Charles Chapman's role as lance corporal Blake had a big Emotional impact on me? His scene moved me very much. George Mackay was kind of the leading actor but I wasn't much impressed. I'm not a big fan of one take movies... but that's how it was done, there were a couple of scenes that I thought were strong but overall, the movie was very quiet with minimal dialogue which I expected more of. But you can see the artistry in the direction and production for sure. To Win Best Picture, it might since it won a Golden globe. But for my taste, Angelina Jolie's Unbroken was a lot more better than this as a war genre movie"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"One word ""emotion."" I think this movie is so amazing beyond its technical achievement because it manages to ignite real feelings for the characters and the events not only in a one level sense of suspense and action but mostly in terms of the human beings and the tragedy that is war. There really is much to say here but one thing I was very disappointed about was its marketing techniques... I understand this made a lot of money and the way they promoted it was obviously of help, but as a filmgoer It really sucks to have the climax of the movie and probably what would be the most exciting moment of the film in the Trailer, really took a lot from that moment."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"A cinematic ingenious masterpiece. I was skeptical with the ""one shot"" take when I first heard/started watching the movie but I've never seen it done so well. It was a somewhat 3rd person pov that really brought the audience there with them not missing anything...literally.The people who are scoring this movie because ""there isn't enough action or the plot was boring"" clearly didn't know what WW1 was like. Movie wasn't based on any battle, it's clearly about the prevention of one. Dunkirk, without context would be the most boring war modern film created but I also enjoyed such film because of the story.If you're into the corny cliche war movies, watch Saving Private Ryan where the ""good guy"" shoots the ""bad guys"", and saves the ""damsel in distress"" & wins.--Simple plot for simple people."
1917,27 January 2020,7/10,Good movie have positives like what a great filming and music oh my God it's make you live the moment like you involved in all of these war .. But it's have negatives like ((1 german soldiers can't shot the soldier and missed him alot then why they should training shooting and then can't shoot him ?? ((2 the French women scene I think the speech was useless and can't get to any point with this speech but little girl moment was so lovely .. Third and last negative story build I felt like it's normal and not interesting.. After all I wanted to put 6/10 but last scene changed my mind and made it 7/10 .. oh my God the scene it was very sad and breaked my heart this scene unforgettable and make me think of my brother and how to protect him every time.. After all I wanna say rip to legend Kobe Bryant 24
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"""A Visual Spectacle"" - well, these movies are just class apart !
Though the best actor Oscar would be Joaquin's this year, but I'm almost certain that 1917 would easily grab the best picture academy award among several others that it truly deserves ! Yes, it's just unbelievably good !!It's literally a war poetry wherein Sam Mendes shows us almost every aspect of a war scenario,threading it alongside the terrifyingly eventful journey of the protagonists accompanied by exceptional camera work,nail-biting background score & a cinematic environment that'll just demand your attention,while you're simply glued to the screen,in anticipation of what next is to follow, in this roller-coaster of a ride !The execution is mind-blowing,with beautifully directed long takes, I couldn't even figure out a single point where the editing was evident.Flawless to say the least.
You'll feel as if you're a part of the entire movie,it's way too immersive & atmospheric.That having said, I did find it a bit slow in a few parts but the decreased pace helps you get involved with the ongoing acts even more, thus enhancing your overall experience !But yes, this movie deserves to be watched at a cinema hall. It's specifically made for that. And with probably just a week's time left for it at the cinemas,I would request you to give it a watch if you have the time, you won't regret it even one bit.A group of 5-10 people in the hall, also clapped once the closing credits started rolling. The movie really does get to you.Try to give this terrific,super-engaging movie a watch if you have the time !
It is, by all means, a sensational movie with some of the most iconic scenes to be ever present in a war-based movie !"
1917,8 March 2020,9/10,Loved the film however the Hindu's would've been been with their own brigades. There were no Africans in the British army in 1917. Please don't put PC into a good film
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"I think I have said in at least one other review, I don't like giving 10/10 as a review score, but some films just deserve it, and in my opinion this is one of those.
I also don't like to give any plot lines or any hint at the film itself, it's called 1917, it's based around WW1, that's all you need.The cinematogrophy is outstanding, the acting sublime. This film does not get in it's own way, I was totally absorbed on every level. Just watch it."
1917,23 March 2020,9/10,The one shot experience is really amazing and unseen. You can certainly be invested with this movie and the storyline is simple but impactful. There is no plotholes as the story is a straight forward one and the audience is happily stuck on their seat and wait for what's going to happen. The movie in my opinion is suitable for most ages. The cast is amazing and the ending was perfect and calming. Kudos to Sam Mendes for giving us this treat. Thanks for reading.
1917,12 October 2020,4/10,"The movie is visually stunning!And that's it.The rest is horrible trash but wrapped up in such beautiful visuals that it's probably enough for most people to enjoy.If this would have been a Chinese (or North Korean) movie, with Chinese (or North Korean) soldiers people would have reviewed it much harsher for its overly theatrical glorification of heroism, hilarious pathos and bombastic patriotism and outright corny dialogues. It also trivializes the life-and-death action with an overly melodramatic, imagination-free script. My Grandfather (WWII) would turn around in his grave watching this.But that's not all. The movie also manages to be quite boring. Not because there is little action which is totally fine. It's the lack of emotional involvement with any of the characters in the movie and the lack of excitement for what they are actually trying to accomplish.4 stars for absolutely amazing visuals and 0 for the rest. If not for the western actors I could have sworn this was directed by supreme leader Kim Jong-un.Better war movies:
PlatoonThe Thin Red LineStalingrad (German movie from 1993)Die Brücke (German movie from 1959)Full Metal JacketAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)"
1917,21 March 2020,8/10,"An astonishing cinematographic feat with lifelike production design and evocative score. Though seemingly lacking emotional weight and tension despite particular scenes striving to do so, the exquisite depiction of this heroic story of the wartimes would definitely stand among the best ever made."
1917,14 February 2020,6/10,"Let's get to it... These two guys wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes in this war being consistently naive as they are. Here's some questions for you: Would you stand in an open field watching an enemy plane get shot down above you and not move an inch until it almost crashes in to you? Would you try to save the enemy from the burning plane after your own guys put effort in to shooting him down? Would you discover a pail of milk and fill your canteen with it instead of the nearby water outlet? Would the obviously resourceful enemy leave the milk just sitting there? Would the enemy leave the dairy cow alive, knowing their enemy would soon be there, low on supplies? Then, would you give your milk away to a woman with a baby? (gee, how convenient.) Would a truck driver in an open field drive through the only mud puddle for no reason only to get stuck? I'll stop here. The movie was ok, way to simple of a plot, and way too many holes. I didn't appreciate the unnecessary editing magic that eliminated any/all cuts. Hope this helps."
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,A masterpiece of cinema. Not an easy watch but everyone 16 years old or older should see it. The members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences really should be ashamed of themselves for picking the very flawed Parasite as Best Picture and not this incredible brilliant film experience.
1917,24 March 2020,10/10,"This film deserves those awards,
The story is simple, but the music and photography are great."
1917,26 June 2020,4/10,"Two idiots stumble across fields, one of them dies, the other makes it. Tripping over cliches on the way. One minute he's an expert marksman the other a fool falling about. Then he's completely fine and able to contemplate returning home despite saying he hated going home 4 hours prior. Complete idiocy."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,Don't listen to the critics saying this movie is boring. This movie is one of the most tense and exciting movies I've seen in years. Amazing cinematography and overall amazing experience of a movie.
1917,10 February 2021,10/10,"1917 is the pinnacle of filmmaking and my favorite movie of 2019. Sam Mendes went above and beyond with his WWI epic. From the personal, up-close one-take cinematography approach to the believable characters, 1917 is filmmaking at its best."
1917,9 February 2020,8/10,"Great great great movie imho. The plot is not particularly original, since it resembles a bit the one of another famous war movie, but the rythm, the direction and images make of 1917 two hours of great cinema."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"I am stunned. This is the best bit of cinematography I have ever seen. The entire movie filmed in a single shot!! Amazing!The story is not particularly new: two men sent to stop a charge into a trap, running into obstacles and situations. ""Gallipoli"" comes to mind at once. But the urgent message took up only a few minutes of ""Gallipoli""; here virtually the entire movie carries that sense of urgency... in a single take!I am not sure whether ""1917"" is the best movie of the year, but it certainly makes a case. Without doubt it makes a strong case for best director and best everything-to-do-with-making-a-bloody-movie-award. Yeah, I highly recommend it."
1917,18 April 2021,7/10,"I really appreciated the technique and cinematography in this movie, but I don't think this only makes a movie Golden Globe or Oscar worthy. There's no story and there's no depth of characters. I normally enjoy history and war related movies a lot, but 1917 was quite... uneventful and even boring. There are a lot better war movies you can watch."
1917,8 April 2020,6/10,As far as I am concerned overhyped by no means a classic.Have seen better war films than that.Was ok.
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"This movie reminded me a lot of Dunkirk. Which I loved. It throws you in the War instantly and you follow our characters to see if they survive. Bravo to Sam Mendes and Rodger Deakins for making such a beautiful movie. Every scene is just amazing to watch and the score is one of the best of the year. This could potentially be the winner for Best Picture at this years Oscars. And it deserves it. Not only is it one of the best movies of the year but one of the best ""War"" movies EVER. Please do yourself a favor and watch it."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,It's a good movie the directing was impressive the acting is very good and the overall story is beautiful and sadMy problem with this movie it's repetitive and has some flaws in the writing and some scenes that are there just to impress the viewersOverall great movie but don't get excited to much
1917,25 January 2020,2/10,"Walking in just 2 minutes from an unscaved green scenery to a frontline trench?
There wasn't any such scenery within 10 miles of the front.
It would take a full day on foot to get that kind of difference in scenery, in 1917!Generals in a frontline trench?
Generals that knew who's brother was where at the front line?
Generals that get regular privates pulled for a message running duty, when they had dedicated message runners in WW1?It's absolute nonsense."
1917,1 February 2020,7/10,"As a theater kid/adult, I was saddened to watch this and realize it actually wasnt one shot. More like 8. It takes place over roughly 24 hrs so obviously they cant put all that plus explosives, CGI war stuff and action into one shot. There are obvious cut offs. With that being said, the storyline and entire film was absolutely wonderful.I am legit let down but not let down at the same time. I cannot NOT be let down with this movie. Only reason I went to see it was for the cinematography. I dont like war movies. BUT, the story was VERY good. They conned us on the whole ""continuous shot"" crap tho"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,Saw this movie last weekend omg what an amazing movie it was heartbreaking in places but a brilliant war movie best iv'e seen for ages
1917,3 April 2020,9/10,"There is something about this movie. I don't usually like war movies but this one makes me sit silently and enjoy every frame. It has perfect combination of every aspect and spectacularly made. I searched everything about this movie after i completely watched and feels like this movie made my day.
Thanks to everyone who worked on this movie for making of such wonderful film."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"I hate to spoil a good movie........But why not just drop coded messages from some planes.....
That way you don't have to use runners......!!??
I actually haven't seen it yet...so I will update the review later.......
However the above was my first thought on seeing rushes of the movie......
The Allies had lots of planes by 1917......!!"
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,George Mackay's dead faced soldier is the perfect metaphor for the misery and indescribable trauma of the Great War.
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,"Sam Mendes' 1917 delivers some truly awe-inspiring set pieces with the aid of its one-shot effect, but fails to take advantage of it when trying to bring stress levels back down to Earth for its quieter scenes. Not only does it not take full advantage of it, but at times the one-shot becomes truly distracting and out of place due to wonky camera work. 1917's spikes of gorgeous tension make it a must-see film, just one that does not live up to its potential."
1917,15 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is an excellent watch: brilliant set design, incredible acting all around as well as an amazing soundtrack that fit the events of the film perfectly. I also really liked the writing which delivered humorous banter and the sharing of funny stories amongst the young men sent to fight in a horrific war. I felt like it reinforced the idea that these soldiers are so close to each other that they're like children at school: constantly mocking one another and telling their own funny anecdotes. Another aspect of this film that was incredible was the atmosphere. Grimy and haunting environments (for instance, No Man's Land laden with corpses, rats and a miserable grey and cloudy sky) with eerie music was just a perfect combination.I'd say the only negative I have with this film is that it was hard to understand what some of the actors were saying at times. But other than that, I don't think I really have any other negative things to say about it. So to conclude, I absolutely recommend 1917, you'll be captivated as well as shocked (in a good way) it's a well deserved 9/10 from me ;)."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"It sometimes happens that you embark on somebody else's journey. This is exactly the way this wonderful film starts. But then, something else happens and it becomes your very own one. Since then there's no room for hesitation. It's only yours and nobody else's. Magical is the moment when we understand this."
1917,17 January 2020,,So this is the new jay and silent bob movie ? Well its not so funny like the other parts maybe cuz Will Farell its not in it
1917,19 April 2020,9/10,"1917 is definitely a very breathtaking movie. I cannot put into words how deeply it touched me and made me feel for the characters. It had everything I could possibly want in a movie and so much more, that made me want to watch it again and again. I was very pleased while watching and I was quite glad I decided to watch it. The story was brilliant, the acting was outstanding, and the whole movie was just so well done. Plus, seeing the movie as a one-shot film added a lot more depth and made me feel as if I was really there. 1917 is most certainly worth watching."
1917,29 July 2020,10/10,"Definitely a classic already. 1917 is filmed like it was shot in 1 take and its perfect, the acting is great, cinematography is astonishing. It can get intense in most parts and emotional in some parts. Definitely 10/10"
1917,29 December 2020,1/10,"Through the whole movie, we seemed to become the camera man and the non-creative director to follow these two young grunts through the WWI battlefield. There's nothing to tell during the whole trudging journey except constantly looked at these two young men's backs. There's no story to tell at all except at the final stage of the movie, a German pilot shot down by the British soldiers and then the humanitarian Brits tried to save that Nazi pilot, suffered the ""No good deeds gone unpunished"" consequence. Other than that short incident, there's actually nothing whatsoever that worth watching.Hilariously and so clueless that this deadbeat nothing happened lame movie would have won several Oscars. It only showed to us how worthless the Oscar Award has been, was and will be. We have seen so many lousy, badly directed, badly scripted, badly acted movies won so many Best Movies, Best Directors, Best Actors, Best screenplays and so on from the Oscar awards. It only downgraded the worthiness of this so-called premium movie award value. And this particular movie ""1917"" is the recent proof."
1917,7 February 2021,10/10,"Stunning film work, most landscapes are real, practical stunts, very good story line brilliant acting plus more"
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"Just got back from the movie theater. Thank you everyone, who helped me decided on which movie to see. 1917 the story of 2 British soldiers, during the WW1 are given an impossible mission . To deliver a message in enemy territory. This is a powerful movie. When the movie started it didn't waste no time in telling the story. Sam Mendes did a masterful job in this movie. The scenes were felt so close, like you were there with the 2 men. The cinematography was breathtaking. The depicts of war , was something to see. Beautifully done, The musical score was beautiful to listen to. The storyline was great. The telling of these 2 young soldiers and their journey into enemy territory was tremendous. The cast of characters was perfect. The 2 young stars of this film, did a tremendous job. They held this movie together. My opinion George MacKay, who played Lance Corporal Schofield. Should haven't gotten a nomination for acting. Well done! This is a beautiful, tremendous and wonderful piece of filmmaking. This deserves the Oscar nominations and right now it deserves best picture and best director. My rating is 9/10. Go see this movie. Again thank you all for helping me pick a movie. I will do it again, that was fun. 🙏🏻#1917movie #ww1 #sammendes"
1917,22 January 2020,4/10,"Very nicely shot and stunning Soundtrack but..
So many scenes seem too contrived and coincidental .
Left me feeling quite meh!
I believe that it was much much worse in real life with conditions beyond comprehension and this film does not seem to portray this at all.More of a Hollywood version of things.
Unfortunately not for me although im sure it will collect awards left right and centre.
Disappointing.."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I am 74 years old and 1917 is one of the best films I have ever seen.
May I suggest that you see it at an IMAX cinema. it will take you back
to the trenches of World War 1 in 1917. In particular the cinematography
is the best I have ever seen. And that includes the first half an hour of
""Saving Private Ryan."" So we have similarity to the best parts of the
latter film and the best bits of "" War Horse"" But for compelling viewing
this has even more than both of these films."
1917,6 May 2020,9/10,"Exceptional work! WONDERFUL!The work with the camera is surprising, sometimes it causes us despair in not being able to understand how certain scenes were made.
History is breathtaking, there is no time to breathe, you get involved in a way that has probably never been experienced.
It is a simple tale, without political ideology, leftism or any other influence ...SENSATIONAL!"
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"Don't get me wrong its really good but extremely slow, when you see a hill far away you half to wait till he runs to the hill, if you see a house you half to wait till he runs to the house, if very ignoring however it makes it more real. Besides that and one small slow part 3/4 in the movie its very good, but don't expect much action."
1917,17 March 2020,1/10,"Total waste of money - absolutely fine scenery for a proper WW1 movie, but did not even try.Zero credibility from the start. Absolutely no logic - neither psychological, nor military. Complete opposite to Saving Private Ryan. If you have ever been to army, you´ll just laugh at how the characters act, how they talk.First off - general chooses two random privates (1 is actually corporal) to deliver strategic message to another troop?? Thats what actually runner messengers were for. On a horse. Probably even a small cavalry troop.Going to a no mans land - and no-one in a trench knows if enemy is gone? In a trench war? Thats why the posts and snipers are for on both sides. You couldn´t even raise your finger from trench without getting the bullet or two. You would know, what time they got their dinner, what´d they eat, what they drink, screaming stuff to eachother etc.Getting almost a direct hit from a plane?? I mean, come on :D And then getting stabbed by saved pilot? How much more stupid can things turn?All the dialogue is non military, all the acting actually is absolutely non military. You wont weep and start crying, sharing your emotional and intimate moments in army in any given moment, that´s not characteristic for being in army or combat situation at all. You wont question every given order automatically like - wait, should´nt we talk about it first - with other private - what is here to talk about, when order is given? You dont ""talk about it"", you dont think, you ""dont"" nothing - you go and complete the order - running, because you are a bloody private. It´s none of your business to think. You don´t even know how to think, you can barely go to toilet and even that with sergeants supervision.Etc.etc.etc. Basically had absolutely nothing to do with real military, army or war experience. If you imagine - how would somebody with no idea about army or military life, imagine the war - then that would be it. Lots of individual heroics, lots of privates saving the day, lots of wonderful escapes from tons of bullets and traps and lots of dramatics and emotions. In reality - nothing like that at all.So impossible to take this movie seriously - just cant go into characters, its just too wrong compared to reality. And I mean like total fairy-tale-wrong."
1917,20 January 2020,1/10,"Unfortunately, I only skimmed the surface when reading the reviews, which led me to losing the price of a cinema ticket and two hours of my life. It's amazing how many fake reviews there are for this film. Lesson learned. Sort by ""Hated it"" next time...."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Quite a movie-a simple story masterfully done that told a much larger story, and that was the tragic futility of the First World War. It is art rather than entertainment or history. Having done exhaustive research on the war for One Night in a Bad Inn, many visual details were familiar. I don't remember being so affected by a movie since the Passion of the Christ. I think seeing it on the big screen amplified the intensity. We saw it in XD. I also can't recall a movie in which the music was this effective in amplifying the drama; the music sweeps you into the scene. I found it remarkable that the leads were played by unknown actors while three A list actors played cameo roles. Though the director's grandfather was in the war and one of his stories was the inspiration for movie, the story line was fictional as were the characters. Telling the details of history was not the point of the film. Telling the broad truth of a war that was one the greatest tragedies in history was.
I suggest sitting toward the back of the theater. The dialogue included R rated language that I can always do without. If you are familiar with the First World War, put all that out of your head. I was distracted thinking where are they, which battle, . . .? That's not the point. Just watch it. Having seen only one other best picture nominee, this definitely deserved to win."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"This fine film's title made me think immediately of the Third Battle of Ypres, better known as Passchendaele. That, however, was fought between 31 July and 6 November 1917, whereas the film is set on 6 April. 1917 draws upon the memories of the director Sir Sam Mendes's grandfather and was designed, remarkably, to look like one continuous shot.The two central characters, Lance-Corporals Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Will Schofield (George McKay), go on a desperate mission. This lasts one day, and certainly feels like it, and they're exposed to the full horror of World War 1. There's also a devastating tragedy along the way.Together with the horror, I think, there's pathos. I was reminded of the words of the great WW1 poet Wilfred Owen, ""My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."" This is partly reflected in the film's central theme of devotion to duty, based on absolute obedience to orders - even when a high-ranking officer tells Will to ""f off"" (I'd say that's one of the most shocking moments in the film).There's some underlying pathos too in the camaraderie between most of the young soldiers. Of course we know now that the great majority had to make the ultimate sacrifice, so the pathos is self-evident. They couldn't have known that, though, and we see that they're generally innocently good-natured and quick to help their comrades. Tom and Will clash at times but essentially they have a strong bond of friendship.Pity and horror are combined when soldiers are shot dead on sight simply for being identified as ""the enemy"". Some words from Wilfred Owen's poem ""Strange Meeting"" come to mind: ""I am the enemy you killed, my friend. /I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned/Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed."" This is even more poignant as Owen himself was killed one week before the Armistice.This film is deeply impressive and has, I think, no major faults. There are just some ""arty"" effects of flashing colours and some insistent background music. It also has touches of an action movie in which heroism triumphs against the most overwhelming odds. This is redeemed by the desperate seriousness of the mission at the heart of the film.It was clever to give cameo roles to a few star actors, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden. Nicholas Hytner had already done the same in ""The Lady in the Van"", redeploying stars from the stage and screen versions of ""The History Boys""."
1917,5 March 2020,,"This was a great movie. The only complaintbI have is that the german soldiers were as precise as the stormtroopers in star wars. They failed some easy shots against the mais character and it was annoying, but at least it didn't ruim the movie for me."
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,Big stars are just cameos & a chimpanzee could have played the main character as he was on screen with not much to say in a lot of scenes.
1917,25 March 2020,9/10,"Excellent direction, excellent cinimotogaphy, excellent screen ply"
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,Wow! A proper cinema movie - I was gripped from the start. Some of the scenes were so intense I found myself clenching fists! It really is a spectacular movie and I would recommend anyone to go to the cinema to watch this on the big screen.
1917,8 May 2020,9/10,"1917 reminds you of various movies that we have seen at different times in our life. It reminds you of #Dunkirk, #Fury and Saving Private Ryan at various junctures. The best aspect is that it is a fantastic achievement in immersive film-making. It keeps you hooked and on the edge of your seat for its entire 2 hour duration.On top of being an engaging story, it is filmed in such a way that it makes it feel like one continuous take, for the most part, which ultimately begs the core actors to deliver their brilliant performances. Quite possibly, this is #GeorgeMackay's best performance.Coincidentally, had talked about #SamMendes and his association with Louis Vuitton when I had met somebody at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris this year. We were such big fans of #SamMendes and it enabled us to talk about Skyfall and American Beauty. #SamMendes immerses his appreciative fans once again! He takes you through the loss of young lives, families torn asunder and those waiting in anxiety and hope and the overwhelming longing for home.It's not always the most comfortable experience. It is, however, a virtually unprecedented one. 😊"
1917,10 August 2020,8/10,"Amazing music, even better cinematography by Deakins. All of these combined with a true story makes this movie a very special war movie. Absolutely one of a kind."
1917,31 August 2020,9/10,"The film is brilliant cinematically but does not feel like it should win best picture at the Oscars. Don't get me wrong this movie is great and I really liked seeing it in theaters, but I do not feel it has Best Picture quality. The film is a must see in theaters as it's visual style is made for the big screen. The actors are really great and I feel the story is pretty good. The claustrophobic feel and the horrors of world war 1 depicted are amazing. The feeling of it being a single take is also really cool and I will say it is the most visually brilliant movie of the year and it's use of suspense is also great. However I feel there are many better films I have seen this year than this one such as Uncut Gems and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. This movie is a must watch film at the theaters but I feel is a tad bit overhyped."
1917,30 June 2020,10/10,Its a decent war movie but lets face its not the BEST EVER like so many ppl sayd it was after they've watched it i can think for at least 10 much better war movies
1917,18 April 2020,9/10,"The film is a model for war movies. Although the protagonist has finished his task at last, unlike the traditional personal heroism movie, the way of shooting in the end enhances the audience's sense of experience and follows the sudden crisis around the hero, which is breathtaking."
1917,13 May 2020,7/10,Through the no man's land there is the rot of the dead swamp. The fluttering white cherry petals remind me of the crown of the king in the twin towers. Ruins of Yass
1917,22 May 2020,9/10,"Only the first batch of audiences are happy, or the whole movie will not stop thinking about seats and editing points. This one mirror is not so dazzling in the end. It emphasizes real-time sense and on-site sense. The scene after fainting suddenly became magical."
1917,26 May 2020,8/10,"I looked at the end of 1917. The long lens is not just used. If it is not taken well, the effect may be counterproductive, making people feel boring and nothing, but the long lens of 1917 did not give me this. feel.The whole movie is about the two soldiers Blake and Scofield temporarily receiving the task, the task requires them to send the order to stop the offensive to the attacking Texas County troops. The lens first started from the frontier position. The black scorched earth exposed the yellowish underneath under the wash of the rain. On top of it were corpses that died as a result of the war. . Then they entered the village and were nearly killed by mines. Although they escaped their lives, Scofield's blown dust was blinded. Fortunately, Brad took his hand and escaped from the underground trench that was about to collapse. . They entered a village and saw the German pilot crash. The burning fire on the plane burned the German pilot half dead, but they were rescued by the two. However, the German pilot who opened his eyes directly gave Brad a knife. , Brad will bury his life here forever. Scofield had to continue to set off. He passed through the ruined city and died for a lifetime. The director did not show the ruins directly to you when shooting the city, but the Germans searched the flashlights of the remnants in the night, illuminating the entire ruins. The front and back sides of the ruined walls were bright and dark. Full of visual impact and soul shock, Field was in the gap between the flashes, with fear and courage, escaped the Germans' sight. A British girl and a baby who lost their parents were interspersed in the middle, which also relieved the audience, but after Field sang a song gently, he embarked on his way of reporting. He jumped into a river to escape in the chase afterwards. At this time, the sky was getting brighter. Field was almost killed in the turbulent water. He hugged a driftwood and came to the gentle downstream river. The cherry blossoms fluttered, and Field looked at This cherry blossom suddenly felt a glimmer of hope. However, on a section of the river blocked by the fallen tree, the white body was packed, and he climbed ashore in embarrassment, there was a team there, they were listening to a The soldiers sang, and the camera was aimed at all the soldiers at this time. They all faced with sorrow, remembering the long gone life or the upcoming battle in the song. When the song was over, the soldiers were preparing for the next battle. Field leaned tiredly against the tree and was told they were Texas.What followed was Field 's process of looking for a commander. It was a climax. He asked again and again in the long trenches. Finally, he found that the first attack was about to begin, so he crawled out of the crowded trenches. In the forward charging team, he was knocked down by someone. At this time, the lens gradually lengthened. He fell to the ground and he seemed very helpless and small in the charging team. However, he quickly climbed up and ran desperately. Gradually, he finally found the commander.I was relieved for Field here, thinking that the commander would say ""good, lad"" to him, but the commander seemed to be the one who saw through the war-""A command to stop the attack came, a Those who attack at dawn will come one after another. ""This is the damn war. Before it stops completely, it is battle and death. Those who survive will not proudly say"" I am the winner ""to you, It just says ""Fortunately, I'm not dead.""Finally, Field found Brad 's brother and gave him the relics. He comforted his brother ""If I may, I'd like to write to your mother. Tell her that Tom wasn't alone."" And said ""He was a good man. "".Brad 's brother was miserable, but he said you should go and find something to eat, but after experiencing this, Field only wanted to walk to a tree, leaning against it, in the thin sunlight, in the light morning In the wind, the forage swayed with the wind, and the tired corporal took out an iron box from his chest, which contained a photo of his family, with ""Good luck"" written on the back of the face. Recall that if there was no war, he should have breakfast with his family at this time."
1917,21 May 2021,8/10,"Cgi, vfx, Sound mixing, Background music, Acting, Lighting, color balancing, Camera angle, Locations, dialog, All is gooood.. I have no Words for this .."
1917,22 February 2021,8/10,"If your looking for an action war flick, skip this movie. Otherwise a very good movie. The main plot was and some subplots were a bit dubious and unlikely. And it was a bit slow. The negatives of this move are not enough for me to not watch again. Amazing effects and imagery. Single shot approach was also very effective and a good idea. The two main characters were excellent and believable. Unfortunately, some of the supporting characters were somewhat of a miscast. This movie effectively illustrated the horrors of war."
1917,4 January 2020,10/10,"I saw this movie yesterday and it is breathtaking. The camera work from 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Rodger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049) is outstanding and yet reminds of Private Ryan it surpasses it without the gory details but still puts you on the edge of your seat. It is a movie that you can connect with either if you have been in the army or not because it is a movie for all. It is a message, it is a wake-up call for the atrocities of war, and this is a war that happens now, in front of your eyes. The camera is so strong that it has some kind of documental feel that evokes some frames of Peter Jackson's ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" from 2018 where he puts never-before-seen footage to commemorate the centennial of the end of the war.Someone has said that that the war movies should not be glorified with a soundtrack but what a soundtrack this movie has! My ow my. I just want to mention one name here: Thomas Newman.Another interesting fact. In this movie, you cannot feel the special effects. It is for the first time that I am not feeling tricked by any CGI or computer gimmicks. Whatever they used here they used it wisely without breaking the balance between cinema and documentary and the final result is mesmerizing. It a disorientating, captivating, .It was filmed and edited as if it was one long take and the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. The plot is rather simple: you follow two young soldiers ordered to deliver a message which will save 1,600 other soldiers.It is a second war movie from Sam Mendes after Jarhead and it deserves special recognition from the movie industry. It is a movie to be talked about in the future because of its authenticity and the special message that it contains"
1917,11 January 2020,,"Initial reactions - I mean this is a gorgeous film with astounding set design, attention to detail, direction, and cinematography. WW1 comes to life. That much is not overhyped. But the plot often feels contrived. The sequence of events flow into one another without believability. The story hinges upon random things that happen to justify cliches that happens later to tug at your heartstrings (cough - the milk, for one) What could feel like a intimate, character driven war story, a small quest with high stakes, often feels like some like a odyssy like fantasy journey. I preferred the realism and temporal tension of Dunkirk. Where Dunkirk lacked in character building (albeit- deliberately) some may feel that this film took a bigger swing. But ultimately, Dunkirk stuck to it's guns and presented war as it was without telling you how to feel. 1917 often felt like it was desperately trying to make you care, trying to make you feel emotion, and it never quite worked. Very good, worth seeing, go see it, be entertained, be astounded, but recognize it's got a few issues."
1917,6 September 2020,10/10,"This is a great movie, I loved the photography, the soundtrack, the acting... it started a bit slow but once the story got going I never had a moment I thought I wanted to stop watching... it's cruelly honest and extremely realistic... i liked the 'one-shot'-style! This film is a testimony to Mendes' directorial qualities!"
1917,18 August 2020,7/10,"1917 - 7/10Compelling visuals and masterful technical filmmaking from cinematography to editing to sound mixing - all fantastic (although, some of the ""invisible cuts"" were blatantly obvious)
The fact that it's based on Sam Mendes' grandfathers memoirs also makes it all the more compelling. But it has many drawbacks not the least of which is that the single cut style never stops feeling like a gimmick in this film - unlike in Birdman where you're absorbed into the story - so the film itself never stops quite feeling like a gimmick either.
It also suffers from a lack of having much to say as the plot is a rather basic A B C plot with no surprises or messages to make you think in the least. Just a standard story with nothing new or original to say. Now, it tells that story well but it's not particularly compelling in any way if you've seen other more masterful war movies. To call 1917 a war film may not be entirely fair or accurate either as it feels much more akin to a thriller. But even then, it's not quite thrilling enough to be a thriller so perhaps just a war drama?
It's a masterfully made film with very few technical flaws but with many, many storytelling flaws. Far from a bad film, but still almost just as far from being great - definitely good though, just unfortunately not much more than good."
1917,21 October 2020,9/10,"I haven't watched a film with this much tension in years, there was very little letup in the first 90 mins, not your classic war movie but full of the horrors war, where everyone is a defacto hero and simply trying to survive. The film itself is pretty linear and predictable so you can say that the plot is shallow in this respect but if ever you wanted a film to embed you in the movie rather than being a spectator then this is pretty damn close. The cinematography was amazing and the soundtrack just brilliant. To me this film was everything that Dunkirk was not."
1917,14 April 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendes has accomplished something special with 1917. This is a movie that excels on every level. Let' start with the cinematography led by perennial Oscar candidate Roger Deakins. The movie is designed to play as if it were one continuous shot which is hard to pull off in any big production, much less a warm film with an enormous amount of moving parts. Not only does Deakins pull it off, it is executed flawlessly. Yes, a good eye can catch where the hidden cuts likely were, but that doesn't take anything from what they accomplished here. The camera work put the viewer on the front lines with the two soldiers whom the story follows. You experience every corner, every sound and every inch of the unknown turf with them and the tension is real. All of this is amplified by a great score which further creates a sense of unease. This is the type of movie that can startle you right out of your seat, put your jaw on the floor wondering how they shot that and bring tears to your eyes all in a 15 minute span. 1917 is unapologetic in its grim portrayal of war. It's minimalistic in many ways, but this doesn't mean it is lacking anything. The simplicity of this film is part of its brilliance. This movie should have won best picture. Not to take anything from Parasite, which was a strong film, but 1917 is a technical and visual masterpiece that rivals Dunkirk for its superb theatrical experience."
1917,26 January 2020,4/10,"I really wanted to like this but kept seeing jarring flaws that ruined the experience and found myself rolling my eyes. The Blake character seemed grossly overweight for a WW1 soldier, as though he'd been eating pizza every night. Even though they'd been given information that the German's had pulled back they seemed blase about wandering around in ""No Man's Land"" (despite being terrified of going over the top just moments before), and seemed horrified by the sight of a dead horse despite WW1 soldiers being used to seeing human remains on a daily basis (Schofield is supposedly a Somme veteran). The German's could have left snipers, no matter it soon became a stroll in the park (at one point discussing Apple blossom). They observed aircraft flying overhead without a care in the world, out in the open, despite the possibility that they might be strafed by them, or set off a Booby trap in an abandoned German bunker which resulted in Schofield merely getting dust in his eyes. The Schofield character walks across the top of a damaged bridge when he could have crawled across, sure enough a German sniper sees him (but couldn't hit a barn door of course.) Minutes before there were British soldiers galore at the very spot, but the Germans didn't see them somehow? Much has been made of the Sikh soldier. Of course there were many Sikh soldiers helping the British in WW1, but normally in their own units, and despite seeing several in the film, West Indian soldiers were not mixed in with English line regiments like the Devons. The list is almost endless, and it's a pity, because a great deal of money and effort was put into the sets, uniforms and so on. The WW1 film ""Journey's End"" (2017) is a vastly superior effort, and yet received only a fraction of the attention that this film has had."
1917,10 March 2020,9/10,"This film is a breakthrough in terms of the production values. Its cinematography was astonishing. I felt like I'm there with the characters and feeling all of those activities that were happening.It is still unbelievable for me to understand how they could handle those scenes, sequences and edits!There was a lot of minute details that they take care of like a master.
Don't even doubt that you are watching a masterpiece, a 21st century beauty, a gift from cinema, a great tribute to the victims, a great tribute to the humanity, dignity, morality...Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins and Lee Smith immortalise themselves with this masterpiece.I was in a very emotional state during and after watching this film. Actually the amount of work that I know they put on to this film was overwhelming and fantastic.There are some sequences that you will not forget ever in your life.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman did a great job and the rest of the cast were amazing also.
Thomas Newman was very good and helped to build the emotional state of the scenes.I think the only weak points about this film were toning down war and depicts it as ""soldiers-life-matters-first"" and a bit predictability of the screenplay.9/10"
1917,18 February 2020,8/10,"After the build up, expectations were high. Knowing this won an Oscar for Cinematography I paid special attention to the framing, lighting, camera movement...Upon viewing, it did not disappoint. Truly, a detailed work of art. Visually stunning. Reading the reviews on IMDB, I was surprised to see so much criticism of the movie. But after sleeping on it, indeed it was a visual masterpiece but full of plot holes.In retrospect, I'd put it on par with Avatar. Completely pushed the boundaries of visuals to place you right in the middle of the action. But the story was outrageous with far too many coincidences.Still, I give it a solid 8. Totally worth watching and I'll probably watch it again to see what I may have missed the first time around."
1917,29 March 2020,5/10,"For the hype and billing, this British WWI story should have moved the viewer with story and acting, but it just never gets where it's going. The story is flat and slow, and lacks the connection and power that successful major war epics achieve. With the derth of quality war pictures in recent years, the timing of 1917's release gave it the potential to be the next great war saga. Disappointingly, the derth continues."
1917,12 May 2020,9/10,"Hands down one of the best war movies you'll see.A beautifully paced marathon tale, punctuated by impeccable set-pieces and a brilliant balance between tension and poetic majesty.Wonderfully scored and the filming is absolutely gorgeous, as are all the costumes and sets."
1917,16 March 2020,9/10,"Giving 1917, 9/10. One thing that I liked about it is that Sam Mendes has directed the movie in such a fashion that it doesn't make us hate any country or people. It perfectly portrays the travails of war in a very realistic manner"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"For such a simple film, it's quite intense. Between the writing, acting, and directing, it was hauntingly terrifying to see on the big screen. It's shot in the style to make it all look like one scene, which only adds to the intensity because you feel like you're right there with the soldiers. A gunshot goes off and you nearly jump out of your seat, half-expecting it to be you that was shot.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to watch it a second time because of that intensity, though. It was brilliantly made, but intense enough that I can't recommend it to just any fan of war films. It may touch a little close to home for some, and that's something very important to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to watch it."
1917,7 April 2020,9/10,"With a permanent dramatic and visual journey, Sam Mendes infects us with his absolute and total determination, to fulfill his mission despite the many and dangerous adversities of the journey.
Let's quickly remember the director, a little over 20 years ago he surprised us with ""American Beauty"", ""Revolutionary Road"" and then he showed his skills in action cinema with 2 movies of 007, ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"" to name a few.
Based on his grandfather's memories -about his experiences in the WWI- for the first time Mendes co-writes a story, where he warns us about the need to go through great difficulties in order to reach our destinations and goals -and then yes- feel satisfied for having been partners in the common struggle and having achieved good for our friends and brothers.
With an impressive rhythm, the film gradually acquires a galloping and obsessive journey against time, going through situations of tension, despair, helplessness and pain: life itself.
As if that were not enough, the determination of the British director is such that he unites 3 entities into one, that is, he turns the camera, the music and the main character into the eyes of the viewer; besides at this moment the 'tempo' of the film is already an ""in crescendo"" so the tension reaches the limit and it is necessary to give the last effort, in order to reach the top that we have all set ourselves.
Apart from his forceful theme on perseverance, the author, with the intention of giving more drama and veracity to his story, establishes technical fulfillment commitments -as it is, the effect of making the film appear to be a single take-, (for this purpose, it was necessary for the cast to train for 6 months) These commitments are elements that in the end make the film rounder and give it greater coherence.
The film is a true personal achievement, made with great vision and a passion for cinema.
Captivating original music by Thomas Newman Shocking photograph of Roger Deakins Masterful performances by Dean Charles Chapman and George Mackay

1917,15 April 2020,8/10,"For the People: It is so apt and takes you to the place inside the movie, it is that involving. Perfectly done screenplay and visuals. One of the best war movies of all time for sure. By the people."
1917,1 January 2021,5/10,"I initially had no great opinion of this film one way or the other. It didn't move me emotionally, and I wasn't especially engaged with the characters even on a superficial level. There was little action, and essentially no character development, despite the enormous opportunities of two guys walking together with nothing much to do but talk about themselves. Indeed, I'm not even sure these characters had much development in them; they seemed to me none too bright at times. However, here I want to concentrate on the issue of believability.First up, for two people in a hurry to save hundreds, they seemed to have a lot of time to waste. First they had time to explore abandoned German tunnels (and get themselves blown up in the process).
Later they had time to reconnoitre a French farm house they could easily have gone around (and get one of them killed in the process). Later the survivor had time to canoodle about with a young woman and child in a bombed-out building. Finally that survivor had time to listen to a long, sad song sung by a lone soldier to a group of his fellows (all of whom were facing one way and appeared to have no-one watching their backs. Just as well a German patrol hadn't snuck up on them). When our hero does finally locate the General in charge to stop the attack, he finds that the first wave (at least) has already gone over the top and many have been killed, leading one to wonder how many lives he might have saved had he not stopped to explore the tunnel, the farmhouse, and listen to that damn song. What I'm saying is, there are more holes in this story than would have been made by a typical machine gun of the period. To make matters worse, it's already been pointed out by experts of the period that in reality the Top Brass would have dispatched a plane to drop a message, not sent two men on foot to try to overtake others on foot.Once more thing. We're told the German trap has been months in the planning, yet its only purpose is to kill 1,600 men. Really? The Germans spent months laying a trap for 1,600 men? There were millions on the Western Front; 1,600 is nothing. The odd thing is, that when we see this 1,600 it appears to be more like 16,000. Is it possible that the script was misread, or are my ears deceiving me. Surely 16,000 is more correct, yet I'm certain I heard 1,600 at least twice.An interesting film. Not a waste of time, and clever in the use of the single shot, but could have been so much better with a little more attention to the script."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,1917 was a wonderful production that fascinated us with camera shots. We can see that the Film costs a lot and that each scenes are predetermined. It's great that the quality of the subject matter and the unnecessary scenes were not included in the film. it's a very impressive film that was watched without being bored.
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Mark my words.A little better than Parasite.
This film made me cry, laugh, feel desperate, and angry.It's so well done, I felt like lasted 15 mins.10/10 would recommend."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"The cinematography obviously is stellar, but the aspect of this film seeming like one massive take is in my opinion more of a hindrance than an improvement. It's cool and unique in the beginning, but later on in the film (especially some combat scenes) there are instances where the film would massively have benefited from cutting to a different perspective.1. It doesn't help in this case that the film starts with only two main protagonists. There are movies that pull off suspense quite well with only a few central characters (I am Legend / A Quiet Place, for instance), but this one in my opinion does not.2. Because once you realise that since this film is one massive take, the only realistic stakes can be towards the end of the movie, (since if both of the soldiers fail at their mission early on and no new soldiers join their quest, the film can't really pan towards anything, so based on this, you now know that if the camera only follows those two around, its highly likely that at least one of the pair will survive for the near-entirety of the movie. And that's a big problem in a film depicting brutal war. (And if this didn't occur to you before, well, sorry :3).3. It further doesn't help that a LOT of the scenes where something meaningful happens are already in the trailer. Carrying on from point #2., if you remember seeing a scene of a protagonist in this trailer that the movie hasn't caught up with yet, well, well well.... Good films only show trailers of their beginnings, and don't show anything from the 2nd or 3rd act. It's such an obvious and easily avoidable pitfall, and yet so many films try to stuff everything in the trailer just to make people see the film, at the expense of the film itself. Having seen the trailer beforehand since it was practically everywhere, this was very bad. The plane scene, and the running-trench scene, were particularly egregious examples of this. For me, this film was like reading a book, having already skimmed the synopsis.4.When soldiers 'just miss' targets running in a straight line (not zigzagging) 15 meters in front of them, I won't lie, the film got annoying for me, that's literally one of the easiest shots to take. Shoot in the back, fin.Positives: Acting was good to very good, soundtrack, sound editing, and set design were spot on, and the story premise was decent. I truly felt for the characters, and I hear that it's based on a true story too, which is also cool. But Saving Private Ryan had a similar premise, however that movie was executed way better.Overall, I didn't feel like I had wasted my money. But I felt like this could have been so much better. For logical thinkers, and for those who have seen truly great cinema, this will definitely be overrated for you."

1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"What superlatives can be used on a movie like this? One that touches the senses in ways that you never saw coming, that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go, haunting your thoughts at random moments for years after. This is ""1917"". A brilliantly told story, cinematography that makes you realize what a movie should be, a heart stopping score, phenomenal acting, special effects that are top notch, and, most of all, a story that punches you right in the gut, and makes you so grateful for all of the soldiers who have ever fought for us, and given all so many times. It is a movie that I am going to watch on Veteran's Day, and more importantly, think of when I see a vet selling poppies, or needing help with something. Yes, this movie touches you that much. It should, hands down, get best picture, and several other Oscars too!"
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"A fantastic, emotional and adrenaline inducing movie, of two men attempting to deliver a message when all odds are against them, in the largest war in their history.
Full of nail biting scenes, emotional interactions and stunning scenery, all being filmed in long, unbroken shots.
Both the main actors knocked it out of the park, delivering incredible performances.
One scene in particular caused me to genuinely sweat with anxiety.
A film that must be seen."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendes crafts a spectacularly unique war film unlike any other that refuses to relish in its combat and violence, but instead, tells its audience an emotionally captivating story through its depiction of the gritty and raw nature of unforgiving war. Legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins works to capture every visceral frame of the film and works with Thomas Newman as he constructs a potent orchestral soundtrack that perfectly underscores every moment throughout the two hour runtime. Not a single performer on screen pulls any of their punches as everyone delivers Mendes' tight script with a pure focus that sells every scene. ""1917"" is an astonishing achievement in filmmaking on all fronts that will undoubtedly be recognized and studied for years to come.The story of ""1917"" is one of fiction that is derived from the real world stories of the world's Great War. We start by getting introduced to our central protagonists, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) as they are handpicked by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) for a mission of the utmost importance. The mission requires that both soldiers make their way to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment and relay a message to call off the assault on the supposed ""retreating"" German forces within the next twenty-four hours; if they fail, the battalion will be slaughtered and thousands of men will be lost. With the stage set and stakes known, both men embark on an arduous trek across the invaded lands of northern France making their way through an assortment of environments across the span of a single day.""1917"" is a film that features a good plot, but not a great one; if anything it comes across as thin.. However, Mendes and Krysty WIlson-Cairns' script does include several moments that seamlessly flow from one to the next and keep the momentum of the story moving forward, while most importantly, leaving long and somber sequences for the film and the audience to breathe giving room for reflection. One of the script's greatest strengths is its pointed dialogue that says so much with so little. The performers do an excellent job to enhance the script by delivering their lines in a way that evokes a natural sense of emotion that resonates deeply with the audience. From the very start, both Chapman and MacKay come across as genuinely being close friends. We instantly buy into their relationship because every exchange the two gentleman have serves to further build their on-screen chemistry. In one of the film's earliest set pieces, Chapman and MacKay brilliantly convey their companionship as one that could be classified as a younger brother/older brother dynamic where Chapman's inexperience in the field is starkly contrasted to that of MacKay's calm demeanor; every step of the way the two are challenged and we witness their different reactions to a multitude of circumstances that further display their individual intricacies. With that being said, MacKay pulls out a true stand out performance as Schofield within this film. MacKay delivers an absolutely transformative performance that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; it is a true presentation of skill that should not be overlooked.You can not discuss ""1917"" without speaking on the pre-production and execution of this film. Mendes took up the insurmountable challenge to shoot the entire film with the illusion of one continuous single shot (Despite the fact that a keen eye can spot where some of the cuts occur). The significance of the mission is known to both the cast and audience, so crafting this film with a single shot in mind is brilliant because as the passage of time moves forward, we stay on the edge of our seats knowing that with the exclusion of obvious cuts, the film is forced to keep pushing onward. All hands were on deck as the production team sculpted miniature sets to test their lighting rigs and get a direct layout of what needed to be accomplished. A dedicated team of designers were painstakingly tasked with bringing every ""1917"" set to life; and it pays off. With the knowledge of what track the camera was to follow and dozens of rehearsals, ""1917"" pulled off what most would not dare to try. When the actors are moving throughout these diverse environmental sets, every segment of the frame is packed to establish a dirty, yet natural world that is as beautiful as it is immersive. Whether it is an object in the background or a character in the foreground, David Crossman, Jacqueline Durran, Dennis Gassner, Lee Sandales, and Robert Voysey come together to create a world that is accurate to the times and precisely encapsulates the depressing realities of the First World War. The technical aspects that help shape ""1917"" into the marvelous film it is, serve as a reminder of the lengths a focused group of immensely talented people will go to create the best piece of work they possibly can and it should not go unnoticed.""1917"" is an enchantingly tense piece of art that straps you in and never lets go until the final cut to black. Mendes along with the entire cast and crew craft a truly immersive experience that paints the art of war as not one of bombastic explosions and blood, but one of fear, disarray and raw emotional weight that burdens every soldier on the battlefield. ""1917"" may not have the most engaging story to tell, but it does not need it; the way in which the film was made and shot is a triumph on its own that many can look to and see that an inspired group united to create a powerful work of art that will be talked about for going above and beyond its genre. ""1917"" is without a doubt, one of Sam Mendes' finest pieces of work.Final Verdict: B-"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Different from other war movies, this film is so beautiful that it make my heart melt and my eyes cry. The Wayfaring Stranger song sang beautifully, the emotions that George MacKay and Dean Chapman acts as Schofield and Blake, a huge set to make this film, the soundtracks, made me like I am in the movie and they take my hand to see the adventure of the two soldiers delivering a message.
Of course, Roger Deakins, Sam Mendes, and other crews really put hard effort to create such a masterpiece.
One thing I really hope is I can see what Schofield life after that."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"A British General gambles 1600 human lives on a long shot punt during WW1. It's a 2 horse race, the bets are in and odds are extremely short. The track conditions are poor and this is a long distance race. Winx wouldn't blink during this one."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"This movie was so overwelming. The Imax screen and sound along with the outlandish and frankly groundbreaking camerawork just added to the experience. The tension was palpable and consistent. Very little time for breathing. Like a horror movie. A 2 hour non stop thrill ride, with few tension release moments.At the bridge scene, I just could not take it anymore. My heart could not stop pounding. My BP went up the sky. This felt so real. I went home. I needed a little bag to breathe. My wife called the doctor. They sent an ambulance!! I could not fight in a war. I know that, because I was in one yesterday. And I felt like almost dying of the tension alone.How real does a movie experience has to be? I saw my first movie in 1983, in a small theater in a small village, I think it was Banana Joe. We still had the afternoon matinees which starred Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. Dirty dancing and Moonwalker were big hits. Yes Moonwalker. We can hate this movie all we want now, but a lot of kids liked this movie, back in the time. It all changed with my first war movie: Hamburger hill , then came born on the fourth of july (yes in that order, some movies were screened late) Platoon and of course Full metal jacket. Which I found difficult to watch. And still feels very real. Especially the first part. I saw Apocalypse now some 10 years later... on a small screen...then came Saving private Ryan and so forth. But this is the first time I had to call an ambulance. I wanted to see the remaining 45 min. But the paramedics ordered me to see badboys 3 instead.Next week Schofield and Blake...I will risk an attack to stand beside you. But who will be the last man standing? Stay in the frame, please....."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"This is a great movie 8 maybe 9-10. But I dont put it on par with Saving Private Ryan...I have seen alot of people say its better...its not. Its VERY CLOSE to on par with Saving Private Ryan but it lacks depth that SPR has. SPR also concludes the story much better than 1917 concludes is narrative.The one shot take is what really stands out though and makes this movie unique.If 1917 had a better ending...9-10 easy
If 1917 also had more depth...10-10 (on par with Saving Private Ryan)"
1917,27 January 2020,7/10,"In a film landscape where Marvel movies are understood by many as masterpieces, and true art films are so connivingly dissected that nothing is above some reproach, a film such as 1917 makes perfect sense. I have read film critics copiously bandy about the descriptor ""immersive"" when attempting to justify effusive praise for this film the same way ""pathos"" is and has been inevitably invoked to describe the films of Charlie Chaplin. I suppose ""immersive"" does seem like a good fit in a film with a singular linear narrative; on the other hand, with such simple storytelling at play, were 1917 not ""immersive,"" it would be an utter failure.Amidst the height of the First World War, two British soldiers, lance-corporals Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George McKay), are sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message to another regiment that will stop a battle and save the lives of 1,600 men, one of whom is Blake's brother. As they battle the clock, their perilous trek through filthy rat-infested trenches and across enemy territory littered with booby traps is filled with high drama rendered ultra-realistically and seemingly captured in real time. Along the way, others that enter and exit the story in small but memorable cameos give the narrative a context and depth that profiles more than mere characters, but the time in which they lived and the war they volunteered to fight and even die for.If many of these elements seem somehow familiar, that is because they are. Though undeniably ""immersive"", 1917 is more than anything else derivative. Make no mistake, this is an exceptional movie, although there is no way it could ever be described as exceptionally original. The heavily praised continuous take presentation has a deep and long precedent, originating with Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope, and most successfully executed with Birdman in 2014. The plot, though based upon true stories told to writer/director Mendes by his WWI veteran grandfather, bears more than passing resemblance to story elements from Saving Private Ryan. Many other film techniques and depictions may only be generously described as homages to Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now.So does this lack of originality make 1917 a bad film? By no means. The acting is superb and effortless, the music stirring, the cinematography and editing nothing less than brilliant. Does this set a new high watermark for technical film quality? You bet. Writer/Director Sam Mendes has never made a bad film, and here he just may have assembled a perfect one, constructed of the best parts of many other successful films before it.I suppose in a film culture saturated with countless sequels, prequels, reboots, and reimaginings, this is the new normal. In that context, for better or worse, 1917 is the state of the art."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I found the music in 1917 continually overpowering and intrusive, as if I were never trusted to observe and think or feel for myself, but had to be led.While the English soldiers are very personalized, and shown as brave, committed, silly, noble, frightened, persevering, the Germans are portrayed as duplicitous and savage the only times they appear and are deceitful in their off-camera essence as well, setting traps large and small.When English trucks become stuck in mud, do the English in general not know what to do? Did English military trucks in 1917 not carry cables?Will reassures the French woman that he is English, not German - a woman in a cellar alone at night is going to be reassured to learn the nationality of the man holding a gun on her?While talk about the movie seems centered on the device of a continuous take, the film actually seemed to me to be ticking off one war film cliche after another. I entered the theater ready for something novel and affecting, but within the first few minutes felt unimpressed and remained so for the rest of the picture."
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,This movie looks beautiful in places and the story of two soldiers chasing through no mans land to stop a doomed assault is an interesting one. The film certainly has a handful of stand out moments - the tunnel scenes and plane crash to mention a couple. One or two scenes are also shocking and one in particular made me jump out of my seat. However it all becomes a bit 'arty' and slightly surreal in places. The ending in particular is weak. The much talked about continuous shot works well in some places but bogs the story down in others. Acting is okay but I found the two leads a little stilted in places and the procession of British character actors in cameos a bit distracting. Do not go expecting a trench based version of Saving Private Ryan..you will be disappointed! Overall an interesting movie which I enjoyed but was slightly disappointed by given all the hype. Look up 'The Lost Battalion' if you want an action packed WW1 film with a great story and likeable characters.
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,War movies are the go to section for best picture at the Oscars but here me out this is no typical war film it is a visecral tension filled emotionally harrowing film where every technical aspects helps the movie to go forward from sound mixing to sound design to ost everything is in sync with the movie so that a audience can get a satisfying experience. Sam mender is back from his earlier lacklustre film with a bang this is his most personal film because the story is about his grandfather who served world war 1 and it talks about the sheer humanity and going forward to finish what is started the fantastic capability of a person's state of mind the humongaus will power to complete the mission in order to save one's brothers in arms is goosebump enducing and tear jerking and coming to another master who is sir Roger deakins who masterfully shot the film which is one take my God how he and editor and Sam Mendes filmed those impossible scenes that is just crazy to just think only. It is not a gimmick it just immerse you with the characters depicted in the screen bravo!. And the actors delivered some of there career best work. Saving Private Ryan got a worthy competitor in the 21st century and frankly this is the best action film of the decade ever. Oscars are tough thistime.
1917,19 January 2020,7/10,Films ok it's worthy of a 7-10 lots of cameos from good actors
1917,30 December 2019,6/10,"Weak writing, overall unrealistic and definitely overrated."
1917,15 January 2020,3/10,I walked into the theater believing the hype and walked out bored to tears.
1917,9 February 2020,8/10,Visually this film is amazing. Beautifully shot. The cameos are great and story style of meeting new people along the way.I didn't think Chapman was/is a great actor in this film - don't recall seeing him before - so it was a positive that he doesn't last the duration.The French girl and baby seemed a bit unnecessary as well and was clearly a point for the milk to be of use.Good film.
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,"Nicely ( not extraordinary in my view) shot , interesting tale but mainly a modern day Saving Private Ryan ( nowhere near as good ) ,unfortunately not over enthusiastic over the acting too, fairly wooden in my opinion.The score is not memorable either , plus with spoilers in my mind , some quite ridiculous scenes.As you can see it's just another war film for me ,of which I've seen many ,no different and a pointless remake . Tbf the one shot technique is lost on me so much for that.
Wouldn't recommend anyone unless they are war film aficionados , if it's raining don't waste your time 7.4 for us ."
1917,7 February 2020,9/10,"I feel really sorry... really sorry for the ones who haven't seen this movie yet.
This is a week after I watched it in the most crowded but at the same time quite IMAX showing I have ever been to. And after a week 1917 still sits in me and I still dream about it at night.
I'm not going into detail about the technical aspects of the movie. Because you know it's a masterpiece by what you heard already.
Just trust me when I say say you WILL love it. It's NOT just another action war flick but yet it's still more exiting and tense that any action or/and war movie I have ever seen.And please don't listen to the bad reviews, they have probably pirated the movie and watched it in bad quality with bad sound otherwise they think transformers is the best movies you can watch... sorry can't find another explanation."
1917,18 May 2020,10/10,"It seems that the whole movie is directed in just one take. There are literally no cut's in this movie. It's like you're in the middle of every scene. It's like you are next to the actors in between the fight. The story is great, it's never boring. They used just one camera."
1917,9 January 2020,8/10,"Nineteen seventeen. Sam Mendes. Just superb.This movie is downright amazing. Definitely one of the best movies of 2019 and one of the best war films I've seen. It's thrilling, exciting, scary, shocking and heartfelt, all jam-packed into one beautiful film.The biggest topic of this film is probably how it looked as if it was shot in one single, continuous take. And there's good reason for it. The one-take format just elevated this whole movie with so much more tension and immersiveness. It's very well done from Sam Mendes. There are some scenes where it's easy to spot when they decided to stop the shot and transition into another, but over time it just became seamless.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is also very on-point (as usual). As well as Thomas Newman's score. That was 1917's secret weapon. The score brings the movie from 100 to 1000. Everything is just elevated the moment Newman's score hits and it is beautiful.Performance wise, the entire cast is superb. Especially George MacKay. His performance was just fantastic. I did appreciate that the film didn't focus on the characters with the big stars (Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden) playing them.1917 is an epic, visceral, stunning depiction of WWI. Buckle up cause once it starts, it doesn't stop."
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"The acting is ridiculous, a normal person would not do any of the things the to soldiers did, like walk towards the planes having a dogfight. The hype of this movie is so over rated, I was keen to walk out of the cinema but thought surely something exciting must happen soon - it never did"
1917,14 August 2021,8/10,"I had he rewatch the first 20 mins in the beginning to make sure I, my brain and my eyes are okay."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"I feel like this film captures the essence of such statement much more so than many other films of the action/war genre. Together with our hero, we realize that all our plans and desires are fragile. Quite often, in fact, it's our own physical limitations as human beings that prevent us from fulfilling set goals. Intentions however not only count for getting war medals, but they do make a difference. I just love this half-full vs half-empty undertone that the film sets from start to finish.Speaking of this film from the technical standpoint, it is as good as they say. While initially I was unsure about using long takes (not the biggest fan of such gimmicks), I felt in this case its use did not detract anything from the plot. It actually made it appear more personal in places.p.s. Special mention goes to some of the best foreshadowing moments I have witnessed so far."
1917,30 May 2020,1/10,"This has got be the most overrated movie of all time. Hailed as the greatest war film ever. How? Why? The plot is full of holes, just like the extras. Most of the storyline was so badly thought out it beggars belief. Example: Our main man finds of all things a pail of milk in an abandoned, blitzed farmstead, puts it in his canteen as he has run out of water. Further down the road near his destination he somehow finds the only woman in the area hiding in a burnt out buildings cellar. She has a baby with her and guess what...she needs milk for the baby but has none, but wait, you've guessed it, he has a canteen full of it. What the heck. Prior to this his mate got stupidly killed at the said farmstead, then out of nowhere just at the other side of a building is what looks like a battalion of soldiers who were too late to help and didn't even go to check on the downed plane. Look I'm getting lost now just like the plot, so I'll stop. There are plenty more of these beauties littered through the film. I expected so much from this movie after all the hype but was so disappointed. The single continuous use of the one camera was the only well thought out part of the film. You need to watch this film just to see how ridiculous it is. Makes Dunkirk look like a classic."
1917,25 January 2020,5/10,"This movie is surprisingly not as good as the hype. I struggled trying to come up with a rating because there are certainly great parts of the film. The cinematography, score, and actors are all great. The screenplay and directing not so much. Just as in the Revenant and Jarhead; I heard what a great movie but was sorely disappointed. A movie has to be believable; what I loved about Saving Private Ryan was you felt like you were experiencing it and forgot that you were in a theater. The movie lacked flow and believability. There are too many Hollywood ""Come on...that's ridiculous"" moments too be listed as one of the great war movies. It will win awards on hype instead of truly being great. It's good to see once but you'll probably never watch it twice."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"WWI is my favorite war. I've read a dozen books about the air war in particular but despite knowing a lot about it all it's always been difficult to imagine what the ground war was like. No more. This visualization is so detailed and convincing, I feel I was there.Add flawless acting and a plausible story and you have the one war movie I've been able to get my wife to watch and actually praise."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,I was looking forward to this but I just didn't enjoy it. The story didn't grip me at all and I was getting bored watching it. I didn't particularly like the characters either. People throwing scores of 10's around yet again. 10 is perfect how can you have so many perfect films out there.
1917,21 June 2020,6/10,"I really wanted to love this film, and I do feel guilty rating it at 6/10. All 6 points are for the cinematography. Visually it was a stunning film, the scene with George MacKays character running through the ruined town was breathtaking, a real triumph. But in my opinion the acting from the two main characters let the film down. Both were just a bit flat, and when things happened to each it was difficult to connect and empathise with them.Maybe my expectations were too high. I would never tell people not to watch 1917, I just can't imagine I'll go back for a second try."
1917,10 February 2021,10/10,I cannot fault this as a film in any way. Simply incredible cinematography throughout and stellar acting with some brilliant appearances from well known faces. The story is a simple one really but done in such a way as to draw the viewer into the frame and have you on the edge of your seat throughout. A modern-made war film classic.
1917,28 March 2020,9/10,"1917 is simple, haunting, and deeply affecting. A seriously great film!"
1917,8 June 2020,8/10,"This film is overwhelming. I have nothing further to add, other than the compelling need for eternal remembrance to those who sacrificed their lives in any way, we can not fathom. We, citizens of any country, today, should feel ourselves lucky and blessed to exist. A Happy New Year to all. George from Hellas. NB: do not give it a second thought; watch it; even if this genre is not your cup of tea. After all, it is much more than a feature film. It's a massive dedication to unselfishness. Do yourself a favour and watch it. And then watch it once more."
1917,14 May 2021,10/10,"1917 was officially released in January 2020, and it is perhaps the best war movie that I have ever seen and one of the best movies of 2020. I recently watched Saving Private Ryan, and I do believe that 1917 is superior. Some reviewers make it sound like 1917 is simply a technical triumph that is light on plot poignancy, but that diminishes the humanity that this movie represents. You feel like you are a part of the trenches. When a certain bomb goes off about 1/3 of the way through the movie, you live and breathe that moment in a way that 99% of movies could only ever hope to achieve.This is a powerful movie. Give it a watch. You will not be disappointed."
1917,14 June 2020,1/10,"My wife really wanted to watch this movie, 2 hours of mind-numbing boredom, don't bother."
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,Saw it today. I have no words. I love that's one shot. Great job!
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,"Again, another overrated movie, along with The Marriage this year. What's going on in Hollywood? The movie is not horrible, and actually enjoyable. But why so many nominations? The cinematography is good, but not better (not even close maybe) than The Russian Arch. So, if you want to see a movie without editing cuts, oh boy, that Russian marvel depicting the Hermitage and the history of Russia at the same time will make you really happy.Also the story does not really seem to be very impressive, since there are countless war movies with similar topics -Saving Private Ryan would pup up in my mind several times while watching this- and kind of simple as well (Guy goes on a mission, guy overcomes obstacles, mission accomplished).All in all an enjoyable film, and probably a succesful experiment, but as a whole it really falls short of being the tremendous multy award deserving masterpiece they are promoting."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,The Battle of Jangsari Wow so many western films WW1/2 but Korea...its forgotten. The movie The Battle of Jangsari is brilliant check it.
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is another in the Deakins film bio that will Garner the Oscar for best cinematography, since the dialogue didn't tell the story but the cinematography did. It had to for this insurmountable task to ever come off on screen the film had to tell this story. The one shot illusion was a marvel in how to advance this technique called film making. I love the idea of using ground breaking tech to further the art of film making. This move is incredible, well directed and the cast was incredible. The lead in this film has every right to be a nominee!"
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,"Absolutely superb simple portrayal of a few hours in the life of ordinary soldiers. Beautifully filmed, disturbing, realistic. One of the great WW1 films."
1917,15 January 2020,1/10,"What happened to the Sam Mendes, from works of substance like 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' to somewhat juvenile, empty of soul films like '1917', where deep characters and real emotions are subverted for theme rides. Here, of all subjects to use for a theme ride, ""the Great War"" is a vehicle for an action adventure, fantasy-esque quest, that not only sheds little about the horrific war itself, but sanitises the sacrifice of young men by a corrupt elite on both sides of the war, who profited heavily from their demise. But you might say, ""Elcid, this is a popcorn action flick, you got to switch off your brain mate, enjoy the ride..."", yet even for mindless action, I never felt at the edge of my seat, and all of the meant-to-be tense and gripping scenes felt forced and contrived, and you could see the actors reacting to cues rather then immersed into Sam's world of make believe. There are two truly great scenes in 'Children of Men' (Alfonso Cuarón), both near the beginning and near the end, where the action takes place in one shot, and here the veracity of both the characters and their environment is so powerful that you truly feel immersed and haunted by the scenes. In interviews, Mendes says he was inspired by these scenes, but it seems by trying to emulate them, he has missed a trick - to justify the story within them! Therefore it feels like you are watching someone else play a video game, where the main protagonist has 9 Lives and reaches number 8 before he succeeds to the final level boss - an underwhelming encounter with Benedict Cumberbiatch (sic) who says ""foff"" and the audience foff too, to recollect on a lost 2 hours. The score by Thomas Newman is also misplaced and passé - think a Hans Zimmer rendition of Lord of the Rings'. The only redeeming feature is the cinematography by Roger Deakins, yet even here, it inevitably draws comparison to the superior cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki ('Children of Men'), and whilst it is interesting to purely admire the technical achievement and continuous mis-en-scene in one shot (with hidden cuts), I think such a scheme ultimately ends up stealing the emotional veracity from the characters since we never really get up close and personal to them to see their eyes - their windows to the soul. The distance makes for a mute joy ride, and it is a shame as rather then free Deakins to bring out the best in the visuals, the one-shot idea has constrained him. There is to my knowledge only two great audio-visual works on WW1 and they are Blackadder Goes Forth (TV Series) and 'Paths of Glory' (Kubrick), alongside great films about all wars, from 'Full Metal Jacket' to 'Apocalypse Now', 'Catch 22', 'Salvador', 'The Battle of Algiers', to name but a few."

What '1917' decides to ignore to its folly is that at the end of the day, it is ordinary people fighting ordinary people. Brother against Brother. Sister against Sister. That's the folly of war and something great director's like Kubrick nailed to the mast in their war films!But you might say, ""Elcid, this is a popcorn action flick, you got to switch off your brain mate, enjoy the ride..."", yet even for mindless action, I never felt at the edge of my seat, and all of the meant-to-be tense and gripping scenes felt forced and contrived, and you could see the actors reacting to cues rather then immersed into Sam's world of make believe.There are two truly great scenes in 'Children of Men' (Alfonso Cuarón), both near the beginning and near the end, where the action takes place in one shot, and here the veracity of both the characters and their environment is so powerful that you truly feel immersed and haunted by the scenes, and the narrative benefits from the continuous shots.

1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"It's 1917, France, and two soldiers are sent on a mission to cross no man's land and get a message to another platoon to stop an attack that would result in great losses.
This is a fantastic film. Beautifully shot, with long tracking shots that heighten the urgency of the quest, and a music score that adds to the tenseness. (I needed a restorative G & T afterwards) Wonderful performances from George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman and great support from a who's who of British actors. Don't miss this on the big screen."
1917,8 May 2020,3/10,"The difference between this experience and root canal surgery is that this movie is visually stunning with a gorgeous soundtrack. Otherwise, both experiences are very similar and seem much longer than 2 hours. THANK GOD for fast forward! And thanks to God, too, that it never occurred to me to say to my wife: ""Why don't we go out tonight and sit in a dark theater and observe the unrelenting horrors of war for 2 hours."" Some war movies rise above the horrors with character development and plot. No so here. finally, if you ever found yourself annoyed by the pretenses of Hollywood, know that films like this are their own punishment. Everyone involved, despite their million $ lifestyles, had to spend every waking hour with this horror. Anti-war, for sure, and maybe someone out there (Hollywood?) needs a blatant reminder that war is Hell."
1917,27 December 2020,5/10,"Movie was stunningly beautiful to watch and the effects and cinematography....blah blah blah were all amazing.Where i have trouble with it is the plot and the events that followed. Only 2 people are tasked to go on a mission of great importance and there was supposed to be no enemy in the way but it was more of an assumption. Seriously my commanding officer would have sent minimum 8, just in case. While the camera work and cinematography and sound effects were amazing, in terms of actual dread and despair there isn't much. As visually stunning as the movie is, filming a war that was known to be one of the worst in history... the plot, dialogue, and overall feel of the film felt campy. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Lebanon, Fury, Das Boot were all far more engaging and far more suspenseful.Visuals, the long camera sequences and achievements done behind the camera is the only reason this movie gets a 5 out of 10. Considering all the WWI material i have read, and seen in movies or documentaries, and comparing it to other war movies this doesn't crack my top 15 war movies list."
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is extremely well crafted. The incredible camera work guides the viewer through the story of the two young soldiers, while the score intensifies the emotions felt during the viewing in an astonishing way.1917 is a great movie with a compelling story, interesting characters, and above all a beautiful way of showing these to the audience. I highly recommend seeing this movie, as it is definitely worthy of Academy Awards such as Best Score, Best Director and even Best Picture."
1917,29 September 2021,6/10,"I enjoyed the first half hour and then it went from bad to worse. Basically after 30 minutes the story is filled with inconsistencies. One scene after the other I asked myself what added value it had. A raging river in that part of France? All mamals are dead except the rats and 1 cow next to a farm which has a bucket full of milk sitting next to it. No humans in sight except dead cows. Then suddenly a regiment of Tommies show up. They are urinating against the farm. They drive merrily around in trucks behind ennemy lines while the two main characters had to make their way through barbed wire, mud, corpses of horses and humans, booby traps, crows feasting on bodies etc. Our hero gets shot in the front of his body but when he wakes up he has a wound in the back of his head. And this goes on and on."
1917,4 June 2020,8/10,"This is a film that anyone who appreciates great cinematography should see! I suspect this movie will run with classic war films like Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan for years to come! You get a front row seat into the soldiers experience of World War I in a super unique single-clip view, giving the element you're walking along with the characters as it all unfolds.Top notch effects! Impressively massive and beautiful sets! The entire cast is fantastic, and this film made a fan of George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman out of me.The only critique I really have for it is that I wish they would have gone a little more in depth with the main characters. I felt like there may have been missed opportunities for that in some of the longer walking shots.While the film certainly has it's emotional moments, it's not quite the emotional power house of other war films (to me that is). This film mostly captures the environment and drama of WWI. The noises, the miserable conditions, and just how much soldiers experienced in only a movie-lengthed period of time.I'd recommend anyone looking for adventure to check out 1917! Watch it on the biggest screen with best sound system you have access to!"
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"An unbelievably good film the story, the way it's shot and the acting all superb it's deserving of all its awards and more."
1917,7 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is a poem.
Is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI.
This movie made me leave the movies with tears in my eyes as if I have had a time travel experience to the World War I, and then waking up and realizing how wonderful are the times we are living in.
1917 is a must see movie for everyone."
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Even if you're not a fan of War movies, I would still recommend this to anyone! It is a brilliantly told story that is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and perfectly scored in terms of music! It is an absolute pleasure of a film. Each scenes keeps you intrigued and on the edge of your scene.Some war films have the hindrance of getting complacent and boring, but 1917 manages to keep you in and it flows so very well! Some fast past scenes with some nice character driven scenes; you won't be disappointed! It is the right length too, as some war movies have the habit of being too long for my liking. But at just under 1hr 50 odd minutes, it was a perfect length.Some cameos from some very famous actors will also surprised and please you!"
1917,8 February 2020,9/10,"What a wonderfully told war story. Not a lot of dialogue, but the action and storyline was incredible."
1917,13 May 2020,8/10,"First things first, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a proper, 'watch it in the cinema' war film. The way that is is filmed in one continuous shot brings both positive and negative aspects, but it certainly sucks you into the movie and doesn't let up. I thought the first 40 minutes or so were completely brilliant, comparable to other greats like Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. The rest of the film was enjoyable, but there were many plot holes that took away from the reality somewhat.The cinematography is worth a special mention. It was right that it won the Oscar as it is absolutely incredible throughout. It feels like a lot of work went into the film and it certainly deserves to be watched at least once.All told, 1917 is an intense, well produced and ultimately enjoyable war film."
1917,20 September 2021,10/10,Wow just wow from the incredible realism to the god tier cinematography combined with a heart-wrenching and at times scintillating story that'll keep you on the edge with chills throughout. 1917 is a Rare Masterpiece.
1917,19 July 2021,6/10,"Oh god... A one shot movie?! Oh my... So revolutionary... Brilliant... Brilliant! Wait you are telling me that the movie is not actually one-shot but it is made to look like it is one-shot since shooting a one-shot movie is impossible? Well then what about ""Victoria (2015)"" which is THE TRUE ONE-SHOT MOVIE? At least I hope the connections between cuts look perfectly seamless, that's the case with 1917 right?.. Right? No? You are telling me that the cuts are so obvious even a toddler can notice where they are? Then what is the point of this so called ""technical achievement""? Really, did we come to a point in filmmaking where just camera work on its own guarantee you a spot in the list of ""Highest Rated Movies of All Time""?Conclusion: This movie is nothing but glorified camera work and some generic war movie with checkpoints."
1917,19 April 2020,3/10,"Let's send 2 young ignorant soldiers to save 1,600 others. Well if that's your best idea then you deserve to die. The British in WW1 & WW2 were about the dumbest around. The only reason that the German War machine was defeated was by shear allied numbers of machines and troops. The Germans should be ruling right now. Heck they even invented the Atomic bomb and Serin gas. Every one else was worried about hurting others feelings like a Fk'n Millennial!!!!"
1917,31 December 2019,2/10,"Never have the trenches of World War One been so tidy -- never have the ruined walls and arches that surround them been so picturesquely arranged -- never have the fingernails of the soldiers been so clean, their teeth so straight and white, their hair so artfully mussed. Even the rats looked like extras who had wandered in from a live action remake of Ratatouille. Did the filmmakers not see Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old? About fifteen minutes in my wife and I knew with a certainty that one of the handsome chaps would not go the distance, and once the remaining handsome chap was on his own we knew with an even greater certainty that he would meet a cowering French peasant girl in a barn or cellar, and that she would be clutching an infant while shells exploded overhead, and sure enough, about forty minutes later, there she was, fresh from having her tumbling golden curls blown out at a good salon. We relished the interiors of the buildings in the ruined town, where patches of brick showed through the plaster walls with all the gritty realism of the decor of a 1950's Italian restaurant in Newark. And to yank us out of the movie right when we might have been giving over to it in spite of ourselves, cameos by Patrick Melrose and Robb Stark! Gorgeous technical work by Roger Deakins and team gets this a couple of stars. On Oscar night that will be the wife and me me rolling my eyes when this wins best picture."
1917,24 May 2020,5/10,Amazing cinematography. Amazing colors and sounds. Painfully boring storyline and movie. Couldn't hold my attention. Would have walked out if I wasn't with friends.
1917,30 January 2020,6/10,Watched it 4dx some very god special fx bar that standard not a great storyline
1917,29 April 2020,10/10,"Even if history movies bore you, there's plenty of action to be enjoyed here. The characters are great, the cinematography is great. and you truly feel for the problem the main character faces. The running scene is one of the most expertly crafted and intense moments in any film ever, even more than in most horror movies. Absolutely worth a watch."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is a triumph at all levels. Filmed as a unique shot, it puts us inside the anguish, cruelty and adrenaline of war. We follow two English soldiers aiming to deliver a message to a frontline battalion that is about to fall into trap that may turn into a massacre in case they are not warned in time. Since the first moment until the end, the cameras follow tirelessly the two soldiers in their almost impossible demand. What is more impressive in 1917, besides the technical prodigy of tricking us into believing it is all just one shot, is the realism in which it paints this story and emerge us into it. We end up living what the two soldiers experience. Accompanied by the extraordinary music, by Thomas Newman, and the usual expert cinematography, by Roger Deakins, Sam Mendes' prospection through the fields of the Great War is truly remarkable."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was amazing, lightening,sound,action and the actors were amazing, I saw a lot of movies and this was the best wow this amazed me!"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing war film. It success not only through great directing, acting, and cinematography, but also because it felt different. This is not just another war film."
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"The whole film consists of two super long lenses. But the long lens of this film is not used to show off skills, but to make you unable to escape from the most personal senses, unable to watch, unable to choose the grand perspective of history, unable to treat everyone in the film as the statistical data in the war. So a unique technique with a unique narrative way is excellent."
1917,20 July 2020,7/10,"There was a lot of hype for 1917, so when I went into watching the film I was expecting a lot. I do enjoy war movies and feel I'm more familiar with WWII compared to WWI. From the start of 1917, I was sucked in. It felt so cinematic, real and raw. This was mainly thanks to Sam Mendes' long shot, which let you feel how big the scene really was. After watching the movie, I listened to a lot of special features and was amazed at how they were able to accomplish this and what they could do. No wonder why they got the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Definitely deserved! I also think the music was really nicely implemented in the film and the acting was well done. While there were a lot of (what felt like) cameos from some BIG actors (ex: Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Mark Strong to name a few), George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman stole the show for me. They are two very impressive actors that should blow up after this."
1917,16 February 2021,9/10,"Fantastic Camera Work and Editing!!!
A Epic visual treat."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"Definitely on the must list for this corterie. I'm not a fusillier (or whatever BT calls hisself), but the weapons and kit looked smack on. The manufactured trenches were enough to give one the willies, and wonder how they trained all those rats. There's not a plot-it's all in the journey, er, quest. Characters met along the way make the story. In a series, protagonist (not hero) encounters officer fixated on his watch to get it exactly correct; officer incoherent and in tears, useless; officer too busy to be bothered. Best line from a major who knows the message is to not attack, 'Have witnesses when you deliver the order to the colonel, there are men who love to go on fighting.""
The ""one take"" technique works ( fun to watch where the transitions are; they obviously couldn't shoot in one take), by the end of the trek, you're much more tired than with the usual scene breaks. Impressed by sequence in ruined city lit by falling flares; the shadows move realistically.
They avoid a blatant moral. The cumulative affect by the end if how stupid war is. No glorifying. Pathos avoided-well, the mother, baby encounter a bit much-and just enough sentimentality.
Quibbles: I'm no geography expert, but don't think there's raging rivers with tall waterfall in that part of France."
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,"A movie with such tremendous attention to detail should not have an outlandish series of coincidences. Worse, the actions of are two heroes are unlikely and Illogical to a fault at times."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"Great movie, really, really good. The one-take cinematic approach is mindboggling, it looks like it really only took around 2 hours to film it! But for some preparations.
I like the story, too. But why didn't they just fly in?"
1917,9 February 2020,8/10,One of the best films that I've seen in a while and my favorite for the Oscars. The nearly 2 hour movie went by in no time. I didn't realize while watching that my emotions had become so heightened because by the end I had tears in my eyes. Was not expecting that. Would highly recommend!
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,"Great cinematography - you feel like you're there in a sense, enough to keep you engaged throughout with one scene only that drags, odd scene a tad far fetched, does show some horrors of war, no real storyline or character background."
1917,1 August 2020,10/10,It's been a very long time since I've seen a high quality film such as this one. It was perfect.
1917,9 February 2020,6/10,"One shot gimmick of the movie seriously undermines the potential of the movie. Instead of normal immersive feeling of a good movie, you get what feels like on the rails trip following two soldiers on their way from point A to point B. This ride along feels very planned and convenient, seriously lacking organic touches of good story telling.There are also few too many modern cliche's that erode the historical authenticity of the movie. Also for WW1 war movie, the whole thing just comes of as way too clean.Movie as whole is not that bad but definitely not worth the hype it is getting."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"In terms of technical filmmaking, ""1917"" is easily one of the most impressive War films that I have seen, and not only for the one track shot. The settings are gorgeously depicted from beginning to end, with the editing and music perfectly matched. I found the story to be deeply moving (I was nearly in tears at one point near the end of the movie), but like any historical drama , there will be plenty to critique, and like any war film, there will be divided opinions.But overall, I think ""1917"" deserves all the awards that it has already received, and I'm certain that this movie will get at least one Oscar, if not several, in a couple of weeks.9/10"
1917,10 March 2020,5/10,"The sets, scenery, and cinematography are all A+. I wasn't as big a fan of the direction as some.The first ten minutes were good. After that, I kept asking myself ""did Disney make a war film???"""
1917,15 September 2020,10/10,"Words cant even explain the feeling I had after watching this movie. First of all, the cinematography was beautiful. The one shot nature was breathtaking. I wanted to be sad after watching this movie, but I was more in awe than sad. It is definitely eye opening to watch what these soldiers had to go through during this time. We are lucky to not have to go through these situations. I couldn't even imagine having to run through an open field fearing that I could be shot any second. Great movie overall and should be watched."
1917,4 February 2020,,"This movie had me go through a roller-coaster of emotions like nothing else. There were scenes where I was tearing up, there were moments where I was so mesmerized by the sequences, esp. the one where Schofield wakes up and walks into the night illuminated by flares, that I forgot about what was to happen next. The use of scenery and elements of nature such as the fence which ends up hurting Will, the sequence in the stream are all used quite well so much so that they become a part of the narrative. The scene where Schofield walks into the night among the ruins, is definitely one of the best I've ever seen.In today's age and time where movies and shows are brought exclusively to your computers and TV, this remains one of those movies which need to be experienced in the cinema hall. Kudos to Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman for this show. One of my top war films along the likes of 'Come and See' and 'The Grand Illusion'."
1917,28 November 2020,4/10,"The characters DID wear the correct helmets and fire the correct carbines tho soon they began foregtting to chamber fresh rounds or insert fresh clips. military actions made NO sense. rivers were raging torrents, then placid ponds, the ground was soggy ponds, then the driest dust. there was no discernable chain of command, much less communication within it--the reason for the silly mission. there were no assigned runners to deliver a message, tho all units were filled with them--HITLER was a runner, forgoodness sake.this flik missed almost no cliches but failed to ask any questions about this horrible war or the slaughter of the working class after they were treated like dogs--any survivors were STILL treated like dogs.if you want a good movie about ww1, try paths of glory or all quiet on the western front"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Of the story isn't that good but with master piece Implementation
Still cant believe the direction and photography of movie it just amazing
The actors make a great job
Great soundtrack
As I say it just a masterpiece
I still wonder how to describe it right but I cant"
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"1917 is the best war movie I've seen in a while. The best thing about this movie is obviously the cinematography, the one shot take of the movie definitely adds to the mood of the movie. The lighting is amazing and this film is so damn gorgeous, such a feast to the eyes. The acting was brilliant. The production design and costume design was also on point.The problem I have with it though are the characters. The characters didn't develop as much through the movie. That made the movie less interesting for me.Overall, 1917 is a great movie with great cinematography, production design and acting. The technical aspects of the movie is definitely 100/10. The characters though feels abit flat. I'm gonna give 1917 a 9/10."
1917,19 January 2020,1/10,"Not a bad movie to see the amazing way in which it was filmed. The one continuous shot is a marvel to look at and the cinematography is great. But the camera-work ability does not make an amazing and engaging movie.I know that the director wanted to tell a more personal and slow, intimate story/journey of two average soldiers. But the movie had no impact. There was nothing emotional in the story and you don't get to feel any emotion towards the two soldiers. You don't get to see the brutality of war or a story thats going to affect you and stay with you long after watching the film.If you're making an intimate personal story about the first world war it needs to have an impact. This story was very bland and very slow/boring. This film is a solid 5/10, but certainly doesn't deserve the praise its receiving."
1917,1 March 2020,10/10,1917 is simply a modern day masterpiece. I was blown away by every single frame of the film and to think they have managed to create the illusion of the whole movie being 1 single shot is absolutely phenomenal which is why every award given is completely well deserved! I'm not even a fan of war/historic film or TV but I can't stress enough how brilliant 1917 is and why all of you should see it in the next week while it's still out in cinema's/theatre's!
1917,22 January 2020,7/10,"It felt like this film was trying too hard to be stylistic and artsy rather than involve the viewer emotionally. I really didn't care about the protagonist/s much because there was very little character development and a lot of potential opportunities were lost when they killed off Lance Corporal Blake. The movie was just basically about one man's survival from one scene to the next and the filmmakers weren't adept enough to create sympathy for the lone surviving protagonist in my opinion. It's difficult to develop a character that way but it can be done as with films like the Revenant, Castaway and Naked Prey. 1917 felt more like an excuse to show off cinematography and create set pieces rather than tell an interesting story. I'm giving this film a C+/B- because there were some good scenes and a lot of impressive work went into the historic recreation of battlefields"
1917,16 February 2020,9/10,"The long-shot cinematography weakens its plot and scenes. However, it is also the cinematography that creates this brilliant immersive environment. It's like the audience is the 3rd person walking with them."
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,I was blown away! How they filmed this movie is freaking STUNNING! This is litterly like a one shot film. It's just like one or two moments in the movie that you are seeing get clipped. AN AMAZING ART OF WORK SAM MENDES!
1917,31 May 2020,6/10,Saving Private Ryan for poors ...5 if not a tru story
1917,9 February 2020,5/10,"As visually stunning as this film is, the story lacks depth, emotion, and at times is plain stupid, for the story I would give 3, cinematics 9, so a 5 from me. I wouldn't watch it again, a very forgettable film, the first 50min was ok, the rest..... not so good."
1917,13 May 2020,8/10,"Long shots of this level can only be the product of this era. I think he has surpassed the traditional technique of so-called lens movement and scheduling, because from this perspective, it is impossible to realize this long lens. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have a feeling - the story after the only shot in that movie is cut off becomes a bit surreal. The sun-like flares, the Madonna-like girl in the basement, the river full of corpses, the nostalgic songs that soldiers listened to before going to battle, and the rushing ahead of the trench All of this was so dreamy that I wondered if the protagonist had actually died under the black shot."
1917,28 May 2020,9/10,"Because of the seriousness and seriousness of the subject matter, war films have been a major force in the awards season over the past few years. Amid all the noise and respect, the famous director Sam mendes is humble."
1917,31 May 2020,8/10,"Directors, take a lesson. Long shots are not for showing off. Most worthy of praise is the photographer."
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"The director's long shot scheduling is also a skill maniac for the audio-visual skills. The long shot with complex motion track is coordinated with the actors to complete the scheduling. This is the legendary audio-visual feast. The rhythm of the story is perfectly controlled, and the long shot scheduling of several plays is very shocking! Two awards of best director and best photography should be stable. In the early years, the shooting technology may not reach such difficulty. The best film should also be this movie."
1917,13 March 2020,6/10,I watch a lot of war movies. Im 48 & when i say a lot thats a lot. The movie is shot well with many iconic shots. Large open areas & tight tense as well. The movie isnt just meh because of lack of action its meh because i just felt bored most of the time. It felt like The Revenant at times only its a war movie. The movie events just seemed forced. Its ok to watch once. Ill likely never choose to watch this movie again.
1917,11 January 2020,2/10,"This is the kind of movie that can pick up momentum by the herd all buying into it without questioning the issues it has. View it with an open mind without thinking about the hype or awards nominations (or wins).This is what I did. And yes, the cinematography is definitely great, and the directing was impressive to choreograph everything in one take, but the thing that matters the most- the writing/story/character development- is not very good.Issues:1. Middle of WWI on the fields and the two main characters are as clean and tidy as a female pop singer about to take stage. There is no facial hair, no dirt, no masculinity to either of them. Very effeminate kind of characters.2. The mission is supposed to be important and imperative, so rather than send reinforcements and snipers to protect the two of them, they send these novices out on their own. It must not have been too important then according to that.3. Why not just save time since it is limited and fly a jet or plane to warn them?4. Since when do trained soldiers save an enemy pilot as if the enemy is a trustworthy ally? Whoops. A first grader would know to use caution when approaching or assisting an enemy. Draw your weapons first, and engage carefully. Don't try to save him like he's your brother.5. Was the prevailing actor the Predator? Why couldn't the enemy snipers hit him in wide open display when he repeatedly kept exposing himself in the open? Why did every bomb near-miss him? I really wanted an explanation for this and it would have helped me to believe it better. Like, is he the bionic man? Is he a superhero who can alter bullet and bomb trajectory with superpowers? If that was explained, it would have made it more believable.6. The Commander of a major WWI battle is so important that an unknown low-ranking soldier from another separate army can penetrate just by barging his way through hundreds of soldiers and the other captains give up his location like he is nothing.7. After a foot chase, just because he jumps in the river, the enemy gunfighter immediately gives up on him- not a shot fired in the water and no pursuit. Furthermore, the letter in his pocket is completely dry when he reaches land. Oh and for ""continuity, one take sakes"" he just happens to drift right up to the battalion he is looking for when he climbs ashore.8. The cinematography is very impressive, but like a few critics said, a) It feels like watching someone advance through stages of a video game and b) the director himself becomes the star of the movie as the viewers are more focused on ""how they can get through the obstacles of the continuity"" than they are ""the story itself"".9. How convenient and how manipulative. The story was lacking any heartstrings so they just had to add a young single mother with a baby who needs milk. As if the camerawork wasn't gimmicky enough, they put that cow in there and the farm to give the soldier milk for this scene's attempt at sentimentalism. Could they manipulate the audience anymore? I'm surprised they didn't kiss and have melodramatic music playing on top of that.Don't get caught up in the groupthink and echo chamber around this movie. Think for yourself.The emotional depth is lacking and when it is delivered, it feels unearned since there is no character development. Why am I supposed to care at all about these two video game characters who the writer/director has revealed nothing of substance about (at least until the end)?All in all, with that said, it's a good movie, but not a great one and certainly not deserving of any major awards. Frankly, I don't even think this should be nominated for anything except cinematography, and depending on the other contenders, maybe director. It is definitely no better than 7/10 movie.6/10"
1917,12 January 2020,2/10,"It's a ""good"" movie, but not a great one. It is not even a ""technical masterpiece"" like some are trying to claim, and it is about as far from a ""masterpiece"" as a movie can possibly be as a whole.Anyone calling this movie a masterpiece or one of the best war movies ever or any other malarkey like that is either flat out lying or they are teenagers or little kids who know nothing about the realities of war. The movie may appeal to them because it is shot like a ""video game"", which younger people are into.The only really truly ""great"" feature of this movie is the cinematography, and to be quite honest, the best camera work is seen in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie. Beyond that, even the outstanding camerawork begins to actually fall apart as the protagonist literally begins to ""run in circles"" around a city just so they can continue continuity on the one-take filming.It's a ""good"" movie, but do not go in thinking this is a masterpiece or anything great.Imo, it is one of the most overrated movies, if not THE most overrated and overhyped movie of the last five years. It's at least in the top 3-5 most overrated and overhyped. The camerawork/filming style though is definitely worth a watch."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"It is easy to give this a perfect score - a hugely enjoyable piece of theatre that I couldn't fault and which was made for watching on a big screen. It was an extraordinary piece of work and all credit to those involved in putting it together.
I thought the film got the balance between the narrative, action, drama and emotion just right.I will add a footnote on my frustration with trailers however which fortunately I didn't see for 1917. The trailer for this film apparently gives away some of the vital plot points which will spoil it - in fact I try hard to avoid any trailers of films I am interested in seeing. I know they tend to be put together by the marketeers rather than the directors which is a real shame when they reveal too much."
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"The first third of the movie was brilliant, had it stayed on that level the whole movie it would be perfect, It was tense, beautifully shot, and had just the right amount of emotion. However, somewhere in the second third, the movie succumbs to some traditional hollywood problems - our hero becomes almost invincible, some scenes overly sentimental, and there are some obvious plot holes. Mendes should've toned down this part and it would've been perfect. The last part is still a bit overly sentimental, but overall the movie ends on a high note. As i said it really is a great movie, but it has it's problems that took away a bit from the overall experience. The cinematography is gorgeous though, at some parts it almost makes the war seem a bit too beautiful."
1917,21 January 2021,10/10,"Realistically true to life action.
Watched the movie, and wanted to watch it again straight away."
1917,8 February 2020,9/10,Thing about war movies is that there is no need for conversation to happen. Not everything must be explained in words. And 1917 did a good job on showing how war did happen and how it affected person.
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,The cinematography makes you feel like you are in the trenches with the actors. It is a moment to moment edge of your seat movie with suspense and action. This is 100% worth the theater experience.
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,"I don't see anything in this movie special, with 5 German soldiers in all movie and without any action?? Oscar for what?"
1917,19 July 2020,9/10,"The film itself is a great film, there's not too much dialogue but as the film has been attempted to be filmed in one cut, the long open wide angles allow the audience to take a lot of information in at one point. So you need to be fully invested in the film to take all the information in and the film gives you a lot of scenes for you to be involved in.The minimal amount of dialogue is similar to Dunkirk as you can tell more by the actors faces due to the emotions etc. The small amount of dialogue also gives you a greater perspective of what the First World War was like and for this sort of film, that is key! The one cut technique is a wonderful idea especially as it's on a film with a journey as you start to feel the strain that it is taking on Schofield making the journey and the danger that is at stake if he doesn't make the journey. It genuinely feels like you are along for the journey! Some action films don't give you this a plot that has so much at stake where you are rooting for the main character so much, each fight or gunfight you feel the pressure that is on and you want and need Schofield to survive to get the message to the battalion on the front line.Despite the use of 2 almost unknown actors being used in the 2 key roles of the film, the casting is flawless. The use of bigger, more well known actors being dotted about the film makes the whole experience better and I can't wait to see what George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, you can see that they learnt a lot from this experience and with actors like Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch."
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,"I knew this movie would be good and I had always been wanting to see it. From the beginning I loved the directing and camera work from the film, obviously Sam Mendez did a great job and I could tell from the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was shot without a transition or a cut scene between lines and characters, and it was shot without the use of a walking cameraman. The ability of being able to direct in this way and to focus zooming in or out on a character and viewing the troubles of WWI without a cut scene watching the two main characters walk through the trenches or travel through no mans land gives the audience a view of what WWI was like and they did a great job of representing it. Not that I know about WWI, but because they directed the movie in that way, it gives a great representation of the battles and struggles of war and the hardships that our main characters went through. Directing, Writing, Camerawork were all incredible in this film, that's what made it so special, but I still feel that there is something missing from it, something that I wish they included a bit more character growth and connection with the audience. However, it is still a great film and revolutionizing for film making."
1917,18 June 2021,9/10,"A unique experience that you must watch and enjoy visually, good acting, great Thomas Newman music, some great scenes, non-stop camera movement, it was great, great movie, I wanted more and more of it, it stirred a lot of emotions."
1917,17 February 2020,10/10,"I'm not normally a fan of war films (in fact, there are only 3 war films that I really like) but after seeing this incredible World War I film 1917, there are now 4 war films that I like, this one being one of them!Not only is the movie shot and made to look like one continuous long shot, but the entire film takes place in real time (with the exception of when a character is knocked unconscious for a few hours), and it's an on the edge of your seat roller coaster ride from the time the title screen comes on at the beginning to the time when the credits roll. And instead of being an observer of the events like in most films, the way this one is filmed, you are actually amongst the filth of the trenches and dodging enemy bullets and grenades all along the way right with the two main characters.While many may watch this film and just see an ultra realistic, and sometimes horrific story of war, it's not a movie that glorifies it. The characters lean on each other, sometimes both literally and figuratively, and their friendship and brotherhood really shine through, and there are moments that will bring you to tears, both in sadness and in moments of happiness.I now see why this movie has gotten so much attention this awards season. It truly is a riveting, exciting, tense, and heart stopping thrill ride. Prepare to be wowed, and strap yourselves in for a wild ride!"
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"Firstly, in my opinion this is an astonishing accomplishment & worthy of note in cinematic history. The camera work is astounding, the editing was incredible & the cinematography stunning... The entire department should be immensely proud of what they have put together! One seemingly continuous shot put together in a similar fashion to Children of Men, but done in a way that the camera always feels controlled & has a more artistic handle on the shot at hand at any given moment. This has to be acknowledged as nothing short of incredible.I don't condone war & do not adhere to the propaganda of war either, but some of the greatest films ever made have been based on events that without war, could never have existed & that would be a shame... The story here is quite eventful & most couldn't even begin to imagine the sheer horror of being tasked with such a journey through enemy territory, filled with skirmishes & dangers above & around you, never mind just the idea of being there. This film manages to put you right in the thick of how manic, eerie & horrific everything could be & does it superbly.Definately in my top war epic list, up there with Apocolypse Now, Platoon & Full Metal Jacket etc. It's not the same kind of war film but worthy of the list.9/10 - 1917 is the best I've seen in years."
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"When something grips you from beginning to end and you feel not the time passing, like you are in a sort of time warp, that is when you know you are witnessing a masterpiece. Blown away."
1917,9 March 2020,5/10,"I was looking forward to this after all the rave reviews, but aside from the technical achievements with the whole single shot thing, it's just a boring movie. It ya a paper thing story and not much happens. I mean, sure there's some interesting shots and some good scenes, but it's just so bland. I don't get the hype 🤷‍♂️"
1917,19 February 2020,6/10,"I enjoyed the movie but it just wasn't very exciting. The one take idea was the only reason it got awards. Worth watching, but I don't think it was anything special."
1917,15 March 2020,5/10,"This could've been more interesting if it was the first war movie I've seen. But as it stands now, it's just yet another war, drama movie. Well shot, well acted, well produced... but it offers nothing new or fresh. Same good allied soldiers, bad Germans, sad war drama, heroic deeds. If you've seen one of these movies, you've seen them all."
1917,11 April 2020,9/10,This was only one shot? That is so unique. kinda reminds me of Hardcore Henry...wait
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"Despite being an year stacked with amazing movies, none of them managed to touch me as emotionally as this movie did. Directed magnificently by Sam Mendes, 1917 engrosses you and keeps you at the edge of your seats from the very beginning as the tense atmosphere and a constant sense of danger are maintained throughout the movie. The characters are not portrayed as invincible heroes but as regular young men who are trapped in this situation, fighting a pointless war. The character development for the two main leads was done subtly but very effectively, with limited exposition. The performances by George Mackay and Dean Charles Chapman were top-notch and makes us really empathize with their characters. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was nothing short of breathtaking. The one-shot technique makes the experience much more immersive as we feel as if we are present there along with the characters. The score by Thomas Newman was phenomenal and helped to elevate the impact of several scenes. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie was its incredible production design, particularly the battlefield and the abandoned town, which showcases some of the most impressive set constructions of the year. The sound design was outstanding and further helped to convey the intensity of the situation.The focus is less on the battle and more on the suffering, destruction and loss caused by war. The soldiers in the movie themselves comment on the pointless and destructive nature of war. The incredible screenplay, direction and performances manage to present this theme in an emotionally impactful manner"
1917,18 February 2020,5/10,This film is beautifully shot. Unfortunately there are so many plot holes it's hard to keep watching with a straight face.
1917,24 May 2020,8/10,"The actors' faces are long, the moats are long, the shots are long, but they are all shown so well by the director."
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"The effect of the film is really shocking and good-looking. There are not only modern props set technology to reproduce the great nihility of the battlefield, but also a sense of individual despair brought by the mirror. In the night, the hero escapes to the extreme. But it's really that there are not enough British actors. They are familiar with each other when they come out, and they are a little bit of a dancer."
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"It's not appropriate for such a cruel film to say that it makes people feel beautiful, but there are several scenes that really make people forget the environment, cherry blossom falling, singing in the forest, running across the charge line, and the last swaying of the grass sea. These are the beauty itself without the background."
1917,25 August 2020,8/10,The camera shots on this film were amazing! Long continuous shots with no camera changing. Perfectly well done! The story line however lacked just a bit. It was too much walking around and not enough war scenes. Deaths that could have been avoided and most likely were in real life. I believe it was based off a true story or true events but did shy away from the truth alittle bit. Overall great film about world war.
1917,14 September 2020,7/10,"I liked this movie, but I can't surely say it was perfect. The camera movement took all my attention, and everything I was living while watching the movie suddenly dissolved with the black screen."
1917,3 January 2021,8/10,"I have always been a fan of ""one-take"" scenes ever since I watched the opening scene of The Reverent, so I was really looking for an entire move done in ""one-take"". It starts off slow & methodically and eventually builds in tension & action until the climax near the end of the film. I wasn't overly impressed with the acting, but the film does a good job of showing the horrors of trench warfare; and I must admit that some scenes were a bit over-the-top, although I guess it was based on a true story. The opening of The Reverent is still far superior for this kind of film style, but 1917 is definitely worth the watch."
1917,18 February 2020,6/10,"Cinematography, setting, were absolutely great. Acting great. The feeling that 'you were there' --great. And it draws you in. Only one scene seems unnecessary--gratuitous (the scene with the mother and child), but like so many others pointed out, PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES, turning this into what I generally hates about American movies--outrunning bullets and implausible situations.
Would LOVE for someone to legitimately explain:
1. The two start out over open country with the distinct possibility of being picked off, yet start with bayonets fixed, though crawling past/over barbed wire WITH bayonets. Later, when in the burned out town with German infestation at close range, no bayonet, just when needed. Also,
2 The soldier runs off without his rifle. To me, this is inexplicable: hostile territory, behind enemy lines, and he's going to outrun bullets and enemy soldiers, dodging this way and that (as he did in the trench, astonishingly).
Thanks.
The close-range shooting by the injured German sniper also bothered me--just a flesh wound, eh.
The French mother holed up with her child in a nasty burned out town infested with Germans...strange but not a plot issue.
Certainly strong points to the movie, but coming off as cartoonish in plot action. Still, the action is compelling. Sometimes found the accents hard to understand, particularly when talking as 'asides' or muttering to one another.
I don't understand the need for some to try to wish this into a true story. It was never pitched as true, and doesn't need to be. Other war moves (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, Hamburger Hill) do a great job of communicating the horrors of war. Some '10'-raters seem to treat this as a genre-setting standard, which I don't see."
1917,28 November 2021,10/10,"This is the best war movie I have ever seen after Dunkirk, from the beginning to the end movie was uncut no scene perfectly directed my favorite part was the small details and backstories of the character, still, I wonder how could they make a movie like thisThe movie was made in such a way that the whole movie was a big long shot, I have never seen a movie like this in my lifetime there isn't a part where it is boring or slow and most important thing is a true war story."
1917,3 January 2020,6/10,"I have a special fondness for movies that set technical limitations and still achieve full bodied, engrossing story telling. For example, Stephen Knight's Locke is one man, in a car, by himself - and it's riveting. Die Hard takes place (mostly) in a single blinding. 1917 sets a limitation for itself by presenting the movie as a single continuous shot. (It's really at least three, but that's beside the point.)The rationale is that this would immerse the viewer in the experience of the war. And despite Deakins skill in pulling off the achievement, I think it does the opposite. It's awkward at times, distracting, and gives up the foundational language of film: the power of editing. Some thoughts:Cutting focuses our attention, shifts our point of view, can put us both inside and outside the experience of the characters.The long shots of the characters walking toward the camera in the trenches are off putting. They are completely unlike the way we experience reality - how often do we hold a steady gaze on a single point while walking in real life? It's meant to be subjective and immersive, but it's the opposite.Things get better outside of the trench when the camera has more movement, but get worse in the ruined village, a sequence that looks more like a video game with new pursuers appearing in the channel behind him.The monotony of the single tales had me looking around the frame for the bodies in the mud, pressed in the trench walls, etc. - impressive art direction, but distracting, pulling me out of the story.The bodies sticking out of the mud were supposed to be horrifying, but they struck me as antiseptic. And one reminded me of Davy Jones ship in the second Pirates movie, which made me laugh inappropriately.The real problem is that we have scene this movie before. The plot is the same as Saving Private Ryan, or even Thin Red Line or the Naked and the Dead, which were also built around a single mission. I think Mendes tried to overcome a familiar story with the single take idea. I also think that he can't resist sentimentalizing the story and reaching for unearned emotion.The flaws of the movie are seen in the far to brief appearance of Mark Strong, who is strong, grounded, real, everything the rest of the movie is not. A more cinematic approach, and a story more grounded in human experience, and built out of characterizations like Strong's, would have been much more interesting.As it is, 1917 is a mildly interesting experiment with a conventional story at its center."
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"I don't know maybe I have evolved or rather became disillusioned with my patriotic aspirations. I blame the internet, as it showed me that the enemy is within.The movie is well shot and the music is haunting, the first half of the film is expository with few words in between, truly mesmerising. I would also add that I can't imagine anyone in the role of Schofield other than George MacKay.But the plot, the script in general, and the ending felt like I was watching a cheap conservative hallmark channel drama on an extremely generous budget.The cameos meant nothing to me, oh look there's Colin Firth - we will never see him again, oh look there's Benedict Cumberbatch and his scar as you were, then that other guy in the end. Good acting overall but too scripted!Should you watch it? If anything it is only worth your while on a big screen, actually the movie has a surprising amount of jump scares ha! There's one moment in the film where I guarantee you will make you jump. So yea go watch but don't expect The Thin Red Line."
1917,15 February 2020,5/10,"No idea how this movie is rated an 8.5 average, and got nominated for Best Original Screenplay is beyond me. I won't give direct spoilers, but nonetheless the below gives hints of what the movie is about.First of all, from my perspective, they took what was Saving Private Ryan and essentially reversed it. Nothing very new in the plot here as far as I was concerned.Secondly, the movie was way too predictable in multiple places. I am normally absorbed by movies, but in this one I found myself saying to myself throughout the movie ""it is likely that this will happen or that will happen.""Everything about it seemed quite contrived.All that said, the acting was good, the cinematography, etc. was good. As well, it was an enjoyable movie. But, I'd rate it a 5 or a 6; I easily could have spent my Valentine's date with the wife doing something more enjoyable."
1917,25 March 2020,3/10,I have no idea why this movie won oscars and it definitely don't deserve 8.7/10 . Don't watch it. It's a waste of time !
1917,19 February 2020,9/10,"This was a great cinematographic epic film that followed two British soldiers to deliver a vital message to an otherwise doomed, isolated regiment. The premise of the plot was to hand deliver a letter from the commanding general to warn the regiment to cancel the dawn advance against a heavily fortified german defense. The result of the advance would most certainly be a massacre of 1,600 British soldiers.
Mendes used a continuous and seamless filming technique using boom and hand held cameras to intimately follow the two soldier-messengers through no mans land and into a hellish landscape of destroyed farmhouses and towns. The filming technique brought the war into the theater. There was an eerie silence in the large audience. This was a gut-wrenching history lesson for many and a cinematic achievement of great mastery. Overall, a brutal, but beautiful film."
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"Some amazing cinematography that almost seemlessly blends into one shot.
George McKay is great as is Dean-Charles Chapman but for me, it was the supporting cast that made the most of their moments. In particular Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Adrian Scarborough and Mark Strong"
1917,20 January 2020,3/10,"The sets,costumes,production in general are excellent.The story, imo,boring.Acting nothing special.I can't actually tell you what happend in the end as I don't remember...That's how underwhelming it was."
1917,19 April 2021,9/10,What a engaging movie from start to finish. A very real depictions of war with hardly any warfare scenes the most impact moment wasn't even on the Frontline and the directing was phenomenal all the way through. I didn't know what to expect going into this movie and was just such a thrill ride with Greta emotion thrown in. Stellar war movie not perfect as some realism is thrown out the window but still keeps you in the realm of war without straying off the path.
1917,26 April 2020,7/10,"This is no Saving Private Ryan, but the story was good. The filmography was excellent.
There are a few flaws though like how the main character blabs to almost everyone he meets the details of his mission though he should have known the consequences if that information was leaked to the enemy. Also, the German snipers and soldiers were such terrible shots they never hit their target, the main character."
1917,26 January 2020,7/10,"Alongside Apocalypse Now and Dunkirk, this is a very visually stunning war film, but much better than the latter of those two. Probably my third favourite film in the genre (behind Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter).There's not much I can fault this film on, other than a few small nitpicks about occasional conveniences that just so happen to pan out for the main character and some of the people he encounters. While it never crossed over into propaganda territory, I do think the German soldiers were excessively written as savages. It could have been to the movie's benefit to have at least one scene that humanizes BOTH sides of the war.The film can also drag in some scenes, with lots of lingering shots that look fantastic but could be a nuisance on repeat viewings. And that's just it. The best element of the film is that the whole thing is practically one long lingering shot, and this can also, intermittently, be seen as its weakness. But this is all just nitpicking.
While I might have spent a lot of time writing about the negatives, this shouldn't take away from the fact that if you've ever enjoyed a war movie, then this is a must-see.It's very immersive, largely due to the cinematography, but even the conversations that characters have in the more mellow moments feel quite realistic. While the plot isn't particularly a point of interest, you do grow to care about some of the characters. 2014's Birdman did a similar thing with the ""one-shot"" aesthetic, and while I enjoyed the characters and themes of that film more than 1917, it's 1917 that I think has a more justified and immersive usage of the style.7/10."
1917,18 March 2020,9/10,Sam Mendes' convincing directing with the amazing cinemtogrophy of this film alone is great enough for a repeated watch.
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"The first film I've seen in cinemas this year/decade, and what a way to start. Whilst the story is fine and decent, but not much more, the rest of the film is outstanding. Obviously, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is the highlight, especially at nighttime, where the town of Ecoust being lit by fire and flares being amazing. Definitely a contender for best cinematography (even though The Lighthouse will give it some good competition). As for the 'one continuous long shot', I knew there were bits where they cut, but there wasn't anything glaringly obvious. But it doesn't matter too much, the camera work is phenomenal.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman give extremely committed and natural performances, and they act incredibly given how the film is being shot and the fact they're in World War 1. The musical score was good enough, if not excellent, and I love some of the small moments of the two soldiers trying to relieve stress and pressure by just joking around.This is a film everyone should see. Yes, over 70% of the film is people walking or running, with bits of tense yet well-crafted action placed in between, but that doesn't stop this film being excellent. A strong contender for Best Picture, bolstered by natural performances, great direction, realism, and of course, outstanding cinematography. See it. You won't regret it."
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"When you think you have seen everything about war movies comes this masterpiece.
Oh my God!
Camera direction is outstanding, acting, direction, etc.... Simply Perfection."
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"This is just your run of the mill war movie. I've seen many like this but this one is hyped (I'm somehow trying to quote a great war movie here, Full Metal Jacket).This is just so average plot wise and it's very slow paced. It was realistic and cinematography is excellent. The characters were in many ways well executed. SFX were really good and costumes and atmosphere was very cool.I liked the movie and thought it was very good but I just don't get the hype. Why did this movie win the Golden Globe over the Joker is just something I find hard to belief because I have found the awards credible so far.The plot is quite shallow and the movie is forgettable. It's similar to Saving Private Ryan in many ways but just not as good. This movie is easy to watch and does not demand anything from the audience. 10 year old can enjoy it just as much as hardened combat veteran so maybe the very broad appeal of the movie is the reason for why it's so hyped.Go see it I recommend the movie. Don't expect to much and just enjoy on face value as yet just another cool but forgettable war movie."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"This is a masterpiece,brilliantly directed,well acted,an amazing story,sometimes funny,emotional and at the end brought tears in my eyes."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"I am not a fan of war movies, but this one was exceptional.That was due completely to the camerawork. With a bunch of cutaways it would have been just another war movie.The way the camera followed these men throughout the whole movie was simply amazing and added to the emotion of this movie.Here's hoping this guy gets the Oscar for director. All the rest were typical directorial fare. This one hit it out of the park."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Brilliantly filmed, well worth a watch for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of blood and guts."
1917,12 May 2020,9/10,"I dont relate to any events accuring in this movie but it made me feel something for the soldiers in a way i never experienced before. Forget about the perfect atmosphere, music score, acting and directing .. i am a man but this movie made me cry in the end and i was moved in every scene the lead characters were involved, other movies tend to make the soldiers like a rambo attitude kind if way but this one felt so real. i highly recommend this movie for anyone literally to see a part of history unfold to his eyes .. sry for my english"
1917,13 January 2020,5/10,"...but talk about the Emperor's New Clothes.
It was on the same level as the recent Dunkirk; looked good but absolutely style over substance. It was WW1 for the videogame generation but without the gore.
Episodic; empty landscapes; implausible behaviour and actions from all involved.
Plus if you want me to be nitpicky... church bells ringing the hour in a destroyed and inferno town; too many occasional black faces (sorry guys but even in WW2 it didn't happen like that); too many fat soldiers (Daniel Mays, anyone); too many Star Wars Stormtroopers dressed up as Germans (oh wait, perhaps it was their ancestors, errmm descendants) and the Cruel and Evil Hun Pilot! (see Flyboys). Plus a plotline that dragged out Mel Gibson's one and only great performance - in Gallipoli - into a two-hour plod. And what was Mark Strong's warning 'make sure you get witnesses' about. It had absolutely no bearing on the film whatsoever.
Unlike Saving Private Ryan or the original Dunkirk, or even Gallipoli, I won't be watching this again. Wish we'd have gone to see Jojo Rabbit instead."
1917,11 May 2020,6/10,There is nothing much in the movie just shown sergent delivering the message with much of difficulties
1917,28 March 2020,2/10,A pathetic anglo-saxon propaganda schtick with giant plot holes on every possible occasion. Ridiculous. Dream on.
1917,4 February 2020,7/10,"1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.Watching this movie, it is simply an experience. The mind blowing cinematography, the chilling atmospheric music and the bleak sets really transport you to the Western Front, the 6th of April, 1917. You're there, in those trenches.1917 absorbed me, like few movies had ever done before. I was hooked, and I think I only took my eyes off the screen about three times. I am not even the greatest fan of war movies (the big exception being Apocalypse Now), but 1917 is just so bloody good. If you are however, just drop everything you are doing, get a ticket, and watch this movie. You will love it.8/10"
1917,2 July 2020,9/10,"From the first cinematic trailer 1917 had me hooked. I've never before seen a movie shot like this, and it was a thrilling experience.The level of tension as scene after scene continued without a cut, the camera spinning or fixing in place at unpredictable intervals. Great sound design, compelling story and characters-and the one shot cinematography is epic.The youth of the soldiers, horror of trench warfare and the pure mental, emotional and physical exhaustion extracted by a state of perpetual combat combined for an evocative experience that was simply overwhelming.Kudos to the crew and cast, definitely worth the oscars!"
1917,6 February 2020,9/10,"There are two things about this film that I am typically not a fan of: movies set in the past and movies where the story line is a mission and not an arc. However, after being mesmerized for the full two hours of this film, I can truly say I couldn't care less. The cinematography, production design and direction were all pieces of art that will without a doubt rain in Oscars. Sam Mendes (director/writer) and Roger Deakin (cinematography) are geniuses that have produced something that has absolutely never been seen before."
1917,11 April 2020,8/10,Just a good story can make anything if it found by a good director. You don't need biggest Star.
1917,14 January 2020,4/10,"I take no pleasure in stating 1917 is a huge wasted opportunity. The selling point for Sam Mendes' (director of American Beauty & Skyfall) new film is that it's a war film shot to look like one continuous take. Bold move for a genre of cinema that requires loads of characters, huge action set pieces and usually many locations. So how can this be pulled off effectively? Well , in this case not very well it seems.The trouble with 1917 is it all feels too clean and staged. I understand that they were trying to go for one continuous visceral experience with two troopers tasked with crossing enemy territory to send a message of stopping an assault from British forces entering a German enemy trap (A race against time literally) but it never felt tense when everything felt set-up. And this is all due to the premise of the film. Why sacrifice tension and dread of troopers in the trenches for some silly gimmick that is going to limit authenticity? Single take shots are the cool kid on the block for sure. A film that carries one in their film is immediately looked upon favourly because yes, they can be quite impressive. See films like Children of Men, Rope, Season one of True Detective, Boogie Nights or Atonement for such good examples. However, you have to know where to use it. It can be a miraculous style of getting across tension or nearing dread or a character's journey in a moment. However, it has limitations which makes making a film purely running on this shot troublesome. So many times did they have resort to cheap blackouts or tricks to continue the single take over a couple of days in a 2 hour film. Kind of hard to produce entertainment when you are literally trying to produce the slowness of time and get to different locations and have different looks in your scene (the burning church scene was clearly done to turn the audience away from the same cloudy skies and muddy fields).I can say with great confidence that only two moments in this film benefited from the single take
approach (The start of the town scene with the sniper and the intense run to find the Colonel in the trenches). For that, I tip my hat to Roger Deakins and everyone involved in those scenes. Everything else however, felt so staged and empty. Almost like looking at a war memorial set piece at a museum. Case in point, there is a scene early on where the troops sent on the mission are going through their trenches to exit unto enemy territory where there's obviously a take going around showing the fear and falling morale of the battalion. A moment should invoke this incoming dread and fear of death. Instead, it all looks glossy and the camera never really smartly focuses on any of the troopers faces. It just sort of hovers overhead, enough to be in the trenches but far away fron the troops to cut off real intimacy Imagine doing a shot like in the classic WW1 movie Paths of Glory where the camera goes slowly down the trenches as all the soldiers look on and you just hear the sound of explosions as the music. Which is another thing 1917 buggers up on.Scenes can work without music. They don't continuously have to spell out incoming dread. It just seemed like a really lazy way of saying oh jeez this scene is intense. Oh look at me. It's all in one take and oh the fear in these soldiers and of time running out is palpable. Be more adventurous with your music choices and use. So many sequences could've carried across dread more if all we heard was soldiers trudging feet in the mud or explosions going off. Just another amateur move.If you can tell, I found 1917 to be a massive disappointment. Not that's it's intentions were not bold or interesting, but it just didn't work. If you are selling your film on a specific style, then use it well. Use it so it actually provides tension and dread. It was not here. Look, it's a war that needs to be remembered and my hate for this film does not discount the hard work and sacrifice these men had on the battlefield. They are heroes and not the worst film will take that away. Its just a shame that such a film couldn't have been done better with just a normal, more focussed approach instead of falling for a stylistic trick."
1917,3 August 2020,9/10,"A well filmed thrill ride of action and emotion that makes the viewer feel as if they are really experiencing the events that occur. The film was great because of its visual effects and Cinematography what makes the movie visual striking. A masterpiece that I'll never forget due to its effort of differentiate from many other war movies, giving to us the perspective of a messenger."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"The best way to describe 1917 is a incredibly tense roller-coaster. Loved the main stars George Mackay & Dean-Charles Chapman were terrific throughout; they bought the passion and energy needed to make this a great movie. 1917 is extremely entertaining, you can't blink at all watching this film. The plot was put together perfectly, I had no idea that this movie was based on a true story. 1917 wants all the smoke in 2020, it lives up to all the hype despite being officially released in the U.S in 2020. Overall 1917 is the leader in best moves thus far for 2020."
1917,2 February 2020,,1917 is the BEST war movie ever! Great job by the cast as well as great directing by Sam Mendes. I can see why this movie is nominated for 10 Oscars. I hope it sweeps the Oscars as it very well deserves to. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"If you are a war movie fan, this movie is an excellent addition to the genre with great production design, acting and realism. I truly enjoyed the environment it created by its visuals and soundtrack. If you like productions like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers or Dunkirk, then you will be in for a treat. It is a type of movie you need to watch in the cinemas to really appreciate what it has to offer.The primary goal for the main characters is a pretty straight forward war mission, but the true storytelling evolves around the journey to accomplish it. The realistic practical sets and CGI effects really worked well. The cinematography gave the audience a seemingly tour of environment of a typical war field as it pans strategically to bring attention to various moments and moods.The continuous shot effect was quite a novelty and was probably a very huge technical feat and tedious to produce, especially to transitioning to various quality framing shots. I personally think making the movie this way as a constant theme was distracting as I start to try to spot the ""breaks"" and the continuous single shot motion made me feel lethargic. As a person who have seen and played a few 1st person and 3rd person shooter games, the novelty wore off pretty quickly. I would probably have still enjoyed this movie without it.This movie is more of an experience and journey, rather than of an in depth storytelling of war strategy with intelligent scripts, so this movie is more of a ride than a lecture.If you are not a war movie fan, it may get boring for you after awhile if you get over the great visual and sound effects quickly."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"I always enjoy a good war movie & 1917 delivered! It was intense. It served the human factor & emotion well. Great acting, costumes & sets."
1917,22 March 2020,9/10,Awesome movie portraying the true brutality of ww1. Must watch!!!!
1917,16 January 2020,5/10,"When that's the teaser for a new movie you just can't help but get pulled in...to what turned out to be, in the end, a bit of a disappointment.
I deliberately didn't read any reviews in advance of the screening I saw, but by the end if it I was left feeling that this was a mediocre piece of filmmaking that could have been much better...the story was unconvincing (surely they'd have sent at least two teams with that message), ditto the acting and I wasn't wowed by the cinematography. Sometimes long shots are useful in showing scale, and WW1 was horrific in terms of the sheer numbers of men needlessly sent to their deaths. There just wasn't a sense of any of that....
For me, Saving Private Ryan (sorry!) was able to convey the horror of war while telling an interesting story that had you hooked from the start and still had me thinking about it days afterwards. . For me, 1917 was forgettable."
1917,22 March 2020,8/10,Awakening from the field is filled with small yellow flowers on the grassland to slowly sit down finally can breathe a sigh of relief cows gradually smaller houses there forever friends under the river drift to cherry blossoms night fire abandoned town only from gunfire and silhouette feel crow on the enemy even body is the first time feel so poetic description of delicate and very grand
1917,22 May 2020,6/10,"It should be said that the long shot saved the film with little plot. Although the whole process marveled at the superb technology, but emotion, human design, theme, conflict are all empty, see the end only feel the technology and the play put the cart before the horse."
1917,8 July 2020,10/10,"Yes it is a cinematographic masterpiece. And brilliant storytelling. Touching acting. All the praises are well deserved.
I agree with them and would also like to add that this film achieves a very difficult thing to achieve: it takes you to the 1st world war and force you to understand the true horrors of it without being didactic about it.
--spoilers sort of--
It is a true eye opener. I have never imagined anything like this in my 40 year life while watching a war movie. 1917 shows that the real horror of it was not the body parts, imminent death or the terror . They are very real and horrible of course but no other film managed to shook me with the meaninglessness of the whole concept of war and the madness of nations to put all that effort (digging that trenches !!) to efficiently exterminate each other's most precious assets, meaning their children, to the point that it is their own children and their own future that they waste abundantly at the end. They tell in the movies people go to war to protect loved ones but it is a lie. The loved ones were dying horrible deaths in this movie .
I see now that the heroes exist but they should not need to be and the lives that might have saved by their heroic acts were maybe lost the next day anyway. No other film to my knowledge plainly put it this way before .
It made me cry to think that we repeated the whole thing again in WW2 and to a lesser extent in all conflicts and smaller scale wars in the world since then. When will we ever learn?I thank the director for making this film with all my heart."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"This is the movie all previous and following war movies will be judged by. Painfully gritty heartwarmingy soft at times to next kick you in the vulnerables.
Cinematic masterpiece. Absolutely will not let you go."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,Please give the authors all the money so we can watch more movies like this. This is the perfect example of a great movie. Totally recommend to watch this!
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,"A lot of reviewers are comparing it to Saving Private Ryan. It is not that, nor was it intended to be that.All I can say is that having visited the sites of the battle, and walked through acres of white headstones, the movie affected me more than just a bang-bang shoot them up war movie. The shell craters are still there, sheep graze rather than mowers as there are still buried shells, they still turn up grisly reminders when they til the fields.Visit, then watch it again and I guarantee you will not have the same opinion."
1917,23 February 2020,10/10,"The movie is non-stop thriller with actions and drama combined together. The camera, angles, music and most importantly the lighting at night was so stunning."
1917,13 February 2020,5/10,"This film, much-hyped and ballyhooed, richly deserves the technical Oscars it received; the cinematography is truly, starkly beautiful, and the ""one shot"" approach to its filming is interesting, if gimmicky. Its biggest flaw, however, is its failure to engage and move the viewer on an emotional level.One is painfully conscious of an ironically heavy-handed effort at understatement, and this effort succeeds too well, to the point of outright blandness. The acting is quite wooden-you can almost hear the directorial instruction, ""more starch in the upper lips gentlemen; remember, this is the British army!"" This flatness persists throughout the film, preparing the viewer for a payoff that never comes. When there is a scene that is meant to be emotionally powerful, it feels forced and insincere.This movie borrows heavily from ""Paths of Glory"", from the long shot through the trenches to the wispy, meant-to-be affecting song just before the attack, both of which were far better done in the former movie.In short, like too many movies coming out of Hollywood today, heavy reliance on the technical aspects of moviemaking while eschewing the transcendent has resulted in the production of ""a beautiful corpse""."
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"After all these years superhero movies watch experience, I almost forget what true cinematography look like. I really enjoy this entre one shot movie, I love two main characters going through entire trenches scene, make everyone in the theather feel the terror of war. And the fire house scene probably the best scene I have seen in my life. Really appreacite everyone who make this masterpeice."
1917,1 February 2020,1/10,"This is quite possibly, no wait, this is the worst ever depiction on film of World War 1 and thus does a great disservice to the memories of those men who lost their lives in the Great War. So totally unrealistic, terrible cringe worthy acting and desperately trying to be PC it made me sad to have wasted two hours watching it."
1917,20 March 2021,10/10,"Watch it in IMAX
Every breath they take is your breath.
You take the journey with them one step at a time.The fact that's it's in one shot allows you to experience every moment with these characters. You see what they have seen for the next 2 hours. There are no cut scenes for them to have a moment to recollect themselves. You feel their rush l..you feel their stolen time."
1917,4 May 2020,10/10,This is in my opinion the best film on WW1. The film centres on two young men who are tasked to deliver a message to another Battalion on the Western Front and the two friends hike through the mud and craters littered with bodies and debris but one of the men gets killed causing the other to travel alone.The film was rich in detail about the war and it gives you a rough idea in your mind's eye about what life was like in the trenches. I found the film very frightening in bits especially seeing the bodies and the tense action in the war.But Sam Mendes did a great job bringing The Great War to life.
1917,26 December 2020,6/10,"Cinematography is a 10 but story is a 2. While visually stunning it's doesn't overcome the ""Hollywood"" plot."
1917,9 February 2020,5/10,"It brings you straight in the world of the trenches of the Great War. What beautiful cinematography. it deserves an oscar for that. The story is bleak and very far fetched from reality. A plane (they were rarely used back then) just happend to crash right in front of them, they passed by a tank which was also not very common then."
1917,27 March 2020,9/10,"Oh man if you know ""one shot"" please watch the movie and enjoy it then argue over the ""one shot"" point."
1917,14 September 2021,7/10,"Style over substance rules again. This could have been a great movie if it had a script. Imagine if they had written a script with characters as opposed to just having actors.Hitchcock tried the all one take look in his movie Rope. Yep, this
Movie has a certain style but style doesn't make for a great movie.unfortunately the movie has no real redeeming features apart from its one take gimmick. Such a pity."
1917,23 February 2020,9/10,"Uau.
This movie impressed me by the emotion it brought without needing the Hollywood drama or exaggeration.
It's impressive how a small story with such a simple storyline has made me so attached with the plot and the characters.1917 is about war times, but without the need for a intense hero which will bring peace to a continent in war. It can even show you that enemy is strong and more ballistic advance than the hero-country.The only only thing I found a bit ""exaggerated"" and perhaps a bit biased is how the main character is somewhat naïve and hero-behaved, while the Germans are designed as all bad.Yet, this movie is a great movie, with a simple storyline but completely worth watching."
1917,11 March 2020,6/10,"I just didn't get it. It's hard to see where the 100 million budget went to. I expected so much more than this film delivered. Lack of story, character building and action becomes painfully obvious when the credits roll on, that was it!?"
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"At the start of the movie I felt the reality of the trenches was captured pretty well and the Saving Private Ryan type storyline was initially gripping to watch.From about the halfway mark the film went rapidly from realistic, to extremely unbelievable plus the scenarios and sets from that point forward looked like something from a stage show instead of a movie.Unfortunately the storyline faltered around this point and never recovered.I also felt that realism was sacrificed to ensure a diverse sprinkling of ethnic minorities were visible in the background and the fact that even local regiments seemed to have many regional accents all in together from Scots to Sikhs cheapened the realism.I get the directors reasons for doing so but I ended up finding myself looking for forced diversity when the plot went downhill, instead of focusing on enjoying the movie."
1917,16 October 2020,1/10,"Words cannot describe just how dull and dumb this movie is. The actors are unlike label, the story basically nonexistent, emotional attachment is missing. Utter rubbish"
1917,4 October 2021,6/10,"This movie lives on Deakins' awesome cinematography and McKay's powerful performance. Nevertheless the story is weak and fairly conventional, enfolding a time-compressed stream of events with a nearly permanently moving camera which I found hard to follow all the time. It's a naturalistic depicition of war tolerating some loopholes in the script, a impressive technical display of a movie lacking some narrative substance."
1917,8 February 2020,4/10,"I wanted to like this movie after hearing all the good reviews and awards hype. There's good stuff, acting is fairly good, effects were okay, but at times the CGI looked blurry, buildings at middle or far distance, e.g. It was distracting.The biggest annoyance was the story line. Simple premise, two soldiers ordered to get from point A to point B to deliver a message. The problem was they continually allowed themselves to be distracted from their mission, and thus to get into trouble. A better script could have found ways to add drama without making the pair look like nincompoops. I have never been a soldier, but at several places I could see a potential problem before these trained soldiers did, and I would have avoided their injuries easily.An average war movie."
1917,7 March 2020,9/10,"This movie is directed in a way I've never seen before. When you watch it, you at times forget about the story, which is great as well, because you're so mesmerized by the camerawork."
1917,5 March 2020,8/10,I liked the movie but he isn't 10 out of 10 but I recommend to watch it if u love war movies
1917,20 January 2020,5/10,"If you are going to this movie for action...do not go. It's literally dragged out over two hours. This is more of a behind the scenes of war kinda movie. It's mostly about the journey. It's kind of like the lord of the rings but...without all of the action. The action really wasn't thrilling. It was like...""oh ok..a bomb"". Not a bad movie but could've been down way better."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"From start to end of this movie was very engaging, Obviously they take several shots but shown like one shot movie, Must watch movie and i'm sure this year it takes many awards. Amazing experience"
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"Give this a watch and see the beauty of it for yourself, because this is a movie where you truly are left speechless after."
1917,22 May 2020,8/10,"Immersive viewing experience, let people quickly into the play. Because of the continuous and large range of lens movement, some places make people a little 3D dizzy. There is almost no trace in the whole mirror, and you will not notice it. Put the fate of the two soldiers in the background of the war, there are not many lines, not only the cruelty of the war, but also the delicate feelings."
1917,22 January 2020,6/10,"I had heard so many great things about this I couldn't wait to see it. By the end I was wondering what all the fuss was about.It was going well up until Blake gets killed, the two soldiers going through no mans land, the German trenches and bunkers was compelling. But then we're supposed to believe the German pilot who had crash landed his plane on fire and was lying on the ground had overcome Blake and stabbed him. Come on.Then out of nowhere a convoy of British troops turn up and give Schofield a lift, they drop him off and he starts crossing the bridge and almost immediately he comes under fire from a German sniper, are we supposed to believe the convoy just left him fend for himself? Anyway German sniper manages to miss his target with every shot but our man Schofield manges to shoot him with his third or fourth hanging from the bridge.When he goes to check to see if the German is dead he gets shot or does he, all we see is him waking up in a pool of blood but no obvious wound. He's then chased by another soldier , he escapes through a door which must have been invisible to the German as he just runs past. Here he finds a French woman and a baby who has somehow managed to avoid capture by the Germans, luckily our hero had found some milk earlier.After he leaves the woman and baby fend for themselves, he comes across two soldiers, he kills one but for some bizarre reason not the other, he drops his knife pushes him away and runs.If it wasnt for the cinematography and the opening half hour I would have given it a 4, poor characters, plot holes and bland story."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,The movie shows in greta detail that every solider has the same story. Solider must follow orders and hope to surivive to get home. The only way home is death or victory.Doesn't matter if its Civil War or the War for Independence.or the Roman LegionsA solider burdened is always heart felt because you know that by following orders your family and love ones may never see you but you keep moving keep walking and keep heading to the finish.A great script with love and respect to the foot soldier.
1917,18 April 2020,9/10,You know I don't watch these kind of movies but I watched it bc my partner wanted too. And I was pleasantly surprised I was into it and watched it all and I recommend it to my girlfriends telling them. Believe me you'll like it.
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"Not your typical war film, in the sense that it isn't a 2 hour long kill fest showing one side out shooting the other. More focus is put on the human side of things which was very refreshing, especially considering how well acted each character is.Although the plot may disappoint some, I thought it was brilliantly paced and plenty happened. Regardless of the content, the production deserves recognition for what was achieved here.The 'single take' technique flowed much more smoothly than expected and the amount of effort required to get certain long takes spot on must have been immense. I expected to find it a little jarring or too intense, however the subtle cuts they made helped a great deal.I was also impressed with the representation of Sikh soldiers as I feel they are so rarely shown in films or documentaries for the part they played in the war. Granted there are only a few scenes and a couple of lines but nevertheless I was happy to see some inclusion.The cinematography and set design deserve special recognition, again regardless of the plot itself what the production team did with 1917 is nothing short of genuis. I highly recommend watching a behind the scenes video for this film, seeing the scale of the sets built is mind blowing.Doubt it'll win best picture but it certainly deserves at least a few Oscars given the amount of work put into making it."
1917,13 January 2020,5/10,"First of all, I thought the new way of filming the movie was very well executed and will now be copied many times. The issue for me was by using this technique throughout the whole movie, it took away from other aspects on what it could have shown.
Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, I wanted to see some action and depiction of trench warfare. What I got, wasn't that at all, in fact apart from a 20 second shot towards the end there was no warfare.
This was not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, they were full of drama and action. 1917 was simply dull in comparison."
1917,22 April 2020,9/10,"What a beautiful movie. The cinematography, music, and acting was just unbelievable. What an incredibly touching movie, you feel like you are right there with the main characters the entire movie and you want them to make it so bad!"
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Visually amazing.
Story amazing.
Characters amazing.
This film you have to see, somehow from the moment of the opening shot it appears to be one long continuous shot right until the credits, makes the film flow perfectly at a great pace."
1917,21 January 2020,4/10,"Expected great things from the previews and was terribly disappointed. The story is dull. The characters are uninteresting. Walked out 1 hour in. Dear Sam Mendes, you owe me 30 bucks...."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"1918 is a remarkable piece of film making. Stunning. When the credits started instead of jumping up out of my seat, I had to collect my thoughts. The story telling, acting, visual continuous shooting totally absorb me. I sat and reflected on the insanity the 1st world war was to how good film making can get to your soul. Films of this outstanding quality are meant only for the big screen ."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Im so thankful that im alive in a time where movies like these are made. Everything was as realistic as it can get, the acting, cinematography, the sets, the lighting, it felt like I was with the characters like getting shot, and somehow could smell and feel everything the actors could. Im never gonna get over it. As a Sikh, seeing us being represented properly in a movie made me emotional. The soundtrack was brilliant."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"Such an ambitious and pristine foray into new forms of filmmaking.
A captivating exploration of life as a soldier in WWI warfare.
The strength of this film is the masterful and unique artistry of single-perspective aesthetics and visuals with zero cuts.
Beautifully filmed and acted.
The story and script were clearly lacking. Definitely not the strength of this film.
If not for the captivating and original approach to filmmaking, I wouldn't give this film a 8/10 stars. Probably would give it a solid 7stars.
But the daring (and might I say, successful) attempt at new approaches to filmmaking talks itself into a bonus point.
8/10 stars."
1917,5 March 2020,10/10,"Yes, there are flaws in this movie. The plot is a bit unrealistic and one does have to question how bullets repeatedly miss our hero.These are things that you will only reflect on afterwards though. As you watch it, you are pulled into the story and I defy you to take your eyes off the screen for even a moment. The cinematography is truly epic and fully deserving of its Oscar. Set design is also very impressive and doesn't pull many punches when it comes depicting the horrors of war.This is a must see movie. Even if afterwards you decide that actually you didn't like it as much as you expected, for the two hours you are watching it, you will be utterly immersed and you can't say that of too many movies."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"Overall a decent movie and very informative. I think it gives a accurate view of the Hell thats called WW-I. It depicts the death and dying, desperation of the young soldiers and the senseless killing that went on.
An adventure of two soldiers, orderderd to try stop their kinsmen who're marching unto a certain death because of the trap set by the German army. Will they make it in time? A good and true story, but I didn't feel much about the way the movie was executed and therefor I don't quiet understand the Oscar. But that's personal I guess.
For me it just wasn't the masterpiece I was expecting or hoping for. It felt kinda empty and hollow. For me it lacked the quality and depth of series and movies like: 'Band of Brothers', 'South Pacific', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', 'Deerhunter', 'Hotel Rwanda' or 'Beasts of no Nation' and so on. I guess I just have to keep waiting a while longer."
1917,5 February 2020,6/10,"I was bored. The story was not interesting. The script was shallow and not believable. No character development. The one shot filming that worked great in Birdman, becomes tedious here as very little actually happens.The movie's cinematography, special effects and camera tricks are cool to watch for awhile, but not for 2 hours.There are many great WW1 movies. This one is not and hopefully won't be recognized as one. See : All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory, Gallipoli, Lawernce of Arabia, Grand Illusion, Sergeant York, Farewell to Arms and many others are far better movies than 1917..
It would be a shame if this boring movie becomes ""the standard"" for WW1 movies above the many, many movies far superior.
It wasn't bad. It was good. But why did they spend so much money on a soft, boring, unbelievable script? Such a waste money and talent."
1917,24 March 2020,9/10,"Dammit! You should watch this movie. Amazing One Camera Shoot, clever camera movement, and perfect cinematography. One of the best movies I ever saw."
1917,20 February 2021,4/10,"The first 20 minutes is great, but after that it is a joke with most unrealistic storyline. I really waited for this, but it was a huge disappointment. It is a disgrace to the people who fought in WW1."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Where to begin? Perhaps the magnificent performances, the superb editing, the chilling score? All worthy contenders, however I must start with the cinematography. Wow. The whole film seamlessly transitions from one area to the next looking like one extended shot, apart from one prolonged cut a little over half way through. The camera soars and dips, making circles around the action, following the soldiers through the trenches and swerving around walls. It's an exceptional piece of cinema that immerses you in the picture, never feeling like a cheap gimmick.Apart from this, it's just a damn good war movie full of emotion and not shying away from the horrors of war. People die. People are wounded. As a Lieutenant sarcastically remarks early on, ""Nothing like a scrap of ribbon to cheer up a widow."" We experience a fragment of the war with our main characters, carried by a stand out performance by George MacKay. We feel what he's feeling and feel immense sympathy for him throughout. As well as MacKay, Richard Madden takes over the screen in his brief appearance.Sam Mendes manages to craft scenes so tense and full of suspense (aided by a terrific score) that they wouldn't feel out of place in a great horror movie and it fits the tone perfectly. In the middle of all of this, there are also scenes of beauty that show humans at their best. A group of people pushing a car out of the mud may seem relatively insignificant but it leaves a lasting impression. There's also a wonderful scene between MacKay and a French woman. 1917 is a film that's both haunting and poignant while being expertly crafted."
1917,2 April 2020,9/10,"I think people miss the point. Yes the story seems very unrealistic at times. But this isn't a documentary. This is a movie that tries to give you a glimpse into WW I and is so much more about the feel than about the story.
It's about never resting, always running from something and to something, loosing friends, being torn between helping or killing, about the massive scale (both in distance and in human bodies) of this war, how bloody young these men were and what they were forced to do.
The longer I think about the story I too think it probably is much 'too epic' and unrealistic. But as I said, for me it's not a documentary, it's art. Go into a museum and look at paintings. Which ones are the ones that draw you in the most, that make you feel like you're there, that let you feel the atmosphere and that won't let you go? Well, for me these mostly aren't the realistic paintings. It's the expressionistic, the surrealistic and the impressionistic ones. Because it's not about how real it is, but where it takes you and what it makes you feel."
1917,6 January 2020,7/10,"Some viewers claim that it is one of the best war films which have been made so far but i disagree with it. First of all, 1917 is a personal film in my opinion and second of all, it does not portray the whole picture of First World War I. There was no law and order at that time especially before the war started. All nations, not only Germans but also France and England were acting freely according to their selfish will ( Greed, competition, nationalism and imperialism) therefore, more than 16 million people were died and killed during the war as it is known. Great cinematography but not a stunning story but it deserves to be seen in terms of technical aspects."
1917,1 March 2020,10/10,"The real best picture of the year. Great - sets, costumes, cinematography, acting, tension, drama, realism ....
Perhaps the best WWI film ever made.
Cheers to Director Sam Mendes, cast and crew."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,There were no cut scenes it felt like one big amazing plot. Just terrific! Good way to start the year.
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,"Well, the Story is quite simple;
the script is OK;
of course, the actors are just great;but what makes this movie so very special is the camera!Just fantastic work!
If this would have been WITHOUT the impressive camera work, I´d say its a 7 out of 10 stars...
But they just packed the 9 stars for ""forcing me to watch without blinking""!
It´s been very long, since I was so impressed."
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,There's no disputing that this film is a technical masterpiece and a brave piece of film making... but it's also tediously slow and dull.Sam Mendes spent so long working out how he could that he forgot to ask if he should.It's unique and will sweep up at the awards but it takes more than originality to make a film interesting.
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"1917 has some of the best cinematography seen on film, bar none. This film is directed by Skyfall-director, Sam Mendes, but the real star is Roger Deakins, the man behind the camera. The entire presentation of the film is so unique and so hypnotizing to watch. This movie takes the Birdman approach and tries to make the entire film look like it was filmed all in one take. The fact that they took this approach with a war film of all things is commendable, and it paid off quite spectacularly. So many moments in the film left me speechless and left me marveled at the filmmaking.The acting, soundtrack and mood of the film were also excellent. Even though this is a war movie, there are lots of quiet moments in the film, and the stellar set design and soundtrack take center stage. These moments add lots of tension and atmosphere, which better lets the viewer put themselves in the world.My only complaint with the film is that the characters feel somewhat underdeveloped. They are very likeable, and I enjoyed seeing their journey and following them, but they do not feel very three-dimensional. This was fine for me because a movie like 1917 is more about the experience of feeling like you're in a war, and it accomplished that, but a little more character moments could have helped.Overall, this was a very excellent and unique experience that I feel will be remembered for years to come as a true technical marvel. It is definitely worth a watch."
1917,18 December 2020,7/10,"Movie is ok. But it's more marketing than a movie itself, really. I am giving it 7 because it is realistic rating. It's far from 10, far from 9, for some subjective people can be 8 but I think realistically 7. Nothing special."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,Would've liked to have seen flashbacks before the war other than the trenches! Great message for people striving to give more than taking more!
1917,4 February 2020,5/10,"Really don't know what all the fuss is about, nice cinematograthy but thats all. There is very little tension and no real action, not a bad film just not a very good one."
1917,13 May 2020,6/10,"I have been in war! the main characters were morons. Why would you save an enemy soldier from burning to death? Why would you remove your hand from a enemy soldier mouth hoping he won't scream? Why not just kill them both. Let's not forget he had the advantage in other scenes to kill the other enemy soldiers but he choose to run from Battle. Regardless if his mission was to delvier the message and he was on a schedule. The story was weak. The cinematic was excellent. The rest of the actors and extras was excellent, it felt that you were there in the trenches, I did relate to the main characters emotionally, but they were still morons."
1917,17 May 2020,8/10,"This is a great film, but I don't understand why it's supposed to have been shot in 1 shot. It hasn't. And you can tell where the cuts are. Having said that, it's an amazingly emotional war film, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"This movie certainly lives up to the hype and expectation given by the fact that they won the award for best drama at the Golden Globes last year. However, to say that this movie is better than Joker is well, I don't buy that as Joker has a better narrative and cinematography, but that is just my opinion. Firstly, I would like to make things clear that this is a movie about the humane side of war and the emotional toll it has on those involved within these wars and at its core, the human spirit to survive.
The actor that absolutely stood out to me within this film is definitely George Mackay whom I have never heard of or have ever seen him in many major films before this and it is quite shocking to say that as he is indeed a talented actor whom in my opinion, if not for his acting capabilities, this entire movie would fall apart as this movie is more of a character driven movie rather than one that relies heavily on the movie's narrative. He manages to convey his character's emotions through his body language and all credit to director Sam Mendes too whom chose to direct a movie that requires the audience to observe and pay attention to the character's rather than having the character announce his emotions as seen in various movies these days. For me personally, the stand out scene would be the scene involving George Mackay's character in an army truck and it is truly such a powerful and emotional scene.
Speaking of characters, I felt the use of cameos from major stars such as Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and etc unnecessary as scenes with them last for approximately a minute or two and these scenes sort of stand out like a sore thumb in the movie as you know that it's just a cameo and these major stars are there for the sake of being there to provide the movie some extra dressing. Some may love this but I felt that these scenes were unnecessary and these actors could've been put to better use.
As for the most talked about point regarding this movie, this movie is edited in such a way that makes it seem like a one-shot. The entire experience was amazing and it draws you into the brutal minute-by-minute environment of war; from the casual conversations between soldiers to the nasty action sequences. I was wondering if all the events would take place within the movie's 2 hour runtime but they managed to pull off the passage of time absolutely brilliantly without having to break the one-shot effect they were really gunning for.
The cinematography was absolutely brilliant too, my gosh, this is a beautiful movie. I kid you not, each frame of this movie can be a screensaver and it is indeed an awe dropping experience. From the colour gradient used which is generally a sort of dull colour to depict the gritty environment of the battlefield to a beautiful flame within what is a dull environment (Not too experienced when it comes to colour gradients so this is the best I can do to explain it, sorry).
As previously mentioned, I now shall comment upon the movie's narrative. Well, it isn't anything new to be honest which is where I feel the movie severely lacks as the end goal is certain and you can kind of guess how the movie is going to turn out regardless of the movie's emphasis on the race against time to deliver the message. Furthermore, I did not feel much tension during the movie as I hoped I would and this is mainly due to yet again, the predictability of the movie's endgame.
Generally, at the end of the day, this is w a must watch. It may not be my pick for the Golden Globe award but my gosh, this is truly a cinematic experience you should not miss out on. Besides, it's January, all the movies out now can be missed out on and you probably wouldn't regret missing it; but this, this you cannot miss."
1917,23 March 2020,8/10,"It's an interesting movie, even more interesting when you know the behind the scenes."
1917,6 January 2020,9/10,"I Dont really watch war film except saving private Ryan but this film is so good that it made me watch tell the end,"
1917,14 April 2020,9/10,"The one take thing is not a gimmick in my opinion, it's a natural step up from Birdman. ""Oh, that one take movie was pretty good, let's add it to... I don't know... a war movie and let's get that new Oscar winner Rodger Deakins to be the cinematographer."" I already talked about the score and when I saw the trailers for this I thought that the two leads split up and were going to meet up in the end. Then I was slapped in the face with one of the most heart wrenching moments of 2019, when Blake was stabbed and bleeding out the acting was great. When he takes out the photo and just stares at it asking Scofield to comfort him just got to me. Also the inventiveness to keep this movie running smoothly was amazing, the Night Window peeling back to let the camera meet up with Scofield, hidden pathways in the barb wire that allowed the cameramen follow the actors through No Man's Land. Also, I may be thinking about it the wrong way, but the movie ended almost the same way it began only Scofield is stripped of what he once had, his helmet, equipment, and friend, all showing the weight and effort that went into this mission. Great movie."
1917,12 April 2021,5/10,"Although 1917 delivers a very beautiful scenery, followed by some of the best cinematography that film has ever seen, story-wise it doesn't captivated the audience as well as it should. I am not saying that I wasn't entertained throughout this film, but I wasn't as invested in the characters as I should have been, and 2 hours felt like a drag.This movie does have outstanding performances by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay.I think the main problem with this film is the emotional connection that movies such as Platoon (1986), Hacksaw Ridge (2016), and Full Metal Jacket (1987) deliver."
1917,20 February 2020,9/10,"We went to see this film at the cinema last night. If you get the chance it's definitely one for the big screen.
I was captivated from the very beginning and, considering the subject matter, enjoyed it.
The acting was brilliant, and as for the direction/production - outstanding, Mr Mendes. I'm sure you've done your Grandad very proud!
The film takes you through a variety of emotions leaving you feeling very humble at the horror and sacrifices these men endured. I'll definitely watch this film again; probably when I need a little reminder of what those boys/lads/men did for us all...."
1917,10 June 2020,9/10,1917 is an impressive technical achievement and a amazing war movie. Sam Mendes does a great job with the one shot story telling. This film is a textbook example of a war movie done right. The set design was so perfect with every detail bringing the coldness of war to life on the big screen. I can tell that 1917 will become a must see war movie.
1917,25 December 2020,4/10,A very blan story wrapped around awkward camera work.
1917,7 February 2020,2/10,"Some nice scenes with beautiful (yet fake) light and some cool sound effects. Thats pretty much it for me. Obviously I belong to the minority since the average score is well above 8. But for me, this movie was extremely boring. I had absolutely zero connection to any of the characters and I just couldnt care less if they lived or died. The dialogue was completely flat and didnt create any emotions in me. At least not sad when I was supposed to feel sad. At times it felt like a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings. It just lacked all the drama and great acting. It jumped to conclusions way too fast, and the main characters just didnt build a relationship to their audience.
Its actually beyond me if this movie win a single award. I just cant understand what that should be for."
1917,27 September 2020,10/10,"I fell in love with its cinematography technique. It's beautiful and mesmerizing. I enjoyed the movie because it has shown me the max. possible quality from both of the technique and the story, so I couldn't I ask for more."
1917,31 December 2020,10/10,"Never before have I been unable to tear my eyes away from a film for even a second - THAT'S how great 1917 is! The way this is shot is pure genius: more is revealed about the world with every second that passes, as you travel with the two soldiers on their hero's journey, so you don't want to miss a thing. Every person involved deserves a medal, with the highest praise for Roger Deakins' cinematography and Sam Mendes' script and direction. I am now a fan for life."
1917,28 December 2019,10/10,"This is hands down one of the greatest war movies to ever hit the silver screen along with being very unique. The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.This isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.From the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.Bravo!!"
1917,10 January 2020,1/10,"This movie is just boring. If you watch Saving Private Ryan oh man that took you right into the battle of World War II. Amazing. Then comes this movie, two guys walking on mud and talking all the time. Then they see some other soldiers and they talk some more. Then they walk some more. Then they ride for a bit. And then at the end they walk and talk again.No idea what I just watched. I don't understand why this get such high reviews. It's just plain terrible. I wanted to like this so bad but the characters just weren't likeable, you tried to like them and the director really really tried you to like them as well even by throwing babies at you at some point but it didn't help.This movie never gets under your skin, you're never scared or feel any tension. And I even saw it in IMAX. The Hero never gets hurt, he's terminator. The Germans are made to look stupid by the English director. They can't shoot, they can't fly, they're just drinking and puking and whatever..Not gonna waste more lines this movie is just terrible. Save your money unless you like watching two hours of soldiers walking on mud and talking."
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,"I love war movies, the classics Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers and newer films like Hacksaw Ridge. With Sam Mendes(Skyfall) directing, an interesting shooting style and a compelling trailer I was hyped up but left the cinema a little unsatisfied.
The story centres around two young soldiers who are given the task of delivering a message to a battalion ordering them to call off an attack, as to avoid a trap by enemy troops and a subsequent massacre.
The way this Is filmed is through one continuous camera shot, of course there are tricks to hide takes but it is an impressive feat. Not only for the actors to give a physical performance climbing through bunkers and avoiding enemy fire but to remember their lines and for the crew to keep this up so smoothly, I give this movie massive credit for this.
The first act of this film is by far the high point for me, we go through the trenches, into a bunker to collect orders then across to the end of the line and through no mans land eventually into a German bunker. It took my breath away how smoothly the camera navigated through this uneven terrain, all the while keeping the shot steady and framed. The tension was there as you can imagine crossing into enemy territory and I was enjoying the film.
However, problems arises when you don't cut from the main characters. When they have to walk to a barn for example we get the entire shot of them walking to the barn. I understand your probably thinking this is supposed to emulate their lives and what their experiencing, I understand but as a film with not much dialogue or charisma from the leads, not any Tarantino style conversations or music playing it drags the movie out.
Not only does the film have a lot of filler, the main characters don't have the acting or charm to carry the weight of this film. In a movie like The Revenant, it worked because it was filmed stylishly and Leo is a phenomenal actor.
Maybe it was just me but I just wasn't rooting for the heroes of this film, I don't think they go through enough or have any backstory explored to give them depth and they don't g through any real character arcs.
While I'm not complaining about the lack of action, it is missing here for a war movie. With this camera style there was the option to get something really special with some sequences but it never comes.
It's not to say the film is lacking any tension or suspense. It comes every now and then, but it's was not enough to keep me invested. I think if you have seen your fair share of the genre this doesn't bring anything new, it's nothing you won't have seen before.
To summarise I don't think 1917 is a bad movie, it's really not. Technically it's superb and the set up could of made this special. However I think the style chosen for this was a double edged sword, it gives great tension at times but drags the film down majorly at others. Combine this with an underwhelming performance from the lead actors just takes the film out of becoming a classic and drops it into the slightly above average category."
1917,20 April 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes again, creates an amazing piece of work. Brilliantly executed. The cinematography is jaw dropping. A stunning work of art. Made to look like one seamless single shot, it is amazingly well done. Highly recommended."
1917,11 January 2020,4/10,"Excellent set design and cinematography, but the ""single take"" gimmickry didn't work for me at all. Two hours is too long to see the main character on the screen 100% of the time. Looked at my watch about 80 minutes in because it was getting boring. Much of the action was pretty ""overdone"" unbelievable, and I felt there wasn't really any ""payoff"" in the ending- it left me flat. Finally... if you don't see this movie on a big, theater screen then don't bother because the ""spectacle"" of it will be lost and the story/character side of this movie just isn't that good."
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"This was a masterfully directed and shot film. Not really much of a backstory to anything, including the characters, which brings it down a notch a little bit for me to a seven. That was probably the intention, in fact I'm assuming it definitely was, but it did take away some appeal for me. However, the cinematography and direction is absolutely amazing. No question that Sam Mendes should have received the best director Golden Globe. Great film, best watched in the theater in my opinion, definitely worth your money."
1917,2 December 2020,6/10,"While I appreciate all that went into making this film, many of the scenes just go on too long. The dialogue is hard to hear and understand. There is no character development at all. The story itself is hard to swallow - 2 privates sent on this important mission with no food or supplies. Yet they are carrying thei bedrolls and heavy unnecessary items? Then no one wants to even read their important message? Great cinematography, but ultimately fails to be a memorable film."
1917,5 July 2020,10/10,Best war movie I've ever seen. They stayed away from unnecessary vulgarity but still managed to instill a generous amount of patriotism. Wonderful
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,1917 is a perfect example of how a simple story can be turned into a masterpiece using film making ingenuity.It has literally turned the direction and screenplay business on its head by changing the rules of the game.Earlier the audience used to interpret a movie by watching a series of frames.With 1917 we see this definition evolve into a series of lengthy shots.To accomplish such a task in a predefined space would have been a quotidian thing but here we see the imagination painted on a canvas of World War 1 which is an outrageous attempt in itself and the result is simply astounding.No doubt it will be one of the front runners at the Oscars which works big time not only because of awe inspiring cinematography but also because of the screenplay.The soul of the film is infectious and makes it one of the best World War drama movies to come out of Hollywood till date.Seldom we see cinema transforming right in front of our eyes and movies that challenge hard to bring such a change definitely deserve all the respect in the world.1917 JUST EARNED IT!
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,"Expected better, It;s worth seeing but don't buy into all the hype that it's great, it's a little boring to sit through."
1917,14 January 2020,1/10,"Wonderful set design and cinematography. The special effects worked well, as did the one continuous shot.
But what really let the film down was the unrealistic characters. In 1917 racism was rampant, and there is no way those working class soldiers from English regiments would have been conversing normally with black people and Sikhs. I grew up in Britain in the 50s and 60s and it wouldn't have happened then, let alone over 100 years ago!
In fact there would have been no people of colour serving as working class cannon fodder in any English regiment. Indians had their own regiments.
Also the soldiers in Yorkshire and Devon regiments would have had very broad regional accents, I couldn't see that any effort had been made to reflect this.
Also I can't imagine the general staff ever talking to a lance corporal, that task would have gone right down the line, probably to a lieutenant.
I am amazed that an English director couldn't bring himself to be more authentic, but I guess he was appealing to audiences beyond his island home, and had to be more inclusive."
1917,16 February 2020,7/10,"The Germans were just as good if not superior riflemen and sharp shooters than the Brits. These two ""superheroes"" would've been toast once they encountered the enemy if it was a documentary, but alas it's an entertaining movie."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"What an experience this was, despite all the suffering and horrors of war depicted in this movie,it was so immersive and intense it made me want be there,that how good this movie is"
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"Lets get the best out of the way first......well deserved oscar for Roger Deakins, best cinematography i've ever seen, Hands down.....Direction is great.....acting, sound effects, visual effects, film editing, music and all other technical aspects are all perfect....beautiful yet haunting....highly recommended."
1917,19 July 2020,2/10,"Wow, what an overrated piece of garbage this movie is. If, like so many others, you have terrible taste and think a few pretty shots make up for complete lack of script, action or anything resembling entertainment, then this movie is for you. If you were able to sit through Dunkirk somehow and didn't regret it for some reason, this movie is for you. But, if like me, you actually have excellent taste in cinema and demand more than just a few cinematic pictures to make an enjoyable film, avoid this movie at all costs. Just soooo boring. I mean how they made it so bad is a mystery to me and how some people actually enjoyed it is an even greater mystery. This movie is complete garbage, save your time!"
1917,26 May 2020,,"1917 exceeds at capturing the chaos and horror of WW1 trench warfare, I am just grateful that ""smellovision"" hasn't been invented yet. The story is a simple yet effective device used to move the main characters through the battle-field of Western France.It is a truly immersive experience, in which you very quickly identify and start caring about the main characters."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Speechless, thrilling and adrenaline rush. Treat to watch. Rise the bar to extreme height. Period"
1917,25 August 2020,6/10,"A war movie that tried to appease all audiences by not making it too violent, missing the mark of showing the true horrors of WWI.WWI is rarely talked about, and for many, many years, I was anticipating and hoping for a great WWI movie to be made.If they were going to do a ""Message to Garcia"" the movie should have been over 3 hours, with the first half showing the horrors of trench warfare, the misery, suffering, and fear. The ending combat scene was very anticlimactic for a WWI movie, or any kind of war movie. A very short scene, diminishing the charge across no man's land.A war movie should be a war movie, not some romantic, okay don't make it too violent. Stop trying to romanticize and appease, and be daring to make a war movie that people will talk about for decades to come and be one of the greatest. Think of Saving Private Ryan on the D-Day beach scene.The whole scene with the French lady and the baby was unnecessary, and a waste of time for the film, but again, forcing in the appeal for a general audience. That scene should have been 30 seconds at best. That scene lasted longer than the ending climatic combat scene. What were you thinking?War movies should be gritty, horrible, and leave a lasting impression, not ""wow the visuals and lighting were amazing.""A few movies that represent war for what it is without being romantic.
Furry.Saving private Ryan (not so much the story but the intense combat)Apocalypse Now. Nothing romantic about it.The Deer Hunter (for those who don't want to see much combat).Flags of our Father (IMDb rated it a 7, but 1917 has an 8.3) Come on.Letters from Iwo JimaPlatoon.Band of BrothersPacific series (Not all episodes, just the combat ones).Not all inclusive or ideal, but some very shocking and griping moments of the confusion and horror's of war.We don't need anymore Pearl Harbor's, and even Midway, way too much shore time with the wives, clubs, and families.I am hoping someone can do a WWI movie and be a war movie, not this touch and go of being more of a TV-14 movie. I promise you, the wives and girlfriends will not hold it against their man for them wanting to watch a war movie without them.We need good war movies. Starting from WWI. How about an Island hoping campaign of WWII? Start with Guadalcanal and end with the Battle of Okinawa? Good for at least 5 different movies."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"This is really a must see movie for anyone who loves movies. How they achieve what they do in this movie is totally beyond me? I have never seen anything quite like it. I had heard about the single long take, but was really not expecting what I saw.Its a simple story about a WW1 soldier taking a note to a general across enemy lines, but what makes it so special is that we are with him every step of the way. We travel through the trenches, the mud and the gore, we encounter the dead, the dying and the sheer horror of war and are subject to every explosion and gunshot along the way. We live every moment of the struggle as if we were there.I cannot imagine any other film more deserving of awards than this. No big stars dominating, just one AMAZING move."
1917,18 December 2019,10/10,"After reviewing movies for many years I have a sort of formula when it comes to writing about the films I watch. If the movie is really bad I tend to write the review straight away so I can get it out of my mind and never have to think about it again. When a film is good, as I find most are, then I tend to wait two to three days to collect my thoughts, do some background research and write it with a clear mind. But occasionally I see a film which absolutely blows me away. These types of films come around rarely but when they do I have to really sit back, take a deep breath and comprehend just how I'm going to convey how good it is in words. 1917 is that type of film - a movie that displays technical wizardry behind the camera and amazing work in front of it. It's been six days since I've watched 1917 and I'm still in absolute awe of what I witnessed!The year is of course 1917. Deep in the heart of France British soldiers battle the Germans in what appears to be insurmountable odds. It's on the battlefield that we meet two young soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George Mackay). They've just been assigned an impossible mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth): travel by foot behind enemy lines, avoiding German snipers and artillery, to find a British battalion that is about to walk into a trap set up by the Germans. It's a task so dangerous it will probably cost both men their lives, but if they fail it will lead to the massacre of 1,600 British soldiers. Adding to the urgency of the assignment, Blake's older brother is one of the 1,600 soldiers about to walk into the ambush!THE GOODAfter reading the above description you're probably wondering what makes this film so spellbinding. Well it's the way that it has been filmed that really puts it above other war films. Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall, American Beauty) and cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, Blade Runner 2049) have collaborated to come up with a style of filming that makes it look like one long tracking shot that never takes a break or cuts away.
We follow soldiers Blake and Schofield all the way through their mission in real time: walking though crowded bunkers, dodging snipers and crawling through mud as if we are there with them. As an audience member it's disorienting, confronting and an absolute cinematic masterpiece like I've never witnessed before. This is a film that just HAS TO be seen in the cinema to get the full experience. It's a movie that really shows the horrors of war with scenes that will shock you and sounds that will scare you. A lot of people may compare it to Saving Private Ryan but I think it may even be better than that!THE BADApart from a couple of nit-picky things there is nothing bad about this movie. There are cameos galore where the famous actor always has his back toward the camera and then dramatically turns around as if to say 'look it's me!', and a lot of the story does fall into place rather too nicely, but nothing took away from my enjoyment or made me feel as I was watching 'just another movie'. Throughout this film's two hour running time I felt as if I was on this mission with these two soldiers and absolutely nothing took me out of it until the very end credits.THE UGLYMendes has managed to capture the horrors of war in full, gory detail. From dirty, rat infested bunkers to brutal deaths and amputations, nothing is off limits as 1917 definitely doesn't glamorise what these brave men in the British armed forces had to go through. It may not be easy to watch for those of you with a weak stomach but it is probably a very accurate portrayal of what really happened in World War One.The saying 'you have to see it to believe it' is an accurate statement when talking about 1917. Nothing I write will do justice to the film which definitely requires a second viewing to fully take it in. It's war and it's ugly but the way it has been told is just as engrossing as what is being told. A must see at the cinema!FIVE MILITARY MEDALS OUT OF FIVE"
1917,28 March 2020,3/10,"Sorry but it was so sad, slow moving, sound issues, and I am so disappointed overall considering all the rave reviews. it was not a cinematographic film in my opin."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I got into about an hour and half of this kid following him to deliver a letter. He defies every obstacle thrown at him and can outrun bullets. Miraculously finds milk to help out a baby, then jumps into a river and a waterfall where the letter in his jacket doesn't get ruined also can swim with boots on, does anyone realize that when you go in water with boots you sink, really Best Picture, far from it!, Judy and Midway were much better movies and Joker just blows this away. Best Director, umm no, many parts unrealistic...very disappointed. The battle scenes, wait there wasn't any and you really never got a perspective of the opposition. So the trench scenes were basically the more interesting scenes. I've seen plenty of war type movies and this wouldn't even make my Top 5."
1917,6 February 2020,8/10,"As far as war movies go, this one is different. My only criticism might be the total lack of humor. As expected, It is certainly not a comedy, but lighthearted humor doesn't even come into the fray.I thought the seamless continuous shot might be a gimmick that would bridal the film (I don't really see the need to avoid edits), but for this film, it is very effective. It pulls you in with our main character and as the film progresses, so does the immersion and the tension. You really do feel like you are experiencing everything as a witness.On top of that, the cinematography is very ambitious....sometimes beautiful.There are metaphors of the contrasts between innocence and aggression. They are well done and poignant. The score is grandiose if not a bit over the top, but it will undoubtedly allow your tears to well.The acting is beyond reproach and the aftertaste is respect. We've all seen a lot of war movies. This one is less about bravado and more about humanity. Our hero is not the typical bad-ass, but rather a young man who is pretty much obliged against his instinct to complete a mission not only because he's following orders, but mostly for honor and his own soul. In that way, he becomes a hero.Well done with some memorable scenes I will likely never forget."
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"Personally I don't see 1917 without it's one shot take. Sam Mendes mad a huge risk to do that and it really pulled off. The movie has a series of mixed emotions, for example when Schofield stops to hold the baby and the next thing he does is chokes a german soldier. Cinematography is a 10/10 the position of the camera in every scene is on point the timing of the movement of the camera and the scene is marvelous. The movie is a 10/10 for me."
1917,25 January 2020,8/10,"I saw this film just about 45 minutes ago. This film is brilliantly shot, edited and delivered all due to the ingenuity and meticulous nature of Sir Sam Mendes and Sir Roger Deakins. One thing this film does very well is remind us how intricate fate and the human nature is in this film. Its like we know these characters personally or as if we were there on the front lines with them.Some films deserve to be on the big screen, this is one of those films. 2019 has been an astounding year for films and 1917 supports that statement proudly"
1917,22 February 2020,9/10,"I used to imagine what if there's a movie that is made one-shot? Or atleast make it look like a one-shot film. I am not a fan of history and war films but the online saying it being one-shot directed my attention. This movie is IMMERSIVE! The effects, the sets, the surprises along the way, are very GREAT and CAPTURING!Looking for more One-Shot or One-Shot Like Films like this in the future!"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,This is realistic movie and I never left my eyes of it.
1917,17 March 2020,10/10,"Watched the movie, ""1917"" finally. 😭 I must say, it's really dramatic and emotional...
Oh man! It is so realistic that it seems to be shot during the World War I. What an originality!!!! The friendship between the two battle-mates, Schofield and Blake is described in a great way. The dramatic emotions of the soldiers are at per. The situations were very thrilling, highly practical and really true to life. Overall it's another awesome film."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,The movie was very good .The direction and the cinematography were so good . I think Sam Mendes will get oscar .
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,Really good war film. The amazing music and the one-shot makes the film amazing. Really good cast and the best camera work that I have ever seen. It is an amazing film for everyone who want to get a realistic war atmosphere in a film. 86/100
1917,16 January 2020,4/10,"I thought I was not in the habit of commenting on movies I didn't like, because it's nicer to talk about what we like instead. But since there is no major Oscar-nominated performance this year (except of course the ""Joker"", which should be discussed somewhere else), and undeserved praise comes for really bad examples of movies that should not be watched, I decided to look back at the following title, from the director Sam Mendes, whose other films left me indifferent.Please note that the commentary will consist mainly of spoilers, because there is nothing else to comment on. The only praise for this movie is the truly impressive long shots, which could be considered a masterpiece, if only they were better integrated with rather poor CGI effects, and served a basic story, that is pure cliché, and nothing more than that.There is no comment on acting because there is no any reason for that. Benedict Cumberbatch and Collin Firth appear too briefly in the film to make any contribution to the plot, leaving only the wooden appearances of the other actors, in all either dull, or impossible situations. From the very beginning, the two main characters stand out from their surroundings, as they just exit from the beauty salon, unlike the other characters with faces and clothes dirty, as the soldiers should be. They are given an impossible task, which seem only they can accomplish. One dies in an attempt to rescue an enemy pilot without any logic. From that moment on, every step is predictable to the end. The rest of the hero arrives to meet even a female person who, apart from mere appearance, is of no relevance to the story. At crucial moments, he even leaves the weapon, so that by some miracle, avoiding all the bullets of the enemy, he will reach the target.The most irritating of all l'art pour l'artistic shots, that are too many in this movie, is when the long run in front of the trench is shown at the end, when the unfortunate hero runs and collides with soldiers who, like a miracle, constantly emerge from the same trench, in order to get to the command and stop this futile attack (it would seem, as futile as this movie is). It would have been easier if he had remained to run in an empty trench, since the attack had already begun, when only these soldiers would not constantly sprout from nowhere. Or, to run behind, instead of in front of the trench, because there is no one there, but in that case we would not have such a long and beautifully shot frame, would we?Unfortunately, this movie failed to be the anything else but the annoying attempt of an imitation of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" portrayed in World War I. Why the title is exactly his year, and what does it have to do with the fictional event being described, remains a mystery."
1917,13 February 2020,2/10,"Yes, one shot is amazing ( actually more than one ) , but the plotting is too simple, what a big fuss to deliver such a minor assignment!I like the lighting art at the night time chasing scene , other than that, really boring !"
1917,1 August 2020,9/10,"A lot has been said about the cinematography, particularly the single-take illusion but the story itself is, by far, the best thing about this movie.
There was a bit of overt the 'guys in the other uniforms are irredeemably evil' shtick to it, for which I felt that it does not deserve a '10'. However, there is some good depth given to some characters (particularly an officer whom it initially seems we should hate) that pushes it to a '9.5' in my eyes.
Individual performances are superb. The actors did an excellent job of portraying their characters with the honesty and emotion that makes a movie. The tone and manner in which the film ended was heartbreaking, even though we know very early on that the heartbreak is coming. I will have to muster up the courage to watch it again sometime."
1917,15 July 2020,4/10,"The main thing that makes this movie different is the one shot approach. However, the story was a bit ho hum, bland and not very believable. It wasn't particularly compelling as an anti war movie. I didn't really care too much about the characters, and there's a random scene where the lead meets a woman which didn't seem to fit. I saw Da Five Bloods soon after and that affected me more as an anti war movie,
Overall this movie was disappointing and I don't get the hype about it."
1917,21 January 2020,4/10,"I am of a generation whose parents fought in WWII and grandparents fought in WWI and have despaired of late as those who went through hardships of war during the last century are scorned by those whose lives have never seen such struggle. I was brought up on films of WWII less so WWI but its reputation, whilst hidden in hindsight was of far greater brutality.I read many flattering headlines about 1917 but little more, I didn't want to have anything spoiled. I had great expectations. As the film opened, it was clear that it was taking an unconventional path which I went along with for a while but it wasn't long before I thought I was watching a walkthrough of a game. The longer it went on, the more I felt like there was an invisible person next to me with a controller.It wasn't just the scenes with target props, single serving characters and geography which made no sense. Being careful not to give spoilers, one moment there are just two people in a quiet rural scene, then there is an action to introduce another, then two, no three soldiers appear from nowhere and then behind a building, there is a whole squad who inexplicably had not heard a dramatic incident that had happened a hundred feet away.Likewise a scene where that squad exits just as the remaining protagonist comes under fire. Why do the squad not provide cover? Are they deaf?No, it wasn't just these things, it was the photography which panned just as the PoV changes in a game to keep up with the character. There were moments when I genuinely half expected elements to pass through each other the way they used to render in early video games and there was a real feeling of 'unrealness' that the whole thing had been one big deep fake.There was some real war horror in the film but I felt that the video game effect cheapened the whole thing as if it had been made to pander to a particular demographic whose attention could only be maintained by such dynamics.I was wondering where I had seen this recently and remembered seeing a James Bond film at a relative's house over Christmas and was struck by the contrast to the James Bond films I watched in my youth.All in all, I felt that it was some kind of triumph but lacked so much and it is an example of one of the reasons why I don't go to the cinema very often anymore.I wouldn't discourage anybody from watching it but it was far less than I hoped it would be."
1917,24 March 2020,3/10,"Beautiful settings, and that's it. Extremely poor plot and characters. It is really disappointing, most of the time it seems a war videogame with its short quests. Awful!"
1917,27 February 2020,9/10,"This is one of the best ww one movies arround, very good picture shots."
1917,17 October 2020,5/10,"Didn't care about anyone. The ""single take"" felt like a gimmick that got boring quickly. The two leads are wooden and delivered the bland expositional dialogue terribly. Despite all its efforts, there wasn't any real tension in the film and it felt like a discount Revenant meets Saving Private Ryan, with none of the exciting action of the former, or interesting atmosphere of the latter. The plot was dull, and the one take concept did nothing to enhance it. Added to which, the two characters were unbelievably irritating in how much unnecessary stupid situations they got into, failing to disarm or shoot anyone they met along the way. The lineR plot felt like a bad rpg. Go here, talk to this guy, then go there and talk to that guy. Complete emperors new clothes. Mildly entertaining at points but largely tedious."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917 proves that great film's can be made. It shows that putting a little more time and effort can turn something that good into something that great. This film is by far my favorite film of 2019. This film is shot to appear as one long take. This approach is not only fasanating but adds so much to the story. You immediately feel the tention due to a strict time restraint due to the plot. As these characters get further to their goal, you can't help but realize the time is ticking. Following their ENTIRE journey because of the one shot makes this film feel like it's you going on this mission with these other soldiers. 1917 is a true masterpiece and should be looked upon as inspiration for those who make film."
1917,5 February 2020,7/10,Very good movie but I don't see what all the Oscar and award hype is all about. Think about the story. It doesn't make sense at all. So they knew the Germans had left the area and the 2 men could make through to the front line. Why not just send the same plane the didnthe recon and drop the same letter to the front line the soldiers were carrying?
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"Even an attempt to make a movie like this should be appreciated; nevertheless an exceptionally beautiful movie that takes most of us to the world we ""fortunately"" were not present to see. Schofield (MacKay) - ""The Last Man Standing"""
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,"Everybody is talking about the technic, cinematic and details. Well, those were perfect. But those aren't make a film what it is.
The characters doesn't build during the movie? There is no emotions in the film and you won't be able to connect to the hero.
I've waited for this movie to come out, so poor, such a miss."
1917,5 January 2020,9/10,This might be the best movie I've seen this year. Definitely need to see this on the big screen. Overall it's a very sad pointless brave thing war is.
1917,28 March 2020,7/10,"First off I will say that the recreation of the battle zones were awesome. You can almost smell the stench and horror of what a WWI battle field must of been like. And the work the director and all those involved did to create it is amazing. My only critique is that some of the events in the film seem a bit odd and maybe it's just me? but I find strange that the two young men let down their guard in reference to the German pilot. I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but it does seem odd. And I have a problem with both soldiers navigation of the terrain and town. The one soldier had to ask the girl who he spent way to much time with, where to go?? In fact I have a problem with the navigation in general. I only saw the one pull out a compass once to get a bearing and did they not have at least a basic map? It just seemed like a very hap hazard OP where 1600 troops lives depend on them getting there? Visually it was a great flic with some head scratching involved."
1917,30 January 2020,8/10,World class craftmanship no doubt. And the intense camera work following the lead characters through the trenches and battlefields is mindblowing even if you can spot some of the places where the invisible cuts are made. But the story is not that great. An interesting thought is to imagine this film being edited in a more traditional way. In that case this would be a pretty big nothing I bet. But the camera work is fantastic which makes the picture worth seeing. Fine acting and great score aswell. Would surprise me big time if it doesn't win the Oscar for best cinematography and production design.
1917,10 July 2020,8/10,"A good old-fashioned war film takes an audience to some deeply troubling times in history(whether its story is fictional or non-fictional) and brings together a group of characters dropped right in the midst of all the war-torn chaos. Like any war film, there's a mission or series of events the characters must go through in order to achieve their goal and having a triumphant victory to bring their war to an end. To get to that triumphant victory there's going to be some sacrifice which can come in any form, whether it's emotional, physical, psychological, etc. A lot of times I have seen these films tell compelling narratives with a wonderful cast of characters, but you as the audience feel as if you are just watching the story from a far or observing these stories invisibly. In the case of 1917, we pretty much get all of what I previously mentioned, yet unlike other war films this film manages to completely immerse you into the story and take you right along side of the characters as they go on their mission. It's a massively immersive thrill ride that allows you to get a complete feel for everything that happens before your eyes.Now many have gone to compare 1917 and its familiar elements to that of a previous hit war film Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, which I would have to admit they do feel quite similar to each other. Dunkirk was an experience to see and hear what happened during WWII in those areas surrounding Dunkirk, however, it still felt like I was merely invisibly observing the events rather than completely feeling like I was right there next to the soldiers and civilians. 1917 takes its audience right into the action and has you follow right along side the characters every second of the journey. It makes you feel like you are just another soldier going on the mission as well. I do tip my hat off to Same Mendes for creating such an experience that you don't get have often during a film.1917 has a good narrative with some good leading characters, but nothing overly complex in those areas. Now I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing and as I just previously said it has a good narrative, but it's a rather simple story- two soldiers are given a mission and they go to reach the objective. Simplicity can be good a lot of times, but with this kind of film you need to have something to compensate for the simplistic story(that they do have in this film). Where the film really shines and excels extensively is in its technical areas such as the cinematography, music, sound design, etc.(especially in its cinematography). I know that I have mentioned the immersive multiple times already, but I will say it once again- this is film is an immersive experience! Perhaps the biggest factor to creating this immersive experience comes from master cinematographer Roger Deakins as he turns the camera from a observational presentation tool to an ""on the ground"" and personal viewpoint for the audience to feel like you jumped right into the film as if you were a fellow soldier. As soon as the film starts, the camera is in constant motion and never really comes to a complete stop. This concept of having the camera at a constant state of motion gives you the feeling that you are on a journey and that the journey continues to go forward. Beautifully framed and composed while being in a constant state of motion. Stitching together scenes so seamlessly that it appears the characters as well as ourselves never stop moving owes itself to two things: exceptional choreography and clever editing. Yes it's very apparent that this film was very much choreographed and most likely practiced countless times in order to nail the scene as perfect as possible. With excellent cinematography and choreographed scenes comes the next big part here is the clever editing used to keep us up with the continuous journey. Taking careful moments in the progress of the film, editors select moments where to hide a cut and make it seem as if they never really stopped rolling.Then we get into the next big parts of the film, which all involve the sound areas. It cannot be overstated how important sound is in a film, especially to a film like 1917 where sound is essential. The sound design heightens the audiences senses to get e good feel for the tension and atmosphere in any given scene. Just another way to feel immersed, having the sound of gunfire, explosions, footsteps, and other sound effects to make you feel the same way as the characters on screen. Thomas Newman's score not only lends a hand to the tense war-torn atmosphere, but also reaches the deep emotional guts of those going through war.In the end, 1917 manages to create an immersive experience that keeps you at the edge of your seat and takes you right into the film's story. A journey for audiences to follow right along with, which allows you feel and hear everything happening as if you yourself went back literally to 1917 during WWI. The films masterful technical elements never disappoint and make up for the rather simple story. Never have you seen or felt a war film like this one!
Overall Star Rating: 8.5/10"
1917,12 February 2020,6/10,"Difinitely not the best war movie I've seen, but this is a good movie. The movie looked very good and the scenes and shots were breathtaking. Sound and music really helped to provide an emotional experience. However, there were too many moment where it fell flat. The story could have been more interesting at points and it just became bland. But overall it is worth a watch and I was not disappointed but 8.5 rating is definitely overrated as usual this movie is a 6 to 7 maximum."
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,"I was very frustrated about this film, because it could've been my favourite film. But badly let down with stupid scenes. I get easily bored with action movies, I'm looking at you John Wick and Fast And The Furious series, this film has none of that. All the build up scenes were all in the trailers. I adore the one shot film and the cinemageophy, but let down with too much walking about with nothing happening. It's like a movie equivalent to Death Stranding. Great movie, with too much hiccups."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,Absolutely fantastic movie. Won't win best picture because Hollywood would never let a movie of this stunning achievement win because it doesn't promote their narrative.
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is undoubtedly a good contention for best American film of the year. Exceptional Direction and outstanding cinematography makes this film standout from other war films.The story and screenplay of 1917 aren't particularly unique when compared to other war films. More than story, it's the cinematography which tethers the whole movie together. Without the finesse of Roger Deakins this movie would've been just an other cliched war movie.1917 may not be my first pick for the best picture in oscars but it surely deserves its nomination.Story/Screenplay: 7/10
Acting: 8/10
Cinematography: 9/10
Direction: 8/10"
1917,1 March 2020,8/10,"Beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. The scene at night in the ruins that are lit by flares and fire is fantastic. Two simple shots stand out to me; the first being in the beginning when the two protagonists walk around a body of water and the camera parts from them, goes to the waters surface and follows them from the side as they cross. The second being when Schofield sits to listen to the solider sing to his compatriots. The camera weaves in between the crowd of listeners to come back on Schofield. Very good costumes. Great set design and dressing. The film is filled with soldiers dirtied in the trenches; smoking, drinking, sleeping and tending to wounds. Locations are filled with ruins, craters, barred wire, old posters, fires, rubble and dead bodies. Everything in the foreground and background does a great job to feel like an authentic WW1 movie. The one shot element does a great job helping convey passage of time as well as really make the movie feel like one continuous journey. All the events on the way to the destination are great and exciting to watch. The death of Blake served as a great way to create stakes very shortly into the movie's runtime as well a create a good character moment between Schofield and Blake's brother. The last 25 minutes or so are great. The quick tempo ticking score gives a sense of urgency.There are a few elements that really hinder 1917. The first being the dialogue. A lot of the time it's very cheese ball, conversations between the two protagonists seem off. The second is the actual story. There's really nothing to the story, just a simple get from point A to point B with things that happen in the middle. Next is the one take element. Scenes where Schofield is running from Germans firing at him seem not as tense as they should be. Well over a dozen shots are missed back to back to back and you see every single one because its one take. Some quick cuts during those scenes would have created a more tense feeling. Finally the movie seemed more like a performance, like a play.Pretty good war movie that is really elevated by its cinematography and attention to detail on set, with a couple great moments. If you like war movies this is one to watch.
7.5/10"
1917,12 April 2020,9/10,Movie runs entirely in war fields even though it is interesting and entertainment . One for the nation . Loves the movie .
1917,22 January 2020,2/10,"Best war movie ever ? Everyone's got there own opinion . Certainly the best since SPR surely .
It's just mega and ticks every box . The only lull was he bit where he's talking to the French woman with the baby . That gave me the ideal chance to go for a comfort break . The great bit parts played by so many top Brit actors give it that added genius . All action thrill ride .
Sam Mendes , you've done it again !!"
1917,1 March 2020,10/10,"Like many here, not a huge fan of war movies. Especially because I simply don't like wars(?). But this movie had me blown away(no pun intended) from start to finish. This was such an incredible experience, everything from the amazing acting (which should've had an Oscar nominee), one of the finest cinematography I've ever seen and the revolutionary camerawork. Such a thrill, sad to see that it didn't win best motion picture."
1917,5 February 2020,4/10,"Won't spoil it but wow, was expecting so much from this movie and it's terrible. A timelime that is surreal with characters appearing and disappearing at plot's will and bullets that bend to land always inches from the character's face. Not believable at all..."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Over a Century ago .Sam Mendez' film developed through a homage to stories of his Grandfathers experience in the First World War. You can tell this is one of his most personal films.This film really depicts how trench warfare really was, horrifying. We see events unravel in real time just as our lead characters do and that's where the one shot really does work- we're experiencing the world as they are.-Perfect pacing.
-Cinematography is out of this world (Roger deakins)- some shots will remind you of skyfall
-score in parts will leave you with goosebumps throughout
-tense to the point you'll be actually feel slightly anxious
-one shot gimmick is almost forgotten because the film grips youOnly niggles is the dialogue sometimes is flat.
Game of thrones tie ins took me out a little bit.But I'm writing a review on here sooner rather than later to Urge people to watch this on the biggest, loudest screen possible before it leaves!
I only wanted to explain the technical side of this film as it truly just needs to be watched."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"It is an instant classic in not only war genre but in movie making. The cinematography, camera angles lighting vividly pop out and become a character in their own right.The story is true to its core keeping traditionally real scenarios in such a global conflict of that era. Definitely in my top five favorite movies of all time"
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"The visual effects? The MUSIC??? God, it was epic! One of the best movies I've ever watched."
1917,29 January 2020,5/10,"I wanted to like this. However, to me, it was unrealistic and boring. No offense intended to the person or persons it was based on. Unrealistic, IMHO, a person can not be shot at that many times and NOT get hit....can not have a tunnel of rocks collapse on you and NOT get hurt.....can not dive into a ravine and go over a waterfall and come out unscathed with all paperwork and photos safe and well....hummm.....nope.."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is so much thrilling and the camera work and performances are superb. Effects and CGi is so real and well done, a jewel of a movie to watch. One of my favorites for 2019!"
1917,22 May 2020,7/10,"This is a tale of a Soldiers struggle to keep a promise. It is a visual masterpiece but it lacks in believability. As a Soldier parts of the tale did not make any sense but I take it with a grain of salt as it is based in World War 1. It delivers action and suspense while draped in the hellish emotions of a world falling apart around our protagonist. If you didn't catch in on the big screen, it's worth the rental or watching it on TV."
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,"Imagine the movie without the single-shot technique, it would be a very very weak movie. The plot is weak, the characters are weak.Is it trying to say schofield was more strategic and experienced and calm? He also had a family but he is very focused and tough? Blake was inexperienced and naive? Both had very kind hearts that's why they were stabbed and stuff? What characteristics do they have?What about the cow, the milk, and the baby? The cherry blossoms too and the petals in the river - was that all necessary? It's a bit too much and commercial i.e. lame.The single-take shooting technique overwhelmed the plot and the characters - I was more interested in knowing how he did it instead of engaged in the story.I still cannot figure out how it gets such a high rating."
1917,20 January 2020,2/10,"How this has got such high ratings I do not know
It's tedious and cliched
The Germans are the worst shots I've seen since the A team and the Brits are too frightfully nice to kill them
It's like a mediocre Netflix movie
The one take thing is a pure gimmick that adds absolutely nothing dramatically
Save yourself some time and money and just watch the last episode of Blackadder Goes Forth instead"
1917,21 November 2020,10/10,"Cinematically brilliant
Brilliant acting
Visually striking
Awe-inspiringly real"
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,What was this absolute crap..... Most over rated film ever!!! Thank god I didnt go cinema to watch this. Avoid this movie at all costs
1917,16 February 2020,10/10,"I don't usually like war films but I decided to watch this anyway, and boy I'm glad I did. The actors did an amazing job at bringing the characters to life, it made for a very believable and moving performance. The crew did a fantastic job with the set, props and costume, and it almost felt like I too was a soldier in the trenches. The story was beautifully told and the room was very somber by the end of the showing. 10/10 definitely recommend and would happily watch again."
1917,13 March 2020,6/10,"Shoe string story, no intensity, weak emotional build and release. Can't understand the hype nor why I saw so many established faces doing such insignificant cameos. War movies are so easy to make exciting and this was just kinda flat the whole way through. I would not recommend this."
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"Wow! I just walked out of the theater with my girlfriend and we both are still in tears. 1917 is is a beautifully crafted yet epic violent tale of an impossible mission. The style and craft from Mendes directing this film to look like one take is done so well I have never seen anything like it before. Now granted I have seen some good films that are made to look like one take, but this film is done perfectly. The whole film I was shaking with goosebumps one minute then completely sobbing the next and then chuckling at some of the one-liners in the next scene. That being said, this film is building and you can feel it and that climax is so emotionally breathtaking and intense.The performances are outstanding and the cinematography is just incredible. What really ties this film together is Thomas Newman's score that is beautiful yet intense mirroring exactly what the film is. 1917 better win Best Picture and Best Director at least at the oscars and that is saying something in a year like this where there has been so many groundbreaking films and performances. 1917 is my new favourite film."
1917,10 January 2020,5/10,"Just finished it in cinema. There's really not a lot to say other than the pseudo one-take. Flat, predictable, lack of focus, scenes that feel completely out of place, no emotional payoff, unmemorable acting. All results of this rather forced one-take effort. And to be honest it's a pseudo 2-take really with that blackout in the middle. I can't believe this could win best film in any year."
1917,28 March 2020,8/10,"I've never seen a movie shot like this. It was a masterclass in film.The story was yet another example of individuals going above and beyond the call in times of war to save their fellow soldiers. There's countless of these stories & the movie itself was very similar to Saving Private Ryan, but the stories never get old - it's astonishing the bravery and selflessness people can exhibit for their family, their fellow soldiers and their country.While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, i still can't help but compare it to other greats like Saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk, which I happened to enjoy more. Still fantastic and would recommend."
1917,18 February 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still young. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.
Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. This gives the viewer a feel as if they are almost part of the mission, walking through the trenches and ducking under the fire of bullets alongside Blake and Schofield. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I felt Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.
Roger Deakins' cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay and Chapman do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.
There is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They survive to move forward to face more uncertainty. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire way through, never giving you a chance to catch your breath.
1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes. I am giving 1917 a 9.2/10."
1917,1 March 2020,7/10,"Watching this film in theaters is an experience and quite the experience. This film is made to look like it was shot in one-take and is used at its most effectively and brings you into the film even more creating one of the most intense films you'll see this year. Of course you can't talk about this film without talking about the cinematography by Roger Deakins, it's just gorgeous and makes the film even better! Also not much people have been talking about the leading performance which basically leads the film. Anyway if you haven't seen this already do yourself a favor and go see it!"
1917,30 March 2020,8/10,"After watching this, I think if only these four movies, this year's Oscar may come between Marriage Story and 1917. ""Irish"" is good, but not beyond the godfather, many people still have doubts about de-aging film technology. ""Inheritance of the Pope"" should be based on the male male male match, in the story and film director has not much room for play ;"" Marriage Story ""is the 21st century Kramer couple, male and female stars and movies to achieve each other, followed by this amazing ""1917"".I always think film is a perfect combination of technology and art. As a director, it is obvious that only technology can not, for example, Marvel DC; only art can not, of course, such as the various cases of failed artist directors. Most directors are of course focused, even very good directors. For example, I like Nolan is obviously more technical hang, and Ang Lee is an artistic origin, on the road of less successful technology pioneers. Most of the time, and this ""1917"", I really feel the artistic and technical perfection of the director is what.The story itself is simple: the spring of 1917, on the French battlefield of World War I. Two soldiers were selected to deliver an important piece of information that could save the lives of 1600 British soldiers, including the brother of one of them. The problem is that the task seems impossible: the enemy lines, trenches, and scorched earth are in front. And they only have two, and less than 24 hours.Under this setting, what would you do if you were the director? You can play a biography of a saint like Blood Wars Hacksaw Ridge, or you can shoot a human test like Save the Great War Ryan, or a shell bomb like most of the war films, with lofty ambitions. But the film was made into a long shot -- even if not -- an immersive war experience. Imagine you live in a big escape game, ahead of all kinds of checkpoints, enemies, traps, you have only one chance, can not be restarted, the only advantage is to have two lives (two soldiers), but the game is over when you die. In the film's two hours, the camera around the two protagonists, their every move, their breath, fear and hope, have been counted into the camera. The audience becomes them, their fear becomes the fear of the audience, their despair becomes the despair of the audience, and their bravery becomes the bravery of the audience. From a technical point of view, I think it's worth shooting a trivia of at least the same length, and I really want to see how Roger Diggins, who was able to seal the shots of Shawshank's Redemption, took those shots, thinking about the Andy shot in the rain. He was nominated 13 times for an oscar and never won, and if he doesn't win this time, I have the urge to smash the kodak theatre (just found out that he won the silver wing killer 2049 the year before last).The story of sending intelligence sounds so simple, but does not give people a minute of boring plot, because in the overall tense rhythm, the director also arranged Zhang Chi's environment and scene settings. From the front to the end"
1917,27 May 2020,9/10,"Dreaming of a mirror in the end, take me across the big river, arrived at the ideal country of life. Probably the most beautiful war movie of the 21st century, the perfect combination of technology and art.
Found a punchline after four brush: the hero on the helmet, syncope, and then cut the black screen 20 s, thought that the hero can't wake up, but Sam mendes with a very high level of empathy: water drops on the face of the sound to awaken the will of the hero and the audience, and then cut the bright screen, while screen lit up, but because of just play gimmick gentleness and tough to break the barriers of screen, the audience and the hero will tie together, implements the audience the beauty of the protagonist's gut-wrenching, is really amazing."
1917,17 June 2020,4/10,"Underwhelmed!
Clearly the film won much, deserved, critical acclaim for the cinematography itself but the plot?! Really?
Within the first few minutes, credibility just fell apart! *Before* 1917 our RFC aircraft were liaising with ground troops, artillery and infantry.
In the circumstances that the forward unit found themselves, a written order would have been dropped by air - mission accomplished.
I know that this film isn't a documentary but there are limits to what the audience will tolerate.
The script was third rate, at best. Cliche after cliche that had more connection to 'Blackadder' than a drama.
My 4k blu-ray will be in a charity shop before the weekend, I certainly won't watch it again. (watched on top quality large oled screen & 7.1 surround)"
1917,16 September 2020,8/10,The photography and the scenes are incredible. very entertaining
1917,11 December 2020,6/10,"Visually appeasing movie, decent acting, but as many said, the story was just too simple and there was little mental stimulation. Not sure if it's worth a second watch, but it was worthwhile to see at least once."
1917,4 February 2020,5/10,"How in the heck can this be nominated for so many Oscars?! It was such a predictable film. No real excitement. No character development. I didn't care if the characters lived or died. The whole importance of the film is garnered from how it was shot, seemingly in one take, but not actually. If you take that away, they could have made this a 60 minute movie. Tops."
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"Just watched the new 1917 film, that tells the story of two British soldiers sought on a journey to deliver a message to their platoon that a trap has been laid out for them, where these young soldiers must warn them before it is too late causing 1600 soldiers to die if they cannot warn them in time.The film has a very basic premise, of the soldiers going through to the trenches to warn their fellow soldiers of a trap, but the cinematography is absolutely amazing. The continuous shot method works so much here, that I don't think the film would have been as good without it.A beautifully made film and most definitely will win awards for the cinematography alone, but as compelling as the story is, it was kind of lacklustre.This is after all a telling story of real life events and certainly was achieved that way, for it's unbelievable one shot sequences and the scenery of war life was really captivating.It just is a great piece of art.The only critic I have is that the characters should have had more development between each other; Both leading roles played by Dean-Charles Chapman ( Lance Corporal Blake) and George MacKay ( Lance Corporal Schofield) were great, but i definitely needed a little more inside story between both soldiers, even so with Blake's brother, but it left me on this journey with these men but not entirely caring for the characters all that much - for the simple facts I didn't feel the close bond as much as I perhaps could have.Again the continuous shot worked tremendously, I couldn't tell where the film had actually cut, and just made it for a mesmerizing experience.This will win awards at the Oscars for sure - don't think it will for screen play though or best film, but definitely for cinematography.Rating: 3.8/5 / 8/10"
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"Like other reviews all say..This is a GREAT movie . There are a few drawn out scenes but they are necessary to keep the emotion moving in same direction .
Will Schofield and Thomas Blake have to get to the other side of the battlefield to save the battalion from a trap . Blake's brother is a Lieutenant , which is why he was selected as inspiration to make the dangerous trek .
The Oscars will most likely award Best Picture , Best Sound editing, Best Cinematography and maybe a couple of other technical awards seeing it was filmed in ONE take .
Spoilers *Who milked the cows in the Farm scene?
When he delivered the message , there were mortar shells killing the Trench soldiers and when McKenzie signaled stand down, how did the enemy receive the same order as peace and quiet emerged immediately .
?"
1917,10 February 2021,1/10,"They pull an Germah pilot from a burning airplane (believable), then one soldier wanders away, leaving his buddy alone with the enemy (unbelievable)Soldier on a mission of utmost importance has a sensitive, almost romantic moment with pretty girl.None of the Germans can hit the target our hero presents to themOur hero carries a 10 round ""short mag"" Enfield rifle. He takes lots of shots, but we never see him change his magazine.After our hero dispatches two Germans in hand to hand combat, he walks on, leaving his rifle behind.He is knocked on his butt by a close-range shot, but somehow comes to and continues on his march, as though the enemy was shooting bricks from his weapon."
1917,22 February 2020,8/10,"There were only two soldiers going from a location of their division to another distant division. The way is not a short one. And you don't know when it will be over. Several fights with the enemy are not full-scale batlles, but instead encounters with a single soldiers, who are still an enemy. When one of two friend wounds his hand and then puts it into a dirty wound of a corpse, I thought that he will be suffering from sepsis later in the film, however, he just washed it and put a bandage around it. Then when the bomb blasted in the tunnel, I thaught ""here we go, I'll see action now"". No way. It was just a stanalone explosion. The one who wounded his hand layed below the bricks and seemed to be dead, but his friend helped him. Later it was he who was killed by an enemy. Surprisingly several alied soldiers appeared. Summarising, the film was interesting and has suspense. Brilliant performance from Colin Firth."
1917,11 February 2020,7/10,"I've seen many war movies and documentaries. This one in the end left more to be desired. Starts off strong but fizzles due to a weak screenplay and uninspiring lead acting. I just didn't feel enough for the characters when the movie would appear to be based on emotional character development. Furthermore, while cinematically pleasing, it lacked authentic scenes like the battle of Ramelle. Worth a watch however."
1917,1 September 2021,8/10,"I like stories like this based on hazardous journeys, from the Odyssey onwards. The scenery of the ""front"" is amazingly well done, and the characters realistic - ordinary guys, not John Waynes. I was gripped by the menace all through.However there were some very unrealistic moments. He falls in a river that looks like the Anduin in the Lord of The Rings and goes down a high waterfall like the Falls of Rauros - in Northern France? More likely a sluggish stinking canal.Then he comes across a guy singing to soldiers who are so attentive and motionless that at first I really thought they were dead men propped up. Squaddies? Seriously?And then our messenger, needing to get through, argues like a nutter with everyone and their dog that ""The attack must be stopped!!"" when all he needed to say, and would say, was that he carried orders from HQ - that would have been perfectly customary."
1917,29 March 2020,3/10,"The filming sequences, acting and set builds were great. The rest unfortunately was not. I can see that a lot of people liked it, and I imagine if I were to ignore everything except how pretty the movie is, I could of too. But I couldn't ignore the continuous improbabiltities and finished theovie really disappointed with the writing. It seems they had a great idea to make a visually striking film, but didn't put as much effort is the actual story itself."
1917,29 April 2021,10/10,This was brilliantly done.Some scenes are very gripping. There is extreme urgency.
1917,2 September 2020,6/10,"The movie starts off at just the right pace, the main characters set off into no mans land and quite frankly it's nail biting. Everything looks perfect, he'll on earth. But it kinda stalls, it never really gets going. I'm probably quite shallow, but I wanted a major battle. However it's not that sort of story. This is a drama, it tells an impressive but ultimately unfulfilling story from the point of view of the main characters. I feel obligated to like it more than I did, but I was left a little disappointed."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"This film amazing the way it is all done in one take and never cuts is a technical showcase of how a film can be done.
As for the film it's self it is a intense war film that in my option is better than black hawk down and the acting is impressive to say the least.
Would highly recommend!"
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"First off, this is NOT a war film. It is a movie about the bond of men in war. It is by far the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. At first I was eager to see the one shot idea Sam Mendes went into this with but, after awhile, I stopped paying attention to that. While everything about the movie was well done I was so caught up in the two central characters that nothing else mattered. I will watch this again and again."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"After seeing trailers and reading other reviews, I was determined to watch this new movie in cinema. And it did not disappoint a single bit; I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. Mendes creates an ultra-realistic piece of cinema by filming in what seems to be one shot and giving the viewer the feeling he is part of the protagonists mission. It's a two hour rollercoaster through the dirty trenches of France, with not a single moment to take a breath. A gift from the Gods for the movie enthusiast, but also a thrilling experience for even the strangers of cinema.It remembered me a lot of Dunkirk, with similar claustrophobic feelings, by showing not only the true horror of war but also the pure loneliness it brings with it. The fear to die alone, to become a forgotten name, to become a meaningless casualty in a meaningless war. The film is so realistic that it often feels you're watching a documentary. The cinematography is a pure pleasure for the eyes; the glowing mist in the French hills, every detail is right, every expression and action of the extra's are right; I could go on forever, but long story short; Oscar Winner for best film 2019. And just in time released to make it a contender for one of the best movies of the last decade, if not off all times. Trust me, I'm not exaggerating. It's a true masterpiece.I highly recommend to watch the Peter Jackson documentary 'They Shall Not Grow Old', which also gives a great insight in the First World War. A war that is often over shadowed by WWII. Not only by cinema, but also by general knowledge. Not many people actually know how horrible the dirty, muddy trench war was from 1914-1918.
A high praise for Mendes to bring this world changing event so realistically to life, something that happened more than hundred years ago, but should never ever be forgotten."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"It seems stupid to state but there was a war before the Second World War. How much do we know about it? When was the last successful film that was made about the subject? I struggle to name any. Sam Mendes looks to change that in his First World War thriller 1917.Unflinching, that is the word I would use to best describe 1917, it is a movie that doesn't care if you want to see what is on screen or not. You are going to watch all the same. It is horrible, painful and most of all beautiful.The entire point of any war film is to relate to an audience the deeper impact of what we see on screen. In this way their ultimate tool is tension. If you can keep the tension high in a wartime drama you are onto a winner. I could widen that viewpoint and say that is the goal of most films is to successfully deliver tension. This is something Sam Mendes has a speciality in. He knows what buttons to press and when to do so.It is quite an achievement to direct two of the most successful James Bond films ever and afterword make a film that is seen as ambitious and your masterpiece. This is where we find 1917, in a gap that we weren't even aware of in our minds, before the new instalment of the mega-blockbuster James Bond and in the lull of Christmas is this powerhouse of a compelling drama based around two soldiers with a singular mission in mind.When the film opens we are given around 5 minutes to settle ourselves into both the setting and the shooting style before we (not unlike our characters) are thrown headfirst into the first world war and all the horrors that it entails, this is an uncompromising vision of the real-life events which happened in a war that has forever been overshadowed by its sequel.Every single moment of 1917, every second and element is all used to elevate the pressure. From the music to the directing and cast, all of it has one goal in mind. To make us never relax. In the entire 2 hours run time, we are given only 2 periods of rest, matching up with our protagonists. Both of which end up giving us deeper anxiety, we want the characters to complete their task, and we want it now.I could pull out any number of sequences of 1917 as highlights but I will opt for just one, which is seen in part in the trailer when one of the 2 leads is seen running towards the camera and other soldiers are running across, that one sequence, when put in context, brought me to near tears alone. That is the power of this movie.I would be mistaken not to bring up how the conscious choice of camerawork gives 1917 it's shape and style, which when paired with the subtle but haunting score by Thomas Newman gives us the overall tone of the film. Blend those two titans with actors of unknown talent and cameos by A list brit talents put it in a grinder with girt, blood and regret, serve it up in an unclean cup and that is what 1917 feels like to watch. I say watch, I mean to endure.1917 is an unstoppable tour de force of the harrowing and traumatic nature of war. This is a film that will be on my top 10 of the year come to the end and more importantly should be on yours too.10 camera cuts out of 10"
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"It is rated 18! Besides the swear word, there isn't much to the expose. The cinematography wins all by hand down. CGI usually infested in futuristic non-fictional movies.. But this is an old time war movie. Given to the facts that the wars zone was not too complicated, the bomb craters and casualties are pretty much ""standard"" so it is really up to how good the stage composition and the 2nd unit director could beef up the jobs to the best possible, and they done it very well. Movie score by Thomas Newman is another superb element in the film. The score rallies so well in pace with the movie mood and the score is the connecting dots that keep my focus throughout the entire movie."
1917,22 January 2020,6/10,"...is what I thought when the movie ended. Because this is what a cartoon about WWI would be like. Flat, one dimensional characters, a plot simple enough for a quick read, bad guys who are all slimy traitors (they stab you when you go pull them out of their own burning downed plane), and the traditional finish where the hero pulls off the difficult task. Think ""Saving Private Ryan"" with robot like, forgettable soldiers, accompanied by very loud soaring music to alert you of the upcoming shooting scene. I really wanted to like this movie but found it mediocre in all respects. Bah."
1917,31 January 2020,2/10,Underwhelming movie. Not accurate depiction of the time and the scene where he runs away from enemy fire in the middle of open city is just so phony.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I always would think to myself that if I were in the shoes of the men that fought and died for us during the first and second World War's, I would've been one of the brave ones. Someone that would've charged out of a trench or a foxhole without hesitation to take down the enemy. Someone that would instantly lay down his life so others could live on. This film really makes me think twice about what I would've done in those horrid times. As this is the finest example of a military related film I have seen in the last 22 years, you feel like you are there along side those unfortunate souls standing in the trenches. Its terrifying. There were 4 moments in particular where I found myself not being able to take a breath, frozen in fear of what was going to happen next. This is all thanks to the GOAT himself, Roger Deakins. If he doesn't pick up his second academy award this year i'm going to petition it as a crime against humanity. This movie is complex on so many other levels though. The set design is astounding. Another oscar i'm sure this film will pick up. Directing was top notch (I admit i had my doubts about Sam Mendes because of Spectre but he has completely redeemed himself on every level) and I can see Medes picking up his first oscar this year. If you're a person that loves military films like myself, you'll love this movie. If you're a person that hates military films, you'll still love this movie. It definitely leans more to the side of anti-war, as I don't think anyone can say the events that transpired during the 19-teens had any bit of positivity after viewing this film. Death and destruction is what you'll see unfold before you instead of bonds being made between men like most war films showcase. I can't wait to go see this film again. I doubt were going to receive a WWI piece like this again anytime soon."
1917,18 February 2020,,"A fully immersive experience. Long shots are used masterfully, and near seamlessly through out the movie. The planning of such an endeavour is done meticulously by Sam Mendes the director, yet leaving enough space for the unplanned and organic performace of the masterful performance of George Mackay and the natural setting/context he performs in. The different forms of natural 'motion' coming out of the unplanned and planned simultaneously tell you a story that couldn't have been told otherwise. Every motion of a head...the eyes...the camera...the light...the body stance...the trees that appear to play an important role in the movie...all together... you lose yourself in. That rich experience and how it revolves around one character brings out even more personal details from each audience member's personal life that then complements the already vivid experience making it even more emmersive.In that respect 1917 is everything Dunkirk was not.Where Dunkirk was a low-res generic overview of a situation including a large number of people...1917 is a hi-res focused image of an incedent of fewer people shown through the point of view of one person. This brings out the gritty, heroic and agonizing details of war, presented with masterful real time long shots that grip your attention relentlessly through out the movie."
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,I won't say what's good in this movie because there are countless things. I will just say what I didn't like. I didn't like the filler/bonding moments and the part with the plane and the way the soldier is killed. It was too fake and happened just so as to dramatise the end of the movie. The scenario was too weak and they should have worked it better so that the soldier would die more organically.
1917,17 March 2020,9/10,"1917 war movie is exceptional in all respect. Storyline, photography, set design, acting, music, in all. Thanks,Dhaka. Bangladesh"
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,"If you have patience to sit in a theater for a long, slow, meaningless dialogue movie, then this is your type. If you expect to see a movie with war scenes, the don't waste your time nor money. This is a very slow and boring movie, probably the worst war movie we ever seen, we just can't wait for it to end."
1917,7 February 2020,6/10,"A decent war film that similarly to Birdman looks like it was filmed in one continuous take. The few issues that stem from that are that at times it begins to feel more like a video game cut-scene than a movie, and essentially limits it to being set in real time (with a lot of long walking scenes). The one-continuous-shot thing begins to feel like more of a gimmick than a storytelling tool at times. However the visuals keep the majority of scenes interesting and there are a couple of pretty breathtaking shots."
1917,20 June 2020,9/10,"1917 is one example why film making is considered an art form. This movie will not give you the Avengers type action, or the war scenes from A Bridge Too Far. Instead, the movie decides to let you join on an incredible quest, alongside two regular blokes. It does so by making you feel claustrophobic when they do, feel tired when they do and feel pain when they do. I've seen a few reviews (still positive), stating its biggest flaw is the lack of a more complicated story. But I believe that those reviews have missed the point of the story. War is not about complication; it's about regular people meeting one another and sometimes they are on your side, sometimes they are not. It's about normal people, like you and me, being part of something abnormal.The symbolism in this movie is incredible and it'll take hold of you, consciously or subconsciously. The link between No Man's Land-death and danger as far as the eye can see, and nothing more-and Purgatory is easily made. The inferno in the city Écoust, where there's only enemies, darkness and fire is the absolute depth of Hell. But the strongest connection might be at the very end.Where the remaining character finds himself with the sun gracing his face, the peaceful field reminds you of the beginning and the single tree that stands there, where he will sit and rest deservedly, is a mirroring image of where he and his friend began their journey. They started in what seemed to be Heaven and they walked through Hell. Only one made it through to the other side, but a part of him (his friend, the one who saved his life) never did-emphasized by the fact that the tree is hollow.He walked through Hell. And back."
1917,28 May 2020,7/10,Nice movie nice locations and scenes but not something i said wow... Just overrated
1917,8 May 2021,10/10,"What an amazing mover, the most fantastic movie in years, stunning to say the least. Heroes can be everywhere."
1917,22 January 2020,7/10,"What a beautiful made movie... just wished they had put more effort into the story.20 min of excitement, but then it slows down the rest of the movie, and it's just a poor and lazy writing job.I will give them credit for the way it was filmed, that's an Oscar worthy.But no wear near the league of film like; Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, The Thin Red Line, Stalingrad or one random episode of Band of Brothers.Again, the script is way to poorly written, to even come close to War movies like those above."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,This was the best movie I watched in 2019 and one of the best war drama movies I have ever seen
1917,8 September 2021,10/10,"Nice story, engaging screenplay, gorgeous visuals, flawless cinematography, epic music,and great ending......what else do you want in a movie."
1917,26 March 2020,10/10,"I can't even comprehend what I just saw. It's a dirt-stained bloody nightmare interspersed with pure glorious splendor. The sound track is absolutely beautiful and horrifying all at the same time. After it was all over the main menu screen started blaring the restless soundtrack again and for sleep's sake I had to shut it off, it's now terrifying nature too much to face as it was echoing through my mind.War film fans. Movie fans. Any fans. Watch this."
1917,6 April 2020,7/10,"For me, 1917 was good, but some aspects took me out of the film.Likes: (i) The cinematography. (ii) The first part the movie, until the German plane crashes.Dislikes: The German plane literally crashes on the exact spot where the two protagonists (Brit 1 and Brit 2) are. I thought: ""What is the probability of that happening?"" ""Nearly zero,"" I thought.The two Brits save the German pilot from being burned alive, and what does the German do? Stabs and kills Brit 1, only to be shot dead by Brit 2.Why was the milk left in the pail? What happened to the person who milked the cow? Did the Germans do 'something' to that person? Brit 2 filled his canteen with milk -- important for a later event.Germans killed lots of cows, just for the fun of it. I guess their withdrawal was too hasty to commandeer them for food. Such barbaric people.A few moments later, Brit 2 kills a sniper and becomes unconscious. Then, the entire movie seemed to become visually surreal, like it was a dream. I thought, ""Is this a dream? It must be.""I pondered: ""What are the chances of Brit 2 stumbling into the hiding place of a woman with a baby that is not hers? It must be a dream."" The baby can't yet eat solid food. Thank goodness for the milk from before!Brit 2 encounters a German soldier, and the German seems to agree to not shout out, but the German shouts out, leading to the German's death. During the struggle, the German's comrade is literally just meters away, oblivious to what's going on.Did the British Army have colonial soldiers (e.g., South Asian, African/Blacks) mixed in with regular white British soldiers? Is that true or a rewriting of history?The way the Germans were depicted reminded of old propaganda movies: they are cruel, murderous, and/or stupid. The booby trap in the cave left the feeling that the Hun was devious and barbaric.Do people realize that it was the humiliation of the German people (inflicted by the Allies after WWI) that led to WWII? Humiliation is one of the strongest -- if not the strongest -- of human emotions. Have you forgotten the time(s) you were badly humiliated?1,600 British lives are in peril, and the General sends only two runners to warn them? I am not an expert on WWI, but given that it was a dangerous mission, if I were the General, I would have sent two teams of two, each independently and ignorant of the other team. There were British planes; why not send a runner to the airfield with the written orders, pass the orders to the airfield commander, who would then have a pilot fly to near where endangered troops are, and deliver the written orders? Does anyone have a horse they can spare or commandeer?How is it that the two guards cannot stop Brit 2 from entering the command post? They don't know his intentions -- he could have been an insane man intent on killing the officers!I could list many more aspects that gave me pause, but I'll stop here.Because the movie tried so hard to depict the harsh and brutal 'realities' of war, I would have preferred to not have to ""suspend my disbelief"" so many times."
1917,9 May 2021,9/10,"We'll deserved award for Cinematography
This movie is beautifully Made with Lovely landscape
And the story is good too , all actors played their parts accordingly.A good movie."
1917,29 April 2020,7/10,This movie made something new by showing how unimportant war was. The other character gets stabbed to death even the real war has started out for him because in a war situation British youth always helped the germans. And then got stabbed to death for being naive of course.It made the war look very pathetic. I even started to think about military leaders as so incapable in the real world that the only artificial system they are able to live inside is a stupid and artificial war time construction called the army.And just how pathetic the whole world war was. Not to mention wars of today.
1917,6 February 2020,3/10,"I suspect many of the positive reviews are not impartial or by reviewers who missed Full metal jacket, Dunkirk, Platoon, All quiet on the Western Front (1930) etc etc.One of the biggest problems with this film is the two young protagonists. Both boys are very forgettable and lack any kind of gravitas to carry a film on the big screen. As a result it's very hard to care about them and their video game like quest. Though this problem is not entirely their fault.The script is run of the mill (didn't people curse in those days?).The director doesn't employ necessary dramatic close ups to break the mundane midshot. We don't effectively see their blood, sweat, tears and the horror or determination in their eyes. Also the panoramic shots aren't particularly panoramic. The scale of the battle fields and surrounding areas are poorly filmed. The cinematography as a whole wasn't up to the scale of story.At the end of the film one gets the sense you've just sat through a long YouTube video of mice in a maze with a few fx thrown for fun. However, this film could be a very good two part BBC miniseries."
1917,9 February 2020,1/10,"Okay first of all it's better than 1 star but as of the stupid, pathetic HIGH rating had no choice but to try even it out with the worst rating possible. This film is slow, full of plot holes, characters that no one could like, not enough action, sort of like a made for tv Sunday night film. High Drama crap. As for the plot itself well Spielberg did it a million times better. This is artsy-fartsy type crap, that the snobs an the critics lap up."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,Nothing else needs to be said - this is a perfect movie.Watch it and thank me later.
1917,21 January 2020,6/10,"The story is so clear and so straight, that the movie loses its entertainement factor and has only marginal surprising elements in it.It was clear that one of two soldiers brings the message to the targetIt was clear that the story has something like a happy endingIt was clear that the movie has some traumatic scenes in it"
1917,21 January 2020,6/10,"As a movie portraying a small slice of WWI ... probably a 9
As a movie for entertainment ... for me, a 6. Why?Because scene after scene was nothing but walking... walking for minutes on end through trenches ... walking for minutes on end through a field... walking up to a tree... walking walking walking but wait! A little running thrown in ...Was the story compelling? Enough, yes. Was the acting good? Yes. Sets and production? All fine. But the overlong scenes of walking were SO long they took me out of the story. I felt like story time was being consumed unnecessarily.At first (in the first long walking sequence) I kept thinking ok, it's gonna end now... then when it didn't... and didn't... and didn't... I thought ok, they want to make sure we get the experience of WWI and these soldiers in their trenches... how it was for them... but it went on for way too long in too many scenarios throughout the entire movie, not just in trenches, but everywhere they went. This movie would have been 45 minutes shorter with the walking cut down in each case to clearly make the point, while not making it overbearing.I would not recommend this movie to anyone but a WWI enthusiast for that reason."
1917,8 February 2020,9/10,"1917
War films often have a massive cast, which means you're likely meet a few actors who don't quite have the chops. This is not one of those movies, everyone adds something to each scene, even if it's only for a brief moment. The choice of using a relative unknown like George MacKay in the leading role worked a treat. He hit the ground running (figuratively and literally) and not once did he take a break. Making the whole experience feel much more believable. That is until the celebrity cameos jump out at you and shout 'Hey I'm a famous actor!"". Although acting well, they often burst the bubble briefly but MacKay swoops back in to ground the audience.The whole movie is shot to make it look like it was filmed in one take. Now, this will divide audiences. For some, it will make them feel fully immersed in the world, for others it will remind them that there's a cast of thousands behind the camera. For me it was a mixture of both and I loved it.I felt as though I was on a Tolkien-like adventure, in a strange world, meeting new travellers and battling evil. Although not as long as The Lord Of The Rings, it could have done with tightening towards the back half as it tended to linger on moments just a fraction too long. These are minor flaws in an otherwise amazing film.
One to see in the cinema, not only for the experience but a least you'll know what everyone is banging on about come Oscar time.
NickWatch It Wombat"
1917,1 June 2020,9/10,"Well if you are interested you can go with those guy and witness history first hand.
Of course the movie has minuses and the story drags along from time to time with implausibility and even sheer ignorance but the overall experience is as close as we'll get to what happened there, until at least the holospace will be invented."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"While much has been said regarding 1917's achievements behind the camera, from its ""one scene"" structure to its astounding cinematography, I was pleased to find its technical feats in full service of its story. Director Sam Mendes' decision to limit the camera to ""zero"" cuts effectively forces audiences to remain with the films two young protagonists, no matter how bleak their journey becomes. 1917 is ultimately a triumph of cinematic storytelling; a sobering meditation on a generational loss of innocence and the true cost of war."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Beautiful film, admirable cast. Most of all, I admired the entrancing cinematography that really pushed the adrenaline further as I kept watching. It gave the film a sense of urgency and the inevitable passing of time and events that can't be controlled or stopped. The accompanying soundtrack delivered very well, but I also found myself loving certain scenes of pure silence where it almost felt safe. This film is one hundred percent worth the watch. 10/10"
1917,23 February 2021,10/10,"I didn't really know anything about this movie before watching it. I knew it was going to be a war movie, but that's about it. So, once I was sitting there and realized, ""this movie seems to be in only ONE shot!?"" I was truly blown away!Not only a technical masterpiece, but a truly great story!"
1917,6 February 2020,4/10,"Didn't know anything about the movie untill I saw it because I wanted to be suprised, but I wasn't.. Not once.. When it's filmed like this you should have thought that you got closer to the main characters, but you really don't. I didn't feel nothing when one of them died, I Just got angry that someone would force someone with a deep stab wound in their abdomen to stand up, and not knowing to put real pressure on the wound.. Did they really do this in 1917? Didn't they know any better? Someone please enlighten me, because I really wanna know. Also the explotion was too stupid..they would have been blown to pieces. It was interesting to see how a war scene could look like, but the dead ppl and horses, didn't really affect me at all. It feels more like you're playing a videogame. I also get frustrated that I don't see the hole picture, and sometimes I Just don't understand whats going on, because our vision is so limited. I also was really dizzy and unwell after the movie, but just because of the filming, not the plot. And the scene with the girl and baby I simply didnt understand. Shes not hiding, with the perfect fireplace just beside all the germans.. When his head hurts i imagined that ut was really bad and she had to push things back in place, but suddenly the injure didnt matter anymore, because of a baby.. I mean the movie is 2 hours long, and they use maybe one minute in total putting pressure on their wounds.. And when he finally gets there, the signing soldier was supposed to bring up feelings? I mean, you have an important message, and u cant just tap someone on their shoulder straight away to let them know.. And couldn't someone help him deliver it? But suddenly he goes from zombie to superhero and runs like hell.. He's the first one to get up, but no one shoots at him.. And when he miraculous finds the brother, still you have no emotions to this.. And im a big empath and can Even cry during commercials, but this movie couldn't bring upany real emotions, and leaves us just as emotionless as the main character.. If that was the idea behind, its brilliant, making us feel like emotionless soldiers being used to all that, but I really dont think it was?!? Would never have finished this movie had I seen it at home, was just bored, dizzy and left with many questions about wounds, lol."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,"I hate war films, find them morbid and depressing. This one however from start to finish was amazing. I was glued to this all the way. The story is fantastic, made me cry a few times. You will not be disappointed. Acting is A******"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"Worthwhile watching.
Can't really complain. But it lacked something that made me connect 100%
Plus there were a couple details in scenes which did not add up
Will it receive awards? Yes especially for the cinematography.
Will it be one one those movies everyone sees? Probably
But will it be remembered as a 100 % masterpiece?
Well... you decide"
1917,28 May 2020,9/10,"1917 is very different to other war films like the Longest Day as the film focuses on two Lance Corporals who are given the impossinle mission to deliever a message to another regiment to ensure the safety of the regiment. 1917 makes the war feel a lot more personal as the whole film is shot stunnigly to make it look like one whole shot throughout the whole movie. You can really see the devastation of the war and how it effects different soldiers.Only negtative with the film is it lacks some of the action that soldiers would of have seen in the mission and the plot feels a bit rushed in the second act.
But Sam Mendes directed this so well, Roger Deakins did such a great job with cinematography and the cast was so good especially George Mckay. Please watch this film it's so worth it ."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Ignore the critics and the dumb ones who say it's too long. Since when is a film at 119 (that's 1 minute shy of two hours) considered long??? You people are simply impatient.Great camera work and the mission to get the message delivered by a couple brave soldiers under their duress and obstacles is the highlight of this masterpiece. Set in the year 1917 and during WWI, this is a must see!Best war film since Heartbreak Ridge and Platoon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1917,22 January 2020,6/10,"Visually the movie is great, I would give 8/10. But the story feels like it's been told so many times before. Me and my friend watched it and couldn't stop comparing it to Lord of The Rings, where we also have a story of two friends going through hell to deliver something to save lives (in 1917 it was a message). I definitely recommend this movie for its visual effect but I wish the director had a better story to tell."
1917,1 March 2020,7/10,Immersion and tension in incredible shooting. But the drama is lacking.
1917,26 January 2020,,"Really enjoyed the film, but since moustaches were mandatory in the British army until 1916, I definitely expected to see a lot more facial hair in it. Most men were cleanly shaved. But that obvious fluke aside, I think it was a great movie"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"A mystifying experience, one that'll leave you yearning for just a little bit more of a lore set 103 years before our time. There's not much dialogue in the film yet the movie speaks a thousand languages, transcending through space and time reminding us of a time that was far from perfect yet still so perfect in so many ways. I seriously don't have words for this film so go out there and see it for yourself.One of a kind
10/10"
1917,9 February 2020,3/10,"Making things hard for yourself as a director with technical stunts and virtuoso shots does NOT make your film better.If your self-imposed one-take forces you to make a movie that is both unrealistic and wildly boring, maybe you shouldn't have used it."
1917,6 April 2020,9/10,"Immersive battlefield experience, a mirror in the end of the war. If you don't finish, you'd rather die!"
1917,25 April 2020,9/10,"1917 in my opinion is one of the best world war 1 films, i have this view on the film as it has used a very unique throughout the whole film where the camera has not to have been cut once through the use of editing and this is as they follow the two soldiers through there long and hard journey to get the other 1st battalion to warn them of a trap that they are about to fall into by the German front line. By using this type of cinematography it has meant that the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat throughout the entire film as they follow the two men from the moment the film begins. This film got all of the awards that it deserved and can be seen in how hard they worked to make this film, it is truly amazing and i would watch over again and again."
1917,21 May 2020,8/10,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Its gritty, charming, sad, Inspiring, thought provoking, gut wrenching, and triumphant.
Sometimes when a movie gets down to the ""meat & potatos"" of action/suspense, it tends to either sacrifice character build or go on for hours. This is not the case with this movie.
I'll admit there were a few parts where I scratched me head; trying to figure out what the lead character was doing...but overall it was a Rollercoaster of emotions.
I was entertained from start to finish; & satisfied with majority of my questions answered.
I didn't feel like the filming was theatrical. But rather felt that certain liberties taken, were entirely plausible.
But be prepared to cringe, scream in frustration, cry from sorrow AND happiness.and don't be surprised if, at the end of the movie, you find you just need to sit in silence and compartmentalize everything you just watched."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"This, quite possibly, is the best made, directed and acted film I have seen in ages. The one shot filming technique was phenomenal, it put the audience right there with the characters and it felt as we were actually part of the film. The music score was a perfect undertone and built to a crescendo at the peak of angst. I highly recommend this film and if it wins Best Picture, etc, it deserves it!!!!"
1917,26 December 2020,9/10,"Nothing short of a masterpiece, a well acted atmospheric thrill ride all the way"
1917,27 September 2020,9/10,"Absolutely the best film in 2019 in the diricting
........."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"The Oscars are coming closer - and with them, the more demanding films in the cinema are also piling up. With ""1917"" Sam Mendes presents after JARHEAD again a highly interesting war movie. The First World War is raging, British troops want to attack the German troops, who are supposedly in retreat, when suddenly the British headquarters learn that it is actually an ambush. Two young soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), receive the order to warn their comrades. A race against time begins, which Mendes shows without a visible cut. The aesthetics are not accidentally reminiscent of video games: Through the gaming theme, the film can tell a lot about the nature of cinema, computer games and war."
1917,25 February 2021,5/10,The film is pretty much average in every way. It overused its music. The makeup is really good except for some reason the main characters look clean while everyone else looks like they were in a war. The story was really shallow and it felt like the distance these characters had to travel was not very far due to the one take shooting style. One take cinematography can work really well (Ex. Birdman) if it feels like it adds to the film instead it just comes off as a gimmick for this film and doesn't add to an already shallow film with nothing new to say.
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,"Technically it's superb. The storyline is simple and yet effective but nothing that we haven't seen before.
What truly fails is the development of characters: they lack depth, texture, transformation.
If the Academy will award this movie will be a big flaw, except that they do it for political reasons IE plain propaganda.
Don't get me wrong the movie is ok and rather enjoyable. Just average."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"In awe of this movie. An absolutely immersive experience that has you tense and gripped from the moment it begins and carries you with it throughout, it will stay with me for a long time. So ultra realistic, even in simple terms the muddy boots slipping as the two make their way across no man""s land brings home the realities. George Mackay's performance shouldn't be underestimated, you can't take your eyes off him and yet it never felt anything but honest and real, never caught ""acting' he's just simply wonderful, he needs nominating for what looks like sheer endurance and beauty and pureness of performance. Other names too are great. But also the music, direction and Roger Deakins had left me stunned. Roger/Sam must win the Oscars. Beautiful, poignant, inventive, just amazing. Can't fault it and can't stop thinking about it either. Sam Mendes has produced something very special."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"This is one of those very rare occasions when after the movie is finished, I just sat in the theater and repeating ""wooow!"" over and over again. I went to see it twice so far. Just amazing!
This movie is flawless. I don't give out 10 out of 10 stars but this piece of art deserves it. Just simply fantastic! Every second on screen deserves full attention, you can't take a break from it and you don't want to.Probably the greatest film shooting and editing masterpieces ever made, even better than Birdman in my opinion, Roger Deakins get ready for that Oscar statue! Mr. Newman's music puts you in the mood with the story, fantastic script and acting from every major character and extras. Do yourself a favor: just go and see it on the big screen. You won't regret it!"
1917,4 April 2020,9/10,Midway fails miserably in comparison to this film. Every part of this movie is detail oriented and meticulously put together. Sam made another great piece of art.
1917,6 December 2019,9/10,"1917 is Sam Mendes second foray into the war genre. Ah yes, you forgot about Jarhead didn't you... After 2005's Jarhead, which I myself loved, 1917 is a hugely ambitious step up for Mendes. He has to be commended for using this 'one shot' technique for what seems to be it's perfect use.
.
Believe the hype. 1917 is this years Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Dunkirk. It's 100% fitting that it's in the conversation surrounding these war greats.The use of the one shot technique for this type of film is genius, as it completely immerses you in the action with little reprieve. Seemingly menial moments like following these two young men walking through the trenches is enthralling & captivating. This is also superbly elevated by the pitch perfect score that is coursing through the veins of the film. Honestly, the score is impeccable, goosebumps a plenty... and the Oscar for best score goes to Thomas Newman, 1917. Then there's Roger Deakins cinematography. Need I say more. It's stunning from start to finish, with some scenes very reminiscent of 2049.
.
Let's get some minor flaws out of the way. Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen from GOT) was the wrong casting for this one. A) he's a little too chubby for this role. It's even eluded to at the start there is no food around, yet Blake looks very well fed. Chapman also doesn't nail some of the important scenes, which takes some of the emotional punch away from them. The only other thing to mention might be the fact the Germans can't seem to aim to save their lives. It did start to feel a little hard to believe at times.
.
George MacKay does a wonderful job as the lead. He hits all the right notes of emotion and intensity. There's also a bunch of great cameo appearances spread throughout the film, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Andrew Scott in a great little scene where a few smiles are to be had.
.
1917 is a movie that demands to be seen on the big screen, the biggest screen. It's definitely one of the best films of the year, and an amazing effort in cinema."
1917,11 June 2020,10/10,Didn't disappoint. Very happy I watched it. The one shot aspect added to the anxiety and the on edge feeling.
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,"I'M GLAD I HAD A BIG BAG OF POPCORN BECAUSE WITHOUT IT I WOULD HAVE DOZED OFF A COUPLE OF TIMES.... NO REAL CONNECTION TO THE CHARACTERS ... and it is NOT A TRUE STORY,,,, its a tale Mendes grandpa told to him when he was young"
1917,7 April 2020,,"Good film.
maybe something wrong historically but ok.
But I can not understand one thing:
Why They did not use war planes to deliver message?
instead of to use two soldiers."
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,This movie is average and cannot be mentioned alongside great movies such as Saving Private Rayan. Good performance from George MacKay!
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,This movie is a Masterpiece. The one shot concept worked very well as you feel like you are there with them and somewhat sharing in the experience. Sam Mendes and the rest of the cast and crew really did a marvelous job with this piece of art.
1917,19 March 2021,9/10,"I'm proud that I have watched this movie. That's how good it is. The take on modern cinematography is very unique and thrilling, everything fits perfectly and beautifully."
1917,17 October 2020,9/10,I really enjoyed this film the cinematography is amazing and the music really adds to the suspense! If you're looking for a gore fest this isn't it which some viewers have complained about quoting saving private ryan. This is a completely different film centred around 2 messengers.Would of gone the whole hog and given it 10 stars but felt some of the special effects let it down
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,This movie represents the outmost of Sam Mendes and his screenplay and cameras. This movie shows artistic scenes when it comes to the war zone created and manipulated by the director.On the other hand I find the story of the journey and survival good but the concentration was targeted mainly to the directing content much more than the story line. Not saying that it was low but they could have achieved more in the field of compassion and battlefields.Generally it is a masterpiece for S.Mendes. Your eyes will be amazed by this artistic paints he had given.
1917,20 January 2020,1/10,"Another movie that promote violence and weapons. It should be in the same category of the Marvel's: the way it is filmed and actioned.
It is for those who love video games, some of the renderings are pathetically designed for certain demographics.
Yes it is a war movie and the sentiments are good, unfortunately the over emphasis on blood and weapons don't justify the euphoria around it."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"From the acting through to cinematography, sound design ,costumes , sets and an amazing score from Thomas Newman everyone involved seems to have given their absolute best here . Even the rats ! On a technical level the quality is staggering . Whatever CGI there is, is always seamless and subtle and the story delivers more than it first appears . Its an exciting and emotional ride . Hats off to Sam Mendes for going the extra mile here and giving us something really unique ."
1917,1 January 2021,5/10,"*Cinematography and Production Design: 10*No need for words here. It's been said in every review. Cinematography alone makes this movie worth watching. Don't demand more from it and you might actually enjoy it.*Story: 6*Straight survival story. While quite poor, this isn't the downfall of 1917. A movie doesn't need a complex plot to grab your attention, deliver a great experience and convey a powerful message at the end.*Script: 3*This is where things start to go very wrong for 1917. The dialogues are appallingly weak. At some points i felt like i was watching a broken dub of a foreign movie. The lines are so insipid and delivered with such bad timing and conviction, that it's hard to take any of it seriously and engage with any of the characters. Everyone apart from MacKay is an extra in this movie, and a cheap one it feels. This is not necessarily a fault on the acting, but often on the directing and the script itself.
Add to that all the plot devices that were used to tell the story, like Chapman getting stabbed off-camera, a lone sniper missing all his shots against a single target 20m away, a rat triggering a tripwire at the precisest of moments like it was being radio-controlled by the Reichswehr... It's just cartoonish.*Acting: 5*This is a tough one for me. MacKay does a stellar job carrying this movie on his back. On that alone, this rating should be much higher. But Chapman is at best unremarkable and every other actor, as mentioned before, is given very little room to deliver an interesting performance and all the lines are blurted out awkwardly and unconvincingly throughout, making the entire narrative fall apart and seriously crippling whatever immersion its brilliant production could have otherwise offered."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"Enjoyable movie if only for single shot vehicle. You can see the seams if you're observant, like when the camera passes a close prop like a tree. The relationship between the two soldiers is fairly well done. Not super exciting, but worth the ticket price."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Wildly impressive. A simple story that plays like a theatre drama, the intimacy and subsequent pressure of one take keeps you holding your breathe on the edge of your seat the entire duration. MacKay and Chapman shine as they carry the emotional weight of the film like champs. Visually stunning, emotionally wrenching, and overall groundbreaking technologically. Will leave you reeling, without a doubt."
1917,6 April 2020,6/10,"...... called the Sergeant ""Sarge"". Which, no Brirish soldier ever would do, let alone a corporal, they valued they're life."
1917,28 July 2020,10/10,"""Best War Film of All-Time"" This was one of the Greatest war films I've ever seen! Heavy Praise for the Cast, Action sequences, Direction! Must see film."
1917,28 March 2020,2/10,I was very disappointed. The movie was slow and the actors had thick accents making them difficult to understand. Avoid.
1917,11 November 2021,9/10,Such a good movie. The story grips you and great buy-in to the characters with tremendous acting and great emotional sell (moves you and makes you feel like you could have been there).The camera-work and the editing and cinematography are absolutely top-top-class. This is a great and memorable movie. So good!!
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"Never seen a such a epic war movie,which capture u to it roots till end...the storryline and emotions are far beyond the masterpiece...it's amazing direction and acting makes its a much deserved roll for a Oscars.
Salute to the bravehearts..."
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,I can't deny the filming was amazing. but the action scenes were just dull and so as to the story. I can't really point out what the mistakes were but the movie was dull
1917,25 January 2020,6/10,"I usually love these type of films, but this was dull, I sat waiting for something to happen the entire film, It's just a film crying out for awards, some of the acting was dire, the action seemed forced, really disappointed.."
1917,21 January 2021,8/10,"Really good piece of TV , the camera work really impressed me the most , its as if you were there . And the sound really amazing."
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"Imagine yourself wanting to know what it's like to be in the war zone if you have never been a soldier or in war. This movie captures brilliantly the emotions, and moods of two soldiers tasked with mission of delivering a letter that can prevent a catastrophe. The urgency they face while facing dangers right in front of enemies are cinematographically shot scenes by scenes to showcase their hope which is a very dangerous thing, as said by the Colonel. Director Mendes deserves to be praised for his work and proposes us with a question: ""Is war really about the last one standing?"""
1917,9 March 2020,8/10,"All I can say is Wow. Although the movie appears to be ""slow"", that's just the storyline. We must appreciate the cinematography and the understanding of how WWI really was. Horrific and torturous and boys having to act like men.
It made me think of my Grandfather over and over which was very emotional."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"This was a great movie which lived up to the hype... mainly based upon the single continuous shot technique which puts you right there with the action. The staging and journey of the film makes it gripping, engaging and almost relentless. Sam Mendes deserves the praise for this unique directorial approach.The only criticism is the rather lame way that each of its top billed cast are introduced to the audience in identical fashion.Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Mays, Mark Strong and Colin Firth all have bit parts but appear from the back or slightly out of shot until you get the reveal ... it makes you want to wait for a someone to grab an arm from a trench and on the end of it is.... wait for it... drum roll... that bloke off of The Greatest Showman (he isn't in it by the way).Otherwise great casting and cinematography and a really good cast of extras. Certainly a must watch movie. Probably more of a 12A than a 15 but there is a bit of gore. My 13 year old daughter liked it and learned something about the pathos of WW1"
1917,29 December 2020,10/10,"But this movie was something else.really great performances, stirring music, everything you can ask for."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is truly on a whole other level from start to finish. Sir Sam Mendes has created something special with this 'one shot' movie, that will have you on the edge of your seats. I found my heart beating out my chest in some scenes and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up in others.Roger Deakins' cinematography is absolutely beautiful, combined with Thomas Newman's score, just adds to the massive scale of this film. The film has everything, action, drama, humour and emotional scenes and truly deserves all the awards it's receiving."
1917,9 September 2020,9/10,A truly gripping experience that depicts the horrors of The Great War. Roger Deakins cinematography proves yet again that he is the best in the game. A truly great film to experience and a cinematic achievement with an emotional ending and one of the best final scenes in recent cinematic history.
1917,11 February 2020,9/10,"I was super excited to see this film just from watching the trailer, hearing about it and seeing the good reviews. I hadn't anticipated any film like this for a while and well it was great, perhaps not quite as great as my too high expectations were at one point, but still very good.
Acting was mostly good, but I did find Andrew Scott's character to be a bit too cliche and the move was perhaps very slightly a bit too unbelievable at times, but not too much.
This movie was made to appear as being just a single shot and I feel like that it fit this movie very well. In the beginning it was slightly claustrophobic, but overall it was great seeing the whole journey and kind of being a part of it. The films looks amazing (cinematography is mostly fantastic) and during the final moments of the movie the white trench section just looked amazing. The running/attack scene during the final moments was very epic. I feel like I am going to have to give this movie another watch in the future to fully appreciate it, or maybe I will find more faults in it.
The score wasn't outstanding but good and the overall sound of the film was good, not deafening unlike in some other movies these days. This was a great movie."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Very well made movie in just one frame fantastic too good, this is the second best war movie after saving private ryan, will give the credit to the director"
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"This film follows a very similar structure, and that is not a bad thing at all. It feels very similar to Saving Private Ryan, sans Omaha Beach. A couple of young lads get asked to do something deathly important... save 1600 men from death (including the one boy's brother). We then watch them traverse the desolate landspace between trenches, navigate an abandoned German trench, go gallivanting across the country side, sneak through a bombed out french town, and float down a river. All while occasionally having a gun fight, interacting with other soldiers, and viewing the infamous wave of infantry ""going over"" at the sound of a whistle. This movie is fantastic, and my only complaint is the same complaint that I have about most war movies... how is the protagonist not dead? He dodges a good two dozen rifle shots by running in a straight lie away from armed infantry men, takes a bullet to his helmeted head, and nearly drowns to death. He is lucky, sure, but wow. Anyways. Go see this movie. It is fantastic. The best WWI era movie I have ever seen."
1917,4 February 2020,6/10,"Well filmed and acted and the techies certainly did a good job. However there were far too many coincidences that led to our hero's survival that were to far fetched for me. He must've made a stop at the barbers as he was very well shaved. Whilst some of the horrors of WW1 were portrayed the soldiers were far too clean. The grass was too long for that time of year. His healed very quickly. They could've dropped a message by plane. Their ears would've been shattered in the underground explosion etc etc. They made a point of giving them grenades but they were not used, especially against the sniper. And just how did the sniper get his shots to go around corners. Etc etc A good effort of a film let down badly by many flaws."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"Strong story, wonderful cinematic experience where it is one continuous shot, great dialogue (which is kept to a minimum), brilliant music. Loved it!"
1917,22 May 2020,7/10,"There is no doubt this is a very good movie. I will say something about the movie that may give something away about it, so don't read past here until you see the movie. I thought the movie there would be more fighting shown. We don't see even 1 German soldier in the film! some shooting from snipers, a downed German pilot and that was it. Most of the movie shows the young man going across the countryside , and eventually at night. Big fires all around a few people come after him and he falls into a river and is carried almost to where he needs to be. He walks up to them and knows they are who is looking for. The trenches you see and the soldiers are so real and you see a little action, but then the movie is over. So this is NOT a movie about COMBAT. Not at all. if you watch it thinking this is what you will see, you will be sadly disappointed. But otherwise the point of the movie is showing the effort that is made to stop this attack. The filming was excellent. The actors were excellent. I just wished to see some combat."
1917,21 March 2020,8/10,"What an epic movie according to performance of every crew, must not miss this movie."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Do yourself a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!
It's wonderful, it's absolutely wonderful. Please watch it on the biggest screen you can. I have nothing more to say... amazing..."
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,A can appreciate why people liked it but a was too many times bored. Just didn't connect to the character emotionally at all. Over drawing scenes with a poor plot that seems very predictable.
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"1917 is filmed as if it's one long take as we follow two British soldiers on a time sensitive mission to save 1600 men from walking into a German trap. While the cinematography and direction are Oscar worthy, the film packs no emotional punch and fails to achieve any real sense of urgency during its 2 hour run time.***SPOILER ALERT***As the movie begins there's no context regarding the state of the war, who is winning - what's at stake (strategically) if these men die at this battle. The only emotional connection you have to the 1600 men who are destined to be slaughtered (by machine guns which came of age during WWI - the script doesn't bother to paint any sort of picture for the viewer) - is that of the faceless hundreds is the brother of one of the protagonists. That's it.The two leads are fine actors but there's nothing about their characters that pops off the screen.. When the two run into danger, they're put in situations that make no logical sense. For instance, the two see a trip wire right in front of them - there's a bomb wired to go off - a rat triggers the wire HUGE EXPLOSION! Yet, of the two soldiers one isn't harmed at all (no burns, no shrapnel) and the other gets buried in debris but is left without a single burn or any shrapnel injury. Then this powerful explosion- that caused no injury to either soldier - makes the entire trench start to collapse as if it's built with dominos?Sometimes the characters are in a huge rush, and other times they take their time waxing about cherry trees and sipping unspoiled milk?? at an abandoned farm. German soldiers have the same aim as stormtroopers, yet our hero manages to shoot a sniper 100 yards away by shooting blindly.There's lots of dead bodies along the way, but Mendes isn't showing us any horrors that haven't already been seen in way too many war films. The one take style becomes distracting after about 10 minutes or so, bringing your attention more to the difficulty of the technical achievement behind the camera than the lifeless story unfolding in front of it."
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,A must see because of the history of WW2. A terrible war with many casualties.
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,Wow what a film that holds you brings you in and shows the horrors that these men faced day after day. A simply story and everything was perfect the acting the sets were amazing everything was just perfect....
1917,25 April 2020,,"My annoying wife is an annoying lefty who hates Imperialism and all decades before 1990's with a passion, this film caused me to go through a lot of annoying nagging and groaning from my wife which has made me so angry. My wife also grew very fearful of moustaches after watching this film as she now associates moustaches with 'toxic masculinity' and Imperialism so she threatened to divorce me if I didn't shave my moustache off so I had to do that which has also annoyed me a lot.Except for the nuisance from my nutcase of a wife though I thoroughly enjoyed this film, just don't watch it with a left-wing extremist."
1917,27 September 2021,8/10,As a WW1 enthousiast i'm always enthousiastic when a movie about that war comes out as there are less then about WW2. And i think i must have seen about every other WW1 movie out there. When i watch a historic movie i always look at the realism and the details of the set and costumes and i must say they did a hell of a good job with the trenches and nomansland craters. They look very realistic and accurate. Neverteless there are some things that puzzle me. Like i don't know how old that frontline is were they started but usually there were like 3 zig zag parallel trenches 1 behind the other something you can't really see. Also when they enter nomansland a couple of dead horses are used as a landmark. But how the hell do these horses die between the trench and the barbed wire. At that point there were no more cavalry attacks and for the rest the few horses they had were used for logistics or moving artillery which all happened behind the lines. So these horses have no point being there. Also when they arrive on the other side of the German lines it seems kind of strange to see all these green pastures or Almost no muddy roads the Germans could have used to transport all the iron and other materials to build their bunkers. Looks to clean to me. In their retreat the Germans used scorched earth but somehow they left a full bucket of fresh Milk lol. What i would love to see in the future is a movie about the underground war that took place with mines and contra mines.
1917,14 June 2020,9/10,"1917 delivers some stunning long shots that will take your breath away. The acting from the two leads are on point and the cameos are great as well.The reason for me not adding the last star is due to one annoying part in the movie... I was left wondering ""Why would you do that?"". I hope it has been added to give a more dramatic feel, and if so... what a pity. But this movie is def. a must watch - and most likely on a big screen!Great tribute to the fallen/heroes of WW1!"
1917,4 February 2020,1/10,"Damn, what a funny remix... 😜But to be honest: they didnt need more than one camera to make this movie - minimalism at its best.We were wondering about the kind of Oscars nominations this movie earns. Maybe ""best dialogues"". Hmmm, no. 😁"
1917,29 July 2020,8/10,"Great movie about the First World War shot in sequence shot. The plot follows two young British soldiers who are tasked with the mission of delivering a message across enemy lines and thus preventing 1,600 Englishmen from being killed in an attack.Sam Mendes the director narrates this film with great subtlety focusing on a part of the war in 1917, these two young people risking everything for the mission, the difficult and crude images, the landscapes covered in corpses all seen from these two people who The splendid photography by the great Roger deakins, establishing the moods of the protagonists, must join forces, the sound, tremendously enveloping. Morality in a war is sometimes difficult, too. Here we see at an important point in the plot how one of the soldiers has to go alone. You see and feel the pain of losing someone, we do not see random deaths without knowing who they are, and at the same time, life continues in that hell. There are many parts of this film that are marvelously cinematographic, from the quietest to the most compulsive moments.
This film was needed about a terrible war that also marked the world."
1917,17 May 2020,8/10,Nice view of world war 1 and hwo a young solider saved the army
1917,24 September 2020,6/10,"And that's the last good thing I will say about this film besides the obvious fact that the production value is amazing.1917 fails to deliver an intriguing story, instead providing us with a generic ""time is running out"" plot line. The two characters we follow throughout the film aren't even that interesting, because we know nothing about them. Sure one of them has a brother, but Mendes did not make it easy for me to get invested with the character's journey. There was not much tension from the characters. Instead the tension came from Deakens' bleak cinematography and Newman's intense score. I did not feel much for the characters. Mendes expects you to care because it's war, and not actually because he made fascinating people. So at the end of the film, there is no satisfaction that the goal was achieved. 1917 has a characterization problem. If I cared more about the characters, I would be a lot happier. But instead, all the struggles they went through didn't feel that rewarding. Additionally, there were no strong supporting roles either. Every person that wasn't our main duo felt like a cameo. I shouldn't expect to love them or even know everything about them, but when a commander is on-screen, I should feel the gravitas of his information.Overall not a great film but definitely technically solid."
1917,16 October 2020,9/10,"What a film! Great in every department, but special mention to the master of light DOP Roger Deakins!"
1917,8 December 2020,10/10,"It's one of the most accurate war movies , the actors have done a phenomenal job , u connect with the characters and fell all the emotions the director intends for you to feel . It's a must watch ."
1917,15 January 2021,9/10,"Such a terrible journey that i witnessed with the soldier , i will never forget ."
1917,10 January 2020,,"I really did not expect this - the first half was excellent - gritty, bleak and conveying a real sense of the horror and mud slogging awfulness of trench warfare. Then it descended into ridiculous melodrama spliced with mawkish sentimentality. The sense of an urgent mission sang away in the wind and when a pristine letter was finally handed over after a torrential river scene all credibility was shredded. Photos perfectly preserved in a tin box too. Mark Strong's was the only outstanding performance which was also a sad surprise."
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,"Mendes has just won the Directors Guild of America top award but I can't see why. This is a pretty ordinary WW1 drama. telling a noble story, but with an unnecessary stylistic gimmick. A lot has been said about the long take shot but these add nothing to the drama and in fact make the film look like playing a video game, partly because of the tendency to have the narrative divided into staging posts (e.g. the farmhouse, ruined town, etc.). Some lines in the script are achingly bad and at times the acting is poor. Deakins photography however is excellent as ever and not certainly because of the long takes."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"This is a solid movie. It does not squirm away from the horrors of war... Nailbiter, couldn't breath, edge of your seat fantastic movie!!"
1917,15 December 2019,9/10,"I know nothing at all about the true nature of war, but I know a lot about making films and TV as I've done it for 50 years. This film is an absolutely phenomenal undertaking. More than once I had to stop the dvd and backtrack, and more than once I failed to see how the shot was achieved. Its only competition will be from The Irishman, and maybe Once Upon... Hollywood, both of which I also loved in their own ways. 1917 is such an exquisite experiment that one forgets about everything else. But it's not just technique at work here; the performances are terrific, as is the writing. They clearly knew those has to be on par with the exploratory nature of the thing, and they were. Kudos to Sam et al."
1917,24 January 2020,3/10,"Technically speaking in terms of cinematography, 1917 is an amazing achievement, with a near flawless implementation of the highly publicized one-take illusion, and some truly gorgeous camera perspectives.Unfortunately, that effectively summarizes the near extent of the film's virtues.When matters relating to actual substance come into play, the movie embodies a redundant retread of tired war-movie clichés, improbable scenarios, and with a smattering of nationalistic propaganda thrown into the mix.Unfortunately, Sam Mendes has managed to pull every brand of ""hip"" and ""edgy"" war movie trope out of his narcissistic rear end as to delude impressionable masses into mischaracterizing this work-of-art as the greatest and ""most realistic"" war movie ever made.Thus, this film will likely wind up securing an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" a meager few weeks into the authoring of this review. But, hey, if ""Crash"" can do it and ""Forrest Gump"" can do it, so can ""1917""!First of all, the movie fails where so many others have succeeded in terms of accurately conveying the horrid conditions of trench warfare. While real soldiers of the era were forced to contend with knee-deep mud and a prevalence of rats, 1917 depicts the trenches as merely the biproduct of less-than-luxurious and minimally damp conditions, complete with make-up work that depicts British soldiers and officers as extensively well-groomed and practically ready for a ""night on the town"", so to speak. This, notwithstanding the fact that a total of about six (evidently clean and well-cared-for) rats show up in the entire movie.While barbed-wire injuries were largely deemed an ""occupational hazard"" so frequent as to motivate the majority of troops to shrug off such occurrences as meager discomforts, one of our esteemed protagonists (McKay) winds up sustaining a meager prick on his index finger and proceeds to whine about it for several minutes.The atrociously written screenplay is turgid and thoroughly superficial, replete with an overabundance of redundant observations, simplistic deductions, and such a prevalence of one-syllable words that the script could have easily been crafted by one so bombastic and inarticulate as Donald Trump.And then, there's the tired regurgitation of the ""barbaric German"" stereotype.When a luckless Albatross D.III is shot down during the course of a dogfight, the burning aircraft proceeds to crash within the immediate vicinity of our heroes, leaving these courageous British lads to epitomize the ""nobility of king and country"" by humanely extracting the German pilot from the flaming wreckage. No sooner has one of our protagonists rushed to a nearby well to fetch their esteemed adversary a pale of water than the ""sadistic Kraut"" elects to repay their generosity and selflessness by literally stabbing one of them in the back (well okay, technically in the front).The only other instance of an up-close-and-personal encounter with those ""Dastardly Boche"" embodies yet another cliched affair. In another selfless inclination to show mercy to their sworn enemies, our sole remaining hero pins a young German soldier to a concrete pillar, clamping a hand over his mouth and silently gesturing that he keep quiet to refrain from alerting his nearby compatriots. Predictably, the German soldier nods in compliance, our trusting hero removes his hand, and the double-crossing ""Fritz"" proceeds to shout ""ALARM!!"" toward his fellow comrades, leaving the British solider no alternative but to strangle him in silence.Another stupid rehash of overused World-War-I-movie tropes concerns the obligatory encounter with the helpless French peasant and her child, who inexplicably seems to be taking refuge in the confines of a long-since devastated town which appears to have been evacuated eons ago.Predictably, the two proceed to engage in sugar-coated banter through some obvious language barriers. The soldier compliments the beauty of her newborn baby. The woman gushes praise over the troop's kindness and bravery. The noble lad supplies the girl's offspring with some much-needed milk. The two exchange innocent smiles with each other. And blah, blah, blah; you know the drill.But probably the biggest disservice that this movie provides to the ""war to end all wars"" is the fact that elects to finalize on a happy ending. Had the operation failed and the British division become decimated in the wake of German deception, the film may very well have left a haunting impression on viewers that properly hammers home the tragedy and senselessness of the First World War.Speaking of the ending, the resolution in question is supplied through yet another hammy and improbable scenario, in which the exhausted hero arrives at his destination and comes face to face with the resident Colonel (Benedict Cumberbatch, doing his best Benedict Cumberbatch impression), who initially declines to read the General's explicit instructions to halt the impending offensive.""I've heard that all before!!!"", he declares in defiance.While the chain-of-command should have easily presented sufficient motivation for the Colonel to at the very least consult the orders being presented, it's ultimately a different route which finally convinces him.""Sir, it's a trap!!"", the Corporal intones, leaving Cumberbatch to turn around in perplexity.""WHATT?!!!"" he scoffs.Evidently, the Colonel seems utterly flabbergasted by the ""inexplicable"" notion that the Germans might actually be utilizing tactics (who would've thought?!!). At that point, he proceeds to snatch up the letter and shortly thereafter administers long overdue orders for his troops to stand down.While not as ""hip"" and prone to 21st century gimmicks, there are tons of WWI movies out there which are far better representations of a conflict in which so many lives were needlessly sacrificed for elusive political objectives, and most importantly emphasize the futility of this particular conflict. For a more meaningful consultation on the subject, go see ""All Quiet On The Western Front"", ""Gallipoli"", ""They Shall Not Grow Old"", ""Journey's End"", or even the 1976 aviation endeavor ""Aces High"", to name a few.All of these alternatives (and more) embody a far more meaningful dedication toward the four-year tragedy of ""the war to end all wars"" than the grotesquely overrated ""1917"", which truly epitomizes the essence of a ""style-over-substance"" flick.Feel free to gawk in amazement at the gorgeous lighting and cinematography, coupled with the visually impressive implementation of the one-shot effect. But don't be duped into the notion that this movie teaches anything meaningful about the First World War, because it doesn't."
1917,10 January 2020,1/10,I saw this last night. Wasn't expecting much and didn't get much. Very little war action. Very little plot. Just kind of went along slowly. This story could have been told in a half hour. War movies last few years have been great but this one falls way short.
1917,22 July 2020,5/10,Problems 1) All possible war movie cliches rolled are stuffed into this movie with a poor attempt at linking them together. 2) The attempts to create surreal moments are lame. 3) Rampant lack of common sense in the soldier's actions. 4) Soldiers have many grandiose near death experiences. 5) Somehow the soldiers complete a 6-8 hour trek in two hours without any attempt to provide credible ways for them to advance in between scenes. And worse yet is that the the soldiers appear to travel very short distances that should have been much further. There are much better war movies out there.
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes' Oscar nominated WWI drama ""1917"" is an amazing piece of filmmaking. This narrative following two British privates sent on an impossible mission behind enemy lines is an unforgettable cinematic experience. The production design is prodigious. The cinematography is absolutely mind-blowing. Sam Mendes is a rare talent."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"As a director Sam Mendes has created some amazing final products rich with character development on a variety of budgets - notably for this reviewer ""American Beauty"" (Estimated $15MM Budget) and ""The Road To Perdition"" (Budget $80MM) - films I both rated as 9/10.1917 (Budget $100MM) is not his best work, though it ranks as quite an achievement, nonetheless. Based on a story from Mendes' own grandfather, 1917 moves at a compelling pace and includes some surprises along the way. As an audience member, I was moved to sympathize with the protagonist, but not to really ""love"" him - because we just did not know enough about his own story, or those of the other main characters engaged. It's a shame, because the drama and the stakes of the resolution could not be higher - yet the table was not fully set for true ""transformation"". Instead, though, yes, we root for the hero, we don't truly find ourselves moved to identify fully with him or those 1600 lives at stake and more.I enjoyed the film, but was not deeply impacted by it. It's truly a missed opportunity on the 100th anniversary of WWI and the millions of stories still waiting to be told. To those who suffered during this horrific global conflict, I give all due respect. It is incumbent on us as storytellers to exploit our own skills to the fullest when given a $100 MM opportunity.My review: 7/10 stars."
1917,16 February 2020,10/10,One of the best war films ever made . The acting the storyline everything about this film is top class . I can't recommend this film highly enough superb
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"Wow. This movie is impeccable. It truly blew me away. I have never seen a movie filmed like this in my entire life and it is done so brilliantly. The entire movie is made out of one take scenes, meaning there is no cutting camera angles and editing. This strategy keeps you locked into the scenes and make you feel as if you're watching it in real time. I think this movie is legendary and probably one of the best war movies ever created."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Amazing cinematography by Roger deakins..
This is one of the best war movie.."
1917,20 January 2020,1/10,This movie could have been done in 30 minutes. Terrible waste of money and a total snooze fest.
1917,27 March 2020,5/10,"The first 10-15 minutes of this film are, in my opinion, the best... It's not interesting or exciting after that and this is coming from a huge history fan.The German army obviously consisted of 3 men and the air force only had 1 guy.
They should've cut down on some of the many fantastic actors that had pointless 5 minute appearances (if that) and paid some more extras.War Horse was a million times better."
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"The visuals and sounds are A+, but the storytelling was pretty mediocre most of the time."
1917,25 January 2020,3/10,"You know how you kind of hate Frodo (LOTR) for being such a wimp? Well instead of Frodo and Sam, this movie gives you Frodo and Frodo. Beta males getting the job done in WWI! An unlikely recreation, mostly because the movie is just scene after scene of two witless morons traversing across open plains, taking no caution or cover, chatting, giggling, and pulling each others hair like little girls while deep into unknown enemy territory. An incredible let down; don't waste your time."
1917,17 January 2020,1/10,"I get the feeling someone had the ""bright"" idea of ""HEY, lets shoot a movie and make it look like one continuous shot"" ..... ""ok, what kind of movie, whats the STORY?"", ... ""Who cares, lets just shoot a movie THAT way""The whole 'continuous single shot' , ......... BFD, if anything, it was actually distracting.
Would like to explain in greater detail/examples but spoilers.Are ppl raving about the soundtrack? cuz even THAT was unremarkable.I was expecting 'EPIC', i feel i got 'Slapped Together' relying WAY too much on a bad idea and too much emphasis on the 'continuous single shot' style."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Brilliantly shot and acted. Brought the horrors of WW1 and trench warfare better than any other film of that period I've seen. Also a beautiful score that complemented the story. I don't get why others are saying the plot was weak and they didn't buy into the story? Too many Hollywood WW2 blockbusters in their diet I think. War is horrible, men face terrible things and all for nothing. This film shows the futility of war and the incredible sacrifices soldiers endured. I think some viewers expected the kind of story where in the end it won the war. That not the point surely? you go through hell, suffer life changing experiences, but it hardly dents the war narrative, the pain and suffering continues. The one shot camera work makes you feel are going through the it yourself, which for me made the film very immersive.
War is hell and men die for nothing.
Brilliant film, one I will revisit many times."
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Over the decades, movie producers have often resorted to war movies as a ""go-to"" plot line to tell a good story. Very few, however, successfully manage to convey the true horror and abject carnage of war. Not only does ""1917"" achieve this, it keeps viewers in the edge of their seats with its magnificent storyline. This would. Or otherwise be possible without the masterful use of the ""one camera one take"" production technique which give viewers the feeling of ""being there"". Continuity is superbly seamless, as is the highly engaging acting. This movie conveys one simple, immutable message: no matter what the era, no matter what the location, war is stupid. I commend this movie to viewers as possibly the greatest war movie of the modern era."
1917,14 March 2020,8/10,"A very well done movie that is visually stunning. Perfectly depicts the hoplessness and futility of that most unecessary war. Being former military I do have one serious flaw I can't get past.In the opening Colin Firth says they have aerial photography of German positions. Why then didn't they send an aeroplane (lol brit spelling) to stop the attack? The pilot could have dropped the order... army commander reads it...roll credits. Or could have landed nearby. Aircraft flew slower than cars drive back then, so shouting could have worked to.Besides that this was a well done film, but not one to watch over and over like Pvt Ryan."
1917,25 May 2020,8/10,"One of the best cinematography ever i've seen in my life. Heartwarming-story, good direct, great sound mixing. One of the best War movie"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Very special realisation, story looks simple but the film is just great."
1917,22 October 2021,5/10,"Compare to other world war movies way too overrated. I understand the importance of the story, but it doesn't mean each great story can make great movie. This is in my opinion prime example. It has received many awards- I assume purely because of some visual effects and importance of the event which it describes but in my opinion sloppy flow. Would not watch again or recommend.Only reason for 5 it's because of historic event and some visual effects....."
1917,24 March 2020,10/10,My god this movie was so epic I will always want to watch it over and over
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,"Technically it was brilliant,but the mv makes me yawn."
1917,13 March 2020,7/10,Great cinematography. Best part for me was the first 15 minutes. The film loses a bit of steam in the final act but the journey to get there is enjoyable and technically brilliant.
1917,21 April 2020,7/10,"You can feel the similarity between this movie and Saving Rayan but for sure the old movie was far better with deepest story and perfect acting
Here the story is weak , some positive things in visual effects and sound only"
1917,23 April 2020,8/10,"This movie is a master piece in means of cinematography. Thanks to Roger Deakins and his team who gave such an effort on not just shooting also on planning every detail.
As soon as the movie started i began thinking ""how did they film this? "" i was looking forward to run to youtube and search and after watching several videos i was fascinated about how they did this.
Movie itself has some plot holes and i was annoyed by the unrealistic moves of this two soldiers but in the end it's a fantastic movie and a corner stone about shooting technics."
1917,24 February 2020,1/10,"It is just an emotional drama, where a brother tried to find his brother but gets killed in action. Then, his friend carry forward the duty to deliver the message to the soldiers. I watched it because it has high rating but it didn't impress me. May be it is good for awards but not for entertainment."
1917,14 June 2020,8/10,"I regret not watching this film on the big screen. Watching on your laptop does not give you the immersive feel that the makers have intended for you with the one-long-shot method.This is a cinematic masterpiece. A technical genius. When you understand the amount of work that went into shooting each scene, you appreciate the film even more.Having said that, I would have loved the film to be crisper and tighter. Moreover, some scenes feel huge coincidences and don't make a lot of sense. They are there to make things difficult for the main character but only a little.Overall, I believe one would love this film only if he has watched it in the theatres, else he would end up getting a bit bored."
1917,11 November 2020,4/10,"Firstly, it's not an awful film it just doesn't really work for me. Plot had huge holes in it, very dull in parts, dialogue was stilted and forced and just didn't feel authentic and the two young leads acting was poor. There were some brilliant moments and some amazing visuals. The one shot trick was presumably why the critics loved it but for me, it actually detracted from the movie the longer it went on."
1917,24 March 2020,8/10,"A deadly drama. Breathtaking war film. I dont know who was the director, but they depicted 1st world war very well. There were 2-3second moments in the film which it can take you to think about it for 3-4hours, there were 2-3 seconds moments in the film that you can dive into it and stay here for 3-4 hours.. Yeah really deserved to take time and watch it !!"
1917,2 January 2021,4/10,"This movie is one of those highly review critics movie that i dont understand why people praise and enjoy it so much. The plot is empty, it simple. Sure it has the best cinematography but that is it. I just dont get it. Go watch Gentlemen or Alice in borderland more excited than this movie."
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"Twenty minutes into the film you will be gripped, by the end of this film you will realise you have just watched the greatest war film ever made, Sam mendes has created a real masterpiece."
1917,29 March 2020,9/10,"It is an art form being able to place you in what can only be described as hell on earth so you can emerge yourself in the terror that is trench warfare. This film was an absolute masterpiece as it achieved that in such a perfect way. Its impossible to imagine in modern times what each soldier lived through and the conditions they sustained...the constant fear knowing it can all be over in a flash. It would be 10/10 ... only small critique is that I didnt fully understand why there were so many massive actors with minuscule parts in this film, it wasnt required George Mackay & Dean Charles-Chapman were absolutely superb in this...the film would be a hit without the A-List hollywood names. Small and only criticism."
1917,25 January 2021,9/10,"I thought this was stunning and so immersive in what we can only imagine it must've been like to live and be in the trenches of World War One. It brilliantly demonstrates how fragile and thin the margin between winning and losing, surviving and dying really was in war. In the trailer there a some massive show stopping scenes but in the actual film it focuses more on the danger and peril. We follow one soldier's journey through the film as he creeps around battlefields, abandoned villages and trenches, trying not to be seen by the enemy and I think that might've disappointed some people who were expecting another Saving Private Ryan. However, I thought in the same way Valkyrie leaves you with a new perspective on a particular moment in history, for me, 1917 really gives a new insight into being on the ground in war away from the Hollywood battle scenes. It's pretty intense but wow, what a film."
1917,17 March 2020,4/10,To be honest I sat with lot of expectations and loved the visuals and cinematography. The film was definitely techinal marvelous. It was a simple concept I thought directed very well.. However the direction failed when there were lot of loopholes in the movie. At the end I walked out with disappointment .
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"This movie had everything you would want in a World War Film it is emotional,action packed and telling you about that you have to deliver a message that can save 1600 men where they are walking into a trap by the Germans."
1917,14 February 2020,3/10,This movie while realistic has only a drab feeling of war war what is it good for. I don't feel much is done here except to confirm that humans are dumb and seem to repeat mistakes over and over. I am very used to this so going to a movie to confirm it is redundant.
1917,31 January 2020,1/10,One of the worst movies I've ever seen! I have no idea how it got such a high rating..wtf
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"While watching this movie I was on the edge of my seat, I had goosebumps, I was speechless about the hauntingly beautiful cinematography!
What Roger Deakins was able to pull off was incredible and there is no doubt that he is best in the business. My eyes were wide open and I was just amazed at how beautiful the cinematography was in Écoust.
The soundtrack was subtle but amazing and picked up when needed too putting the audience on the edge of their seats.
This is the first movie by Sam Mendes I have watched and will be definitely be checking out more of his movies. He did an amazing job of making the movie without any cuts it really helped you to experience the events of the movie and makes you feel the panic, tragedy and the adrenaline rush along with the characters.
This movie checked all the boxes in my list and is one of my favourite movie all time!
A must watch for all."
1917,11 February 2020,9/10,"Awesome movie from the beginning till the end , everything was great :
1) The music was intense and perfect with every scene
2) The acting was great
3) The movie was kinda emotional and it made me feel sad
4) Awesome and one of kind Story
5) The film shooting was The best and Gorgeous
6) This movie deserves all the nominees and winnings for the oscars
7) My rating for this Gorgeous and one of kind movie is : 9.0/10"
1917,3 February 2020,9/10,"1917 is a brilliant adventure film, which was released in the 1. World War. Apart from an emotionally charged story, realistic dialogues and well acted characters, the movie offers a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Roger Deakins behind the camera manages to create a gripping experience through unique images and consistent camera work close to the main characters. Moreover, the sets seem to be taken from real life and make the viewer feel as if they are at war themselves."
1917,1 June 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes brings a war movie about two men sent on a mission to stop an attack. I have always been interested in seeing this, since I haven't seen too many films based on World War I, but I didn't see this movie in theaters until I saw it nominated for a hell of a lot of Oscars. I have seen my fair share of war films, and these kind of films deliver a brutal punch and shocks you with its graphic violence. I went into this film knowing almost nothing, but prepared.
I was actually surprised and a bit relieved this movie didn't focus on graphic violence to give you a brutal punch. This film delivers that punch in such an emotional and haunting way. The score and the performances in this film is excellent, and the realism in this movie shocked me.
It took me months to go see this movie, but at least I can finally say I'm glad I did."
1917,18 February 2020,6/10,"It looked good.....and uuuh......that's it. The cinematography is impressive, Roger Deakens did a fantastic job. But that's pretty much it. Everything else is bland."
1917,13 June 2020,10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece. Obviously. Yes, like some critics say, the film's story is basic and simple. That doesn't mean it's a failure. You don't need something filled with twists and swirls for it to be good. This is a war movie, and it focuses on that very well. Another thing critics say is that the characters are underdeveloped. That is not true. They may not show much emotion or backstory, but you can feel it, and especially relate to it if you were a war veteran from the WW1. I am clearly not, but I must say they handled this film very well. Don't listen to the critics and keep what I and many others who like the film say and watch it. It is a worthy watch. Once you combat all the cons of this movie, you are left with the greatest war movie, and possibly the best movie, of the year."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a well made, carefully crafted movie.Brilliant writing, phenomenal acting and directing, and gritty realism make 1917 a truly great movie. The ""one shot"" aspect initially turned me off to the film, thinking it was a gimmick, but I was thoroughly impressed by how well it was executed. Overall 1917 is an achievement of filmmaking, and worth seeing.Toting itself as ""one shot"" is a bit misleading. It nearly accomplishes this, but there is one hard cut, which feels out of place considering the rest of the editing. The ""hidden"" cuts are sometimes quite obvious. Despite these aspects being flawed, it is still an astonishing feat of cinematography and editing. Thematically this style compliments the story being told and for what is mostly excellent acting and direction.The film can be divided into three noticeable acts. 1: No man's land/the farm, 2: the city, 3: the frontline. By far the first act is the strongest, the chemistry between the leads is amazing, and the setting is thoroughly immersive. After the farm, the films greatness wanes and becomes a little more standard. There is a great scene when things slow down, and humanity returns in this portion but it is overshadowed by a strong attempt to increase tension. (Strong in that it does work, but by contrast it tarnishes the rest of the film). The third act sees a return to great direction, choreography, and filmmaking in general. Act 3 is a strong conclusion to the film, and redeems some of the lesser qualities in the middle.On a technical level the sound design was great, and the soundtrack, was refreshingly minimal. 1917 takes logic and action in a fairly realistic (though possibly heightened at times) manner. This means that sound effects needed to feel connected, and the score shouldn't override the visuals. What should have happened is thankfully what did. The score is never overbearing, and each sound effect feels genuine to the scene its placed.While 1917 almost loses its way in the middle, it finds itself again towards the end. It's an enjoyable movie, which will make its way to being another classic.Final score (81/100)"
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"Loved the cinematography & had me stressed the whole way through.
Best War film I've seen."
1917,6 March 2020,10/10,"Everything about this movie hits perfectly. As a long time fan of war movies and just historical films in general I was amped for 1917. As a long time fan of cinematography and how it can shape a films story and tone; I was also amped. If you take the constant one take away from the movie you still have something incredible here. You get a journey out of the 90 min plus run time, and you're in it for every second. The one take makes you feel like you're on this journey with these soldiers. When they get shot at you feel like you got shot at, when they crawl in the mud you feel like you're in the mud etc. The performance by the leading man is great and I hope to see him in future films or tv. A true race against time war thriller is one that I highly recommend not to just cinema buffs but just anybody that enjoys a good movie. While those with short attention spans may think it's boring because theirs not constant blood or witty banter all the time, but don't let that subtract anything from the film. It took a note from Dunkirk in the fact that soldiers when they are in these situations, probably are not talking too much. 1917 flawless, riveting, engaging, 10/10"
1917,3 October 2021,6/10,"The first 20 minutes were simply fab. The scene setting and costumes are top notch.The storyline and the remainder of the movie however is very weak.The Title '1917' is a TOTAL Miss Match as it caters for a solitary 24 hour period in what was surely ONE HELL OF A YEAR!?Just look at what took place during the Battle of Cambrai which kicked off on the 20th November 1917.Was '1917' worthy of a Best Movie nomination, I personally think not."
1917,4 March 2020,9/10,"A movie that will no doubt go down on a lot of best lists. It it beautiful, intense, and depressing all within two hours."
1917,6 June 2020,9/10,"Superbly engaging and affecting war drama, that doesn't let up even when it slows down. The camera work enhances the storytelling without drawing attention to itself or feeling like a gimmick. One of the most well paced action films you'll ever see."
1917,8 November 2021,8/10,"Two young British soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are tasked with a mission to carry a message far beyond enemy lines which could save 1600 men from walking straight into a trap.I am personally not a huge fan of WW1 and WW2 movies, but there's no denying the fact that this movie is a huge technical achievement. Roger Deakins is one of the best cinematographers of our time. Some shots are mind-blowing. It's hard to imagine how it was shot. Every movie Deakins is involved with looks astonishing and 1917 is no exception. The score, sound editing/mixing, visual effects, and production design are all outstanding.1917 is shot and edited to look like one continuous shot, but that is not the case. This illusion was created with camera trickery and great editing. Sometimes you're able to tell when the camera cuts when darkness obscures the screen for a second or when the camera passes by a wall. Contrary to popular belief, the longest scenes were according to one of the lead actors, Dean-Charles Chapman, only 7- or 8-minutes.I can't begin to fathom the amount of preparation and planning that went into this movie. Creating a war movie to look like one shot from start to finish is not an easy task. It took extreme planning from the director and the cinematographer.The actors give great performances. I did at first not find Chapman and Mackay's performances to be very believable, but it took a quick turn. I did not find it very appropriate for Blake to be cracking jokes whilst being in constant danger. But suddenly the tables flipped, and it got more serious which I enjoyed.When Blake is bleeding out, we can see his face turn pale. This was done without the use of special effects or makeup. I don't know how it's possible, but his face is naturally flushed with color. I think this was an amazing detail and I had no clue it was done without the use of makeup or special effects.Some people might find 1917 to be lacking character and some might call it a ""gimmick film"", which I understand but I don't fully concur. While the plot is simple, the movie still has heart and great action. The last sequence when Schofield is searching for Colonel Mackenzie is great.The first 10 minutes of the movie were flawless. I was engaged and I was thinking how this would be my favorite movie of all time, but I don't think the rest of the movie held this standard. 1917 is still technically one of the greatest movies of all time and it's an enjoyable watch too. I highly recommend you watch it."
1917,21 March 2021,4/10,"The ending that I was thinking that's it. Weird camera kept moving all scenes. It's alright, I guess? It kind of the worst film ever!"
1917,3 July 2020,6/10,"One nice combat movie I have watched same like savings private Ryan,dankirk and pearl harbor"
1917,19 April 2020,8/10,Quality in screen and light perfect and also music.
1917,20 May 2020,10/10,"It took me a while to realize that the camera didn't stop through the entire film. I had to go back and watch it over again to be sure. There is no editing in this film. This is a stage play or a ballet of sorts becuase there is no room to mess up. Besides that, it's an exciting and surprising WWI story which is always important to be told."
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,I love war movies and specially the one made with such details. I hope all wars end one day.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This movie has everything. Its profound, enlightening, has well developed characters, it immerses the audience and makes you feel like you're in the trenches with all the characters and is incredibly moving and intense. The messages conveyed are nuanced yet subtle but also profound. This movie is a great road and psychological war thriller film. It's a modern classic and one of the best war films that I've ever seen as well as one of the best movies of the year. This masterpiece is filmmaking at it's finest."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes takes you to the First World War and never lets you go till the end. The cinematographer is a genius, does all the film in one take. Actos are perfect and the scenography is incredible. This movie is a ""masterpiece"" and deserves all the Oscars!"
1917,23 January 2020,3/10,"The whole movie is about two young men sent on foot, in enemy territory, by a General, to dangerously attempt to give 1600 men a message when all He had to do was to have a message dropped from a plane(s) - that were already there. I realized that about 45 minutes in and stopped the insanity. Two hours of an implausible mission that could have been done in minutes."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"I didn't notice it at the beginning of the movie, but after 10-15 minutes into it I started to realize there were no cuts. I'm not sure how it's done, no idea at all if it's really a one shot or there are some imperceptible cuts, but the thing is that the human eye cannot perceive any cuts. At least everything seemed to me really seamless, except for just 10 seconds of blank screen on purpose to portray the main character's blackout. Hats off, really! Amazing camera and photography. I reallly enjoyed every minute of the film."
1917,31 March 2020,8/10,"So this film was quite a journey. Beautifully shot and well acted. The story was fine. The writers, actors, director, and all the crew really worked some magic. For me the 25 minutes or so were quite thrilling. I had to walk away for a few minutes, then came back for the finish. I know one thing. If all I have to do right now( during the 2020 virus) is to stay at home and leave some distance to help save the world I'm good. Can not begin to imagine what those young men went thru. For a patch of ground."
1917,5 February 2020,7/10,"A movie for teenagers. Shallow dialogues, white/black characters, badly performed at times, great visual effects. Take your kids with you."
1917,11 January 2020,,"I want to watch this movie again, but as of now, this is one of the best war movies I've seen in a long time.The movie is emotionally overwhelming, riveting, visceral, haunting yet beautiful and its gripping to the end. Director Sam Mendes masterfully evokes the harrowing horrors of WW1 while unearthed the humanity from within.At times the shots were mesmerizing and a feast to the eyes, Deakins' technical prowess successfully gives this movie a very tangible experience, like peering a window into the past. The movie speaks volume when there is no dialogue, and thats where the movie truly distinguishes itself from other war movies, which often focuses on the characters.Go out and watch it in the best theater possible, this movie is outstanding!"
1917,12 May 2021,9/10,This movie has shown us what it means to be a good director. Well done Sam. From the beginning till the end I was wondering how he manages to do this. It's just a scene. Just one scene.
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,"While I am not a full-fledged historian, the absolute hell on earth that was The Great War has always had me with my ears perked up and at full attention and upon finding out there is going to be a big hollywood film on the topic I was more or less excited about it. Granted, I don't watch trailers so I didn't know what to expect, outside a WW1 war film.The Good:
The film really delivered when it comes to costume design, there was great attention to detail, albeit some pieces were anachronistic, but that is negligible.
The lighting was great and in some scenes absolutely key, combined with the decent camera work and filming locations it shapes up as a very aesthetically pleasing film.The Bad:
I was really hoping for a more-or-less realistic depiction of WW1. Needless to say, this was NOT it. I am not one for gratuitous gore and guts, but it's hard to overstate how much of a Hieronymous Bosch-esque horror trench warfare in The Great War was and I was really hoping that would be featured in the film. It's obvious they tried to point that out, but it seemed extremely tame, both in scale and in intensity.
The script is pretty basic, which in itself wouldn't be bad, however too many things just happen out of plot convenience which defeats the purpose of keeping the plot simple.
Scenes just require a ridiculous amount of suspension of disbelief, especially when it comes to shootouts.To those interested in learning about WW1:
Dan Carlin's ""Blueprint for Armageddon"" does a fantastic job at providing both a very educational and (gruesomely) entertaining take on the war. Lengthy as it may be, I think every second of it is worth listening."
1917,17 January 2021,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect, but this movie was excellent. The British accent was at times difficult to understand but after watching again with closed caption, my review didn't change. My dad passed last year before we could watch it, but I know he would have loved it."
1917,25 March 2020,10/10,"It felt like I was watching a Lord of the Rings war movie. The one shot choice for this movie was amazing and I hope we see more movies like ""1917"" come forth. I could easily watch this movie many more times. Amazingly perfect in every way for a movie lover of war and photography. This movie was really something special."
1917,31 March 2020,10/10,"What a scenic movie....every frame was carefully crafted and so rich. Long held camera shots are unbelievable and can't understand how much effort was given in.Beware, you will be take to the war, once you start watching..."
1917,24 January 2020,8/10,"1917 starts with a view of resting soldiers, Green trees and landscapes showing the quietness before the war. After this it directly puts you in the war zone through the eyes of two soldiers (Blake and Scofield).
The movie starts with the mission that depends on one brother to save another. But suddenly it becomes the responsibility of the fellow soldier to carry the honor and valor of his friend and fellow soldier. 1917 shows that the bond of friendship is stronger than the horror of War.
1917 never tries to make you choose sides, right or wrong in the war. It depicts how a small yet significant information or effort can save life of 1600 men.
In 1917 Sam Mendes manages to create a compelling movie with the stories of his grandfather Alfred Mendes.
Sam Mendes never tries to make anyone hero during the war. He just presents you with the terror and horror faced by soldiers in WW 1.
1917 is technically brilliant specially the cinematography and background score.
At times Thomas newman's score feels like work of Hans Zimmer.
The single-take (long shot) camera technique of Roger Deakins makes 1917 a incredible watch as the drama unfolds infront of your eyes.
There are few scenes which are high on emotions yet they are so beautifully shot, it feels like the earth is shifting under your feet.
The trip wire scene and The Long shot of planes (Night scene) shooting on Scofield are magnificent example of technical brilliance.Though 1917 is a technical masterpiece, it never runs out of emotions and keeps you engaged with the character's journey.
It shows how many lives are sacrificed during war yet new Life survives.1917 is one of the best WW 1 movies I have scene in recent times. It achieves the technical standards set by Dunkirk but it has a lot more to offer on emotional front.
It's Dunkirk sequel with a lot of emotions. If you have a knack for war movies you won't be disappointed.
1917 leaves you spellbound with the sheer brilliance of it's camera work and craft."
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Realistic (I think) account of the horrors of war. Old style back and forth ground fights with little respect for human life. The acting was very realistic and had me hanging with every scene. Major subliminal messages that provokes the mind for those interested but also entertaining for those that aren't.
1917,6 February 2020,5/10,"I was looking forward to seeing this but I was so very disappointed. All the major scenes were completely over egged, not in an action packed kind of way but exaggerated to the point that the characters decisions made no sense. From trying to tightrope walk over a bridge in full view of any enemy soldiers for miles around to the ridiculous scene of running across no man's land, it was hard to feel taken by this movie. Indeed its easy to see why the Germans lost this war considering their troops must have been trained to shoot by Star Wars own Stromtroopers plus the main character never had to reload his weapon, Infinite ammo certainly is a big advantage in war.In fairness to it, the movie looks amazing, but while there is certainly a story there threatening to reveal itself it gets lost behind theatrics."
1917,9 February 2020,2/10,When yo want to make a realistic movie over WW1you do not put actor that look like they walked outside Mcdonalds actors to play the soldiers Chapman was fat Thick Chicks and Ass chicks.Also how i can believ that a General picked to naive soldier to go on a suicide missionDid you saw the Black actors in ww1 in France?Also many other thinks did not made sense in the movie it felt like Dunkirk that theatricality replaced realism
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"The movie was great, lack the depth Saving Private Ryan had, but in general it was a nice story and great cinematography work.I want to take a stab on something that bugged me though...30:34 minute into the movie, Lance Corporal Blake refer to the German soldiers as Nazis, Quote: ""Nazi Busters!"" however, the Nazi party wasn't existing till the begging of 1930's..."
1917,30 June 2021,10/10,Just incredible. Takes your breath away. An exceptional piece of film work and acting.
1917,26 October 2020,10/10,"This is such a great war film, good acting, great actors, love the scenery, the music is quite dramatic but good. Would definitely watch it again. It's just as good as saving private Ryan and HackSaw Ridge."
1917,19 April 2020,9/10,"1917..
A true Masterpiece..The muvi is designed to be in one camera take..which is such an important element of the experience.. its like the camera itself is a character. No wonder they got Oscars for Cinematography...VFX and.Sound Mixing.But even with all the effort to make it luk awesome.. Sam Mendes.. u amazing director.. the contrast u see in muvi.. all green peaceful grounds with cherry trees and blossoms..and then dark war zone..with men eating rats..dead soldiers and dead horses.. The clear message was never said in the lines.. but was well understood by ur audience... which is the difference between War and Peace.. portrayed beautifully.Its the best war muvi of modern tyms..one must experience on a good screen."
1917,27 June 2021,4/10,"I don't need to harp on about the technical achievement that it is, as that is what the movie is known for. It is unfortunate that this overshadows 1917's offensive take on Germans during WWI, like typical American children thinking German s in WWI were evil because of WWII.In 1917, German soldiers are portrayed as killers while British soldiers are portrayed as merciful, as the opposite. This is propaganda, pure and simple. The Germans were not evil, the only ""bad guy"" in WWI were all the politicians keeping the war going while all the soldiers and civilians eventually wanted it to end. Don't forget that the French and Germans would fraternize during this war, a practice that had to be banned.We also have Germans with storm trooper aim; chasing and firing bolt action rifles simultaneously against a target fleeing in a straight line no more than 30m ahead. The plot is full of typical unbelievable Hollywood action that simply does not belong in a war film.If you're going to pursue utmost immersive cinematography, then please also incorporate an authentic, unbiased, respectful script to match. Impressive technical achievement, but I cannot recommend this propaganda war flick."
1917,8 April 2020,8/10,"A movie behind Saving Er Ryan, ahead of Dunkirk. Of course, the British were shown as angels, the Germans were shown as devils, but other than that, I watched them excitedly, a successful movie. Oscar wouldn't have gone to Parasite if his story wasn't that simple."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"I enjoyed it,a tad slow in places mind. A film full of suspense and had you on the edge of your seat. The sets were superb and give you a feel of what it was like for lads in the trenches during the First World War,although I don't think we will ever know the true horrors of war unless you were in it. A great performance from the two leads,George Mackay was excellent as Lance Corporal Schofield.All in all a good entertaining film which I suppose that's all you want from a trip to the cinema.A steady 7/10 and one that has to be watched on the big screen and not some crap copy 👍"
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,"No Man's Land was tense. Blake dying early was interesting, but you knew Schofield was going to make it because someone had to live to tell this story. The point of the movie was to emphasize the futility of war... But that's not exactly some groundbreaking message. Every same person understands this already. The movie was good, and the cinematography was intimate. Overrated though. Doesn't leave any lasting impression on me."
1917,19 March 2020,9/10,"Directed by Sam Mendes, Cinematography by Roger Deakins, and Edited by Lee Smith, each of these main crew members came on board the production of 1917 blessed with their respective win of an Academy Award previously. Sam Mendes won his first Oscar for American Beauty back in 2000, a director of good taste and technical wisdom, he knows exactly what his vision requires and puts himself to test en route to the end goal.Based on true events, 1917 tells a story of strenuous wartime efforts refined by Sam Mendes and Writer Krysty Wilson-Cairnstold, originally told to Mendes by his grandfather who fought in the Great War. In 1917, north of France, Germans make a smokescreen retreat to lure a regiment of the British Army into their trap. With field telephone lines cut, two soldiers are ordered to hand-deliver a message to the regiment on the frontline calling off their planned attack, where lives of 1,600 men are at stake.I can hear people say, uh, not another war movie, and the Academy has seen great ones since 1999 with Saving Private Ryan grabbing 5 golden statues including Best Director. But this movie is less about the war than about the almost impossible salvation of one person, or 1,600 people in time of war. In an increasingly hostile socio-political climate recently, we seem to forget the price we pay in wartime in exchange for the solidarity and comfort we take for granted. We resort to ways to soothe ourselves and take care of our souls but in a time like 1917, one man struggles to belong to the turmoil of war, let alone cares for his own insecurity and fear. 1917 is a film that puts you in the shoe of two young soldiers and follows them on a journey of salvation, where war is not happening but conditions every step of theirs. It is a universally moving story of sacrifice and heroism through the experience of two insignificant yet so brilliant boys, kind of like us. It is also a stunning movie that looks like it is done in one shot to exactly transcend your film viewing experience, taking you into the desolate world of war-torn France as we follow the soldiers passing through unimaginable lands. The technical excellence blends into the gripping storyline seamlessly, and we feel for the soldiers as they embark on a near-impossible journey that ultimately, is for their reunion with their loved ones.The film is tantamount to a free-flowing yet labored and deeply affecting poem, one that caught me on the edge of my seat, fidgeting and unwilling to let any moment. Some scenes are beautiful beyond measure, i.e., when George Mackay's character floats in a river with cherry blossom flowers emerge and ""escort"" him down the stream like guardian angels; or when the wrecked city gets lit up by weapon fire in the middle of an eery night, the camera flows in a way as if it has a soul of its own. Surprises abundant, 1917 also renders each location crucial to the development of the main characters, thanks to the impeccable production design and the wonderful camera movement in every frame.Also, speaking as a production nerd, let's go back to its Golden crew - congratulations to their well deserved Oscar nods in Best Achievement in Cinematography, Sound Mixing, and Special Effects! To reach the height of a one-shot illusion, the production team planned for 6 months to go into the set with excellent coordination, minute-detail oriented planning, and near-perfect execution. Production designer Dennis Gassner built models of the entire set so everyone could sync up with the vision of Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins. When shooting, the camera could roll for as long as 10 minutes, sometimes more. 1917 provides invaluable filmmaking insight to those who aspire to unconventional storytelling and creative handling of locations & characters. If perfection in production planning ever existed, 1917 is probably it.Last but not least, Thomas Newman's score is sensational throughout, inducing all kinds of emotions at the right moment. He reminds us time and again why he is one of the greater film composers. At nearly 62 years old, Newman has 80 film scores and nine television scores to his prized name, nominated at the Oscars for 14 times. He is no doubt an indispensable muscle in helping the film get its recognition.Perhaps filmmakers of every genre could benefit from learning how 1917 is done, it is truly a gemstone of poetic storytelling combined with technical excellence. I hold this film very dear to my heart and I only dream of planning and producing a project of this much beauty and sophistication."
1917,15 January 2020,6/10,"This hyped war film was pretty good and I enjoyed it, but it don't think I need to see it ever again. The single shot real time thing was really cool and it felt like you were in a virtual reality video game or something.The plot has a Saving private ryan thing going on. The modern cinematography and conceptual sound design felt like Dunkirk."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"The ""one shot"" does it all! Immersive, deep and true vibe. Great movie with a lot of psychological action. Its not about war."
1917,26 January 2020,2/10,"How very disappointing. There was no compassion in the acting building no bond or emotion. High emotion was only achieved by the use of highly dramatic loud music. The continuity was extremely poor and the story well, was there one. I can only conclude that the people who really like this are connected to the Oscar academy committee or the film Institute. I'm not sure how the IMDB Calculator works but if they are adding up the scores properly this should not have an overall rating of more than five. It's two hours of your life you will never get back on a film that is too self-indulgent. I like Sam Mendes but I'm not related to him so it's best to tell the truth."
1917,5 March 2020,10/10,"In the last 7 years maybe we missed to see this level of movies, most of films maker are thinking about money only without thinking about their content, and for me this movie you must see, this is how we can start the new decade with !!!"
1917,1 June 2020,7/10,"Initially it will be able to grab your attention. 0 to 50 minutes, you will like the way it flows. But, later on, you may have to forward it due to it's slow pace, if you are not a tolerable person on delay. Plot is very shallow and straightforward. You won't find any twist. Otherwise, acting and cinematography can have claps."
1917,17 January 2021,8/10,"I adored the picture in this movie, and it is truly a piece of art as if it was made by a painter. Not to mention it was shot with an impression of a single shot. The common idea of the plot is great: it is very unpredictable and even contained elements of horror. I don't remember any war movie that was so engaging to watch. Truly amazing at first glance!However, if you try to nit-pick, you would find a lot of holes as inconsistencies as if it was only shot by a painter without any help from anybody from the military and history. Here they are:
A guy without legs decided to kill two soldiers when he had a chance to survive by not doing anything. Why in the world would anybody make this hasty decision?Nothing got soaked after being in the water, even photos in the holderA group of soldiers does know how to get a truck out of the mudHe never eats. Is he a robot?How did the trucks come so silently to him/them so he did not even notice? Tesla trucks have not been invented even by now; WWI trucks were way louder than the current ones."
1917,1 April 2020,9/10,"This movie just focuses on two boys and their horrific encounters with war. The way the movie is filmed is as though this is just another normal day in hell, they just have to do what they have to do. I feel like the camera work may have been a bit much but it makes you feel like you are there right next to them throughout the film. Please watch."
1917,18 October 2020,2/10,"I'm old enough to remember a student poster that was rather trendy when I wasn't old enough to be a university student. It featured a soldier in the process of dying with a huge ""Why?"" plastered across the top of it.Why do the rear lines seem to exist mere metres behind the front lines?
Why would a couple of lowly lance corporals be trusted to save 1600 men?
Why is there virtually no artillery (the biggest killer and maimer in WWI) in this film?
Why do we have random individual Indian and black soldiers chucked into units without explanation?
Why is there so much greenery on the frontline?Why is this film rated so highly?Looks very nice, though. I suppose that's all that matters these days. Extra star for the prettiness."
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,"I have not seen a more boring movie in my life, seriously, The plot itself was 100% predictable and simply idiotic - I could not believe they called this ""a story"". Acting was okay, I guess, since there was really nothing ""to act"".Also, I was excited to go see this movie especially because I heard it looked like shot in one take, and I am a big fan of ""Children of Men"". I was really disappointed. Compared to the long-take parts of ""Children of Men"", which were amazingly done, here the ""hidden"" cuts were more than obvious.I've seen many dumb movies, but this one really killed me from boredom. I watched till the end in pain, hoping for something to change, even just a little. It did not. I'd really give it two stars, but I'll go with one just because it was so much under all my expectations."
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,"An exceptional movie for its genre, with excellent storytelling, cinematography and camera work. The amazing scenery, brilliant performances from such young actors and the suited soundtrack tie together a truly beautiful film."
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,This movie is beautifully done. But after about 20 minutes of being impressive with the single shot I was over it. The story is very one note. It's just them getting from point A to point B. The whole film is to showcase the one shot while getting from point A to point B. There were emotional scenes but I didn't feel any emotions. Not sure it it just felt contrived or acting didn't sell it. This does not deserve best picture. Best cinematography sure.
1917,19 January 2020,5/10,"The Production value is just Masterclass. And the way it's filmed....well.... honestly never seen anything quite like it. Phenomenal direction, production and background score. Let's not forget the acting of the main guy.....the level of fitness it requires to do the things that he did... It's just Marvelous...... But honestly it's not for everyone. For people who appreciate the design and the work that goes into making a film like this..... you are going to enjoy this. But for people who love story and storytelling, this movie is not for you cause all in all there was not much of story to tell.... And the celebrity cameos....that was honestly completely unnecessary and rather a bit distracting."
1917,6 March 2020,6/10,"Very slow moving movie, I love war movies but this was actually quite boring. A lot of the scenes feel very long and drawn out. I was fairly disappointed and found myself fighting the urge to turn it off. Yes, the ending was kind of cool. But it definitely wasn't worth sitting through the rest of the boring movie."
1917,12 January 2020,,"Sorry thought this film was going to be good.
The best part is the last 30 minutes"
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"I'm not gonna say I didn't enjoy it I came out the cinema thinking I hadn't been ripped off like I have with many films recently but and here's the problem with 1917 the story is very simple the 2 soldiers have to get from A to B to deliver a message that could save hundreds of lives including one of the soldiers brother's but what happens on their journey is a bit unbelievable and convenient I'm trying not to give anything away storywise but it felt a bit to rushed to me like they spent all the money on cinematography and direction (which is outstanding) and didn't spend to much time on the actual script, there are certain parts of the film where I just thought ""come on that's a bit lucky innit"" and it happens a few times in the film which ruined it a bit for me but it is worth a watch just for the cinematography and direction which is definitely the best I've seen in a long time."
1917,13 April 2020,6/10,"The film has an excellent screenplay - incredible scenes and one will recognize already at the beginning, starting with a single camera movement from a peaceful meadow to the cruel trench typical for the 1WW. The excellent screenplay is continued through the whole film.
However, for me it was a significant contrast to the storyline. It may sound strange, but the scenes were arranged too perfect for a war film. The storyline itself appeared to be fragmented and in many cases so unlikely. Finding milk in a bucket on a deserted place which will be used later in the film to prove the honesty of the main character, sudden appearance of a patrol behind the frontline, a rescued pilot that has nothing better to do than attack their rescuer and more of that. The excellent screenplay is for me 10/10 but it does not reflect the kind of the story and the storyline only gets a 4/10 due to fragmented scenes and unlikely events."
1917,19 August 2020,10/10,"As myself a war Veteran, wasn't to sure about this film, but this movie sure depicted the horrors of war, and the determination and courage we Soldiers exemplify to carry out missions. What an incredible film and beautiful music score."
1917,3 February 2020,,Has good parts and bad parts but overall is a great movie.
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"Just came back from the movie, Glad i watched this on the big screen!The whole movie is like a piece of art with non-stop action, emotion and intensity that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Yes the story is simple and ending is predictable, we all know what happened in WWI, but that doesn't take away the beauty of story telling without the need for words.The direction, music, sounds, production design, screenplay and most importantly the cinematography are some of the best i have seen in a long time all combined together in one movie. The amount of hard work i have seen in the making of video is simply mind blowing.Can't wait to watch this again..."
1917,16 May 2020,10/10,"So much continuity to tell a story over a short period of time makes this movie an absolute, edge-of-your-seat must-see movie. The brutality of war is not relaxed for this one. The story was told wonderfully and the directing was top-notch."
1917,14 December 2020,10/10,An absolute must-see film. The single camera shot that compromised this film summoned the audience to be a part of a film like we never have before. Wow. This is a classic and a treasure!
1917,30 December 2019,7/10,"Seen a lot of war movie filming was great ,could been better"
1917,2 April 2020,7/10,"It's a good movie, for sure. But it's overhyped. I can think of at least a handful of better wartime movies (Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, Hacksaw Ridge, The Hurt Locker, and Unbroken) which we're all better imo. The visuals to this movie are impressive for sure. And the sound is great - maybe a smidge overhyped too, but still great. But there's not much of a story. The acting is mehhhh. The journey is entertaining, but the ending then almost feels rushed."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"I've seen a decent amount of war movies in my life, and while I've always had an appreciation for such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Schindler's List"", I've never been a war movie fanatic. Even though I have praise to give them, I tend to not revisit them too often. This film however, I can say that I can see myself revisiting at least a few more times, and more than likely while it's still in theaters. It's a marvel of an achievement in the cinematography department, and the production behind it is anything but lazy. The acting is superb, and believable in every scene. The lighting is very effective in a few key scenes that are standing out fresh in my mind. The movie also knows just when to have a lack of a score to build tension, and when to bring in the epic orchestra to ramp up the drama of the scene. The make up is top notch, and the wardrobe is indistinguishable from authentic uniforms of the time. The story, though simple, is very engaging, and does an outstanding job of plopping you right in the middle of it. For it being the ""one shot"" gimmick throughout the film, I never once felt that the pacing suffered from it, and it only added to the experience, and the immersion. Most movies I see, even the ones I adore, tend to have very small things here and there that I can find to nitpick if I really want to, but this film, I can't think of one thing I would change. Not one thing comes to mind that could've improved this experience for me. See this movie on the big screen if you can. I urge you to not let this movie fly under the radar. See it, tell people you know to see it. Help ensure that the very hard work that was put into this pays off for all of those involved! I cannot recommend it enough!"
1917,8 March 2020,7/10,The pace of the movie is very slow. I almost didn't finish watching it. They could have done a lot more to make it more moving. Was expecting a lot more given the reviews.
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"I think only maybe once or twice in a lifetime does a movie touch you so deeply that you feel like you're right there with the characters going through what they are. I am an avid movie lover but the only other time I experienced this was during Titanic back in '97.
I am a wife and a Mother and admittedly I can be a little emotional but I don't easily cry at movies. This. Movie. Well, it was truly brilliant and not just because of the way the story was told or the INSANE set design but somehow the director made you feel like you were right there with the characters walking timidly behind each one of their brave steps. This movie didn't glorify war or the good guys or even country this movie glorified the nobody specials who were the greatest hero's we'll ever know. It reminded us of the sacredness of each and every life, of family of friendship and the strength of the human spirit. I've never seen anything like it and probably will never again. I'm sorry but there needs to be something higher than the Oscar for this movie. My sincerest of thank you's to the actors who played the roles in this movie and the respect they gave each character. I would call the director a genus to his face and to every single person who worked on this movie, you made a masterpiece and you made history real to me and my family in a way that like I said, happens maybe once or twice in a lifetime. And I thank you for that."
1917,7 July 2020,10/10,This film is incredible. It managed to tell and intimate story surrounded by the huge theater that is Europe in World War I. The characters are deep and ones that you are easily invested in. Sam Mendes accomplished this while still showing the brutality of war and making a staggeringly beautiful movie.I cannot recommend this movie enough and the fact that it didn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture boggles the mind. Enjoy!
1917,20 February 2020,4/10,"I watched the movie, I haven't watched such a boring movie in a long time, and this is even war movie witch i generaly really like, so I think this is the most boring war movie in history.
I watched it expecting some action, something that would save it, but to no avail.It got those Oscars, for like a single shot, although of course they made transitions at least at dozen places, but they neatly masked it with editing tricks and movie record tricks.
It's boring when everything is in one frame, there is no dynamic, it is more immersive, but that would much more feet action movie, not this boring drama ... 4/10"
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,"After all the hype and the user ratings at 10/10, I couldn't wait to see this film thinking another 'Saving Private Ryan' was waiting..... Unlike SPR and the tour de force Normandy landing seen, which left me in shock, 1917 just doesn't ever get going. The only suspenseful moment was which way Benedict Cumberbatch's character was going decide. A decent enough film but a classic, not a chance."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,Shot with one camera. Seems like one long take from beginning to end. The environment that they set for this movie is amazing. Another movie that seems like one take is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). Although that is not a war movie. I definitely recommend 1917.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This may be one of the greatest movies of all time. It is the most immersive experience I have ever undergone. The visuals are so beautiful and disturbing at the same time. However, I think this needs to be seen in theaters to get the full effect. Don't Miss This!!!!"
1917,17 January 2020,2/10,Just cant get my head around a tired and wounded soldier manages to survive a very cold strong current river with a waterfall for miles and deliver the letter from the General. Must have had waterproof paper and ink back in the day. Spoiled it for me.
1917,17 January 2020,2/10,So we have letter that has orders from the General that needs to be delivered by foot that is miles away to stop 1600 men being massacred. Our hero has been shot at and is on the run and jumps into a river which has a very strong current and for miles he travels then going down a high waterfall and survives to hand over the letter which seems to have no damage and maybe waterproof ink. There is so many other plot holes which I wont delve into. Loved the cinematography and cast but too many blatant flaws. Shame
1917,6 February 2020,6/10,"As a film that has gained much fanfare and a handful of prestigious Awards to date (Golden Globe and (BAFTA awards for best picture and a host of technical awards among them), '1917' has naturally aroused Oscar interests soaring high. So what's new? And what are the bets ? Following review of the film is offered from these perspectives.Here's a story of two British soldiers Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and William Schofield (George Mackay) who are tasked to deliver an urgent message from General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to Colonel Mackenzie ( Benedict Cumberbatch), battalion commander of 2nd Devonshire (where Blake's brother Joseph Blake is a Lieutenant), in a battle zone across French border during World War I. The message that they carry is to stop attack on a German fleet - which is on a tactical withdrawal to counter attack - in order to avoid a big showdown and heavy bloodshed.Would seem to be a fine enough plot for a 120 minutes movie, which has its real time-span of over a day. The time-span would also justify the 'single shot' appeal that the movie presents. Obviously, there would be a lot of action, fighting, fireworks and adrenaline infused in between that would provide the movie ticket's worth. Not to mention of the superior cinematography (Roger Deakins of 'Blade Runner' fame), the matching background music (Thomas Newman) and the mesmerising editing by Lee Smith (remember it's single shot?).But then, sub plots and dialogues are what makes a worthy screenplay. Here Sam Mendes (Director himself, who had the advantage of the story being told to him by his Grandfather) provides some twists and turns to the story, so that the film does not appear too plain and stale. So we have a trip-wired bunker coming down, thanks to a rat - but nothing happening to our protagonists; an aircraft dogfight, which ends up with the shot down German aircraft falling straight into the feet of our watching young soldiers, and Blake getting stabbed by the German pilot when he tries to save him (why? especially when the Geneva conventions are still far-away?); Schofield collecting a flask of fresh milk from the scene, only to be handed over to the French woman Lauri (Claire Duburcq) who was caring an unknown baby; a bogged British vehicle which is salvaged thanks to efforts by Scofield; plenty of missed shots by German snipers; finally, Sho' managing to get across to Colonel Mackenzie and stopping the attack; and Sho' being able to meet and convey the sad news of his brother's death to Lt Blake.But sadly, the subplots manage to neither further nor enhance the plots. Some of them seem too deliberate - for example, the milk and the coincidental baby scenes, which had little or no impact on the movie's progression. And the dialogues are too insipid, carrying little or no punch. The film doesn't leave an impression on you, either as an adventure or an anti war saga. It ends up as wasted emotions and efforts, inspite of the great audio visuals that the movie presents (thanks to its team of technicians).So what about the Oscars - well, your guess is as bad as mine!"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"2019 was one of the best years for cinema I have ever seen and 1917 is one of the best of the year, if not the best, it deserves all the praise that is having, due to several factors, if possible watch it on IMAX, the experience is completely unforgettable, there are scenes in that we are in the skin of the characters and the cinematography of Roger Deadkins makes all the difference, Oscar for sure in this category, there are some emotional scenes where the music is magnificent and the performances of both main actors, mainly George Mackay. In other words, a cinematic masterpiece."
1917,26 May 2020,9/10,"Just amazing. If you want to see an authentic view of what war looks like, look no further. There was a beauty to the nasty depiction of war in the film. You could practically smell and taste it and it isn't pleasant but the movie is amazing in depicting that. Shows the constant need for anxiety and paranoia, mixed with not having the right to greave properly during war as each day is not promised."
1917,6 March 2020,10/10,"I think I recommended just about everyone I see to watch this film. It's well made, EXCEPTIONAL acting, gives you an insight into just exactly our soldiers went through. I think that every single person should watch this film just so they can appreciate our men and history. I don't know how the film makers did it but you ACTUALLY feel like you're there in the film with them. Loved, loved loved it!"
1917,17 July 2020,8/10,Its a wonderful movie without a doubt and that's why won a Oscar. Excellent cinematography and cast of the movie is also fabulous. Everyone should watch this movie.
1917,23 June 2020,4/10,"While watching this film before I read these reviews,I thought to myself this is a lot like saving private Ryan.Then after seeing it,I read the reviews and see that many thought the way I did.I dare say also that the producers have also seen the Aussie film ''Gallipoli''as the final scenes about saving men before they went over the top,are very very similar."
1917,9 February 2020,2/10,"Supposedly this is an original story, but I have to wonder as the central premise was ""Borrowed"" from a far superior World War One film; 1981's Gallipoli directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander), and starring a pair of talented young up and coming Aussie actors; Archie (Mark Lee) and Frank (some dude named Mel Gibson). Mark Lee pretty much dropped out of sight after Gallipoli, whilst Mel Gibson got ruined by fame and the Hollywood machine.Technically speaking Gallipoli isn't even a war movie, it's a Coming of Age story featuring the friendship between two young athletes. We don't see the beach-head at Gallipoli until the third act of the film, and the finale features Frank having to deliver a message to the trenches on the front line, to halt an impending attack that will result in the slaughter of hundreds of ANZAC soldiers, including his mate Archie. It is revealed that the purpose of the attack is to distract Turkish forces long enough for a British force to establish a beach-head on a nearby beach. It is also revealed that the impending attack on the Turkish trenches across no man's land, is no longer necessary due to the fact that the British forces landed with no opposition from the Turks whatsoever. Apparently the British forces are sitting on the beach, enjoying the sun and drinking tea. It seems the British commander is unaware of this and orders the suicidal attack to go ahead, over protests from ANZAC commanders that it is not necessary. Frank must evade obstacles and enemy fire to reach the front lines and deliver a message from an ANZAC commander to temporarily halt the attack until he can review the situation. Frank runs harder than he ever has in his life, to deliver the message to save his mate Archie and the lives of the ANZAC troops, who will be slaughtered if they go over the top. Does he make it in time? I won't spoil the ending for anyone who might want to see Gallipoli.(Modern audiences that need carnage and action sequences every five minutes, might find Gallipoli boring, and indeed while I would not call it slowly paced, the action and war sequences are only in the final act, the characters are well developed in the first two acts, so you do care about them. Mel Gibson proves that he was quite a talented young actor, before Hollywood ruined him. Loved Apocalypto though BTW).1917 features far too many WTF? moments that overcome your suspension of disbelief, and there is no real character development that allows you to care for the protagonists, or really give a crap whether they succeed in their mission or not. In contrast to Gallipoli, in which you see the initial rivalry between the leads, and their growing friendship as they head to Perth to sign up and join the war. By the time of the final act, you really care about Archie and Frank, and you're willing Mel on in his suspenseful run to save his mate and the ANZAC troops from being slaughtered for no purpose.
And to address my review heading - the ""Single"" take continuous tracking shot style, which of course was not filmed in a single take, but digitally edited to appear as though it was. What's the point? For example the single take tracking shot from Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas, in the scene where Ray Liotta and his girlfriend enter the club through the kitchen and make their way to their table. To produce a shot like this (without digital assistance) is incredibly complex, the choreography and logistics necessary for all the many actors, extras and the cinematographer to hit their marks precisely on cue, to pull the shot off successfully is mind boggling, and a testament to the talents of all involved. It isn't a matter of talent if you can stitch together many takes and shots with digital editing, to emulate a single take continuous shot. Now I am not some anti-digital/CGI crusader, these techniques and effects certainly have a place in modern films, and there are some very talented digital artists out there. Roger Deakins is a talented cinematographer, that I don't dispute, but to laud the accomplishment of the single take tracking shot digitally composited from many shots and takes, is in my opinion, a waste of time. To do it without digital assistance is where the talent truly lies, and I would much rather see modern directors and cinematographers attempt to do it ""Live"" without digital editing assistance. Spend a bit more time crafting a good screenplay first, rather than just thinking up cool shots and techniques, and this is where 1917 falls flat on its face.Is it really that hard to write screenplays that aren't full of plot holes and logic malfunctions? Is it really that difficult to write well-developed characters that an audience can care for and sympathise with? It certainly appears to be that way, I can understand that these big budget movies need to get as many bums on seats as possible to re-coup their enormous budgets and crack a profit. I also note that the hyperactive editing style of modern films, and the bombardment of imagery, panders to the short attention spans of modern audiences, who lose interest otherwise and find scenes that last longer than a minute excruciatingly boring. For example I recently watched an old film that had a scene that was over five minutes long, and I thought that this certainly wouldn't play in the modern era. BTW I am not some boring old fart who only watches old films, and can't cope with modern film-making. I recently saw Logan and was quite impressed, even though I am not a superhero fan at all, comics YES, Marvel and DC trash NO (Batman and Iron Man excluded, they're vigilante anti-heroes). And yes Logan had plot holes, but it wasn't enough to shatter my suspension of disbelief.Forget 1917, watch Gallipoli instead."
1917,4 February 2020,8/10,"This film is so amazing in all aspects.
First of all George MacKay is outstanding in this movie. I don't know why didn't he get at least a nomination. Production design is great. The way Sam Mendes managed to create the atmosphere of the Great War is truly Oscar winning. Directing is also marvellous. While I was watching the movie, i was saying to myself: ""wow this guy just earned an Oscar"". It's amazing how they made the movie look like it's a one shot take. This portrays the duty of soldiers in this cases, meaning that they can't lose a second or their purpose will be affected. As the movie slogan states: ""Time is the enemy"".
For this I outline the amazing director's work and Oscar winning cinematographer Roger Deakins. The script is very good, solid and entertaining. You really get to connect with the characters and fell their emotions, starting from the nap at the beginning to the resting in the tree at the end. It's also emotionally strong since the script takes the WWI atmosphere very crudely showing the horrors of war.
Finally sound. Wow. I jumped scared in one of the scenes because of the sound of an explosion I think this is one of the strong points that this movie has. It really immerses you in the environment. When planes pass by the sound of the engine leaves you deaf (not really but).
So, if you have the time and money to waste in this movie just do it, you will have a good time."
1917,8 February 2020,7/10,The movie is unbelievably over hyped. Lacks action. The one take is good but that's about it and that doesn't make a movie outstanding like a lot of people seem to think.
1917,10 January 2020,5/10,"I wanted to love this movie. I wanted it to be the next great war epic that the trailers convinced me it would be, but in the end, it was a slow, methodical trip across the countryside with next-to-no combat and a focus almost entirely on dialogue. While that may be enough for some people, I look back to Saving Private Ryan and other masterclasses of the genre that save the character driven moments until after they have already shown you the horrors of combat. For me, the quotables and the character arcs did not feel earned, and the journey ended in a puff of smoke that dissipated unrealistically quickly."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"On my opinion this movie is definitely the greatest war movie comes after (Saving Private Ryan & Apocalypse Now).
this movie has a great plot with a slow Mounting in events, an excellent drama and soundtrack, a legendary cinematography that blowing your mind, we shall raise the hat for Sam & photographers they did a great work,1917 has the all qualifications and abilities that the great war movie should has. the acting was a superb especially from George Mackay he deserve a Nomination for his role as Lance Corporal Schofield, he made us attaching with the character.
I really loved this movie & I wish you are just like me."
1917,14 February 2020,9/10,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. The score is impressive, and a full-length shot makes the scene so real as if I was going through the mercilessness of war. I was entirely drowned in the film and felt depressed and breathless in the whole process till it ended. An incredible experience tonight."
1917,5 March 2020,10/10,"I couldn't believe my eyes as I watched this film, it was all in one shot! Impossible and yet amazed after the film I straight away watched the bts of how it was all done, faking the one shot look. As a camera operator, photographer and general camera lover I have to say this is one of the best and jaw dropping cinematicly beautiful films out there! So glad that watching this film in goldclass was my valentines gift, amazing!"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"This movie is great, but not Oscar movie! Yes, it's a Great War movie, but it is too overrated!!"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I've just finished watching the '1917' movie, it was exceptional. The one continuous shot was unique and worked perfectly; it also added to the realism making it feel like we are actually with the two main actors of the film. It would be nice to see more films use the one continuous shot in the future! Sam Mendes did an incredible job on directing this movie.The cinematography, editing and sound was perfect and it was aesthetically pleasing, I was immersed the entire time!The acting quality was surprisingly great for the whole duration of the movie. George Mackay played his role well! Everyone should go see this movie in the cinema for the best experience.I thought this movie was incredible and it is certainly one of my favourite war films, possibly the greatest. 10/10 from me."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"This is such a brilliant piece of army movies
.There are so many thrilled scenes in this movie and i will recommend this movie.Atleast watch this movie in your life after watching 'The Shawshank Redemption'."
1917,4 March 2020,8/10,"1917 was a long-awaited movie. When I watched the released trailer for the first time, I was sure that this movie would enter the Top 250. Sam Mendes is a director I already love. The movie enters the subject directly. ""1917"" is the story of two friends reaching the front in time to save 1600 Soldiers. It was great to shoot the whole movie in one shot. The reality of the background action scenes and the shooting is very nice. I was never bored for the 2 hours I watched the movie. it is necessary to give the right to the movie about it. Because the movie is not boring. It was a movie that I watched with pleasure. I suggest you watch. My movie score is 100/82."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"From the moment I first saw the trailer, I was captivated. Hell, all the movies that showed this trailer beforehand were overshadowed. I had very high hopes. As in I told everyone that this my favorite movie even though I hadn't seen it. When I finally got to go, I was dying of anticipation. I was also scared I was going be disappointed.I was wrong. This movie was better than I ever thought any movie could be. I cried. Probably too much. I was crying when I left the theater. I was crying thirty minutes later because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I was thinking about the soldier who was singing Poor Wayfaring Stranger because he knew that they were going to die and the look on Schofield's face as the song was going on. I was thinking about Blake's death and how the words he spoke asked if Schofield knew the way. I thought of how Schofield almost gave up in the river, but then he saw the cherry blossoms. I thought of the moment they were in the abandoned German bunkers and they saw the picture of a family. I thought of Schofield not wanting to think of home and how he didn't want his medal. And I thought of how Blake would never get his medal or to see his family again. Of how he was killed because he wanted to be kind to the enemy. I thought of how, when Schofield woke, he must have thought he was in hell because of how the flares looked. And I thought of how he walked to the tree when the sun was setting. And of how he took out the pictures of his family. And the words come back to us.
Not all in the particular order but still. It's been five days yet I still tear up. It's a beautiful movie. I walked out changed."
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"This film is not really about war, but the soldiers that were in it. The film focuses on a soldiers journey through enemy territory to warn soldiers on the front line not to advance into a trap.It really takes you on a journey of friendship and loyalty. Most of these men were very young, in their teens. It's a brilliant well thought out story that will touch every person whom has a heart.I hope we never have to face another was like this. Our young men and women should live life with much happiness whilst we are free to do so.God bless the young men on both sides of the war whom fought for their country and was just doing their duty. Remember they all had families whom loved them as they loved theirs."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"The dedication of this movie is shown through the watching experience, it almost amazes me how minimal yet amazing the shots were, simply mind blowing.All accolades this film receives are thoroughly deserved, a masterclass of cinematography, sound editing and directing, no film in my personal opinion compares. The best war movie ever made. All credits go to the actors, the endurance and skill it must have taken to perfect the scenes must have been both physically and emotionally enduring.It takes you on a emotional and adrenaline filled journey, which leaves your heart and stomach in your mouth throughout, it embodies war and anguish creating what can simply be described as a complete cinematic experience, I could not take my eyes off the drama.It's poetic beauty of the fear of the unknown future during war time, the determination of brotherhood and the respect of comrades is shown through the the various scenes taken over a mere 24 hour period, whilst simultaneously making you feel you've known the characters for a lifetime. completely emotionally enticing.The emotional investment this film creates is almost unbelievable in nature, you empathise a lifestyle you could otherwise never imagine, all credits to the director and his team.Do not wait until this film is out on dvd, watch it in the cinema, you will never find a movie you feel more apart of ever in your lifetime. Congratulations to all involved."
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,"An undeniably great war film. The cinematography is unorthodox, where almost all the movie is composed of a utterly long, one take shot. This method adds layers of engagement to the audience as we see developments minute by minute very close to the characters. The subtle scores were mismerising. The deep emotional values subliminally streamed within the action teases your consciousness, push you further to think of dark struggles accompanying war."
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"I am beyond words after watching this movie. The whole way through I was on the edge of my seat. Performances from all actors were absolutely beautiful, but I could not be more impressed by how well George MacKay played his role. A cinematic beauty for sure. Well done once again to Same Mendes."
1917,1 February 2020,8/10,"Stanley Kubrick once said , ""If it can be written or thought , it can be filmed."" Sam Mendes's 1917 just reminds us how true that quote is . A retired military personal who fought World War I tells his grandson a story about the War. Years later the little boy is now a established movie director , only this time he decides to flim his grandfather's story & makes '1917 '.The First world war drama which has already won best picture honours at the Golden Globes , uses the ""one-shot"" format like Hitchcock's 'Rope' or Alejandro González Iñárritu's 'Birdman' . 1917 uses several takes and set-ups, seamlessly conjoined to give the appearance of a continuous cinematic POV, albeit with periodic ellipses. The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917.The storyline of the movie is very simple , there is no hidden plot or twist in it , but where the flim makes a difference is on technical ground . The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is only possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a living genius. The movie is shot beautifully and edited even more brilliantly by Lee Smith . It is always mesmerizing to a watch war movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The background score by Thomas Newman brilliantly holds up the audience .The climax scene where Schofield runs to the Commander through the battlefield reminds me of Nolan's Dunkrik , where Fionn Whitehead lies on the sand & the fighter planes drop off the bombs . Geroge MacKay has brilliantly potrayed his role as Corporal Schofiled . Dean Charles Chapman and Richard Madden (who only comes in the climax) also adapted the charecter well .The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance . The story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while.The entire cast deserves a round of applause for pulling this off. Modern flimmaking at it's best ! It will be a shame if this doesn't win the academy award for Best Cinematography though Parasite or Joker should win the award for Best Picture this year .This movie is epic visual treat . If 'My Way' shares the same spot with 'Saving Private Ryan' , this one will be sharing the spot with Nolan's 'Dunkirk'.Ratings - 8.6"
1917,20 February 2020,7/10,"Two minutes into this movie and it became hard to breath until the credits rolled. This movie was very thrilling and a whole lot of fun to see in the cinema. The sound and the music add to the anxiety of the film in a great way. However, this movie does have a lot of plot points that others have already mentioned that don't make a lot of sense and it's really hard to look past them.
Overall, the movie was fun but not one of the very best of 2019."
1917,14 October 2020,1/10,"So many plot faults, far too much emphasis on camera work and special effects. Totally unbelievable plot, just cannot believe this was based on a true story. I think it was part of a vivid imagination. Two soldiers in a bunker, big explosion, one is blinded, neither are deafened, and miraculously the blinded soldier gets his sight back within a minute of leaving the bunker. Neither are even slightly injured, even though they were within yards of the explosion. One soldier left on a highly important and secret mission and he tells a bunch of soldiers in the back of a van. The commanding officer, although aware of his mission just dumps him without support or backup. These are just two of countless examples of stupidity that totally ruined what could have been a great film. Camera work was superb, the acting okay, the story was just silly. Yet another example of modern directors putting effects before a story. I wish directors would watch the old black and white war films to understand true story telling."
1917,1 April 2020,10/10,"I can't anything more than what has already been said other than, Just watch it, fan of war based films or not just give it a try."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"Way overrated, yet beautyfully filmed picture. I went here because of all good reviews. But was disappointed. Not much story. Telling the story of World War One in a '12 year old' rating is impossible. It's like hell, wrapped in a nice giftbox with candy. Not good."
1917,24 August 2020,10/10,I just can say incredible . Since the movie start I get attracted to it . There were some scenes like the scenes of mother and baby that it was very sadly and it makes me cry that we will understand what torments they had.
1917,3 December 2020,8/10,"The plot, the cinematography, casting etc is just terrific. I personally loved the background score & the one shot format of shooting."
1917,4 March 2021,10/10,"I must say, it's probably the best war film I've seen in a while. Lived up to my expectations. These war heroes have been through hell and back. I applaud the actors and directors for this wonderful masterpiece."
1917,21 April 2021,10/10,One of the best war films I have seen in a long it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish it's one of them films you just take your eyes of the screen for a split second because I will miss something happening you real well made film with a cast of some people well known and some probably not so well known you have to watch this film if you haven't already I give this 10/10 it just that good.
1917,31 January 2020,5/10,"My expectations for ""1917"" were not to high since I am not a big fan of war themed movies, although I really enjoyed Dunkirk and Hawksaw Ridge. To put us simple, 1917 is a good movie if you look at it in a technical perspective. The way it was shot is undeniably amazing and it takes some talented crew to get the amazing result, making us believe it was made in one single shot (although we know that's not the case).
Unfortunately there's pretty much it about ""1917"". The plot is non existent. I am not being sarcastic, there's literally no story here aside from taking one message from point A to point B. That's it. There's an attempt to create some side stories with random characters that just came out of nowhere, but there's no emotional connection with any of them. And I think this is the major s problem with 1917: you don't feel any emotional connection with the characters and because of that I couldn't care less about what happened to the character's.
I honestly believe that if this movie was shot like any other movie, it would be easily forgotten because, like I said before, the story is nothing more than delivering a message. Period. And since the main character is mostly alone, you don't see any dialogue, any way for you to connect.
As much respect that I have for all the crew involved in this project, I must admit that it didn't work for me."
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"The cinematography of this film delivers in capturing a vision of the hell-scape of the WW1 battlefield in France. Many of the scenes are hauntingly surreal, my favorite being the night-fight lit only by flares overhead.I found myself frustrated by the main character's choices, though with the huge caveat that I have no idea how I would've actually reacted in his boots...and just as likely would've been one of the people pissing himself, paralyzed with fear like the captain in the final trench in the final battle.That said, the movie compels you to think ""what would you do?"" as we follow Blake and Scofield on their lonely mission. My gut instinct would've been to shoot the German pilot immediately in his burning plane, not try to rescue him. Likewise, the German NCO puking in the street at night from overindulgence with brandy was a sitting duck and I was hoping Scofield would shoot him in the head. He fails to do so and winds up having to strangle a German private with his bare hands a few minutes later--far more up close and personal and dangerous! Yes, shooting the German soldier in the street would've given away his position, but his surviving and yelling ""Engländer!"" did that anyway. Perhaps I've just played too many FPS videogames...I found myself frustrated to Scofield's choices at times. I found myself unsure what to do with the realization that I'm apparently a few degrees more bloodthirsty than he. He succeeds in his mission, so you can't argue with results, I guess. And the primary objective is to get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, not to waste time fighting Germans. The story has a ring of truth to it because he does (partially) succeed. If this were pure fiction aiming to convey a sense of nihilistic pointlessness of war, then the orders would've become unreadable after being dunked in the river with Corporal Scofield and the attack would've gone off to utter disaster anyway. Or at the very least Lt. Blake would've been lost in the first wave--but miraculously wasn't. Likewise, Scofield's flouting my expectations with his flawed but all too human (and humane) choices lends it an air of credibility as well. Truth is stranger than fiction at times.One of the limitations of film is that while it can show us the horrific landscape of twisted, bloated, rotting corpses of horses and men, it can't reproduce the equally horrific stench that would've driven many of us insane. Likewise, unless we have personal experience to draw on, we only have our imaginations to guess what the mud & cold and discomfort felt like, and the words of survivors who wrote down their experiences for posterity.I didn't know quite what to expect from this movie and while I did enjoy the aesthetic cinematic experience, like others commenting here I also felt vaguely disappointed and dissatisfied. We aren't given enough connection to the two main protagonists to care as much as we should about their plight. A flashback scene to Scofield's visit home, seeing family & friends but having the heaviness of knowing he had to return to the front might've helped this film, or giving us more of Blake's pre-war backstory....this is what got sacrificed for the sake of the illusion of ""one long take""...I also had minor quibbles with Corporal Scofield needlessly cycling the bolt action on his Lee Enfield, dramatically signaling his preparing to fight. The Lee Enfield rifle remains ever ready to fire after the first round is chambered. It's fine to show him run out of ammo and reload a fresh charger of ammo into the magazine, but beyond that he shouldn't be operating the bolt at all except between shots. But Hollywood & unreal Guns is a known cliche. Just eyeroll with it and get back to enjoying the story."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"This is a beautifully shot movie. So much so that if everything else about the movie was a little mediocre, it wouldnt actually matter very much.This of course is not the case though. 1917 delivers on every level and is a wonderful piece of film making. If you don't know the detail about how it was made, look it up, it is massively impressive.Technical stuff aside though, in a time where we are saturated with remakes, sequeals and spin offs, it's refreshing to see a good original story and get taken on a real journey by a great movie again.Do yourself a favour and watch it at the flicks, you will not regret it :)"
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I was looking forward to this movie for months and was somewhat disappointed. Not enough background into the characters, just endless footage of running though the trenches."
1917,17 February 2020,6/10,"I was very disappointed in the movie ; the acting was sub par I thought , did not like the one shot camera direction , lost creative opportunities I think . Seemed like a good story but we never saw the struggle and the obstacles , the character just meandered into half baked scenes that seemed rushed or not thought out . The lack of substance in the scenes and lack of honesty / intimacy with the characters left me feeling the movie was shallow and redundant . Not sure what everyone else saw in this movie , nothing on "" Saving P. Ryan "" ."
1917,17 April 2020,10/10,"Totally loved this movie. The 2 hours flew by, and was always on the edge of my seat. Best movie I have watched in years. Wish there were more masterclasses like this one.. It is so rare. Brilliant."
1917,30 January 2020,8/10,"The actors and story were awesome, but the actual filming at times made me feel as though i was in a VR or 3D movie, neither of which that i can visually tolerate without feeling ill . So so so so unfortunate. The scenery, scene set up, etc were outstanding. I lost 2 stars because it made it hard to enjoy my expensive seats and experience at the cinema."
1917,13 March 2020,10/10,"I heard so much about this film being fantastic. I couldn't wait to watch this film. As a ww1 and ww2 buff. So when I started watching it I was happy for the time. This film is so historically accurate in what they showed. Not only that but the way they filmed it, made you feel like that you was actually there. What it would have been like during that time. The actors was so convincing that they made you feel all the emotions that would have happened at each moment.
Never once was I disappointed. When I finished watched this, and had left the cinema. I was so emotional and upset. It's the first time I've felt like this after leaving the cinema. To the film producer who made this hats off to you. You made a fantastic film."
1917,18 March 2020,6/10,"The movie has a strong start visually, then gets all Elijah Woods- pale white guys staggering through scenery on a seemingly impossible mission, trading wooden dialogue.
It also reminded me of Dicaprio in 'The Revenant', where a white guy staggers through scenery and an implausible story, stuck together by an implausible plot.
Best not to see it in the cinema so you can play with your phone and make it through the two hours having done something useful."
1917,19 January 2020,3/10,"Boring, over rated, slow, no action, no memorable lines, mediocre acting, predictable plot, the only good thing is the cinematography. Wait till it is on your streaming service."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"A side note: I turned up at the local cineplex and the ticket person checked my ticket and pointed out the correct cinema showing 1917. I didn't think I had arrived late but it seemed to have already started. The scene was the trip by the vehicles through the mud and fallen trees. I picked up the story no problem. My impressions at this point of the movie was the extremely inappropriate music that sounded more in keeping with a Star Wars film than something set in World War I. I had similar issues with the movie 'Dunkirk'. Anyhow after 40 minutes the movie finished and I knew something was wrong. I checked back with (another) ticket collector and found that my session wouldn't be starting for 20 minutes. So I managed to see 1917 twice. At least some of it twice.
Seeing the beginning made me rethink a few of the issues I had initially felt. Yes the music was still inappropriate and as the volume and tension slowly increased we all knew that something was going to happen. Worse was that the music was continuous through, I guess, 90% of the movie. Why don't directors just leave everything to the sound effects department?
I also found that the slight overuse of profanity and gestures a bit out of period. Am open to correction here.
To the movie. When I first viewed it I was not conscious of the 'one shot' camera work until the final conflict. Seeing it from the beginning impressed me so much. The camera work and art direction deserve awards and what is sometimes overlooked is the extras casting. Absolutely brilliant.
The two leads had to hold the whole film together and they did that and more.
Ok, I have issues, but over all, if someone asked me what I thought, I would have to tell them that this was probably one of the most visually exciting movies of the past ten years."
1917,13 March 2020,9/10,"So many heartfelt reviews here. I want to focus on what delighted me most about this beautifully-shaped tale of a horrible war. English lit lovers take note!
The story opens in a lush April meadow where young Corporal Schofield blissfully dozes amid red poppy flowers, calling to mind an iconic WWI poem
which begins:""In Flanders fields the poppies grow/
Between the crosses, row on row/
That mark our place, and in the sky/
The larks, still bravely singing, fly/
Scarce heard amid the guns below./We are the Dead. Short days ago/
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset,/
Loved and were loved, and now we lie/
In Flanders fields.""Corporal Schofield, so pale and reedy, seems doomed beside his friend Corporal Bates, who looks much more vivid, alert and capable of pushing forward into their uncertain future. Later on, for instance, the two young men walk through a cherry orchard that's been deliberately destroyed by the retreating enemy: Bates confidently observes that the orchard can be restored with proper care and grow even better than before.
Soon after this scene, we encounter a war-battered officer, who quotes a popular verse from Rudyard Kipling's much-loved 1888 work ""The Winners:""""A friend in a pinch is a friend indeed,
But a fool to wait for the laggard behind
Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne
He travels fastest who travels alone.""One corporal falls by the wayside, the other proceeds alone. Does the survivor reach his goal unassisted? The movie's closing moments find us in another spring meadow beneath a ravaged but still living tree. What the corporal takes out of his pocket is a resounding answer to Kipling's poem and a message of hope.PS: In response to remarks that no Africans fought in WWI and the appearance of black soldiers in some scenes is ""too PC."" Britain, France, Belgium and Germany all had African colonies at the war's outbreak, and those colonies sent support troops. One million soldiers from 50 countries are buried in Flanders Field, which lies across southern Belgium and NW France. The US didn't enter the war until near the end, but segregated black American troops were among our contribution. After the Armistice, some black soldiers stayed in Europe rather than return to the US, where Jim Crow law reigned. Race riots broke out in northern US cities when returning black vets pushed back against the outrageous racist treatment that black Americans had taken for granted before WW I."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"Centering around 2 young Brittish soldiers, Blake and Schofield, tasked with a simple mission: cross enemy lines, into No Man's Land, and deliver a message to another battilion, countermanding an attack planned for the next day.Should the message not reach the batillion in time, 1,600 men (including Blake's brother) are likely to die at the hands of the Germans who lie waiting to spring their trap... With a refreshingly straightforward, momentum driven narrative, the audience is firmly placed in the trenches, alongside these soldiers as they make their way through the theatre of war.Director, Sam Mendes, and cinematographer, Roger Deakens, achieves this immersive feat by having shot the film to appear as one continous take, from a single viewpoint. The camera follows our heroes closely and without cutting away, through the entire, unrelenting experience - keeping the tension and dread squarely within focus.While the direction and camerawork is without a doubt a technical achievement, the stylistic choices could easily have been considered a gimmick, having the (ironically) adverse effect in taking its audience out of the experience. Thankfully, this is not the case, as the various facets of the production are seamlessly executed with mastery and care. This includes the gritty set pieces that will have your heart pounding at the same rate as the protagonists, holding your breath as they progress through booby trap laden trenches, enemy-infested buildings and perilous river waters.The film's casting should also be commended for having the restraint to put some of Britain's greatest thespians in the smallest of supporting roles. Instead, the film is led by two relatively unknown actors, giving the audience the opportunity to invest fully in the story and characters - without viewing it through the usual, artificial lens of A-list stars.Overall, the entire production is put together with a strong vision ans clear focus.
Immersive, hard hitting and unforgiving - an epic, in the grandest sense of the word. This one is not to be missed and demands to be experienced on the big screen. 10/10"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece and is going to be remembered as one of the finest war movies ever made. The movie is not about its story, it's about bringing out a real war scene on the screen."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"The one-shot gimmick that Birdman used so well is dialed up and used to perfection in this film, to help immerse you in the experience being portrayed. This is truly the work of masters of the craft of film. The two leads should have no trouble getting hired, because not even Leo in The Revenant worked as hard as they did.
Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, I could actually see what was going on in the movie at any given moment, with nothing hiding behind shaky camera work. The tension is nearly constant. The score only enhances that. This is the best movie of 2019, and a must-see on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible."
1917,26 February 2020,8/10,"I went to see ""1917"" tonight as a sure way to cheer me up. Indeed, what better way to put a string of bad days into perspective than a WWI story! The Spanish flu - admittedly worse than COVID-19, as far as we know it - did not even need to be covered, since it broke out one year later and 1917 was horrendous enough in its own right.
Anyway. I was still irritated that the two ""expendables"" sent on a quest were consistently treated like s*** by the top brass (sender, receiver and the random motorized one with no situational awareness) and only got support from peers and mid level officers. That's way too predictable.
Then, there is the question of motivation : whether you're gung-ho or a reluctant follower, when you're expendable, you're not gonna expect fairness and the only question is how far you're going to push yourself and... yeah... why? Because you, somehow you're still a nice human being, in the middle of all that nonsense? Hence, you accept to be played and act more badass than the rest of the losers ?? Let's face it, most get mangled or killed, no matter their role or attitude. That's just l'esprit du temps (Or should I say, Zeitgeist? This movie could have been very similar, if shown from the Germans' perspective.)"
1917,6 June 2020,6/10,The one shot novelty wares off quickly. After that your are on a journey of sorts that I can only explain is the cinematic equivalent of drinking tap water IN 4K! Worth a watch but don't expect a ground breaking new story to be told.
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"1917 follows the actions of a few days in April 1917. The Germans have retreated, but airial recon has identified that they are not in flight, but rather this is an organised retreat to an already prepared line.However the Devon's don't know and they are due to attack. Blake (Chapman) and Schofield (MacKay) are selected to run through the area vacated by the Germans and give the warning. This begins the film, and it follows the two Lance Corporals as they make their way through no-mans land; the German trenches and the terrors that wait beyond.This is a great film; paying homage to those who fought in Europe whilst not glorifying the Great War. Recommended."
1917,19 January 2020,4/10,"More like slow, lot's of pointless dialogue, ...One of the main characters (thankfully, the irritating one) get's stabbed trying to save a German downed pilot when he was determined to get to his brother not 5mins prior! Dies a minute later and is already blue in the face?There's a cow on an ""abandoned"" the farm, but there's a bucket 3/4 full of fresh milk but neither look for anyone?Then all of a sudden, two soldiers appear and help out. Where did they just appear from because the farm was surrounded bu open hills at least 200m all round?Cinematography and loud orchestral music does NOT make a movie, especially when that music is trying to convey emotion but just does not fit with the scene!Compare this to Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, both of which I've watched about 5 times because the story, characters, etc were believable and GREAT!Average at best and fast forward to the end after the first hr!"
1917,11 January 2020,3/10,"If you love war films, don't bother with this..
This films was close but soo far.. A few moments jumped the shark and were just un realistic.. I had issues with some of the vfx that looked soo fake and a really weird sound mix.. When the German war plane crashed this film early jumped the shark. This film didn't totally suck, but when 100m is spent.. It's way off the mark.. Stream it for free in a few years.."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"Sure, it had a few good cinematic shots.But the story felt hollow - cardboard cutout characters - generic message delivery through enemy lands. Almost feel like they did it by the numbers."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,I'm at a loss for words to describe how Great a Movie this was. Wow!
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"Im really happy that there are still good movies in the making! I always liked war movies for some reason but I thought I've seen them all. This one is different! there is so much emotion and good character development sometimes you forget you are watching a war movie! the cast was good and the cinematography was perfect! the way this movie was shouted deserved a price. Some scenes remember me to the classic movie drom Pink Floyd The Wall which took place on the 1th WW.
I went to see this movie with my 12 year soon and he told me at the end this was the best movie he ever saw! I can understand for him at his age. This was a really good start!
It was a perfect father and soon moment!"
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"First of all i want to say how much i loved that movie
this movie was funny scary thrilling and sad at the same time
every thing about this movie was quality
from the direction to the acting to the music
but one thing was really exceptional that was the cinematography it was breathtaking
watching this movie in IMAX screen is the only way to go"
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"Underwhelming. The ""single shot"" might be technically brilliant but it's distracting and didn't really work for me.
The plot and characters are weak - barely believable at times.
It's an ""ok"" film but don't believe the hype."
1917,1 June 2020,8/10,"Amazing from a cinematographic point of view. Quite moved when I realised at the end that it is based on real events!!
I still can't get over how the whole movie is like one long countinuous scene . I've Never seen a movie filmed like that and it absolutely blew me away. What a film! Tension from start to finish and really cleverly filmed. War is an awful thing. Sam Mendes has made a phenomenal movie."
1917,7 September 2020,5/10,"The first 20 minutes of this film are great. But then the trick of the one shot wears off and leaves us with a movie that is constrained and has nothing to tell us. It all feels like a cheap video game. There are so many elements of the story that are contrived: booby trap set off by rats, plane crash right into the two guys, milk in a bucket while everything is destroyed, sniper missing target but getting hit himself, stupid germans only, rapids and water fall in the North of France, singing soldiers within distance of enemy, trees in the middle of nowhere, trucks appearing in no mans land, destroyed town without rubble, but chiming, and countless more. It's like the director is testing us how far he can go with stupid made-up scenes. Most of them are not even necessary to tell the story. Even the landscape feels like an unreal CGI world. Dialogue is often boring and redundant. Really disappointed with this movie."
1917,28 January 2020,8/10,"Simple story, yet touching, a look of the final stage of World War I through the look of a soldier who needs to carry an important message far beyond no man's land. The staging is amazing, there are diverse sceneries which do not repeat in the movie and, specially the trenches, are recreated in a realistic way. The sound mix gets you into the mood of the film and have touching compositions. The camera is in third person, so you go with the protagonist throughout his journey. I think that there were some part of the story that could have been closed in a better way at the end, but overall the film gets you into the suffering of this soldier and the struggle to fulfill his important mission, while getting the audience into a clear representation of the life at the trenches."
1917,22 January 2020,8/10,Don't fool yourself. This isn't just a movie. This is truly piece of art. Most amazing cinematography i ever seen in one of the most realistic war movies on all times. 20 years after winning first Oscar the time comes for another one for Sam Mendes.
1917,23 July 2020,10/10,"How can I say that? The direction is flawless. The cinematography is exquisite. George MacKay's performance is a master-class lesson in realism. The signs in the trenches. The fountain scene. The flares lighting the night. The score. The Wayfaring Stranger, with wet, bone-weary, hungry, young shell-shocked MacKay. Each well thought out piece of this puzzle fits in exactly with the next, making this the most raw and beautiful picture I have ever seen. Wow! Well done, all."
1917,26 February 2020,7/10,"1917 is a film with a very well achieved use of a long shot, which has an intention to the message of the film. The film represents a cyclical process of the characters. In the opening shot the characters start on the floor, resting. This first shot is a static one of a grass and some flowers and we begin to back off, this means that what allows us to rest will be moving away more and more from us. Or worse, we are the ones who move away from that.That last idea expresses the disagreement against the war that the film (and every good war movie has) communicates. This is indicated with false conformism in all soldiers along the way. From the ironic names of the trenches, to the attitude of the captain before leaving the trenches.The film generates empathy by including a human purpose to the war, such as avoiding the death of a brother and saving many men who will unnecessarily go to fight. The purpose of the long one shot is to generate that trip that seems to have no return. Then, we realize that it does have an end. The surviving character ends as he starts resting in a tree. Of course, the difference is that now he is alone and that is the difference between the beginning and the end of both the film and the war.An important and symmetrical element during the film are the flowers seen at the beginning, these appear in moments of calm, in the most sacred moments taken from the war situation. The flowers can be seen at the beginning, when a character dies and finally at the end of the movie, representing that the character returned to that place where he can rest."
1917,4 May 2020,2/10,"MEH.
Didnt like it, wouldnt watch it again. Boriiing."
1917,19 January 2020,2/10,"This is one of those ""emperor's new clothes"" movies that everyone seems to think they have to say they like.
Well, I hated it. What a bore-fest. I didn't realise that during WW1 it was so easy to walk about in the open having a chat - and that's pretty much all that happens.
A total waste of time."
1917,11 April 2020,6/10,"I watched the movie after seeing all the hype about it and after recommendations from friends .. and ngl i didnt get why the hype.i cant deny i really liked the visual experiance and the film was directed very good .. it was the only thing i enjoyed about the film.in my modest opinion the decision that the movie would be made as a one long shot (thogh it was executed in the best way possible) wasnt the right decision .. let me explain ..being a long shot the time of the movie and its events was very short .. the whole events of the film took place in only 2 hours .. even on the front that is a shirt time for alot of events to happen so most of the events wasnt realistic to happen for our ""heros"" and most of it felt like it was put there to happen .. the mouse to run into the wire only when they was there .. the german plan to crash just at there feets and just when they arrive .. the germans to kill all the cows and just leave this one to our heros.also the movie is filled with dum decisions and dum war cliches that was hard to believe."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"Throughout the film there are some cinematically beautiful scenes, and a clear style throughout. A personal story from the director adds to the films emotion and story.However I couldn't help feeling that something was missing. The handful of inaccuracies were not a major issue for me, as opposed to some of the other more critical reviews on here.The film started to take a ""Revenant"" turn from approximately 30 mins in, whereby we saw the main character running from place to place avoiding death and pulling through terrible experiences but started to feel overly dramatised at times.The acting didn't come across real to me, and although there are certainly some stand-out performances, overall it did feel like watching actors rather than an original, heartfelt performance that the director intended.We did see the visuals of the horrors of World War one but overall it lacked some of the grit to add the depth and emphasis to make this truely poignant with the viewers.I wanted to love this film but something was certainly missing for me and it would not be justified to pretend otherwise!"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Roger Deakins is the best cinematographer of all
time. Good story but the cinematography is amazing"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is an emotionally exhausting thrill ride that gets under your bones every time the speakers go roaring. Crafted with great technical expertise, 1917 ropes you in completely and takes you on a journey from start to finish, in what looks like one single shot. If you thought the single shot thing was just marketing and it's not really going to be like a single shot then hold your horses your buddy because you're in for a surprise. It obviously is not shot in one single take but the work done to make it look like a one shot movie is remarkable. Sam Mendez and Roger Deakins have given us a movie that is going to be remembered for a long long time.👌🏼👏🏼P.S: Thomas Newman's background score is priceless💓"
1917,5 April 2020,10/10,Wow just wow incredible in all ways! Sound design to no camera cuts wow..
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,This film was very well done to the extend that you grasp for air as you go along with the cast in their journey. Each scene was the epitome of perfection. There are no words to describe the cinematography skills that was used for this masterpiece.
1917,17 October 2020,9/10,"The film 1917 is in my best 5 movies of all time.
To the reviewers citing the films 'limited battle scenes' or 'limited shooting & explosions,' you would be correct. However, you seem to be missing the objective of this film. 1917 shies away from more chaotic battle scenes in favour of conveying a human story. It focuses on mate-ship, the horror of war, bravery, loss, atrocity, solitude, repression, and so on.
1917 conveys its message with a somewhat masterful touch.
If you are hoping for a war flick packed to the rafters with action, try films like 'Hacksaw Ridge' or 'Saving Private Ryan.' 1917 provides a realistic take on warfare. It does not provide extensive battles nor does it have any intention of doing so."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Hands down this is the best movie of 2019, everything was exceptional. History, acting, direction, editing, sound design, etc. Simply blown away with this jewel."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"I'll keep this review short.It was really amazing to watch. The one take camera effect surely benefitted this movie.
The story was really solid and there were some good anti-climaxes in it. WW1 was also generally a good idea since it's not talked about as much as WW2, so this movie gave a good view on that as well and the actors did an amazing job. I really was immersed and felt
the emotions with all these dead/dying soldiers.Definitely going to re-watch this in the near future."
1917,28 March 2020,5/10,"It was hollow and boring. Not what you thought it was, in the wrong ways. It's like being catfished on tinder."
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,"The movie, 1917, is a fine example of both the art and craft of film making. Human tragedy is part all life and will always remain so. Although we always know how things will turn out, we return over and over to tragic stories."
1917,16 January 2020,8/10,"Watching this movie was exhausting, and I mean that in the best way possible because it was just gripping. It felt like you were right beside these soldiers who were taking you on journey through the haunting lands of the first world war. It was brutal. In the first 2/3 of the movie not once did I feel safe. I mean this literally as I thought my heart would give in. Even when the situation seemed calm, you never really felt safe. This was a massive achievement by the director because I rarely ever feel that way in a movie.I've heard criticism about the lack of characters in this. On that front I'd have to disagree. I felt the character building was more than sufficient and very subtle at times as well. I remember watching Dunkirk which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as this due its decision to leave out any character building as I felt what they were going for wasn't nearly as effective as the accomplishments made by this movie.I went to see this blind and I really recommend avoiding any spoilers or trailers for the full experience. This is definitely one of those movies you watch and think to yourself - ""how have they even made this!?"" I thought they were exaggerating when they said it was going to be just one shot but it really feels like that.Performances were brilliant, I didn't know the cast going in and so I saw some short but lovely surprises, and Game of Thrones fans are also in for an interesting dynamic.Roger Deakins is easily one of my favourite cinematographer (as I imagine is the same with many), and again I had no idea he worked on this movie going in. I knew i came out of cinema thinking I wanted to know who was responsible for some of the mesmeric shots I saw in this movie and I wasn't surprised at all when I figured out it was him. If you've seen his work, you know you're in for some delightful lighting.I will say that I haven't given this a higher rating because I do feel like it is very much a ''cinematic'' experience. In other words, i don't feel like I would enjoy this movie nearly as much as I would on any other platform. A tiny nitpick for an otherwise massive accomplishment."
1917,22 January 2020,5/10,"It has to be said, British War movies are boring.Dunkirk 2.0Waste of time"
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Review - 1917WW1 flick not unlike the very disappointing Dunkirk. However, this is superb. A class above in all aspects. Well-done Sam Mendes.The cinematography in this film is something to behold, the way the camera follows our 2 English soldiers around immerses you into battlefields of the undisclosed locations.The plot revolves around 2 privates sent on a mission to stop an attack on German lines that will end in certain death for the battalion. Not unlike Gallipoli.The story never stalls and includes some close quarter combat, major battle scenes and raw emotion.What I loved about this is it's artistry. A technical masterpiece of film making and unlike Dunkirk it maintains the one story the whole way along.Don't be fearful of blood and gore, it's no Saving Private Ryan in that regard but it doesn't lack because of that. Quite the opposite.The only negative is that there could have been some extra character development or back story but I'm being over critical.This will surely win an Oscar for cinematography. Hands down some of the best camera work I've seen.Go see this at the cinema.9/10Highly recommended"
1917,14 February 2020,8/10,"The movie is impressive by its reality and immersion on the WWI period, the caos, the communication problems and the visuals of trenches are just some of the things that made me fell in this historical conflict. The continuity and the non felling of cuts could be revolucionary."
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,"As far as my recollection goes, 1917 is one of the best WW1 movies I have ever watched. Directed by Sam Mendes, who has given a wide variety of genre movies, I knew I'm in for a treat. Coming to the plot of the movie, it's straight forward. There are no twists, turns or cliff hangers. So yes, the highlight of the movie is not it's story but the way in which a simple plot was presented to the viewers.Using the concept of 'One shot' editing, the film is captured in one continuous motion, where the viewers are experiencing the movie in real-time. It is flawlessly executed. The kind of tension built at particular scenes in nerve wrecking. Cinematography gets a big thumbs up. Music composed fits really well into the scene (especially a folk song sung in the movie).Acting by the two main leads is great. Unexpected and surprising cameos.Top contender of oscars."
1917,30 January 2020,8/10,Loved the production and the look but the story to me takes a dive when the brother gets killed. Why would you pull your enemy out of a burning plane and then give him water ? Why wouldn't you just shoot him?
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"Depressing and slow...it's understandable that war is an ugly reality, however, the story here has very little depth.I've seen better....."
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"I saw my first movie in 1948 - Bambi :)Over all the years since then I've seen great, good, bad and indifferent movies and then there comes along the occasional magnificent achievement in filmmaking.
I rate 1917 in the latter category.It grabbed me right from the start and it never let go. I walked and ran every step of the way with the characters. I was so involved I never even noticed any the big names that appeared in the end credits. I was very glad I never watch trailers or clips or read reviews in advance of seeing a movie. They always give something away.Others have rightly praised the one-shot style, editing, the widescreen cinematography, set design, the score etc. They are absolutely stunning.Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are very convincing in portraying two ordinary soldiers plunged by circumstances into a situation they could never have envisaged. It's not really a ""war movie"" in the true sense. It's a story of courage and determination in the face of massive odds.I am beyond understanding how anyone could rate 1917 as boring. It will long live in the memory."
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,"This is a powerful film. It is also visually beautiful. A lot has been said about the single shot format and it's all true. The scenery and the imagery is incredible and you can feel the enormous size of the setting and the undertaking. There is really no reason not to see this film.One thing to be said about this film is that it does not glorify war. It is not an anti-war film. But it seamlessly highlights the horror and absurdity of WWI. I think that is just as important as anything else. It highlights the honor of the soldiers and their personal struggles while not glorifying what was one of the greatest slaughters in history.Another thing, the usage of wayfaring stranger was jarring. WowI absolutely recommend this film, to everyone."
1917,30 November 2020,8/10,"MY OPINIONThe acting1917 was filmed to look like a continuous shot. To that end, it was essential for Mendes' actors to be as prepared as possible for each take, as the longest one was about 8 minutes long! The movie must have been a tremendous challenge for the crew.The score1917's OST has been composed by Thomas Newman, an old-time veteran when it comes to movie soundtracks. Although not the same, Newman's score could be somewhat similar to that of Hans Zimmer, in its attempt to get an air of solemnity, sadness, and despair. We can point that Newman's piece entitled ""Tripwire"" is very similar to Hans Zimmer's ""Why So Serious?"" from The Dark Knight.The direction/cinematographic qualities?Mendes didn't just want to make a beautiful film; he wanted it to be as detailed as possible. He wanted the film to look as if it took place in WWI trenches-dead bodies, rats, and anything that comes with it. He wanted spectators to feel like they've been side to side with the soldiers in the trenches; not like watching the film from a third-person perspective. Sam Mendes' technical and visual triumph was thus rewarded with the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar.
The sound/visual effects/general aesthetic/atmosphere?The Academy Award-winning Visual Effects and Sound Mixing represents the brilliant attention to detail to keep the story tense and alive. The resulting atmosphere grasps the audience's from the very beginning till the end of the movie to live a real cinematographic experience.The story?The story is pretty much a one-liner: deliver this message as fast as possible or people will die. In many ways, 1917 reminds of Saving Private Ryan, throughout a ""one-mission movie"". I believe Sam Mendes' goal wasn't to deeply develop the story nor the characters but rather more on the making of a technical masterpiece.The effect on the audience?Immersively accomplished, 1917 draws one into the absolute insanity of the terrifying moments of WWI. Here you will feel like you're walking along with these guys.REVIEWEven though I had fulfilled the Academy-Award winning 1917 with high expectations, mainly because of the ""one-take"" feeling watching the movie. Still, that's the very reason that kept me from watching the movie, as I thought it could turn it into a '70s movie. Poor me, I was so wrong...Listed as a cinematographic masterpiece, 1917 is a rather thrilling journey, with even greater intensity than most recent horror movies. Sam Mendes slowly escalates the stressful atmosphere until uncovering everything in the last 20 minutes. We follow the fortunes of these two British soldiers for 110 minutes with a smooth, good-looking ""continuous shot"". The slick strategy with which Mendes tries to fool us is brilliant. This one-take feeling intensifies the tension and urgency of the British Soldiers' mission, as we experience the events mostly in real-time, from the characters' perspectives. Moreover, this technique gives the movie an unblinking stance towards the horrors of WWI, since the audience can't avoid the macabre chaos from this non-stop take.
1917's cinematography is captivating. There are so many significant close-ups picturing a thousand words from those two soldiers about both their background and psychological impact from WWI. While the film is mostly grisly and sinister, there are moments of beauty and humanity, the best thing is that Mendes knows when to return from those close-ups to show the shocking nature of the battlefield. (SPOILERS) The scene taking place at the French bombed village with the woman and its baby act as a poignant moment of grace and magic that shines through the darkness. This moment of benefits both the rhythm of the movie while developing the character's feelings. (END OF SPOILERS)
Both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are amazing, as they are the roots of 1917 and also had the tedious task of carrying the movie mainly from their acting skills. (SPOILERS)MacKay's sprinting in the dark within the bombed village is one of the most incredible and widening pictures I've seen in a long time!(END OF SPOILERS)
An aspect I didn't expect to be that great from 1917 is Newman's score. Indeed, Newman's music is often more pronounced whereas, in 1917, it acts more as an ambiance, pretty much inspiring from Hans Zimmer's style. Therefore, the soundtrack enhances the atmosphere of each scene and its intensity.Mendes' 1917 is, in conclusion, one of the best movies I've seen in months. It's an extremely nervous experience with perfect performances and some of the most stunningly beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It left me completely aware of the futility of war. Not to have seen this movie in the theater as I did is a real mistake, as the experience it provokes must be even more powerful. I rate this film 8/10 as I think it's one of the best War movies I've seen, still, he's no match for The Last Samurai, and equivalent in intensity to Hacksaw Ridge, The Hurt Locker or Fury."
1917,9 January 2020,10/10,Sam menedes did an incredible job and the actors were great
1917,10 March 2020,10/10,"This movie reminded me a lot of Dunkirk because of the emotions it forces you to deal with from start to finish. And The King because of the way in which it depicts war. This movie has you tense from start to finish. You're constantly worrying what horrible thing is going to happen next to all of these young largely innocent boys and men. No one on either side of no man's land was responsible for the war and yet they were the ones paying the worst price. I always wonder how many incredible athletes, teachers, musicians, doctors and etc. Are lost in conflicts like this.The movie doesn't shy away from violence, but unlike some war movies that are more about the action and explosion of war this one like the king, wanted you to deal with the misery. In the king you see how small wars in that era were. In 1917 you see how large and random they are, but the portrayal of battle was significantly more quiet than I expected. Who knows what is truly accurate, but im the same age as many of those people that fought in that war and it gripped my heart like no other movie has. Incredible."
1917,29 January 2020,8/10,"It is a technically beautiful film, it is a very well designed and used sequence plan simulator, the sound effects are magnificent and the soundtrack is great with only one part or another that I thought ended up not matching the film. The photography is good going to spectacular in some takes, the film has a simple story and very well told.
Despite this, the film does not create any charisma with the characters presented in the plot, which ends up affecting the emotional part of the film. The dramatic parts of the film are hardly touching due to the lack of development of the characters, you know very little about them and barely know their names, which in my opinion ends up impacting the complete work.
I liked the ways the camera is positioned, it brings a feeling of war games in the first person, and what adds even more to this feeling is really looking like it is a game with several stages throughout the film and between those stages there is always something happening that disturbs you to go through that with tranquility.
At the same time that the film shows the real grief and chaos of the war in some moments it boasts as something that brings honor to man.
It's a very good film and it's worth taking a chance and checking it out."
1917,14 May 2021,8/10,I was recommended this by a friend and put off watching it due to lack of interest in this type of movie. After watching i see why there was such a hype about it as it did have a lot to offer and gave much insight into how things were.The cast played their roles very well and the realism in their faces was astounding i would watch again but again not my first choice of movie.
1917,14 March 2020,9/10,"I can't really add much to the praise that has been heaped on this film. It has a method which it follows with great purpose, taking you into the raw experience of two ordinary soldiers as they set out on their mission. It is filmed in real time, and the tension never lets up, even in the quieter moments. There are no artificial, invincible heroes - just men struggling to survive through constant vigilance, and it becomes more and more gripping as the action advances.When the film was over, I suddenly found myself crying my eyes out - not through sadness, but through a massive release of emotional tension that I hadn't really been aware of.I would urge anyone to see this film at the cinema, rather than wait for the small screen. You need the full impact of the Cinema to fully appreciate this film."
1917,15 February 2020,5/10,"I am not going into huge details but.Very realistic, especially fighting and characters, especially being sick in background or panicking really shows how traumatic it wasTimes I thought it was rushed and boring and there was some plot holes which were off. All germans have stormtrooper aim, but again it's a movie. Generally good. But it isnt kn my favourite war movies. It's worth going to watch tho"
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,"Yes , I'm quite an old fart . Old enough to still vividly remember year 1970 , when my grandfather told me a chilling story from WWI . In 1914 he was enlisted in Austro Hungarian forces , his cousin also . I still have original , framed , enlarged photo of that cousin in uniform , taken in early 1915 .
Anyway , I remember painful , sad expression on my grandfathers face , when he told me how his cousin died right beside him in a trench of Russian front
in 1917 . He was shot by a sniper . My grandfather wrote an exact date of his cousins enlisting and death on backside of that photo . . He also told me how horrible the soldiers
suffered in those trenches . It actually pains me while I'm writing this , and I can feel the soldiers pains when I read E.M. Remarques ""All Quiet On Western Front"" .
And this movie , while not bad at all , IMHO , fails to expose the true dread and emotions that this book , my grandfathers stories and other , much better war movies do ."
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"This movie really puts you on the edge of your seat it really does. i love war movies like this it's only 1 cut which is really really awesome. It just keeps you watching and watching it is a 10/10 for me if you love war movies if you love movies that keep you on the edge of your seat this is the one for you. It is a sad movie, emotional, powerful, and action. it really is a powerful movie that everyone needs to see."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was phenomenal! every single thing about this was amazing, from start to finish! Many people are gonna say that it wasn't that good cause of the simple plot! But the outstanding cinematography and the music is what makes this movie so special! Best two hours of my life!!"
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"You may know by now, but the movies ""continuous shot"" style is beyond amazing. The clever shooting and editing make this movie a masterpiece. The action was all believable and the drama felt real. If you're a fan of war movies, this may end up topping your list of favorites. Do yourself a favor and see this movie."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,This film really surprised me. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen this yet. It's got great pacing and great music when needed. Every character compliments each other well. As the characters don't talk that much and there is more depth with the expressions and actions. An absolute masterpiece. Definitely recommend 10/10 best film of the year
1917,21 April 2020,3/10,"Frankly, the movie was assinine. Childish. Pathetically unrealistic.
The Germans can't shoot anything, accuracy is only for the Allies. The writing was so cheesey it boggles my mind anyone wrote this in the modern era. It's more like a terrible 50s movie. It even has one of the most cliched tropes in movies: our protagonist escapes all the enemies by jumping into the river. Someone needs to grow an imagination.If you're not an intelligent adult, you might find this compelling."
1917,7 February 2020,10/10,"Wonderful movie!I usually don't really enjoy war movies so much but to me this was more than that; many war movies tend to romanticize what war is but 1917 didn't.
War is brutal, dark, cruel and that's the way movies should show it to us and this one did a great job.You'll feel anxious and tense during the whole movie and I believe that's how it should be, at points it made me want to cry and at some others it made my stomach turn, it made me wish for an ideal world.George Mackay's performance is absolutely beautiful as well as the photography, the scenery.
The music was terrific, it was there when it needed to be and silence presented itself when it was needed too.Wonderful movie, definitely one of my new favorites."
1917,19 February 2020,7/10,"I mostly enjoyed this movie however the more I think about the whole shtick of the film (being the fact it was done in 'one take' the less impressive it is. Some of the 'hidden' cuts are so obvious they might as well have been edited conventionally. For example multiple times the camera will clearly cut behond cgi elements or when the characters go into a dark tunnel and the screen goes completely pitch black. Also there is literally a cut to black halfway through the film so they didn't even stick to the whole 'one take' thing. George McKay is great in this and the rest of the supporting cast are also good. There are also some great set pieces. I enjoyed the film a lot, but the more I've thought about it the more the concept has soured."
1917,19 March 2020,10/10,I was subconsciously holding my breathe almost the entire movie. Crazy how a movie can be shot in such a way that it has an extreme impact physically on the viewers body. Go see this in a theater if possible and sit fairly close to the screen for best effect.
1917,23 April 2020,9/10,This movie is a masterpiece. The whole movie in a single shot the clever cinematography never even makes us think of the invisible cuts. Also the climax was awesome creating the hype and an excellent ending. Everyone acted so well and it obviously deserves 3 oscars it had gained.
1917,20 April 2020,6/10,"First of all, my biggest gripe with this movie is that it had so much potential to be great. I was going into it picturing masterfully choreographed fight scenes, and excellent scenes of tension. What I got just, wasn't that. The ""One Take"" thing felt more like a gimmick and there wasn't anything that struck out to me as amazing. The script was pretty bad and the weak plot kind of stuck out like a sore thumb. Also the music got in the way at times, which took away from the tension. I would've liked no music for those scenes to really amp up the tension. But i thought there were some good things too. The set design is great, there are some cool visuals, the acting is pretty good, and despite not having amazing action, there were some pretty cool scenes. But overall, it's not what people are making it out to be."
1917,25 April 2020,10/10,"Brilleant cinematography, super direction, quality experience, frame by frame bloddy hell planning, invisible computer works,technically, story and acting best best beat"
1917,12 June 2020,8/10,"This film does not have a grand war scene, but talks about human beings in war. From enemy to comrade-in-arms, the scene of the dead is filled with the background of the whole film. A close-up of a woman in a retreating enemy trench; Redemption and revenge for the enemy; In the firelight, Schofield sees a hungry French woman in the basement with a newborn baby; All this was sublimated when he finally climbed out of the water and heard the ballad in the forest. Originally an innocent soldier, he was accidentally picked by his comrade Blake to complete this ""impossible task""; From the initial complaint, to the acceptance out of friendship, to the courage to be saved by a comrade, to carry something with you in the end -- these are the things that are most memorable in the war, the story that director Sam Mendes's grandfather lived and will never forget, and the key factor that moves the film from seven to eight stars."
1917,6 March 2020,1/10,"There have been a lot of war movies, so if someone has to do a new movie the standards have to be high. Although it scores well in cinematography the story is quite weak and the pace is extremely slow. Overall you get the feeling why did they bother?"
1917,3 November 2020,10/10,This is a masterpiece of craft that should be studied and enjoyed for years. A masterpiece that everyone should see!
1917,28 February 2021,9/10,"Love the one take style, keep the pressure building throughout the whole film and think the cinematography is epic. Sam Mendes has made a masterpiece!"
1917,31 December 2020,6/10,"It was decent, but not the ""greatest war movie ever made"" as some people claim. Platoon takes that title.Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 150 characters."
1917,24 August 2021,9/10,"Sure, it may sound like a simple small story, and an equally simple mission, but don't be fooled! This small simple story is played out in a huge, heart pounding, neck, forehead, and palm sweaty, body trembling, and tear trickling way!It's April, 1917, World War I. Two British soldiers have a mission: deliver a message to the Colonial, ordering him to call off the attack that will take place on the Germans the following morning; the Allies are walking into the Enemy's trap, according to surveillance photos, and must be stopped from going forward! If you think this mission and message delivery will be easy, you're dead wrong!I saw this war film in the theaters with my Dad, and I loved it so much! What a horrific, but brave and hopeful adventure these two soldiers had! The director Shawn Mendes pulled off an incredible style of using mostly long, continuous shots, only cutting when the screen goes black from an event that occurs on the mission! The set design is extraordinary, the (practical) effects are SO lifelike (and gross looking), and the two main performances are star making!Don't miss this epic little story within the bigger story of World War I, a general step in a series of steps to ensure peace and freedom for the world! You'll gasp, cringe, cry, and smile! 1917 is a year (and movie) you'll definitely want to visit, and witness!"
1917,23 January 2020,7/10,"From the moment the movie began I found myself a little unsure as to how to take it. I was hoping for a realistic feel but beyond the look of the movie there isn't much about this you can buy into. The acting was quite stilted at times and the script and characters were off the mark. Visually it's fantastic but that can't carry a film alone, especially not one dealing with sensitive historical subject matter like this. The language used and the banter was not true of the time. The situations the main protagonists find themselves in from one moment to the next are at times believable and then immediately unbelievable. It was entertaining and spectacular to watch but it isn't a masterpiece in as much as it was badly cast and way too far fetched."
1917,6 February 2020,4/10,"The first issue I have is with set design, the movie posits the trenches as a bit muddy but not too bad. The plot ambles from device to device to keep it moving but I was more and more incredulous the longer it went on. The 'single' shot was impressive and immersive but let down by the wider portrayal of the action. Many critical reviews have made the same observations I would so I won't labour the points, but it reflects badly on the other offerings we've had this year that this film has got the accolades that it has."
1917,4 November 2020,5/10,"Plot:
""Hey two soldiers, deliver this message to someone.""""Okay, sure""Run run run, coming to earlier enymies line. No ones left.
Run run run, reaching an abandoned house, watching two English planes fighting a german plane at the sky. German plane goes down, 10 cm next to the soldiers. They rescue the german pilot from fire then the german soldier kills soldier nr 1 with a knife.
Soldier nr 2 gets a pick up by other soldiers who are suddenly there too. They drive him until they reach a brigde they cant pass with their cars. Soldier 2 continues to walk and as he steps out the vehicle he gets under attack from a single shooter. He kills the shooter.
Run Run Run. Soldier comes to a destroyed town, flirts with a french woman. Talks to her child, leaves them. Runs again, and walks into a german Justin Biber. Kills him too and runs from other nearby germans. He jumps into a river. Some meters later he manages to get out the water and walks into a group of English soldiers who are listening to a singer. He looks for Coronel Mckanzie but Mckanzie is not there. He runs again because Coronel Mckanzie is some meters away at front line. He finds him, tells him to stop the attack because it is a trap. Sherlock aka Mckanzie won´t listen to him till he reads the letter Soldier 2 has brought with him. Attack stopped.
Then he looks for the brother of recently died soldier 1. Tells him that soldier 1 is dead. Brother is sad and says: ""thank you anyway""
Soldier 2 chills at a tree. The End.For god sake."
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"1917 starts with two soldier boys sitting by a tree, passing the little time they have before their division is once again called into action. From that moment, we follow them through a relatively short mission, but a very intense one. Mendes is a master here. He has a way to show the horrors of war that is different from other war films. Instead of relying on visually strong moments of death, instead of showing how evil human beings can be, and instead of requiring from his actors emotions of extreme fear, sadness and horror, he approaches all of it in a more realistic way. He relies on the small and more introspective feelings that our two protagonists feel during their journey, and requires from his actors only a portrayal of two innocent boys who have to go through hell in order to achieve something. By doing this, we see the horrors of war as being how that affects people in a deeper emotional level. We see all the apathy, regret, disappointment and frustration that they have to endure due to the realities of war. Death, however horrific it might be, is only one part of it, and what stays with those who survived is a set of feelings and memories that is much more frightening, and which we as viewers are invited to feel alongside our main characters. Mendes also has the sensibility to show every single character in the film as a human being, and by doing so, he expands the whole narrative of good vs evil that is usually portrayed in war films, to a more complex and realistic one, one of empathy vs apathy, power vs powerlessness, humanity vs humanity itself.
About the cinematography, one of the most broadly discussed aspects of this film is how Deakins films everything as if it was one shot. And it is indeed an amazing technical achievement, one which certainly adds to the feeling of absolute immersion. But Deakins does a lot more than that in this film. He is able to use these immersion techniques combined with beautifully lighted shots, sensible camera movement and, in a few key moments, an almost ethereal atmosphere (which is significantly brought up to another level by an amazing soundtrack). What he achieves with this is a mix of realism and poetry that adds an extra layer to the film, which would otherwise be remembered simply by its technical accomplishments."
1917,29 March 2020,7/10,"I didn't like how unrealistic the story was and also how the characters were so dumb. Found myself yelling at the screen.1) Plane crashes and ends up right at our lead protagonists feet.
2) Main guys have to pull the German pilot out of the plane to save him. Why? Then you are so worried about getting him water and he stabs and kills you! It is war, I don't think you do either of these things especially given you are on a mission against the clock!
3) Other guy mourns his friend and kills a bunch more time while on the clock.
4) Surviving guy hangs out with french girl and baby for 15 minutes while he is on the clock.
5) Will Schofield makes it to the finish line but is already too late. Would many lives been saved if he isn't hanging out with the French girl and her baby?
6) Characters decisions seemed dumb and against the mission in parts of the movie."
1917,7 February 2020,6/10,"So, the historical war dramas have finally got their first entry that can truly be described as a blockbuster format. All flair, no substance.The movie relies entirely on its ability to keep you glued to the screen regardless of the weak characters, the plot holes and the leaps in logic the movie gleefully undertakes for the sake of moving the story towards its underwhelming conclusion.Deus ex Machinas? Check, every 30 minutes or so. Redshirts? Check. Stormtroopers as enemies? Check. Flat dialogue and unreasonable statements? Check and check. Even cheesy one-liners make an appearance.On the plus side, the movie is shot beautifully. The faux long take really works and makes you feel like you can't get your eyes off the screen lest you miss some important detail. The CGI is not top of the pops, but it certainly does the job. The score is great too, keeping the tension high when necessary and jerking a few tears (or at least attempting to) when it can.Still, in the realm of blockbusters 1917 still has some ways to go. I dare say Avengers: Infinity War is a vastly superior movie in pretty much every regard. And don't let the setting of 1917 fool you - it is a blockbuster, not a period drama. Ask yourself: if it was set during an alien invasion in 2117, but with the same themes, same plot, same characters and events, would you see it in a different light? You'd probably see it as a mediocre blockbuster with cool cinematography, and that's precisely what this film is."
1917,3 June 2020,5/10,"I really was looking forward to that movie, but the amazing shoots can't compensate the bad and thin story plus all of the old stereotypes of war and the bad to the bone Germans. Sorry. War isn't and wasn't that way or just that one dimensional. Especially the first one. And on top of it there is that completely unlikely and stupid storyline, to rely the lives of 1.600 soldiers on just two young and inexperienced ""boys"", that makes the whole movie so painful to watch. At the end it just seems like a call off duty b-movie with awesome pictures. Nothing less. But also nothing more. Sorry."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"I congratulate everybody that was involved in the production of this film because they gave us a masterful work of art.It's astonishing that they made this film with such realism and emotion, and it would absolutely wouldn't be the same without the long shots and brilliant cinematography.1917 has to be the best film of the year and I think this film along with Birdman have inspired a new genre of film. I hope more directors are encouraged by this film because I'm out of words on how great of an impact this has left on me!"
1917,23 February 2020,6/10,"NEWSFLASH!! 1917 is nothing more than just another movie. It's an amalgam of the marathon legend born from the Ancient Greeks' battle against the Persians - and a script born from a 12-year-old boy's daydreaming fantasy of being a hero by defying all odds. It's all wrapped up into a format akin to a non-interactive video game. It's a 6/10 from me, and I'm being quite generous at that!!"
1917,31 July 2020,9/10,Good movie. No glorification of war. Good movie. No glorification of war. Good movie. No glorification of war. Good movie. No glorification of war.
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,"This film is a very good watch but it is very intense so you need to be in the right mood and know what to expect. The main character is very well acted and is able to portray the emotions and strain of war. The film is one continuous shot which is very impressive. It also shows all the horrors of the war. One of the best scenes shows the soldiers going over the top as the character runs along the front line. One very small criticism is that the main character is shot at a lot but a lot of bullets miss him even though the German soldiers are quite close to him. The main character is able to shoot a German in a tower from quite a long distance. This is because the main character has to be put in danger but obviously he can't die before his mission is over or the film would be over. When his mission is done there is very little recognition for the main characters journey which adds to the realism as the commanding offices have a lot of other issues to deal with which adds to the realism. The music is very good and the film looks very realistic. There is one scene with a plane crash which is very well done. Overall, this film is a brilliant portrayal of World War 1. There are a lot of World War 2 films but not many World War 1 films so this helps to address that. It may be too graphic for schools but it could be shown to show how awful the conflict was."
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,Not sure how this movie is so highly rated. This movie is extremely slow and boring. The most boring war movie I've ever seen.
1917,20 March 2020,10/10,"I think my Review contains little bit of Spoilers! So here's what I think. I am a Movie and Series Geek/Freak whatever you prefer. I watched, watch every kind genres of films every single day! So trust me when I tell you- 1917 is one of those films which without a doubt is ""The Best Movie You Will Ever Experience."" This story is from ""WWI"" as you may simply know/guess from the Title/Plot. You will simply feel the entire things (The War, The Tension, Bullets Flying Around, Being Afraid for Life, What it Needs/Feels to be a Soldier!, What it's Worth Fighting For etc.) The Cinematography is awesome. The Casting is genius. You will love literally the whole thing. I won't brag anymore, I guess you can decide when you experience it on your own."
1917,16 January 2020,8/10,1917 is a beautiful film set amidst both brutal and picturesque natural environments. The cinematography is some of the best ive ever seen. The score was equally brilliant and the acting was flawless. One of the best war films of the last decade.
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"A work of art.
Don't watch if you want another glorious ""America conquers all"" movie or a Mel Gibson style big speeches that swell your chest with pride and emotion.
1917 will make you very uneasy with it's intense underlying tone and fast paced action.
I gave this movie a chance after hearing how ambitious the film style was, purely for the cinematic experience and realised at the end that I could actually say for the first time that I loved a war film."
1917,28 June 2021,9/10,This movie is remarkably well directed. The story is sad and painful. The director pays homage to the fallen of the great war. Sam Mendes brings to life a war long forgotten and a sacrifice long lost. Well done.
1917,29 March 2020,1/10,"Let me say first off that I love Sam Mendes. I think he makes great movies...just not good war movies. I admire the talent it takes to make single shots, but it takes away from the art of film editing that creates emotion for a film. This is not a documentary and there is no need to make it feel like one. This movie sacrificed a lot of emotion for cinematography and it shouldn't have. There was no need for over the top scenes just to say we shot this continuously. I wanted to like this film, but it fell short of great war movies and I am left with a void. I really feel like this is the nail in the coffin for great war movies and I am really sad."
1917,7 February 2020,4/10,"All technical marvels are accepted, and the film's brutal realism acknowledged. However, the premise that the British high command would give two flying handshakes about the fate of 1600 troopers is historically bordering on the insane. In 1916, from July through November, the Battle of the Somme took place. The British lost 20,000 men ON THE FIRST DAY. The total dead and wounded was one million. The premise of this film completely negates anything that cleaves to accuracy. Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' from 1957 was far closer to reality than '1917.' Perhaps something resembling this chain of events did occur in WW I, but that would have been the rarest of exceptions. The lasting impression this film imparted to this reviewer was one of absolution; exoneration for stupendous military incompetence, and for the high command's disdain toward those in the trenches."
1917,27 May 2020,10/10,"One of, if not, the best war film I have ever seen. The cinematography is breathtaking, so beautifully shot and sets the perfect tone for the film.Keeping the big names to smaller roles was a smart move for a film about a war that changed the world.This film deserved best picture, director and actor. Taking nothing away from the brilliant performance driving the Joker."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"Probably best war movie if not better than , it's comparable to Dunkirk, this movie bleeds with emotion from top to bottom, and by far first Hollywood movie that acknowledged role of Sikh's in world wars, such a great job done by everybody who put together this movie"
1917,25 September 2020,10/10,Excellent movie with good actors and strong storyline. Also great film work and music.
1917,13 January 2021,3/10,"I really have no clue where the hype comes from. I don't care one bit about the continuous shot thing. It doesn't change my opinion on the movie.1917 is boring and cliché. Two guys go to deliver a message and one of them is motivated to deliver the message in order to save his brother. Of course, one is going to die and it's a war movie so it's not going to be a happy movie where the brothers reconnect. As such, the brother dies.It didn't feel sad when he died, either. I didn't feel connected to any characters in the movie. It never felt happy. It never felt sad. It never felt dramatic. It was never exciting. I didn't feel as if I were there. It never really evoked any emotions."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"Truly a cinematic achievement. The cinematography and soundtrack are both top notch and really bring the film to life. The acting is also first class, and you really feel for the two protagonists and their seemingly impossible mission. A must see on the big screen."
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"I don't usually write reviews for films I will not start now. However I will say this movie is phenomenal cinematic art! I can see it sweeping awards easily because to have the vision to bring this into reality was an amazing feat from my perspective. It grabs you within the first ten minutes and doesn't let go. Everything about it is outstanding, the writing, acting, directing and cinematography. You will not go wrong with this investment of time and you will learn something about warfare 103 years ago."
1917,1 February 2020,5/10,"The list of great films about war will not include 1917. Kubrick's Paths of Glory is about people; 1917 is about actors. Costa Gavras brilliant Battle of Algiers will be there. Downfall. Mash.
The director of 1917 was distracted by the technical concept and many of the sequences are impressive; in the way that a clever ride in a theme park may be impressive. Nothing more."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"Before I saw it, I'd have guessed that a WWI movie would have been impossible to film in the manner that this one was - i.e., with real sets and little or no CGI. I've never seen a movie with such attention to realistic sets, such incredible camera angles, many of which seem to defy physics, and so many continuous takes. The story, alone, may have been worth 8 stars. The production values and cinematography were worth another 8. which is to say that I'd give this movie 16 stars if I were allowed. I thought that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a perfect war movie, but it's not perfect compared to this one. BTW, Stephen Spielberg's production company was much involved with both. If Sam Mendes and Spielberg can ever outdo this flick, it will be a miracle."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I didn't know logs and trees were such a problem in WW1. A fallen log was used as a plot device at least 3 times, maybe more.
I went for the novelty of seen the single 2 hour tracking shot, you can clearly see the ""tricks"" used to accomplish this illusion. It just ended up being a distraction to the story. Those who say the cinematography was great, I guess. They failed to give any scale to the battlefield, they needed to pull back and show us the world. Most of us don't know what WW1 looked like. My wife said it felt like we were watching someone play a video game. And she's right. When the main character was shot by the incompetent German sniper, Someone In the theater even said ""game over!"" Unrealistic?Two men caught in a huge explosion in a tunnel, one is literally buried under what looked like at least 1 pound of rock, stones dirt, and rubble, emerges with little more than dusty eyes. And which point he wants to go back. I'm not sure why, he is clearly immortal and a super human marksman. When he locates and shoots a German sniper that is in an elevated covered position who is firing on him. I guess he could have got lucky and lucky he is. Bullets cannot seem to hit him. Except the one that hits him in the back of the head. But that is cured by a French woman with a fat starving baby when she touches it with a rag. Then of course Germans are all evil, stupid, drunk and immoral. Even when they save a German pilot from burning alive he repays them by stabbing the best character in the gut. Because Germans have no honor, never did, especially the pilots. There are so many stories that have gone untold about WW1 they choose a fetch delivery quest to an NPC that looks like Benidict Cucumberpatch."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes has created a masterpiece.The cinematography of 1917 grabs you and has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Portraying the film in a single shot, a technique I loved in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Birdman (2014), was a difficult task to say the least. Sam Mendes has outdone all my expectations. We follow every footstep and we experience every moment of Lance Corporal Schofield and Blake's journey to deliver a message to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment halting their attack on the Germans. The shear amount of thought that has gone into making sure the the film flows into 1 shot without reusing the same set and ensuring what is round each corner is unique, is superb and unlike anything you can compare.Many war films fall into the trap of feeling like they have to pack the film with fighting scenes. 1917 hasn't. I loved the quiet scenes and the character monologues which show the other side of what soldiers experienced whilst at War. The scene following Schofield and Blake's close escape from the German trenches where Blake calmingly, and cheerfully tells Schofield a funny story just minutes after their near death, shows perfectly how there was no time to dwell. During these times keeping your mind off knowing you are at War being the biggest battle. During this scene Blake makes reference to the Cherry Blossoms that have been chopped down by the Germans, saying they remind him of home and times with his mother. A some what strange happy site for Blake allowing him to reminisce for better days. As Schofield drifts aimlessly down the rapids, exhausted and on the brink of drowning. The falling of the Blossom reminds him of the reasons he embarked on this journey, and memories with his lost friend now knowing that he is watching over. A real turning point in Schofields mind that he can successfully deliver the orders of General Erinmore.The reaction of Schofield to the melody of Wayfaring stranger is cold but perfect. Silence in this scene allows us to listen closely to the lyrics of the song and the deep emotion they hold. Schofield who has fought his own battle to deliver the message to stop the attack and those young men preparing to cross the front line are all in fact poor wayfaring strangers, travelling through this world below.A wonderful and moving encounter between Schofield and Blake's brother at the end, who his actions ultimately managed to save, tie the film perfectly to a close.I loved the directing
I loved the acting. For a young, new actor George MacKay is simply Brilliant in the role of Lance Corporal Schofield.
I loved the cinematography
I love the writing
I loved the music
I loved the lighting
I love the makeup
I loved it all."
1917,14 April 2020,9/10,One-take feeling seemed to create an immense tension to this war movie. Close to human atmosphere and sympathy for every one taking part in horrors of war. One of best movies I have seen.
1917,12 April 2020,7/10,"This film is a terrific effort in conveying the experience of the Great War. It is exciting, tense, and keeps viewers fully engaged.But, in the end, it is a very limited story. Character development, plot -- these are secondary to the portrayal of the unique experience of that time and place. To criticize its shortcomings does not diminish its power -- it did not seek to develop character or to have more than a simple plot.The film won three Academy Awards, but all were in the technical categories: cinematography, sound editing, visual effects. In these it was outstanding.So I would recommend the film with the caveat that it will not be for everyone and is more likely to survive as a history class docudrama than as a classic film for the ages. That said, it is a terrific immersive experience."
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"The movie is shot by a genius and that is that. All technical stuff are really really great from the cinematography to the single shot, everything is beautifully done.
The good stuff end here though. The plot is know to the viewer before the film starts and that didn't bother me. What did bother me were all the ""WTF"" moments(and there are many, like too many) and the fact that the two main characters are utterly idiots, plain idiots. It's really clear that the script writers didn't give a sh** about the characters, there's no evolution, there's no deep characterization, nothig. It's a real shame, because it could have been a really great movie. It's just ok, no greatness there. I don't get the hype, really can't."
1917,12 January 2020,2/10,"It's getting so painful scrolling past blatant movie employees reviews of movies,the language is copy and pasted by writers who clearly cannot talk like regular movie reviewers and the constant barrage of 10/10 is a sure sign the review is not worth reading.
It's become common now to give 2 stars because people give 10 to what is likely a 7 movie to balance the equation so people have to scroll endlessly for a genuine review of what is actually in the movie.
1917 is a decent movie it's a 6.5 .....we don't all go with our Oscar list ready to chew I off."
1917,15 January 2020,6/10,"A simple story well told in one shot. Catchy from the beginning due to an astonishing camera work and music. Unfortunately, weak performances (exception the leading actor) ruined the possibility to watch a memorable film."
1917,20 December 2020,7/10,"Looks beautiful, and is a wonderful film to watch. Sadly the second half loses its way and the style turns into something more like a video game."
1917,10 March 2020,5/10,"Few nice shots is all this film has to offer. Overall its a boring and unoriginal movie. And unrealistic on every level except outfits. All boys look too slick and too well fed for WWI conditions. It just doesnt look good. Why directors dont pay attention to those important details novadays? And in terms of drama, emotions, bound with characters and character development this movie is just extremely week compared to movies like saving private ryan, thin red line, platoon or casualties of war. I liked road to perdition from Sam but Im disapointed by this one."
1917,10 February 2020,1/10,"The only thing that I was missing is a controller in my hand and this movie would truly have been a video game!! The hero is just jumping from one level to another, one chapter to another and facing just random obstacles that make absolutely no sense. He's even collecting things that might be useful to him in the next chapter...
They should change the title to ""Two Many Coincidences"" and do sequels exactly like Final Destination.Seriously, the luck on this guy makes Rambo - Commando & Die Hard look like schoolboys. The rules of engagement make no sense, the combat scenes are pure luck and do not add up. Any veteran that has spent 5mns in a war zone, would tell you that he should have died at every single one of those scenes. He's just getting through the levels because, well, this is how the director wants it. With this kind of luck, this guy should just move to vegas, buy lottery tickets, bet on games (...) then finance his campaign to become Prime Minister. He could also easily finance the campaign for German Chancellor, and just end the war this way. He'll even have enough money left to develop a cure for death, live an extra 100 years and buy Google, Amazon & Apple!I mean seriously, the story and the combat scenes are so far fetched - it's not even funny.
Sam Mendes is just making another James Bond movie in 1917. It's a free country, he can do whatever the hell he wants, but the disappointing side of it is that Hollywood is raving about it. Ricky Gervais said it best!Clearly, all the ones leaving good reviews are paid, don't know what a good movie is supposed to be like or have never played a video game..."
1917,14 February 2020,8/10,The picture and sound of this film is the best it has. It manages to put you in a situation it has not been that much exploited in the industry (WWI) where the battle was really in the trenches (actually this element has big importance in the storyline). The story is simple but effective. It has a down grade at the 3/4 of the film were it calms down just before the ending but nothing that would spoil the experience. Totally recommended.
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"I have to say that his year has been very wanting with regards to quality movies, and until seeing this I was convinced that Joker and Joachin, Phoenix would scoop best movie and actor awards across the board. That thought has now been thrown into turmoil as 1917 is a better movie, and the George MacKay portrayal of Schofield is wonderful. How Sam Mendes pulled off the end to end nature of the story in fabulous. I cannot recommend this highly enough, and would suggest the bigger the screen the better......enjoy"
1917,18 March 2020,10/10,I love it it's one of the best films ever sundtruck is amazing cinematography is the best in 2019
1917,12 September 2020,1/10,"You literally sleep for half of the movie, wake up & feel as if you missed nothing. The 1 is for the great filming."
1917,21 February 2021,7/10,"Allow to rain on your parade movie lovers, because this acclaimed film to me is just kinda average. Now of course, the visuals and the cinematography are next level, truly pulling off the time period of WWI. However, it all falls flat when it comes to the story. Some of my favorite war films like Saving Private Ryan & Dunkirk have interesting characters and events that keep your interest. This movie does not. None of the encounters or events keep me intrigued, mainly because I didn't really care about the main character or if he succeeded. I had high expectations for a film that some were calling to be put among the best war films of all time. Yet I'm disappointed, and will stick to the other classics."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"Saw this movie today. Thought that it has been highly pushed and overrated. Acting is good, not excellent. Scenery not much better than most war movies. Hard to believe that any of the storyline could have happened. As a Vietnam era Veteran thought that this was very much a fantasy film."
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,Not what I expected but that's not a bad thing the fact that the camera stays on the main characters feels like that you have gone on this journey with Blake and Schofield through the front line and trenches was brilliant it was an exciting film as you didn't know what would happen next.The cinematography was fantastic
1917,21 August 2020,10/10,"This movie is one of the best movies ever made and without a doubt in my top 3 movies of all time.I love how simple a story is yet executed in the most brilliant way possible. You watch our characters go through pain, sadness, and loss. It works how the characters are not fully fleshed out detailed characters because there are people who have done heroic things for their country and their people in WW1 that we will never know.This tops the list for THE BEST cinematography in a film EVER. I have never seen a movie that goes beyond how good this wonderful film looks. The one shot camera technique works and works so well. It really makes you feel like you are there with the characters.The themes are so damn well executed that it really does feel like you are in WW1.The soundtrack is godlike, it makes the scenes 100x more powerful and it just works so well. Some of the best music i have heard in a film.There is a scene that stands out for an actors wonderful performance, great acting all around.
Please do definitely see this whenever you can, this might not be for everyone but if you are a true fan of cinema you absolutely cannot miss this. This is a bucket list movie."
1917,31 December 2020,10/10,This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched.
1917,27 March 2021,6/10,Remove the one-shot gimmick and what you're left with is a very average war movie but yeah ok movie.
1917,3 December 2020,7/10,"The one-shot aspect refreshingly feels not like a gimmick but an irreplaceable part of the narrative - it makes the experience all the more enthralling and even emotional. However, it is also the only thing that this movie will be remembered for..."
1917,8 February 2021,9/10,"Such a well done war movie. However, it has a side to it we dont usually see in most movies of this genre. Absolutely recommend, particularly for WWI nerds like myself."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"I love drama movies and particularly dramas taking place in history or war, so this movie was number one in my to do list. The fact that is was filmed in just ""one shot"" is emotionally engaging from the very beginning. You feel you can't turn your head or even blink 'cause you'll be missing a precious moment of the movie. I cried trying to imagine how many stories like this have got lost in time, how many people have suffered the injustice of war.
Best scene: Schofield getting out of the trench, bombs reaching ground and exploding, soldiers dying and still, he doesn't lose focus to deliver his message 😢"
1917,28 March 2020,4/10,"I was fooled into watching due to its nominations and awards. I can't believe nowadays just some cinematic editing technique can make a movie masterpiece. Since when we lower our standard for a masterpiece. Aside from cinematography, this movie has 2 things I don't enjoy: terrible acting and lots of plot holes.Tom was so eager to deliver the message to save his brother battalions at first, but only 5mins later got himself into a relax adventure into German trench and tunnel, like a kid enjoying the games, suddenly forgot about his mission. Right after they discovered the tunnel, everything becomes so silly and unrealistic: the barn, the plane, Tom was stabbed and died after like literally 5min and a split second later there's whole British company appears, which should have some medics to save him LOL, in reality. The truck only carries Schofield 500meters to a bridge which only has 1 snipper. The night scene is even more ridiculous, where the whole German army was 100m from the bridge, where the whole British company trucks passed by in the afternoon, without any conflicts. Then some stupid and silly shooting scenes which I find funny instead of intense at all. Then jumping to the river, which should've killed the guy, and fell down the fall, which should've killed him again, look at the strong and spiral currents, the hero still managed to keep his head up and float all the time. If you notice further, the water after the fall is too silent and to be true, normally after a fall like that the current is still very strong. Then hero meets battalion, only like 200m from German army in the town, but the British battalions are attacking Germans in the OTHER direction, which basically means the British is under siege haha.Time and space in this movie is completely unrealistic and doesn't make any sense. I feel unsatisfied and disappointed after watching this. Speaking about war scenes, It can never be compared to Saving Private Ryan or Band of brothers, The Pacific.."
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is really a masterclass in a cinema going experience, the ""one shot"" idea for creating this film, calls for a linear plot logically, yet the plot of this movie makes perfect sense as such because it's the military and a classic use of good vs. evil. The movie is quite simply and honestly an emotional and psychological journey as though the viewer was really there! Astonishing"
1917,7 January 2020,8/10,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is just a feast for the eyes. I have only two critical points here:1. There is little to no character development.2. The portrayal of the Germans is too stereotypical and seems to confuse WWI with WWII
1917,7 February 2020,9/10,"I don't usually like war movies, but this is really good, go see it.PS - Ignore the nitpickers and really low scores (as for most movies)"
1917,8 May 2020,10/10,An excellent showcase of a cinematographer's power.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was absolutely incredible! I just saw it in theaters today and I don't think there was a single dry eye in the theater. This movie was packed with a pure roller coaster of emotion and was so very intense. Everything about the movie was wonderful. The story was great and simple, the acting was superb, and the directing was absolutely phenomenal. This movie will most definitely win best picture at the Academy Awards."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"This war movie it's not like any war movie before its from different angle of the war , showing the environment of the war of course show with great images by the great Roger Dickinse, and for who say the only thing special of this genra that it's one shot which is show like its one shot, which is hard, and the music is incredible, and who connect all that and give us this masterpiece Sam Mandes, this movie from the best movies of this which a great year for cinema and in the dicade, and from the best war movies ever ;because it's a special movie."
1917,2 February 2021,5/10,"Maybe all those who are praising this mistake have not seen WWI films such as: Paths of Glory, The Grand Illusion, All Quiet on the Western Front or Lawrence of Arabia. The sets, props and cinematography were excellent. The acting was OK, but the script, direction and editing missed the mark. Many scenes were unbelievably unrealistic. A great disappointment."
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,Certainly worth your hard earned money. Filmed in a unique fashion.
1917,17 October 2020,10/10,"Cinematography, acting, writing, direction, sound, background and makeup, this movie excels in every aspect there is. This is a 10 as there's no flaw throughout the 119 min long movie, must watch before dying."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"Everyone in that era responded to war as it was, accept it as another day to live. Their emotion follow the mind resistance to make everything makes sense. This is bloody war, what do you gonna expected it? Pile of bodies, killing stock, civilian people miseries , an hungry orphan baby-girl. All check. it is conventional.They had suppressed all emotions to survive, but survive are not, never-mind, better life await.an then the sphereas like i saw The Raid The Redemption, but in silence, in stasis. no arggh ahhhh punch, no glorifies kill count's came from brawl everywhere, but the terror are the same! Everyone can kill you in every direction, and you knew you gonna hit, whether through bullets, bayonet, or shells.then you act as the man in queue, waiting to be slain. You know its will comin but you must act as everyone act: placid."
1917,4 December 2019,10/10,"Had a privilege to watch this extraordinary movie about war, survival and friendship. Scenes are not overpowering and they are appropriately selected for the movie. Good acting with nice views of open country. Screenplay is topnotch. Highly recommended."
1917,15 April 2020,9/10,"The best word I would use to describe this film is mighty. But also it's a wild ride of emotions all throughout. The cinematography is most certainly the best of this year with only 1 true cut in the middle of the movie, the entire thing is pretty much filmed in a way to make it seem like one continuous shot. I thought that might've given it a pacing problem since you'd have to be with the characters every minute of their journey, but damn it does a good job of keeping you on your toes. Every single minute of this film is put into something worthwhile, from the scenes where characters are in extreme danger, to more calming moments of peace in between peril, to the most emotional parts of the film which for me was around the 45 minute mark and also at the very end of the film. There are two very impactful parts in 1917 that really show the reality and unexpectedness of war and it makes the film so much more realistic and heartbreaking. The music is loud and excellent and it does a very similar thing to Dunkirk where it uses its volume to its advantage and it can up the emotion, terror or triumph with the score. My favourite scene in the entire movie is when Schofield is running along the front lines as the score is at its loudest, it gave me the biggest goosebumps I've had in a while and it was the moment I decided that 1917 was most definitely triumphant. It turns what seems like a small adventure into the most large scale and mighty movie I've seen from last year. It was just undoubtedly all parts awesome, emotional and terrifying and it's one of the best war movies I've ever seen and it even rivals Saving Private Ryan. It was so damn good it's been bumped up to number 4 on my top 10 of the year. It definitely deserved best Cinematography and Sound Mixing. And I do feel it deserved best visual effects too because there wasn't one moment where CGI took me out of it, the entire thing felt real and extremely damn immersive. I haven't been so invested in a movie for a while, truly a triumph of cinema and it's not something I'll forget easily."
1917,23 January 2020,8/10,"1917 is a masterpiece with Sam Mendes skill. The movie is shot so well it brought you to world war one. the acting from the two leads is fantastic, bringing realism and drama to the war it felt like a very detailed documentary. The story is realistic and simple. the movie is 2 hours long feeling like you went on the mission with Blake and Scholfeld. If you like movies you should see this. 1917 might be a new step in cinema."
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"I've watch hundreds of movies, but none were like this. With just enough drama and tension, the way this movie immerses you into the movie is amazing. The 'one shot' directing was also done flawlessly. And the way they capture the true nature of war... it was devastating and wondrous at the same time. Just amazing."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"It's amazing movie
And good story
Happy ending
And good act"
1917,25 February 2020,10/10,"I think it is the best movie.... Excitement, confustion mixed up.... Just awesome movie...."
1917,5 January 2020,10/10,Enjoyed every frame. Enough said. Thanks and goodnight.
1917,24 February 2020,7/10,"I have to say, this movie was such a treat to watch. I could only imagine the effort that was put into the camerawork to keep the movie's one-shot feel must be paramount. The one-shot method definitely made a lot of sense for this movie. It really keeps us close to heart with our protagonist and lets the audience experience the horror of war. I can see that this could be a powerful tool in different occasions. Honestly, it felt like a video game at times. It was really cool.But unfortunately while this movie had finesse on the screen, it did lack in its writing department. My main complaint is with how they handled the protagonist and his partner. I really believed that the protagonist's partner had a lot in him that the audience could have learned about, but sadly was never delved into. Meanwhile, our protagonist really did not have anything in particular that made him interesting. Not that he needs a lot of flair, but the lack thereof, kind of hindered the movie's potential. There was room for character growth that would have made the protagonist interesting. But that growth was approached so quickly, that it really didn't had any impact whatsoever. This is why I think the potential of an intimate character growth from the one-shot method was wasted. Also, the ending was kind of lame, albeit was tense."
1917,25 February 2020,8/10,"This movie shows how brilliant technical aspects can make a movie very exiting and how brilliant shots can make the viewer feel being involved.
For sure 1917 is an outstanding cinema experience, but to put it in the same Category as ""Dunkirk"" or ""Saving Private James Ryan"", there is missing this intelligence of the content and the fact that this substance had to be sacrified for the long shots in this movie is the only thing which makes this film not perfect.
Despite those critics the acting of George McKay is outstanding so that all in all this film is recommendable."
1917,20 March 2020,8/10,"Movie is very good. There isn't quite a lot of films which make yoi really feel like you're inside the actuall war like this one makes you feel. I'll try to keep it short so:
Enviroment 10/10
Actors 9/10
Story 5/10
Emotional engagement 9/10
Feels like a real war(thrilling, scary, OMG scenes...) 10/10
+ Bonus: it's made to look like it's taken in one shot."
1917,31 May 2020,9/10,"Really good movie it draws you, there isn't a boring part to this movie. What i really loved about this movie and the reason i watched it was the cinematography and how it looks like it is all a one shot. Awesome movie would definitely recommend. Technically Brilliant. Highly recommended."
1917,16 March 2020,8/10,"Seconds unfortunately drags quite a bit, gets too poetic and moralizing. Thats why is only getting an 8 from me. Would have been a 10 for sure if not for the fault above.
Special mention for someone finally minding more or less realistic bullet sound effects, where they respect distances and speed of sound. Beautifully recreated trenches, great tension. I would say a must watch despite the tern second half / last third."
1917,18 February 2020,6/10,"6 stars for the setting, and the cinematography
0 stars for the story and actingStory
Germans left their trenches, British phone lines cut, 2 soldiers have to deliver a message behind enemy lines. We have seen this in Saving Private Ryan, only difference here: The soldiers know where the recipient of the message is located. On their way they see friendly aircraft, at least 2 times flying over them. My question: Why didn't the aircraft drop these messages? Story would be over.Acting: While George MacKay delivered an okay-ish performance, Dean-Charles Chapman was ridiculous. He is just too immature for this role.. his character came over like a baby.. I didn't buy it and in my eyes it was pretty unauthentic.It is good for a watch, I just wonder why they picked this poor story, (which we already saw in Saving Private Ryan) for this beautifully shot film."
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"1917 sweeps through harrowing, high-stakes mission to deliver a critical message to the front lines late in the first world war. Two young friends accept an order to make the death-defying run, hoping to save the lives of 1600 of their countrymen.The narrative itself contains few novel elements. We see stock characters like the crusty, jaded Colonel who ""loves the fight"", the wide-eyed youth eagerly following orders, the bell tower gunfight, the hero holding his friend as he dies - sputtering out his ""tell my mom I love her"" speech. The latter is a trope so common in earlier war films that it became a staple in parody. While familiar, it still works in this film because you are part of the action.The viewer follows the mission in one continuous shot as an invisible first-person through filthy, crowded and rat-infested trenches with only a vein of grey sky visible overhead. Signs are posted around the corners warning soldiers to keep their heads down - and momentarily you might even find yourself ducking. Bullets crack into the rocks next to you and you scan around, trying to figure out where they're coming from. You are immersed in the action!The attention to detail, the acting and the cinematography makes it all feel real. The experience is the selling point, so see it in the theater if you can!Naturally, none of this would work if the acting wasn't spot on. There is little dialogue throughout, so a lot has to be conveyed with faces and they succeed here. The leads adeptly convey veneers of stoic bravery over terror, panic, relief and sorrow.On the downside, the characters aren't explored too deeply but following along with relative strangers actually adds to the anxious ""what am I doing here"" vibe. The other gripe would just be that 1917 does check off a list of war movie cliches without breaking any ground, story-wise. I'm afraid that may make it less memorable, overall.By the final frame, you get to exhale. The experience is worthwhile."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,The casting is really good the story is very basic but the cinematography is amazing.. I was tense the whole time when I was watching it... the music and the effects kept me hooked the whole movie although the story is basic and not complex.It's worth watching in IMAX
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"This is an immersive, exciting depiction of some of the fighting of World War I. Sam Mendes should have cut or otherwise drastically modified the scene with the baby, but otherwise the movie is full of lean acting and dialogue that aren't overdone."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Holy Moly what a movie. Really great, even if war movies aren't your cup of tea. The camera work is just incredible and the atmosphere they build make you forget your popcorn."
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"Quite proud of the job done with directing and photography: I love the camera movement as points to our protagonists nearly for the entire picture.
The screenplay is very simple yet effective.
I got quite emotional at the end when Will makes the extra mile trying to reach his comrade's brother."
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"This piece of cinema will remain relevant even 50 years from today, for 1917 does what rarely movies do! Making you a part of the script.
Contrary to the trailers & narratives, there are actually 3 characters leading here; Blake, Will and You!
You will become such an intregal part of their path, as Roger Deakins takes you so deep into their journey that at one point the lines blur.
Whilst Chapman is amazing, it is MacKay who took the cake!
Sam Mendes has managed to live upto his benchmark! Kudos!"
1917,25 January 2020,8/10,Pretty good movie. Intense at parts which gives you an idea of what war is really like. I loved the way it's filmed but I noticed it consistently.
1917,14 November 2021,5/10,"A little bit long, at least it has 30 minutes in excess, a little bit boring and slow. The beginning was promising, but suddenly it started going nowhere. It's a kind of a renewed ""Gallipoli"" meets ""Save private Ryan"" but the dead boring way. An overrated award winning film, which makes me wonder who the competitors were in 2019, and another Sam Mendes's aesthetic exercise which lacks interest despite the beautiful images and music."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,"My husband and I saw this movie today. It was our Valentine's Day date. He chose it and I was willing to go but not necessarily excited. Now, ""My feelings are quite the opposite."" This is the best movie I have seen in the last year. Not only should it have won the best picture Oscar, but Sam Mendes should have won for best director.The complexity of this film - the work they did - it was more like a stage production than a movie. I'm in awe of the long takes and the actors being so constantly in close-up mode.The movie did not feel long. The real-time feeling had me constantly on the edge of my seat, never once thinking ""how much longer"" or ""I need to go to the bathroom."" We were experiencing the movie just as the real characters were.I really can't wait to see this again. There is so much that I feel like I missed. Of course the cinematography was out of this world. But, also the script was excellent. There is so much to notice and uncover in the dialogue and characterization.I feel certain we will purchase this film for our collection."
1917,8 March 2020,,"While at risk of being regressive in the wake of Christoper Nolan's excellent Dunkirk, Sam Mendes' 1917 establishes a unique identity with a novel storytelling conceit of its own.An ambitious single-take endeavour, 1917 demonstrates captivating technical prowess as Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption, Skyfall) negotiate nearly two hours of runtime through a variety of filming locations, set pieces and lighting effects that will surely make for the most interesting 'Making Of' featurette to grace home media . The result is a film with excellent pacing in its relentless forward momentum, where any downtime only serves to add to the growing tension as the soldiers' time to deliver their message runs out. Most notably, the single-take feels genuinely organic and never compromises the film's ability to deliver on action, and in combination with a shocking first-act twist, 1917 boldly raises the stakes to ensure it stands alongside its contemporaries.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman star as a charismatic lead duo whose barely familiar profiles compliment the sense of realism that Dunkirk arguably sacrificed in casting an idealistic Harry Styles. While Chapman gives lends the film an appropriate degree of levity, MacKay's stoic yet fragile turn earns the film's right to its emotionally stirring conclusion.Demanding to be seen on as big a screen as possible, 1917 is highly-efficient film-making at its best, delivering cinematic spectacle unrivalled by any summer tentpole with twice the budget and half of its ambition."
1917,27 February 2020,7/10,Music is doing whole film. It's holding in tension and shows us what to expect or what not to expect. It's good film.
1917,7 March 2020,10/10,"It's the first movie i watched in cinema in 2020 and i loved it,it was great"
1917,18 March 2020,10/10,"1917 moved me in such a way, I created a IMBD just to write this review."
1917,7 May 2020,9/10,"Good war movie with great spectacle and a very negative stance on war. The impressive one-shot is impressive. But other than that I didn't get much out of it. I thought the characters were bland but the film does what it wants good. Go see it though, it's still a good movie."
1917,5 June 2020,8/10,"Slow, but builds up, the cinematography is mind-blowing, being just two long shots. Gorgeous backgrounds and the horrors of the trench warfare are brought home in stunning reality.Worth watching."
1917,26 June 2020,6/10,"Visually pleasing, of course, since the way it was recorded is spectacular. But the plot didn't quite catch me"
1917,28 June 2020,9/10,"Incredible way to show a movie in sequence, masterful there is no doubt that they had a great preparation"
1917,31 July 2020,10/10,1917 is without doubt one of the best movies of this decade.
1917,31 January 2021,8/10,"Given that the film is presented as being a single continuous shot, I was surprised to find several scenes and moments that should have been cut."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,Stunningly shot with amazing visuals. 1917 does not glorify war. It shows how brutal and devastating war can be. I absolutely loved the movie.
1917,15 February 2020,6/10,"1917 captured the beauty of the French landscape and showed how war could transform beauty into a snarl of death, ugliness and destruction.Special effects, editing and costumes were well done yet acting lacked a certain degree of engagement and I had the experience I'd been watching actors instead of people, especially the Germans who had virtually no depth whatsoever, generically depicted as being stupid, evil and incompetent.Other reviewers had compared 1917 to WW1's answer to Saving Private Ryan. Nothing could be further from the truth. Saving Private Ryan portrayed depth of story, multifaceted characters, nuance and humor, and it was a film that operated simultaneously on multiple levels, whereas 1917 possessed none of these qualities. With war movies like Ryan, Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now I left the theater jolted into an altered state; the savagery of war left left me with a gaping hole and it required time to heal. WIth 1917 the echo of war ceased when the projector switched off."
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,"Wonderful performances by the two lead actors drive a very entertaining and believable plot that manages to keep you tense and engage for the duration of the film.
Photography is gorgeous, and is accompanied by an amazing music score and even better cinematography. For me this is the true Best Picture of the 2020 oscars. Amazing experience that I definitely will repeat.
The only thing bad about this movie was that i didn't get to enjoy the ""after-taste"" due to learning of the untimely death of Kobe Bryant as soon as I left the theater.
#Mamba4Ever"
1917,27 January 2020,8/10,"The movie is impeccable! Great cinematography and a ""hold on to your seat"" non stop action/drama/suspense. Really! An amazing piece of art. But.. but... it strongly carries a British propaganda undertaking. This is surely disappointing and the main reason for receiving an 8. Germans are terrible and British are heroes!? Enough with this #Brexit story!"
1917,19 March 2020,5/10,Just put it on 4 times speed - enjoy the many many types of walking - stop 2-3 times for story. A quick 25 minutes fix ;-)
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,"I love the camera angles and the closeup shots in the movie. However, I am frustrated how the movie never showed actual German soldiers in battle or fighting but rather scatters of Germans (sniper shooting, some soldiers shooting in the dark of an abandon town, German pilot for only a minute). I have a feeling that once again political correctness got in the way. Amazing how Hollywood is so frightened they may offend someone that they will try everything to ensure another side isn't shown as the enemy. They would have found a lot more Germans than what the movie depicts.What really bothered me is the scene where the rat crosses the trip wire causing a major explosion. Someone both soldiers don't receive any wombs (just some dirt in their eyes) but the explosion caused the entire mile long tunnel to collapse (as they ran through the tunnel, it was collapsing behind them but never in front of them)."
1917,19 February 2020,9/10,I always have loved war movies but never got to experience it in the cinema.i am glad i did it this time and took time to watch this visual treat.it was bit slow for me in the start but it paced steadily.cinematography is extraordinary to give viewers the realtime war experience.Emotional raw and haunting.
1917,13 November 2020,10/10,"Artistic scenes throughout.
That little scene where they're chatting in the back of the truck 👌"
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"I was skeptical that this film would not live up to the reviews. My 12 year old granddaughter wanted to see this because she said they don't teach WWI much in school. My 15 year old grandson was reluctant to give up 2 hours of his Sunday although he is into all things military. Both were enthralled by this magnificent effort to give us a glimpse of the horrors of war. Mendes captures all the elements perfectly so you feel that you are there with the main characters. You see the destruction, the death, the pain and suffering of everyone and everything. The film is about something bigger than one man and about what we have deep inside that keeps us striving to take one more step forward. I highly recommend this movie."
1917,29 May 2020,1/10,Watch Alexander starring Colin Farrell instead if you want to waste a few hours of your life.boring vomit.
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"I had high expectations for this movie. Sadly, it turned out to be overly-hyped. While it was thrilling and the visual images were amazing, I feel like today's cinema is fully focused on that and forgot about the essence. The movie was good, but not great. Did not tickle my intelligence, or my deep emotions. And that's exactly what a movie should do! After I watched Hotel Rwanda, for example, I thought about it for years, it inspired something in me - to make a difference! It reached my depths and shaken my inner self. This is just an example. Many war movies did that, and I hope these new writers and directors will remember that us, the audience will forget what we saw, but never what we felt."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"For the first five minutes the intimate camera was slightly discombobulating and I felt uncomfortable.And then I felt like I was walking by their sides and slightly after that I started crying and didn't really stop until the end of the creditsThe fact that my stone hearted partner was also sobbing is a testament to the overwhelming emotional punch of 1917.A minimalist script and storyline combine with completely immersive cinematography and soundtrack to create a film you will not easily forget.The detail and love in this film is apparent - It minimises the use of CGI, uses actors who have faces out of old old photos and you can almost hear Grandpa Mendez telling his stories.Thank you Sam Mendes"
1917,4 January 2020,10/10,"This film is overwhelming. I have nothing further to add, other than the compelling need for eternal remembrance to those who sacrificed their lives in any way, we can not fathom. We, citizens of any country, today, should feel ourselves lucky and blessed to exist. A Happy New Year to all. George from Hellas. NB: do not give it a second thought; watch it; even if this genre is not your cup of tea. After all, it is much more than a feature film. It's a massive dedication to unselfishness. Do yourself a favour and watch it. And then watch it once more."
1917,10 April 2020,3/10,"While the people might gush about the cinematic feast, in terms of storytelling, it's yawningly boring and unrealistic."
1917,17 March 2020,7/10,"For the people who never read anything by Tardi, who actually seems to be the only inspirator. Good enough movie though"
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,Loved this movie but not sure of the constantly moving camera. The story line is not quite what we expected...not going to spoil it for others but it is surprisingly a great story.
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,"Better than Dunkirk is all I took from the movie. Some unrealistic plots, surreal filming crossing apocalypse now and oh what a lovely war. Worth a watch if only to enjoy the first 15 mins."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"What a great film, this film is not only beautiful and ingeniously made, but also a plea for a united Europe. Divisions give this kind of war horror. Sam Mendes remindes us of this with this film. 1917 is an total experience because of the way the film was shot, the sound landscape and the good actors. A film that can already be seen as one of the most important of the new 20 decade."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"It's not often a movie can touch you so emotionally and capture you, captivate you and hold you right in the centre for the whole two hours.
Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins have succeeded in this and with great achievement.
The Cinematography is beautiful, the music is heart pounding and builds your Adrenalin from start to finish.
The two leads are great and believable and there's nothing in this film I can fault.
I hope this clears the board at the Oscars as it truly well deserves 👍"
1917,25 March 2020,5/10,"One of the most boring movies I've seen this year. This is not a war movie, it's a movie about war. It's a boring movie."
1917,2 May 2020,8/10,"Very good movie, just brilliant...the story, the way that was filmed, everything... good job"
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"If you love Cinema just choose the biggest screen in a theatre and just go and have Cinematic Orgasm watch 1917

1917,8 April 2020,10/10,You will be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,Never seen a film so quickly establish memorable characters so well. The two main characters have believable chemistry and at no point are you broken by a weird delivery or bad writing. The former being notably impressive as the entire film is edited as a single shot. There is only one visible cut in the entire movie. If you've seen Birdman then you know what to expect.Sam Mendes seems to be pretty contempt being one of my favourite directors of all time as he's done nothing to jeopardise that position (excluding Spectre which was probably his biggest misstep thus far) the way he structures a scene makes it feel alive and entirely like a real war zone. The sheer quantity of real extras is used to great effect to make achieve the aforementioned effect. There are hundreds of extras in one of the final scenes and that shot alone probably earned Mendes his Golden Globe and likely the Oscar I can confidently say he's going to be nominated for.I'd say it's a definite favorite of mine and should be seen by any fan of cinema.
1917,15 May 2020,2/10,Same thing over and over again. Soslow moving and redundant that you get it all in the first 5 minutes. Too long scenes just running through trenches over and over again. Some scenes last a long time and accomplish nothing. Use of 'dark shooting' to cover any detail.Just another long dumb movie.
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,"This is my first movie review on this site. AMAZING MOVIE. Please, go see it. 11 out of 10."
1917,17 September 2020,3/10,"Yeah yeah the cinematography is good but with lots of bad CGI!! But shouldn't all of this be good in this day & age!?!?!? Mind numbing and boring ALL the way through. How anyone can be captivated by this ""story' boggles the mind. I have a great interest in the first world war and history in general. But this had me yawning all the way through. It could have been such a good film if some thought had gone in to the story line and characters. Most of it is just slow shots of walking along trench lines or no mans land, through woodland or floating down a river. Very disappointing."
1917,26 October 2020,1/10,"Not sure that the casting director has done this before, I felt the actors were transparent and unable to adapt to the fact that it was 1917.Such a bore....nevermind the sentimentality that it was personal to mendes....this was a story that could have been told in a fifteen minute short.See it for what it is.. a slow and empty tale of which there are a million.Cinematography excellent, story atmosphere poor.Another two hours ill never get back"
1917,20 February 2020,6/10,"Not a bad movie, basic story combines Saving Private Ryan and Gillipolli. Two classics. Two English soldiers set off to deliver an urgent message to cancel an attack, that is a German trap. Based on real events where the Germans retreated to shorten their lines, into a stronger defensive position. The two go through deserted German trenches, where they come across Germans who can't shoot accurately or will sneakily stab them if they try to help them.
War scenes are good but the film lacks depth."
1917,3 February 2020,8/10,I'm never gonna piss at a tree again.Also rat almost ended the movie.
1917,31 December 2019,4/10,"And will continue watching but OMG I hope I do not fall a sleep.Private Ryan comparison? NO WAY, unless this movie does a complete turn around in the last hour. I rate the first 1 hr as a 3 and even if it gets better I can not see it getting past a 5 rating. I will finish watching now. OK last 15 minutes shot my ranking up to a 5 rating for the last hour but still only gets a 4 rating from me"
1917,13 April 2020,1/10,We were in an excellent theater expecting to really enjoy this movie. It's extremely stupid. One example....guy's buddy just got killed. He starts dragging his body to no where and while he's doing it a few guys magically walk up. It's quiet. No wind. No explosions. Very quiet. This guy just say his buddy die. He doesn't hear several guys approach? It gets better. 50 yards away we find an entire convoy of truck built in 1916 has magically driven up. They must be running a cloaking device right?The guy that dies is 50 lbs overweight in a time where there is very little food.The German position has bags of rotten food. They are obviously starving. Eating garbage. Then our hero's walk out the back of the Germany's position and find that the Germans have killed a bunch of cows. They are fresh. You are starving but within 100 yards is a bunch of cows.If you make it to the sniper shooting at the remaining hero you will reach the point where I gave up. Talk about magic bullets.Hollywood.....how can you assume we are so stupid as to watch your junk.This movie is worse than The Revanant.
1917,27 March 2020,1/10,"The title says it all, don't waste your time on this one. I found myself bored since the first minute of the movie. I didn't care much about any of the characters, they were uninteresting and monotone throughout. The writing was terrible that I did not care of what was happening at all. The camera work was amazing but that's about it. The one shot was clever contributed to how slow this movie was. Overall, a forgettable Oscar bait movie."
1917,11 May 2020,5/10,"I love true stories. While this is a great story from the history books this movie did not resonate with me. The acting was acting. And that is not a compliment. Too many directing mistakes to count. As director Milos Forman would say ""it has to be real."" If One manages to get out of a rapid rushing river they would be exhausted. Okay check that. But then 10 seconds later they're walking like nothing happened? Hmmm. Well, this is how my directing mind works while watching a movie.
I gave it a 5 because it's based on a historical event and it had a good cinematography. The acting and directing was very disappointing. IMO."
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,This movie is not even a true story it's just some story that his grandpa told him
1917,19 March 2020,10/10,"I loved the way the camera revolved around the actors, scenes etc - it's like the whole movie's one great long shot!
This is an amazing unheard true story of a hero ever been told!"
1917,23 November 2021,9/10,This film was visually epic and caught all the horrors of WW1. It's one shot filming only added to the intense journey we find ourselves on. I would say one of the best war films I've seen for a very long time.
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"Riveting.The ""one shot"" feel was awesome. Truly made me feel like I was right there for the journey (and a heroic journey it was).Definitely different than any war movie I've ever seen, and had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.They could have drawn it out to make it a 3-hour long movie, but I'm so glad they didn't. The run-time was perfect.All in all it was a solid 9+."
1917,22 January 2020,3/10,"I know there are not many ""well made"", WW1 films and this one doesn't make the grade . Nothing new to see here and recommend watching Masterpieces such as Gallipoli and All Quiet on the western front."
1917,13 January 2020,5/10,"No surprises. Low budget war flick. Good as made for TV movie. Cheesy dialogues. "" They killed the cows!...'pause'....so that we wouldn't Eat them!""....wow....thank you Mr. Obvious."
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,"Of all the movies nominated for the best picture award at the 2020 Oscars, this one is definitely the best. I wastched it in 2d IMAX , and trust me, that's the way its meant to be watched. The movie goes from one set piece to another without leaving the side of the protagonist (aside from one moment in which the lead blacks out and wakes up, during which a lot of time has passed.)
This movie is a technical marvel and even the background score is amazing (watch out for a sequence set amidst glaring lights, the whole score is amazing.)"
1917,31 December 2019,10/10,"For your information, Sam Mendes' directed masterpiece is based on a story told from his grandfather who served in the WW1 and was assigned the similar task depicted in this film. I sensed the honesty in the storyline. For example, the extent of the German military intelligence was not understated. The one continuous shot definitely made the biggest contribution; Mendes and his team did a masterful job minimizing cuts or transitions while seamlessly shooting the battlefield scenes. I was extremely mesmerized by Roger Deakins' vivid cinematography that I think he deserves a second Oscar. Thomas Newman's score was marvelous, which lifted and sank my heart in scene by scene. The production designers accurately recreated the war zones and trenches where soldiers endured both the terror and desolation of war.Forbes reviews 1917 as ""The Best Picture of the Year,"" and I completely agree with that assertion. This deserves to join the list of films that will be highly regarded and recognized during this awards cycle, such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Irishman, Parasite, and Marriage Story."
1917,8 May 2020,10/10,"I cannot for the life of me understand how Parasite won best picture compared to this incredible film. I tried to watch Parasite. Hated it, and not because of the subtitles."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"This movie deserves every accolade heading its way. Sam Mendes has delivered not only one of the best war movies ever but one of the best movies full stop. The first act is one seamlessly put together tracking shot that builds serious tension while throwing in a few uppercuts that really catch you off guard, the second half is nothing short of sublime. Beautifully terrifying, sensationally upsetting, heartbreaking and thrilling it doesnt let up right to the end credits. The performances from the leads are incredible and are soundly backed up by the wider cast and when paired with the most amazing cinematography means I have no criticisms at all to say about this film. See it, absorb it, remember the bravery of our elders ...then see it again."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,Watched this movie as I saw The Longest Day for the first time. A totally another movie off course but this movies a so rare. Maybe Platoon can battle with 1917.
1917,9 May 2020,7/10,"Poor under the aspect of the story, but good in audio effect and tension"
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"Technically the most impressive film ever, characters are relatable, the movie is just so well balanced and impactful just go watch it at the cinema no ifs or buts."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"It's up there. With Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's list and Band of brothers. It is an emotional, amazing and deeply effecting story with a very effective Camera. Perfect in every way. It should definitely win movie of the year. Ounce upon a time in Hollywood was good but there were flaws in the storytelling. This movie is perfect from beginning to end."
1917,12 January 2020,,"Meticulous as to details with the exception,showed conditions really as what the were,bloody,muddy,dirty,horrible, with the exception that when ever the soles of their boots were shown,either or dead bodies or people in prone position,the tread and soles were all fresh and new.Real world,they would have been worn way down.Also,the song Wayward Stanger Soldier appears to use the old Hymn.Goin Home as it's inspiration,maybe too close.
Reminded me of Red Badge of Courage,but great in it's own right"
1917,12 January 2020,,"Meticulous in everyway,with exception of when soles of boots were shown.Unlike reality when they would have been worn down to threadbare,maybe even with worn out holes,they were all new and fresh with tread.
Song that propelled movie,WAYWARD STANGER SOLDIER, is obviously based on old hymn,,' Goin HomeReminded me so much of Red Badge Of Courage,but true story and great in it's own right."
1917,25 April 2020,9/10,"This was a great film as it so realistically captured the war effort from the English soldiers perspective. Very grounded and a very realistic perspective on how things were, and were probably handled (we'll never truly know).I also found how myself constantly thinking of the core decency of the main character (and others) and what a horrible situation they all were in and how people adapt and the strength of human will. It took me a while to get to watching it and all the hype was right - Great film!"
1917,27 March 2021,2/10,"This was a big miss. Predictable and just kept missing the mark. If you're looking for a great WWI movie, the Lost Battalion is far superior."
1917,26 March 2020,8/10,"I have to say this was a beautifully shot movie!. The cinematography was outstanding and everything from the actors, props, background and filming locations couldn't have gotten any better.However, this is not an action movie of any sort."
1917,2 January 2020,10/10,"So rare nowadays to watch a movie that has good actors and a good script. Sometimes I think that one out of ten movies is worth watching. 1917 is really really good and. Highly recommend watching it, thank me later."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"This story is based on a true story, and when you know that going into the movie like I did, every part seems grimmer than it would have otherwise. Stories follow guidelines, but real events don't and this movie shows exactly that. There are moments that are horrifying, where you feel the fear these people must have had. It shows that one moment everything can be going well, and next you might be dead.When watching this movie, there wasn't a moment where you felt like you could relax, so dont splurge on lots of snacks, you wont eat it.All in all, this is a movie that will go into my top movies for sure."
1917,23 February 2020,1/10,"Having watched the film twice now, I cannot comprehend the reasoning behind the fawning praise and the 8.5/10 rating. As a war film it was decidedly lame and sanitized, with its clean newly dug trenches where comfort was occasionally disturbed by a shell or two! The acting adequate - though nothing special or outstanding. The Storyline was merely a rehashing of much that had gone before it and better told...Here, there was no utter misery of trench warfare. The ubiquitous mud, the dissembled rotting corpses, vermin infestation, the endless queue of broken bodies stricken by war and epidemics.. This '1917' occurred on different planet - where war is glorified and sanitised. much has been made of the single shot filming technique. One has to wonder... 'so what'? Surely, cinematic innovative filming techniques are deployed to aid more accurate , dramatic story telling.... Given the paucity of the storey line and the insultingly sanitised mise-en-scène just about any filming technique would have done. indeed, a handheld 16mm camera might have greatly improved the end result."
1917,22 February 2020,6/10,"2 hours of high adrenaline, but without a plot. I wouldn't recommend it."
1917,16 March 2020,6/10,"There is no denying that this movie gets a 10/10 for visuals and cinematography. But when you put those things aside, you see an amazing story that could never reach its full potential. Half this movie is just the main character walking around. And then the other half are war sequences that lack any action or entertainment. Also, his friend from the beginning that died 30 minutes in was pointless. We never got to actually connect with him. Overall this could've been great, but instead misses the mark.Consensus: 1917 is a visually stunning film, however, this is brought down by a story that never reaches its full potential, and an overall boring adventure.
Visuals and cinematography: 10/10
Story and plot: 4/10
Acting: 8/10
Entertainment: 4/10Overall: 6.5/10"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"What an incredible film. The protagonists are rarely out if shot, accentuating their roles in the film. The cinematography is jaw dropping and aids your transportation into life in the trenches in WWI. The mission they're given is nigh impossible and their determination and bravery is to be applauded.
What I enjoyed most about this film is that the focus is not on the special effects of the shrill demented choirs of gunfire and shelling that must have been horrific to experience, but on the emotions felt by those featured.
If Saving Private Ryan is the WWII to see, then 1917 is its WWI counterpart."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,Very dramatic war film that shows the terror and trauma in all its horror. The seemingly one long shot of the first and second part adds to the whole stress of the operation of the two cadets. beautifully shot landscapes contrast the stoic but terrified characters.What I escpecially liked abt the film was that it included sikh and black soldiers.A film abt their experiences in the military and during the war would be much appreciated and necessary.As I wrote in the beginning i liked the film a lot but there have been enough stories told abt white male suffering :D
1917,28 February 2020,10/10,The most engrossing war movie I've ever seen. The whole time I was mesmerized wondering how the camera was rolling through the scene. Beautifully done
1917,13 March 2020,8/10,"You've gotta watch it just for the sake of the unique way in which it was shot. It tells the story in a way that no other filming technique could. I've rated it so highly just because of the brilliant execution artistically but the story itself for some reason wasn't as impactful on an emotional level as I hoped it would be. That said, it wasn't SO flat that I felt disappointed and I enjoyed watching the story unfold."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"The Beatles sang ""Two of Us"" and ""1917"", shows the camaraderie of two on a mission and what it means to be faithful to the needs of another and being willing to completely shoulder the burden, seeing the task through!"
1917,3 February 2020,4/10,"As usual with movies today , great cinematography brilliant shots and details but poor understanding of actual history. Movie filled with cliches and tropes. As a little story is nice and emotional but has no substance within the historical context. NOT for the hardcore history buffs like myself. I've tried to be objective and gave it a 4/10."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"For me this was the best movie. The camera work, the sound, the story and all the emotions with it. This is now my new favourite"
1917,20 March 2020,10/10,This movie is a true marvel when it comes to cinematography. You really get invested into the story and follow the journey with anticipation and excitement. Amazing movie with an amazing sound design and (as mentioned) wonderful cinematography.
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"Everything this top notch...literally everything!
It reminds me of Saving Pvt Ryan. The production design can't be any better. The background score, the cinematography is one of the best I have seen. Not to forget the hard work put up by Cast and the crew!"
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"1917 and Dunkirk are the best world war films up-to-date.The visual effects,cinematography,direction,music are all a masterpiece."
1917,21 October 2020,5/10,Well filmed but lacks credibility. Plot line and characters simply unbelievable.
1917,22 February 2020,10/10,"I knew going in I would like this movie. Historical/Historical Fiction are a favorite of mine. I did not realize that this would become on of my favorite of the genre and just how much I would love it. This movie captures what real soldiers of the time must have felt. It drives home the idea that these soldiers werent out their just looking for a kill. These guys were people with friends and family and just wanted to keep them safe and see them again. The camaraderie between Blake and Schofield can be felt from the beginning. The movie takes off from the start but you can tell these two men have a friendship that has been through the worst of war. The movies really shows that none of these men are particularly in this war for glory. They are here to do their job and get home. Except for one man (late in the movie). The dialogue throughout isnt some grand speeches or long winded monologues, its straight and to the point but in a beautifully told way that again emphasizes the situation. The main characters convey such emotion visually as well. It's almost like you can feel it yourself. The actual filming itself is amazing as well. They have these long continuous shots that really keep you on edge and engaged in the movies well. You literally follow these men's entire journey and it connects you with the main characters even more. This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing more than a couple times."
1917,23 December 2020,10/10,"This is like the nightmare from which you can't wake up. Amazing movie, from the first to the last scene.
One of the best movies ever made. I can't describe how I feel, im so depressed now and .... Oh my God.... Just watch the movie!!!!"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,Absolutely excellent. There are no words that can describe the emotions felt during the whole 2 hours. The first 30 mins or so alone deserves an academy award and it just gets better and more intense from there.Remarkable film making and a fitting tribute to the fallen.
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,It deserved a better ending. All the rest was very entertaining.
1917,7 June 2020,2/10,Worst war drama ever!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste ur time watching it!!
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,The camera work practically puts you in the movie. Experience the story like you are the third member of the team. Good building up of suspense. Ending was OK but lacked punch. Was expecting something a little more dramatic from the final scene.A movie that must be watched on the big screen.
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,I found 1917 to be very entertaining and inspiring to be persistence and have faith in your own abilities to get there; to obtain your goal at ALL cost.I throughly enjoyed this War movie and the Music was fantastic!! Yes I paid attention to the Music ;-)
1917,12 January 2020,6/10,"While the direction, editing and sound design is top notch, the pacing really hurt this film. There are many moments where I sat there bored because a scene would go on for too long. And because the characters are not that interesting, I can't immerse myself into the movie. Would still reccomend seeing it for the direction and cinematography, though, because it is amazing."
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,1917 is a glorious Shot film. This is the best war movie which I have ever seen. The entire movie made to take it's shot at one single shot
1917,21 December 2020,7/10,"The camera shots are amazing, as well as editing between the scenes.
However, there's a small lack of character development that causes to movie to fall short, as well as some plot material.Overall. It's a good war movie. It's no full metal jacket. But it can compare with many of the higher ups in the business"
1917,21 March 2020,7/10,It is good movie ! But it could be better than this ! I had more expect !
1917,20 February 2021,10/10,"It's so great. Acting, cinematography (especially cinematography holly crap was it great!) directing, everything worked into itself to create a rollercoaster of emotions that can be seldom experienced. This film brings EMOTION. No longer is the aim of the story to be quippy and self indulgent but to leave you with something to eat. This movie feels like that scene in ratatouille when remi is trying to teach Emile about experiencing flavors of cheese and a strawberry. The aim is to experience the movie not have a surface level plot with surface level characters and an u genuine story. 1917 is a refreshing reminder that movies are not all car ok copies in attempts for corporate cash grabs. Rather, they can be art. They can be a true expression of emotions, which characters we care about in a story with stakes. Thank you 1917 for being that thrilling but artful experience cinema is meant to be"
1917,29 May 2021,2/10,"Most interesting part of the movie was the visuals and direction. Everything else was as simple as a children's storybook. Good movie to watch if you're into that plain and simple atmosphere and immersion but personally I feel like I didn't get anything out of it. There seems to be no point, no message and no new innovative or even creative ideas. Some scenes are just so stereotypical and cheesy it was hard to sit through. Hard to believe this is considered one of the best movies of the year. The film industry can't be that dry, can it?"
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,Absolutely loved this film pulled at the heart strings
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,"The whole military basis of this story is FALSE.
If a general had needed to get an important message to a regiment facing a massacre he would have had a plane fly over the regiment and drop a message attached to a streamer so it could be picked up. Relying on 2 corporals to walk many miles through known enemy territory has a zero percent chance of success, as everyone would have known.
Front-line trenches of the 'Devons' were constructed by machinery for the movie as these broad trenches could never have been dug by a small group (1600).
No attempt made to explain why so many men were insane enough to put themselves in these crazy, high-death situations. God, king & Country only go so far - perhaps, they were infected with Male-Madness: aka Testosterone?"
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"""1917,"" set during World War I, is the story of two young British soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), impossible mission to deliver a message to another battalion in occupied German territory. If they succeed in getting there, their letter to retreat will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), from walking into certain doom.""1917"" is the newest film from ""American Beauty"" director Sam Mendes. Unlike ""American Beauty,"" which relies on great characters and a strong story, ""1917"" never gives time to develop these attributes. The action in the film moves so quickly that we never get much character development time with Blake (Chapman) and Schofield (MacKay). When we do, those times were great, both Chapman and Mackay performed excellently in their dialogue scenes. But, these scenes were the only time we could get a sense of their personalities. Scenes that ultimately felt like pauses between the technically genius one-shot style frantic action scenes, and never the primary focus of the film.The best aspect of ""1917"" is the cinematography. You can't help but get a heart-wrenching feeling as you move with the characters through the rat-infested trenches. We pass by shell shocked soldiers who look like they've been squatting in the same position for hours, maybe even days-every moment radiantly captured by the genius cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Who now, almost yearly, earns an Oscar nomination for each film he does. Years back, he was the Coen brothers go-to director of photography now each project he does seem to be bigger and bolder than the next. Deakins brings an excellent theater experience to each film he does, and ""1917"" will not disappoint. There's a scene in the movie that uses bombs and flare flashes to light a night scene that came out so beautifully while adding a layer of tension to the story that I found astounding to watch.""1917"" made me think of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but if you cut out 3/4 of the story and kept just the action scenes. I wouldn't say I like bringing up other movies while reviewing, but I feel like one can't help do that with the war movie genre. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" there's a more elaborate storyline, a stronger sense of knowing the characters, and also great action. ""1917"" gives only the action part of the formula, in my opinion. But, the unbroken shot technique to show World War I action was so impressive that it made the movie thrilling to watch the whole time."
1917,13 January 2020,4/10,"This is a very dull movie. No ""wow"" moments at all for a war movie. Writing is poor. The two characters are dumb. Too many cliches. It's like they took the blueprint for your average B rated horror movie and tried to use it for a war movie. You know that commercial where the people are running from the chainsaw wielding maniac, and they are trying to figure out where to go, and one says why can't we just get in the running car? and another says what are you crazy? Let's hide in the shed. It's that kind of dumb. I took my mother to see this along with my brother. She said it was boring and my brother called it a dud. Wait for it to come on HBO. Or don't watch it at all. You will forget it in the months to come."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"Beautifully shot, actors were amazing, incredible use of sound and score. This movie draws you in as if you are apart of the story, it may just be the start of 2020 but this movie is probably the best movie of the year."
1917,23 January 2020,5/10,"This movie looks amazing. Easy Oscar for cinematography. But it was boring and a lot of nonsense from story point.The things that didnt made sense:
1. Why they send only 2 soldiers if its that
important?
2. Why did he want to help the enemy?
3. How the hell did at least 100 soldiers and a
caravan get there without any singn?
4. Where did the 100 soldiers go when he
were shot at by the sniper?
And etc. etc.
I wanted to like this movie but i was bored to death."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,Very entertaining.Finally someone depicting the World Wars as they should be. Love the token commonwealth diversity which made it so real to me. Why haven't Directors done this before? Genius
1917,14 February 2020,7/10,"Distances aren't real,it shouldn't has to have one shot,more shots would help it to have real science.⚡"
1917,14 February 2020,7/10,"It shouldn't to use one shot (it isn't one shot it special cuts does majics,so it seems one shot.),this job make fake distances and sciences ."
1917,8 February 2020,5/10,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, but was surprised to see it was focused on two soldiers in particular, and they remained the main focus throughout.
I felt the the film captured some of the horrors of world war 1 in the trenches with dead bodies of soldiers, rotting horses and rats. I believe conditions to have been even worse than depicted in this film, but they handled it well giving an idea of the horrors that soldiers encountered.
Bits that I didn't like about this film were things like the single cow alive, with a pail of milk nearby, while everything else has been killed and fruit trees cut down. I can't believe that the German pilot that they rescued would have just pulled a knife and killed his rescuer. In the first war pilots were very honourable with a sense of fair play, so this underhand attack doesn't sit well with me.
The soldier that is left then becomes invincible, when he later ends up with no rifle, helmet or anything, but still manages to evade bullets and bombs. At one point in the dark when discovered by the Germans they shout Englander. How on earth would they know this one guy is English and not French or Belgian?
Then he stumbles on a battalion of soldiers in the woods just listening to a soldier singing, with no regard for any possible attacks from Germans as he just wanders in and sits down with them.
It was all too English flag waving and how they won the war, it needed more balance.
Well done on the scenes, but the superhero brits didn't work for me."
1917,14 February 2020,1/10,"This is not a WWI movie ,its more like a polished ,fake, made up, documentary that has major Hollywood puff added. This 1917 movie is not good, it has beautiful scenes of trenches and bunkers, that's it! What it dose not provide is a visceral,brutal,horrifying,bloody or truthful depiction of what it was really like (or even a half attempt) in the trenches of WWI, if that's what you want don't look here! Hell, This movie did not even try to convey the Three most terrifying words in wwi... ""men prepare bayonets!
Also, Anyone saying this movie is like Saving Private Ryan only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie! Because after that 1917 really gets bad, I'm talking snooze fest bad! If anyone wants to watch a really well made, great WWI movie check out THE LOST BATTALION, it was made twenty years ago and blows this 1917 movie out of the water!
P.S. My Daughter who took me to see this apologized to me as we were walking out of the theater.
Matt"
1917,21 March 2020,7/10,"Big shot 1. With much said about the long continuous shot and me being no expert, I have nothing to add except that it is brilliant and rewarding to watch.
Big shot 2. Of good use were the big shots Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch to draw one's attention and even carry one's excitement.Apart from the two elements, I believe there was not much else to this war movie. Neither gruesomeness nor tragedy seemed effective enough to me. Honestly, when a central character is knocked unconscious from a sniper shot and doesn't die, I am bummed out. Googling tells me there isn't much historical accuracy to the film either. That's too many let-downs, and therefore, a 7-star seems enough."
1917,16 March 2020,7/10,"I see a gorgeous work in the visual effects
But the story didn't steal my attention!Also, the exaggerations in making German's too idiots aren't going well!"
1917,15 March 2020,9/10,"One of the finest this year, it really gets on your nerves and forces you to pay attention all the time, and the photography? 10/10, Really loved it and would recommend"
1917,8 May 2020,8/10,It felt that all was taken on a one long continuous take. Gripping and exhausting at the same time. Focuses on a single task or goal that will have a huge impact on history.
1917,28 May 2020,8/10,"""if you use the traditional narrative technique, you will not feel the urgent crisis. You will keep going, and you will never look back. ""
As the production says, the long shot has the effect of allowing the audience to go deep into the film and be rendered and experienced in the atmosphere. Because of this, in order to highlight the fact that ""1600 brothers will be slaughtered as long as there is no immediate message,"" the audience can be shot in this way, and the audience will be rendered by this urgent crisis in the cinema, and will have a definite experience of the mood of the two soldiers in the story. Whether at the beginning Blake learned that his brother was in the midst of a trap, eager to convey a message, and in the final Schofeld running directly in the bombed battlefield, these clips would not be so shocking if they were used in traditional narrative techniques, because attention and accumulated emotions would be distracted during editing and transfer. But one-mirror shooting methods will not have these problems, the difference is that all the scenes and pictures are coherent, and naturally our focus and focus in the cinema will not be interrupted by the field and editing, so from the beginning of the accumulated atmosphere of Zhang urgent will continue to follow the protagonist until the successful delivery of orders."
1917,29 June 2020,10/10,"When i saw this at the movie theater i left speachless. This movie is by far the best movie i have seen in recent memory. So impressive that it is just one long take. Beautifull scenes, incredible acting. Very touching movie. Lest we forget."
1917,12 July 2020,9/10,1917 is all my hearts. Usually historical films can bore me or I loose attention but this was such a captivating film that I was completely engaged and engrossed in the movie. George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman have absolutely done justice to their roles. Not for a single second you will feel they have detached from the character. The editing of the film is done such incredibly that the entire film looks like one shot. This is a great show put up to get idea about what happened back then and how these two gentlemen hold the entire film together. Another film you should definitely add in you 'Must-Watch' list :)
1917,28 September 2020,10/10,This is by far the best film I've ever seen but it has to be experienced in a cinema or via a projector... Its lost on your regular TV. The camera work is marvelous and it seems to capture an era with absolute ruggedness.
1917,8 January 2021,10/10,"Absolutely incredible movie. I have watched it at least 6 times, and I'm just as blown away as first time I watched it. Fantastic acting, amazing script, magnificent music and of course the most beautiful way of filming a movie. Probably one of the best movies I've ever watched. Also a lot of poetic quotes... I would 100% recommend this movie!For the first time ever I would rate a movie 10/10"
1917,20 March 2021,10/10,"I remembered when I watched the trailer, this film looked intriguing. But I was expecting it to be just like another typical war film. However, when I first saw it after the Award ceremony buzz, I was completely surprised by how emotional and beautiful this film was. Not to mention the sheer amount of intensity that is shown here. We experience the struggles and horrors these soldiers go through while fighting in the war, and I feel all sorts of sympathy for all of them. And that climax is one of the best I've ever seen in film. It is the definition of determination and inspirational. This is truly a remarkable technical achievement of cinema, and I highly recommend it."
1917,12 March 2021,9/10,"This film was so realistic and emotional. i loved it. the actors were so good, their acting was so real. the cinematography was... amazing. i hope i won't forget about it.
the ending scene was so calming
romana: ultima scena a fost cea mai frumoasa intruchipare a calmului pe care am vazut-o vreodata. am simtit usurarea pe care protagonistul a simtit-o. a fost genial"
1917,28 November 2021,10/10,"What a great movie. Roger Deakins puts in some truly top-both cinematography, as is to be expected. When compared to Dunkirk, which is the main movie I hear people comparing 1917 to, the characterization here feels much more personal. The violence is quick and realistic and scary without being excessive, making this movie considerably more accessible than similar recent war films. The music, acting, set pieces, etc are all pretty much flawless, and the tracking shot technique works wonderfully. However, the fact that it still manages to tell such an intense and compelling story is the true wonder of 1917."
1917,25 March 2020,4/10,"I must say that I was dissapointed in watching 1917
because it could have been a great film about WWI.The problem with the film 1917 is that its gimmicky story telling and surreal filming style distract and got in the way of telling the horrors of wars!1917 could have been as good as Platoon, Apocalype Now & Schindler's List."
1917,18 January 2020,2/10,Similar story as Saving Private Ryan (trying to locate someone in an active war zone) minus 99.8 percent of the action.Boring and hard to watch.
1917,6 February 2020,7/10,"The camera work is definitely good. Tension build up in most scenes also pretty good.
At certain points in the movie you feel the horrors of trench war.The story line begins promising but throughout the journey it misses a lot and for me it wasn't important any more.
That left me with hope for good action scenes but unfortunately that also did not worked out the way I hoped for.
I think the makers aimed for a to big audience and included the younger viewers who cant handel the gore.
If you really want to make a realistic movie about war and battle with lots of detail you should go all the way in my opinion (for example ""full metal jacket"").
But this movie is not all the way, this is a good halfway. Way to prude as they say in Britain.It could be a really intense good war movie do.
Too bad"
1917,30 January 2020,5/10,"In 2019 I got quite confused as to what classifies as a great movie. I had high hopes for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and got utterly disappointed. The Irishman was long and boring with actors that were doing the same routine for the 1000th time. And again with 1917 I don't get why people rave so much about it? 1917, like Dunkerk is not a great movie. Both movies are very weak and totally unbelievable.I admit, the one shot camera work in 1917 is nice, but it did not leave me with my mouth open. And then the story itself is very shallow, it's just not gripping or believable. The 2 soldiers sent on the mission lack depth and they look more like they're on a school trip. There's no fear, no emotion, no tension. It's all very shallow and unrealistic. Not once do you get the feeling they are on a dangerous mission. Even when one of them dies he seems quite relaxed about it and not panicked or worried at all. Oh well I guess I'm gonna die, too bad, but hey what can you do?The other soldier gets shot at a thousand times by both snipers and regular soldiers, but I guess they used the A-Team approach here, lots of firing but somehow he never gets hit...In the end we see a reprise of Saving Private Ryan, but not in a good way.I'm not a director or an actor, but I found this movie utterly weak.I haven't seen all Oscar nominees, but Joker should get it or any of the movies I still have to see. If this movie wins then I'll just give up trying to understand what makes a good movie. But 1917 isn't one... It does not even deserve the nomination."
1917,5 January 2020,10/10,"I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture. I'm not at all a fan of war movies but I am a fan of great movies....and 1917 is a great movie.
I have never been so mesmerized by set design and direction, the mass human emotion of this film is astonishingly captured and embedded magically in the audience. It keeps running through my mind...the poetry and beauty intertwined with the raw misery of war.
Treat yourself....see this movie!"
1917,17 January 2020,,"1917 with its realistic landscape and live action depicted the horror of trench warfare more dramatically than any previous film of the same genre that I have seen. There were number of bad mistakes such how did the letters and photos in Corporal Scofield pocket survive to become readable after he was washed down a river in full flow. These and others, however, did not detract from a very human story which apparently was based true events experience by Sam Mended grandfather.
All young people of our generation should see this film to appreciate what soldiers endured in that unnecessary and fruitless war. My admiration goes to the camera crews who took many sequences in single shots following the soldiers through the trenches. A truly epic film which I would gladly see again. I recommend seeing in a wide screen format to appreciate the scale of the landscape"
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"*1917*
I, actually, am stunned after watching this film. It's hard to decide where to start. I didn't think any film would come close to Joker this year, but 1917 has arrived right next to the DC masterpiece. Huge amount of credits go to cinematography. It's an incredible talent because once the movie starts, you would realize that the director has not shouted CUT! and the cameras are rolling and the movie is moving ahead without any cuts! The actors' expressions, their makeup, the whole war scenario art composition, the story with a fabulous direction serves us a day in life of soldiers making us awe, worry, laugh, cry, and appreciate such a creation.My rating 9.2 🌟"
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"WWI movies are not so frequent, but when they are good, they convey the view most effectively that wars are to be avoided.
One aspect was absent: that the action takes place in France. It looks terribly like where the movie is shot, England and Scotland, weather, landscape and all."
1917,16 January 2020,4/10,"Like all reviewers have said, yes the film is shot beautifully. The cinematography is at times breathtaking, specifically the town being lit by flares as our protagonist runs from gunfire. Beyond this, there isn't much to care about. First one of the two protagonists is killed off screen in the absolute dumbest way possible. The next hour have zero battles beyond the occasional running away from gunfire from stormtroopers apparently who can't hit anything. Our hero fires ONE shot the ENTIRE MOVIE. No exaggeration. The final half of the movie he doesn't even have a gun. So after the two hour run time of walking and dialogue, all building up to this hopefully climatic moment where he delivers the message and saves the battalion, the commander tells our hero to ""f off""....like what!? That's what we built up to? The film then wraps up with a pretty pointless informing the one brother his other brother is dead, where he is told ""thanks. Now go grab some food"" and roll credits. God what a missed opportunity at a movie about WW1."
1917,23 March 2020,6/10,"As many mentioned 10/10 should go to the cinematography. I believe many rated high because of this reason.
However, story line and the presentation is not strong enough to get beyond 6 stars from me. When taking about the acting facial expressions are poor. Director focus on the backgrounds of the scenes not on the faces of the actors."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"1917 tells a very simple story, but manages to have viewers on the edge of their seats just by the way, the story is told.During the movie I found myself asking, how they did some of the scenes with almost no visible cuts - in a war movie! The camera work is setting new bench marks and is definitely Oscar-worthy. This way of filmmaking draws the viewer into the action on the screen, as if he was part of it. The result is a atmosphere of danger and suspense, which is tangible for the viewer. Rarely I did experience a cinema audience that quiet.The acting is also very good, but some of the characters might have been a bit more interesting with more background and depth given to them.The set design is made with a lot of effort and adds even more to the general atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack underlines the scenes very well.This is the type of movie, which should absolutely be watched in cinema!"
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"Brilliant directing from Sam Mendes and outstanding Cinematography by Roger Deakins, but I gotta give this movie a solid 8 because some scenes felt very much like ""James Bond"" scenes and not quite convincing for a World War I movie. But It makes sense though, it's the director of the Bond movies here, so that's why. And to cut to the most important and the most unconvincing part: The Letter. He goes through all that trouble at the waterfall and the waters and at the end the letter is not destroyed not a little bit and even the writing paint should have been disfigured after all that trouble at the waterfall. That scene ruined the realistic part of the movie."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,Transfixed from start to finish. Flawless execution. The entire cast and crew ought to be congratulated. These stories will slowly be lost to history and so they deserve your time and attention.
1917,19 April 2021,5/10,This movie was even more boring than I thought it'd be based on what I'd seen of the trailer and reviews. As I recall one of the bigger talking points was about it's virtual single take aspect. I don't think this conceit served the movie well. It felt almost like a video game because some of the scene transitions were abrupt or unnatural relative to the action that preceded one scene to the next. Ultimately there were just too many of these jarring moments and with the director resisting making a normal cut I lost any connection to reality or a sense of caring about the characters. Kudos to its technical virtuosity but it left me cold when my blood should have been boiling with the daring story that was being told.
1917,24 July 2020,1/10,"Pointless, shallow, boring.
Not many years ago there was a time when the movies were made of gold. The golden age of cinema. Only if you have seen old classic movies you can realize that this movie is nothing but a fraud.
Meaningless nonsense. Trying to hide the lack of substance with tech proficiency and uninspired script.
But this is not the problem. Anybody can fail. It's human. what is utterly disappointing is that the viewers are not able to have personal opinions. They just follow the hype...
Cinema is dead... long live the Hype"
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"I've always been a fan of war films. They're not my favorite genre and I haven't seen all of them but I've seen all the classics.Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan etc. World War 1, 2 movies seem to be popular at the moment. It's a subject that hits home to a lot of brits and especially men around my age who are shocked to see how those boys went through hell.After seeing a short trailer for this film I knew it was a ""must see"". I'd seen Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" which was absolutely brilliant. And I got the same feeling after seeing the trailer for this film.After playing a round of minigolf with my sisters boyfriend we got a takeaway from Nandos and ate our food in the IMAX. We sat at the front of the cinema and were both blown away by the amazing story/cinematography and acting from this entire film.Sam Mendes is an excellent director. I loved Jarhead and this was even better. You're so immersed in the action and you feel like you're on a mission with the boys. The music is fantastic and overall just a brilliant movie.Can not stress enough how much you need to see this in IMAX"
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,"Before going into this film I'd seen plenty of reviews, award mentions, trailers and a strange amount of behind the scenes clips. Everything I saw told me that film should be fantastic and that's what I was worried about. Had I built up an opinion of the film before even seeing it? Would I only focus on the one shot cinematography?So by the time I sat down in a full cinema a few weeks into the film's release I was a bit nervous about the end result. Thankfully I didn't need to worry. Every exception was met and then some. I was in awe of the cinematography but I was certainly not distracted. It served the film excellently. There were some beautiful images to be enjoyed coupled with some of the most tender moments to come out of a horrific war film. The rise and fall of the score kept up with the scenes being laid before us and it's true that George MacKay was utterly brilliant.The performance of his was brilliant and I fear it was outshone by the rest of the noise about the film. None the less he pulled off a difficult and demanding role that I'm sure kept the audience on the edge of their seats to holding back tears in the final moments.A fantastic film, not just an art film and not just a war film. Something greater has been captured here by the team the brought together 1917."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"Everyone should see this film in the Cinema. The way Mendez has shot it is unbelievable! You feel apart of this harsh mission, and it has you on the edge of your seat!"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"It was ... stunning. First, the claustrophobic recreation of the trenches and the horror of the battlefield were so realistic, I SWEAR I could smell the death. (I realized early on that seeing it at a theatre that served food wasn't the wisest idea!) The most striking feature was the nearly 2 hour continuous, seamless take, which meant my heart was pounding and my throat was tight from 5 minutes in when they received their assignment. Added to that was the subtle scoring between the moments of the ""hottest"" action which was frequently just one continuous chord that just felt like the tension was getting more and more taut, to the point of strangulation. Aside from four recognizable faces in VERY brief cameos, the use of unknowns was also effective, kind of reflective of the anonymity of the common soldier. I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
1917,13 January 2020,6/10,"It's an experience, certainly, and I do recommend seeing it in a good cinema.Deakins was fantastic, absolutely, some stunning cinematography.But I found the movie incredibly disappointing overall. Feels like a missed opportunity, a very interesting experiment that just does not quite work.Most of the movie felt like a series of Call Of Duty cut scenes, a video game you had no control over, a really odd feeling, and some of the scenes were like a video game in content with reality stretched to almost breaking point.To me it was an adventure movie rather than a 'war movie', much more like Indiana Jones than Saving Private Ryan... To relate it to another movie I felt it reminded me very much of The Revenant in story and style, but like that movie it felt rather empty to me."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Oxford defines 'Cinematography' as - 'the art of photography and camerawork in film-making'
-it will become far more clear when you watch this movie.Its a war epic depicted from the messenger point of view. A soldier whose only mission is to deliver message on-time to the other end.Its a SINGLE TAKE MOVIE, means scene is constantly going on and camera is just following along!Believe me when I say, that this movie is gripping in its storytelling. It has the raw feeling & harshness of war in its appearance.
It is a brilliant movie to start this new year, as its my first movie that I watched in 2020.
Go watch it and Enjoy!"
1917,7 May 2020,7/10,"Since the focus is on one person, the frames are almost never wide enough for this to be a visual ""feast"", (although there moments like this). However since it is so focused it becomes more like a filet mignon. Elegant, polished, thoughtful, and of course delicious! They didn't just try and make a film where the camera seemingly never cuts. They also took great care to set up visually pleasing shots, making great use of angles and props. Not to mention is still works as a complete story. Excellent!"
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"A tremendous feat of film-making, which makes you feel as if you are alongside the main characters in this brilliant film. Filmed in one continuous shot it leads to many surprises and an intense feeling throughout the entire film. The story is simple but very effective at showing the horror of WW1 and what it did to these brave young men. Everyone should see this film."
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"A few words, gestures, expressions and the emptyness of War and two non-stop hours of a magical soundtrack saying words soldiers cannot say.
Unbelievable!"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"Story - 8 out of 10
A bit far fetched at times and the timeline/distances themselves never really make sense. However, it is totally engrossing and you are happy to believe every moment of it.Acting/Characters - 8 out of 10
A little weak to start off with but there are so many powerful and emotional moments throughout that you have yourself wondering how can this be the same film.Cinematography/Costume - 8 out of 10
Beautiful cinematography without being spectacular, the attention to detail on the uniforms and set designs are very impressive. The running scene at the end is one of my most favourite cinematic moments of all time.Soundtrack - 7 out of 10
Explosive and haunting all at the same time. Dialogue is clear and easy to understand.Overall - 8 out of 10
1917 is a war movie that doesn't rely on extreme levels of gore and brutality to have you gasping for air by the end of it. The constant suspense and overall tone of the film will have far more of an effect on you. Amazing movie!"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"I am an Iraq and Afghanistan combat Airborne Ranger. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be like every other WWI movie out there...good but not great... boy was I wrong!!!This movie grabbed me emotionally from the first second to the last. It triggered some very repressed emotions from my time in the military. It was an emotional roller coaster that had my heart pounding the entire time.This movie is a beautiful masterpiece that shows the true horrors of war that young men faced during that time. The sense of complete hopelessness but the drive of duty and honor to your fellow soldier.I left the theater with my wife with plans to go to dinner, I had to go home.Thank you for this movie, it was truly amazing. Best war movie ever made."
1917,16 February 2020,6/10,"Did Brits say ""Boche""? Did the Germans ever abandon a trench line and give up ground just to set a trap? Were the trenches arranged in rows: our trench, their trench, our trench, their trench? Didn't the battalion Schofield was trying to reach figure out on its own that it faced resistance the minute it went over the top? If the Germans destroyed their own guns, why not just blow up the trench as well? In every conflict, is there always a reluctant hero who just wants to get home but whose abilities soar above those of all around him? And does he just need some inspiration? And is his name sometimes Alvin? Was WWI a big Super Mario game that could be set for one player? And-biggest question of all-who milked that cow?"
1917,1 March 2020,6/10,"I believe that this is The Most Over-Hyped movie Of 2019..
Step aside your fascination with cinematography and Take an overall look at the movie to determine how good it may be..
I swear many people didn't notice James Bond film, Spectre, begins with a tracking shot that appears to go on for a full four minutes before the first cut."
1917,29 September 2020,10/10,"The movie is an extraordinary piece of cinematography.
Every second is work of art."
1917,26 February 2020,10/10,"Simply wow from the word go. Sound effects, cinematography, Acting, Direction, Emotions everything is just awesome. Loved it and will forever remain one of the best movies in my list. Felt like, i am in 1917 and not in 2020. Very engaging master piece."
1917,7 November 2021,10/10,This film was AMAZING! I felt like I was right there with the main characters. Only real *Ingrates would give this movie a 1 star! Seriously. These same people probably thought that WW 1984 was a Masterpiece!🤣
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Was looking at other reviews and so someone write: don't listen to the critics who say the movie is boring. THIS movie is beautifully done, tense, and well paced. Please watch jt"
1917,23 February 2020,10/10,Never been so captivated by production design and direction in a film before. The best war film in years and the best execution of a one shot movie ever made. Although parasite won best director at the Oscars I wouldn't have minded Mendes winning and it for sure should have won production design. Roger Deakins cinematography was obviously exceptional. Anyone will enjoy this film and appreciate its craft.
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,Loved the way this film was shot. It is fantastic that the main characters are in shot for the complete film.Loved it.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Firstly, you *must* watch this on an IMAX. DON'T ever see this on a small screen.This film had me and my brother moved to tears multiple times. The Night Window scene moved me to weep and I don't know why. (Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman also deserve a great deal of the credit).The format of the film is nothing like I've seen before (and I've seen Russian Ark) but the acting is brilliant to carry what starts as a weird method to follow the characters throughout their story."
1917,19 January 2020,1/10,"I am not sure why I sat through the entire film. Thank goodness it was half-price Tuesday for this Senior. Ususally if a director wants us to ""care"" about a character, we get to know them as we did Richard Jewell. Not in this case. Two fellows walk from France to Germany in a trench and do we even have a vested interest in whether they live or die? The first line of barbed wire, decaying horses, and men caught dead in barbed wire was reminiscent of the cold reality of ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" (the best WW1 film of late). Following scenes were as if we were watching a surreal dream sequence to nowhere. Even when the front-line commander got the message, his oh, ok reply made all that wait pointless. Golden Globes can take a hike and leave that parade."
1917,16 March 2020,2/10,"Possibly one of the worst war movies I have ever seen.
Very weak almost non existent story line (if you can call a couple of men walking through the countryside to get from A to B with minimal interaction a story line).
Acting was so so but not much for them to really act on.
By comparison Gallipoli (Mel Gibson) - similar story about two men trying to get a message to the troops, and Saving Private Ryan.
Both those movies are or were Oscar worthy and amazing, not this.
I have no idea what has gotten into the Academy these past few years."
1917,3 June 2020,8/10,"The score and the videography were beyond amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the visuals. The color grading was well done too.However there were a few moments in the film where I reached for my phone and poked around on it. The nonstop nature of the film meant it never really gave you a chance to slow down, but it wasn't able to hold your attention throughout either. The characters themselves aren't too important, and the film chooses not to focus on any development.I felt I was corporeally in world war 1 though, and the horror and discomfort shone bright during certain scenes. War is indeed brutal.I quite enjoyed Sam Mendes direction, and the whole movie being one shot made it feel as though we were taken on the adventure along with our protagonsist. All in all, solid movie."
1917,2 February 2020,4/10,"This journey lacks depth and strength. ""1917"" is too long, too padded, and too shallow. The characters are not interesting or well developed, and neither are the cameos of well known actors. A disappointment."
1917,12 July 2020,8/10,"I must admit, I am a lover of war movies but one thing that struck me about this particular one was how straight the point it was. Very little if any build up! It was also mainly just the main plot with very little if any side story. Brilliant watch!"
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,The message lf the continuity. How to keep going after a tragedy happens is represented through the amazing steady cam and longshots during the movie. Super recommended.
1917,30 August 2020,7/10,"Technically beautiful, the one-take effect is original and very immersive, this is how to make a film - just lack some great emotions and epic moment.
However, a must watch."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes has created a master piece of writing, acting and cinematography. The whole crew of this film bring their a-game and it's blatantly obvious when you watch it.I haven't cried this much at a film since I last watched Paddington 2"
1917,23 January 2020,7/10,"Extraordinary film.that really makes you feel you are in the middle of the trenches and the devastation of WW1. Superb photography throughout contrasting the beauty of the Normandy countryside in spring with the many corpses and wounded, endless mud, ruined villages and blasted trees etc. Good cast also though most of them only appeared briefly. The weakness is the script which in the opening exchanges between the 2 main characters seemed rather dull. However you are soon caught up on the amazing visual experience."
1917,14 January 2020,6/10,"The effort Sam Mendes has gone to to create an authentic WW1 setting is astonishing. The scenes of the trenches, dead horses, bomb craters etc really put you in the scenes, and I was blown away by the film from a visual point of view. My problem is that the plot holes in the story were as big as some of the bomb craters. And after leaving, I realised they were too many and obvious to allow me to enjoy the film. (I'm about to reveal spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen it).
So we all know that it's true that German forces retreated from trenches at times. As the distance between allied and opposing forces was as matter of yards in many cases, the fact they had abandoned their line would have been obvious over a relatively short period of time to the allies, because of air and recon intelligence.
When the rat triggered the trip wire, both men were literally on top of the trap. It was a big enough explosion to collapse the entire tunnel, but they both survived without a scratch.
After the pilot killed Blake, almost straight away, Schofield was suddenly joined by a huge troop of British Allies. Where did they come from? Why didn't they just take the message?
When they drop Schofield off, he immediately starts getting sniped, while the troops are presumably right next to him. Why didn't they shoot back to help? Where did they disappear to?
When Schofield is being chased, he kicks a door through in clear view of his pursuer, and the pursuer just runs on. Leaving Schofield to spend a random night with a woman and baby who happened to be surviving on their own with no food and water, hidden in the same ruins as German troops.
There are more. I won't labour the point, but once you start seeing the flaws, they just all add up to make what is a beautiful film just too implausible for me."
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,Every few years there is a film that jumps out and makes you think about how cinema can be used to inform us of historical importance. This is one gòd example
1917,29 January 2020,1/10,"It was like saving private Ryan without action scenes, good acting and story line..... what a boring 2h and the peak came with a singing guy from Devon company. Actually director of photography should be the only one being cheered after that movie. If you're looking for bright conversations, epic war scenes, amazing character storylines..... watch Saving Private Ryan once again, this is the same average film as Dunkirk... and why he didn't kill this German pilot at sight ? Lol PC? Help and let yourself kill ? Is it war or AA movie"
1917,13 March 2020,9/10,All nonsense of war in one scene...this is masterpiece!!!
1917,11 March 2020,,"1917 is an unique epic World War I story. Unlike other classical war time movies, it's not an ordinary heroism story but the thrilling, hellish horror of a war story. A very honest. The soldiers are brave but modest. Main characters are not showing gorgeous heroism like some other classic war movies to consolidate audience feelings but also main characters honorable spirits never yielding.
The heroes are two Bristish soldiers Schofield and Blake is tasked to an impossible mission by cruel commander, to carry a hand delivery message to an isolated battalion which prepares for an attack which will end with German army trap. The odyssey of two soldiers goes through horrors and the violence of war, the mud and the rotten corpses, rats, skulls, in the cold dark Rolling inside bomb pits, sniper fires at the barbed wires, deadly outraged enemies.
Director Mendes made this film based with some of his grandfathers memoirs, strongly giving antiwar messages. Also casting is good, for example at the end, the soldier met with war loving commander (acted by Benedict Cumberbatch). It's nonsense to say war scenes are good, but frankly cinematograhically, pictures of the spectacular battlefields is excellent. This masterful film will be a new standart at war films category."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,I was left speechless by the end. Absolutely stunning and gripping. I felt as if I was actually in the movie being carried along by this incredible story. A masterpiece! 10/10
1917,22 February 2020,10/10,"Wrapped up the last decade as one of the best films to come out in ages. Breathtaking and masterful. I saw it on a huge screen at the cinema and could barely blink. It should have won more than its 10 Oscar nominations, really. What a piece of work!"
1917,4 April 2020,8/10,"Great movie with absolute best cinematography.I think we all can say it is a visual masterpiece by Sam Mendes. The last time i watched something good as this was Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. Whole movie was shot at on shot gives you the felling of how the characters felt at the moment. It is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI. All the effort they put into make this happen deserve best gratitude that audience can give."
1917,10 April 2020,5/10,"A lot of logical fallacies which are obviously visible in the movie seems to have been ignored by other reviewers here. Although it's a sound film technically, the story just doesn't work for me.Maybe the movie did want to deliver some emotions and a message in the end , but I just couldn't get them because the one shot filmmaking gets so immersive that you just don't care about the character's emotions or expressions making the ending of the movie kindof weird.
The Woman - baby scene was when I felt like giving up- it didn't even add up to the plot! What was the need?"
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"There isn't anything I can, by way of adulation, that hasn't already been said about this film. But I will say this-it's damn special. It says something about a period piece when nearly 6 weeks after its release, on a Friday when a big budget movie is being released, that the theater is still half full. If you need help restoring your faith in the art, this outta do it."
1917,5 December 2019,10/10,"I saw the trailer to this movie I thought it was an interesting set up but, I thought I was going to play like every other war movie. The beginning of the movie It Takes a turn that surprise me and then I kind of play like Saving Private Ryan in a way. Only in a couple ways though everything else was kind of fresh and original."
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,I just don't see what people like about it.?! I thought Dunkirk was much better.
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I will not have any spoilers in my reviewFirst of all, the battlefield landscape/setting was nicely done and littered with bodies, artillery shells, barb wire fences. The camera footage is cool how it only focuses and follows the two main characters continuously, only showing the other soldiers and the landscape that immediately surrounds them. It makes you feel like you are there and it is certainly an unique way of filming.However, filming like that has its consequences. The movie is really limited in what it can show. It maybe puts too much focus on these two main characters without showing the bigger picture of the war they are in, as a perspective. The movie lacks a strong beginning and ending; it jumps right into the mission and has a rather abrupt ending. The climax of the film is very short and not much of a climax at all. But the biggest bummer is the severe lack of character introduction/background/development. Very little is revealed about the personal lives of either character, which is a bit shocking considering the entire movie only focuses on these characters. I was unable to connect with them or feel any emotions toward them during the scenes that were supposed to be much sadder than they ended up being. There is no bond or great dialogue between the two, either. The movie dragged on for too long with too much of the same thing.Because of how the movie was filmed in a continuous scene following the two characters, this movie would've been so much better if we learned more about the characters and saw more of a brotherly bond so that we could connect to them more."
1917,1 June 2020,9/10,A deserved Oscars winning movie including special guest appearances.
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,1917 is visually stunning with so many beautiful shots throughout the movie and the entire one shot really gets you immersed into the movie the story was amazing and very intense would recommend and watch again
1917,29 June 2020,10/10,I was amazed at how well done this movie is. Historically it is very accurate. It's basically about the German strategic withdrawal in 1917 to shorten their lines. They withdrew 9 miles in this case and the Allies assumed it was a ruse. So the story is about two soldiers attempting to warn their comrades that it is not a ruse....that the Germans have simply withdrawn to the much stronger Hindenburg line. One of the best WW1 movies I have seen in many years.
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"A masterpiece, really. That's all there is to it. Beautifully shot, beautifully written, beautifully executed. I have zero negatives about it. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely speechless."
1917,14 February 2020,9/10,Very good movie. The long track camera work was definitely Oscar worthy.
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"What I liked the most about this film is the way it is shot. The cinematography and direction of this film is outstanding, it truly is a visual stunner. The decision to film this as a 'one continuous shot' look was a brave decision and I'm sure many on the project had their doubts and possibly protests. I'm glad they pursued with it as it really pays off.The film follows two young soldiers, in a fairly simple plot - to deliver a message to call off an attack crossing through enemy lines. Although there are a many of special effects (you may have seen a plane crash in the trailer) the decision to tell the story using a continuous shot really adds to the trials and tribulations our protagonists face and makes this a more emotionally charged film.The film is always moving forward and there are many usages of camera angles which give more of a 360 degree view of what the soldiers are navigating and experiencing, rather than just seeing things through their eyes in a straight line. It was a really engaging technique and I liked the way we never traveled backwards as an audience except for one key instance which you will need to go see the film to understand.While I haven't seen all the films represented under the best cinematography category at the oscars, surely 1917 must win!"
1917,10 January 2020,1/10,"It's true what they say about sequels or remakes. They're never as good as the original. It was like watching a Disney animated feature made in to a live action film in reverse. Although, I must say that the preview trailer of the mixed live action/animated Call of the Wild with the CGI versions of Harrison Ford and Buck looked even worse. Although, the makers of 1917 could pull off a Godfather II with the sequel 1918. However, I'm sure 1919 would be as satisfying as The Godfather III. What's that saying about history repeating itself? Hmmmm. I can't recall. I've actually enjoyed those single shot videos on YouTube of people eating various types of food into a microphone for two hours more than 1917. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall during that meeting when they debated the title of the film. At least the sets were pretty!"
1917,18 January 2020,2/10,"This is what happens when you make a war film and spend all of your military adviser budget on soy lattes. This film is so historically inaccurate it makes Braveheart look like a documentary.
The only thing dumber than the characters and plot are the people giving this film a 10 out of 10.
I'll concede that the film is well shot and the cinematography is okay but certainly not worthy of the universal praise being heaped on it, not unless you think someone walking backwards down a trench with a steady-cam is the most impressive thing since someone figured out how to digitally edit a ""single take"""
1917,8 August 2020,8/10,"Not what I expexted but it wasn't a bad movie. Movie gets 7/10 but there is a lot of famous actors so i give it 8/10.
Colin Firth and Mark Strong from Kingsman. Richard madden from Game of thrones. Benedict Cumberbatch."
1917,28 February 2020,10/10,"1917 is 100 times better than Dunkirk.
The falling scene was really heartwarming.
Hats off to Sam Mendes!"
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"Masterpiece. Loved every second of it. The music, the pictures, the places. Brilliant. War cinema as it should be. Nothing more, nothing less. But if you want action film just don't watch it. It is drama, and it is the way all of the films about war should be."
1917,18 December 2019,10/10,"This is a Perfect Movie. Shot in real time in what seems to be one long continuous take, perfectly orchestrated action, consummately choreographed and shot. It's got Everything; sets, costumes, acting, score, cinematography, story (not necessarily in that order). And it'll set a standard for years to come.
Btw, I get the comparison to Saving Private Ryan, which has perhaps the best invasion scene ever. But on the whole and in many ways 1917 surpasses SPR. It's a Monumental Masterpiece; practically incomparable."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"One of the most immersive movie experiences out there. The one shot style of the movie makes you feel like you're right there with the main characters the whole time. I loved paying attention to what was happening around the characters such as the men in the trenches, the war grazed environments, the dead bodies and the rats. All of this combines for a visual masterpiece, a very visceral film. Dont compare this movie to the action-driven war movies of Hollywood. This is a very different style of war film, it's more of a survival/thriller/horror and it's quite the ride!"
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"I like a good war movie and couldn't wait to see this, it's a very well shot movie, great images fantastic back drops. But it's the kind of movie you only watch once, like Saving Private Ryan its is a good movie - not a nice movie if you know what I mean. Yes it's a horrors of war movie not an adventure story. I was a bit disappointed with the unnecessary scenes were he meets the girl with the baby in the bombed out town, felt like a bit of distraction (similar to the plantation scene in Apocalypse Now), it didnt add to the character or the story for me. I'm glad I've seen it but I didnt come out wowed as I expected."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"This film reeks of compassion to the brave. It is reminescent of Lord of the Rings, in the sense that it's an adventure about two 'hobbits'. Tolkien, after all, served in WW1 too. The main characters embark on a similar quest as Frodo and Sam. It feels as if you join them on their journey. Like you're going hiking with a few friends, except every wrong move might kill you. The tension build-up from start to finish is impeccable. All great movies are about a journey. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a journey, as is Apocalypse Now. This movie was missing the 'Marlon Brando' depth though, therefore it is not a 10. Never before has the first World War however been portrayed in such an intimate and beautifully shot fashion."
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,The film is gripping from start to finish; the cinematography makes you feel like you're there with the soldiers. The lead actor is brilliant and is worthy of awards. One of the best films I've seen for a while.
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"Thus movie totally sucks. It tries to compensate a good and colourfull story with cool effects(as allot of movues coming out recently). The dialog is horrible, allot of time during the movie you can sense that they are dragging the scene out unnecessarily. Plus everybody has anadditude and a super typical character, like a comedy almost! And as soon as whichever character is on film they really take their tine to add unnecessary overly acting manners! Very overly acted, not unlike a stage play, overly dramatic, bombastic acting not suited for a movie. The music trying to give weight to a scene is also done terribly. Very uneasy feeling overal to the movie, it drags you out of the story in the way how dumb some dialog was. Also, why did the main character try to lIft his ingured friend TWO F*$IN TIMES??? He could have done much more to save him!! Nice filming in the beginning filming the entirity of a ww1 battlefield, but that was it.
Total garbage fire."
1917,18 April 2020,7/10,"Dont get me wrong. I liked the movie. Only that the story is ""Gallipoli meets Saving Private Ryan on the trenches"". Lovely scenes... Some good action. And thats about it. Nothing original."
1917,9 January 2020,10/10,"After being disappointed with Dunkirk, I took the reviews with a pinch of salt this time. This movie was a thrilling film which took you on an emotional rollercoaster. I could've given it an 8 or 9 as to get a 10 should be very rare but I feel that 10 was probably deserved as I came out of the film changed and for a film to do that it needs to be excellent."
1917,25 May 2020,9/10,"Astonishing, vibrant, tense a ground breaking film from director Sam Mendes. Immersive in every way; though not perfect, it is an amazing film."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"I rely on imdb for ratings all the time, but never do i take the effort to leave one myself. I leave one for this movie because it really made an lasting impression on me. It doesnt happen often either.The level of cinematography, music, and sound effects will take you on an emotional ride of your life.This is just not a war movie, this is something more. Go live the experience."
1917,4 January 2020,10/10,"The best war related movie i have seen, ever. This movie is a masterpiece for the big screen!"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,This movie will leave you absolutely drained by the end of the 2 hours in the best way possible. The single continuous shot throughout the movie makes you feel like you are a part of what is happening which comes with the anxiety and anticipation of what is gonna happen next.This is a visually stunning masterpiece and definitely a must see
1917,25 January 2020,6/10,Im slightly disappointed after watching this movie.. i loved the cinematography and the aound track but there is no story in 119mins!!!!!!! only someone running for the whole movie and he is stupid and has the greatest luck!
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"*1917* A must watch movieFalse Hope is not good!!!War... World war I.Communication Technology was yet not matured enough and hence strategic moves needs to be conveyed at border Frontline by someone. Mission is on!The way in which the movie is structured, you get involved right from the beginning till end. The mission is critical and dangerous too. The battlefield is full of bombardment, exhausted troops and death all over. Spectacular greenfields turned out to be a death trap as attack can happen from ground or air. But mission is still on !!Love and hate, hope and despair, relation and patriotism, death and destruction, fear and courage are two sides of the same coin. And you get engrossed in the ocean of uncertainity. Whether mission was successful? What does the soldier fight for? When last moment in front of you, what do you think?1917 , a great movie !!!Direction - 5/5

1917,21 May 2020,9/10,"Great movie!! A very long and impossible mission for a rookie soldier with no experience. Unbelievable obstacles along the way, pretty intense. Hghly recommended!!"
1917,2 January 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes has made an exceptional good movie and the ""one shoot"" technique really supports the story in every way. It is difficult for any director to make the horrors of WW1 fell real, but the acting, screen play and filming made it very intense experience."
1917,16 March 2021,9/10,This is one of the best movie of past decade. Movie that have a different perspective of WWI. A beautiful movie. One of the best cinematography in movie history.
1917,24 February 2020,5/10,"Frist time I was confused what happened to them but after that, I got it what happen's before. I recommend to someone loves solution key."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"I really loved this movie. The ""single take"" appearance adds significantly to the drama, realism, and emotions of the movie. The visuals are outstanding and the two main actors are fabulous. There are several big names that are in the movie with very limited screen time which also adds to the overall impact of the movie. The Wayfaring Stranger song is basically perfect."
1917,27 June 2020,9/10,"A simple story line where a message is passed to next military camp by two men who travels through the opposite military camp and finally reaches the spot after a great travel, The actors made us to sit back and enjoy the movie with there massive acting, and in other technical aspects the film is strong and neat, The film takes some time to set with us and blows our mind finally, so it is a must watch film for everyone in big screen which shows the power and beauty of the film.And a special mention to to the cinematographer Roger Deakins and Background score by Thomas Newman who took the film to next level.And nothing without the director Sam mendes, you are great sir..
So watch it soon!!!!"
1917,28 January 2020,1/10,"The production is amazing, but I didn't like the story."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is breathtaking. One of the most incredible cinema going experiences I've ever had. It is visually stunning, packed with great performances from the leads and some superb cameos (loved Andrew Scott) and it is a thumping thrill ride like no other. So gripping. So visceral. Still trying to take it all in. This could be one of the greatest movies ever made but need to see it again first."
1917,11 January 2020,1/10,"Don't waste your money in this so called ""One Shot Epic Battle"" movie. Overrated AF. Cinematography is ok, not ""LEGENDARY"". Plot is bad & music is also typical ""EPIC"" or nothing new. If you are really a fan of battles etc, please go & watch GoT battles (Far better than this garbage). Original rating is 4/10 but 1/10 is because of Overrated & all the hype around this movie. Congratulations 1917 for taking the number 1 spot from Marriage Story ."
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"Hope for more. I was blown away by the intensity of this two shot movie right after stepping out from the theater. However, story was kind of weak. It's really like I played a very exciting video game and that's it."
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,"Absolutely Mind blowing On what this movie sets for It,I was Speechless walking out of this movie,So If you don't have anything to do go See this Movie!!!"
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,Go See this Movie!!! This Movie will leave your heart pumping and You will be Speechless.
1917,21 February 2020,10/10,"This film was executed so well that I have not felt this kind of immersion before in a movie. I was dragged in to the year 1917 and so thrilling journey. The thrill was nothing someone tried to do. It just happened when they succeeded so perfectly showing the environment and the soldiers like it just could have happened exactly like this. Cinematography, editing and directing is so good I was just drawing my breath all the time. And as a musician I am so relieved that the score hit me deep in my soul with other elements in the movie. A masterpiece. Well done!"
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,Wonderful movie we're the actors go on and on where it seems without a break
1917,19 April 2020,10/10,"Often when I watch recent films, I feel my gentlemanly manners and sophisticated posh ways aren't wanted by anyone in the movie which upsets me greatly. But in this film I felt the complete opposite, there was no character in this film I dream't about ripping my tie and jacket off me and destroying them whilst shouting appalling abuse at me, the characters in 1917 truly did imply they wanted a posh gentleman like me to support them, give them wise advice and look after them in the best possible way I can which made me so nostalgic for the 1910's and so proud of the First World War generation.Recent films also tend to make me feel like I'm watching a feminine film but this film was truly masculine and made me feel very comfortable as a result of feeling manly by watching it. No character should have the right to make me feel like my ultra posh ways are lame and make me feel like a feminine idiotic weakling, 1917 and the lovely British Empire understands that perfectly and I can't thank 1917 enough for understanding this!"
1917,22 January 2020,7/10,"So 2 guys are walking and an airplane crashed out of the sky and lands 5 feet away. they rescue the enemy pilot and he then kills the main protagonist?
these incredibly unlikely and dumb plot angles keep happening, like when a soldier puts a hand over an enemy's mouth telling him to be quiet - and then the guy doesnt.the storyline was totally unbelievable."
1917,17 September 2020,10/10,"When this movie was released, a thought: ""Ok, I must to watch this as soon as possible.""
And yes, I did. And I don't regret. Because it made me cry, hold the breath, close the eyes, hold tight the chair and reflect. That's the kind of movie that is worth spending money and time, because it shows you, truly, the felling of the worst thing that can happen: a war. Ok, there is the question of being a romance and all this stuff, but even with this detail, it doesn't make the movie less important. We are living in a dark time, and we need, more than ever before, the history to remind us to the point where things can get."
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,"Was really looking forward to seeing this one. I felt the pacing of the film was very slow in places . Acting was of a high quality between the two leads. Some great set pieces that just about manage to keep this film interesting for me. In summary I would say it's just an average film, that I think the hype, made me expect a lot more from it."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"Despite great scenario, cinematography, sound effects, attention to detail and historical precision, the plot is childish and a bit surreal. Nevertheless, much better than Dunkirk. Best film? Only because the competition is mediocre."
1917,7 February 2020,6/10,"As a war film connoisseur this one will not make my top list. I've read reviews that say this is a visceral and edgy depiction of trench warfare yet there are hardly any scenes of actual trench warfare. So a bit confusing. Some of the scenes are indeed rather unbelievable and far fetched, particularly when the lone soldier encounters a drunken and young German soldier the former of which raises the alarm. I'm sure if you've just strangled and killed one human, killing another rather than bringing the whole German army down on you wouldn't come as much of a hard decision as opposed to running and somehow dodging countless bullets.I haven't investigated any historical facts of this event, even if there are any. I don't think Sam Mendes' goal was historical accuracy.I have many family members serving and ex-servicemen and women, I personally have never served. I think everyone will have a different perspective. We'll never hear the voices of these people because they're all dead and can only guess at their reality from diaries and letters.Cinematography is beautiful, with long expansive shots, deep and rich colouring and stark contrasts. Their uniforms are in surprisingly good condition.Anyway, it is worth watching, but for me not keeping."
1917,30 December 2019,8/10,I've always been a nerd when it comes to historical wars. I enjoyed this film on the grounds that it tells the story with the gloves off. I felt invested because I felt like I was truly there with the characters. Saving Private Ryan similarities in the editing and storytelling. Highly recommend.
1917,15 June 2020,4/10,"Nice shots, beautiful cinematics, but nothing happens. Plain dull and boring."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"An amazing film. I really felt like I was there, in the war. The cast selection was amazing and the special effects were great. Overall, a great movie, 10/10!"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Utterly compelling heart of darkness masterpiece, playing out a million stories of vicious, brutal, random, pointless death with an unbearable poignant ending"
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,From the moment the movie began it had you encapsulated in the sheer task that Lay ahead- the movie has everything- great story - gripping suspense - amazing cinematography- great acting - you became part of the journey- you felt the thrill the tension the emotion- simply terrific- if you loved hacksaw ridge this is a must
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"Just finished watching 1917. I start by saying that I don't know how to find the right words to express my current emotional status.The first thing that comes to my mind about the movie is the style of directing. It was a bold choice, because of course you don't always see movies shot in that way, but I'm a 100% sure that it paid off. It really made you dive into the story, the characters' feelings and the details of the ruined war places you see. Furthermore, you see only one real and direct transition from scene to scene. That particular transition was also the audience's emotional transition, since I think it divides the movie into two main moments. That change of feeling, mood, and action made the viewers change emotionally, since it's clear that the movie is coming to an end, even though, you really can't expect anything anytime, because Sam Mendes knows what is doing.The cinematography is simply amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if it won an Oscar for that. The importance of colour is really highlighted, and it plays a really huge part in the film. I think that the relationship between colour and audience is real. Colour makes you emotionally weak, strong, anxious and frightened, and I can go on but the emotions I experienced are too many. Colour is the lead of the movie.One of the best parts of the movie was the original score. Since I care deeply about music in movies, I can say that I was not disappointed. Music accompanied colour in every moment of the movie, creating an atmosphere that really can't be explained. (There's a very intense scene when George Mackay's character arrives in the french village, where colour and music work together, as the protagonist runs trying to save himself)
I really want this aspect of the movie to be acknowledged.I want this movie to do well, because it deserves it. I can't wait for the Oscars and I can't wait seeing this movie win."
1917,19 January 2020,8/10,"I enjoyed this film. The scenery made you believe you were in the middle of the rampage from WW1. The acting was very believable. You flowed the main character throughout the movie seeing things as he saw them, smelled them, felt them....on the front lines as an English soldier. Very well done."
1917,23 January 2020,8/10,Watching our protagonist slowly go numb to everything that happens around him shows the severity of the situation. It movie also proves you can have a war movie which does not focus on one man gunning down a whole armada. The fact that this is a true story add to it as well.
1917,27 January 2020,7/10,Loved the cinematography and performances. And yes as stated elements of the film were harrowing but something was lacking. I wasn't pulled into the story..... possibly all the positive feedback I had heard may have led to higher expectations as well as a feeling of being manipulated - emotionally (and I often allow myself to be manipulated by lesser films than this). Of course the film is traumatic in parts and again but.....?
1917,30 January 2020,1/10,"Sam Mendes is one of my favorite directors. Yet, 1917 is very amateur in every aspect. Movie is an unsuccessful duplication of Saving Private Ryne ( SePR ) . It animates the very unforgettable scenes of SPR. The mission, the adventure two soldiers face, even the knife fight scene, raiding the house with wooden srairs in which German sniper was hiding ..Everything is copied from the
benchmark movie
SPR. Besides, there are unconvincing plot fallacies. When two soldiers gotten the mission to deliver the message to not that remote division, first they rush then they slow down. Plus if there were British soldiers majority alongside the road why on earth one of these planes, division etc..hasn't been given that mission.. Colin Firth's apperance even seem not to spare the movie from being a big dissapointment. If the director was a youngster from Z generation it could be accaptable . But seeing Sam Mendes' name in the movie shaked me very badly !"
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"It is a short film but it has a great impact , plus it tells us about the horrors of war . Loved it !"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Truly an incredible movie.From the beginning, you are taken on a near-impossible journey with the main characters, and apart from a couple of quiet moments, the stress level remains high.Every detail, from the lighting to sound effects to the variety of characters, keeps you on a tense roller coaster of emotions, hoping for the best but anticipating the worst.I wish more movies were created to such a high caliber."
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,If you're a war movie buff this movie is not for you.
1917,14 February 2020,3/10,"(Short Review)Movie Name - 1917
Director - Sam Mendes
This movie is better than Dunkirk for sure but still no big gem or anything. This movie's story is average and with same drama of many war movies. The reason putting this over Dunkirk is cuz of its execution and direction overall. The writing was nothing profound but this movie's direction is pretty smooth, and with that direction, the whole movie's experience is watchable and feels soothing to experience it. The open-world here is really a big plus point of this movie. The universe is filled with detail and a proper detail indeed. The soldier were shown in many personalities of their own, this is something Dunkirk highly lacked and even when they changed personality of any character it was done in such one-dimensional way and also, with weird dramatic way, it was feeling more fabricated than it feels in this movie. The subtle maturity and a life in characters is more visible in this movie than Dunkirk. The gimmick of one-shot worked perfectly for an intense journey of a soldier."
1917,16 February 2020,10/10,Thank you for everyone making absolutely amazing story
1917,19 May 2020,9/10,A personal experience that displays the emotional chaos and uncertainty of events in war. While exploring the will of two individuals we are taken as if alongside them in their objective. This left me with heavy emotional investment in the main characters. A dive into the action and mindsets of young men at war who show fervently the measures that ought to be taken to protect one another. Wonderfully shot and completely immersive.
1917,21 May 2020,9/10,This is the first war movie that caught me in the feels. The one camera style adds to the intensity of the action. I feel they captured how horrific WW1 was for people perfectly. Those two hours flew by!
1917,23 April 2020,10/10,Another brilliant piece by Sam Mendes. The unique POV following the journey of the young soldier in what feels like in one continuous shot is amazing! It's captivating the whole time with unexpected twists and turns.
1917,16 July 2020,8/10,"I like a lot about the movie, the camera view and acting, but would like some more coversations and emotions
over all a really good movie"
1917,3 October 2020,10/10,"I wondered why Parasite didn't win best cinematography, until I saw this gem! Not just the best cinematography of the year, but also of all time. If the story isn't in itself was enough for you, the grand direction, multiple breathtaking locations, the impeccable editing, and the (almost) one shot take will define this film. There is absolutely nothing to dislike in this film for me. NOTHING. Sam Mendes is an extremely talented director, and in my opinion, this masterpiece feels better than American Beauty. A standing ovation for every long take."
1917,8 June 2020,9/10,"From the first cinematic trailer 1917 had me hooked. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see it in Theater (which I definitely regret now), but watching it at home was still excellent. I've never before seen a movie shot like this, and it was a thrilling experience. The level of tension as scene after scene continued without a cut, the camera spinning or fixing in place at unpredictable intervals. Some times you saw what was in line of sight for the characters and at others the angle allowed you to see what they couldn't but desperately needed to. The design team did an incredible job of bringing 1917 to life. With incredible acting and story telling in addition, the mindset during The Great War was In clear focus here. The youth of the soldiers, horror of trench warfare and the pure mental, emotional and physical exhaustion extracted by a state of perpetual combat combined for an evocative experience that was simply overwhelming. I loved this movie, I will most definitely be watching it again."
1917,26 April 2020,5/10,"Yeah I get it, this movie looks great, with top notch cinematography. And the movie is supposed to look like one continuous shot, sure. But unfortunately that's all this movie has going for it. I was going into this movie expecting something that rivals the likes of Saving PVT Ryan, Platoon, hell even We Were Soldiers, but 1917 didn't even come close to any of these movies mentioned. This movie tells a simple story, which you pretty much have figured out about 15 minutes going in, not a lot of suspense or drama in the whole movie. This movie would make a decent flick if you haven't seen many war movies. But if your one of those who have seen many throughout the years, I don't think you'll be too impressed."
1917,31 May 2020,10/10,"The best film I've seen in a very long time.
Nothing more to say apart from PERFECTION"
1917,22 June 2020,10/10,"'1917' left me speechless right after I finished watching it. Every second of this movie is perfectly shot. The cinematography was mind-blowing, the soundtrack was beautiful, the storyline was intense, gripping yet emotional and touching. For days I couldn't stop thinking how perfect this movie was in every aspect of it. Thank you Sam Mendes for giving a phenomenal film experience!"
1917,6 July 2020,10/10,"1917 is so beautifully shot it could have had no dialogue and it still would have been an incredible story. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the whole two hours, and wished it was longer."
1917,5 June 2021,9/10,"A phenomenal cinematic experience. It made me feel like I was on a battlefield. The ground level experience made me think of those men who lost their lives and much more for the mere sake of somebody's lust for power.1917 is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins' cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going. Mr. Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. '1917' benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time."
1917,25 November 2020,9/10,"This is the most wonderful piece of artwork considered that not a lot of movies depicting WW1 in the recent decade and well-made. The movie also made the scenario in trenches pretty well. Injured men just casually talking, some were exhausted and even some were injured. Both protagonists were walking down the trenches just to let us see the what it's like to be in a trench is pretty wonderful to see. Perhaps the best scene of the movie is where he reached a certain city before jumping into the river. It was pretty intense to see the British soldier and the Germans fighting each other in such an intense manner. I think it's pretty good. I'm loving it already."
1917,27 April 2021,10/10,Breathtaking movieBest movieDeserve Oscars⭐⭐⭐⭐
1917,1 February 2021,10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece!
The way is filmed is absolutely amazing, it makes you feel you are there with the guys."
1917,28 September 2021,4/10,"This is not the typical hero movie that people are used to , is the first time I watch a movie from the First World War , too much drama I would say ... cinematography is a pretty good movie , I can't deny I felt bored watching but also interested in what happened with that soldier."
1917,6 August 2021,8/10,"This is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking that hits you on a visceral level. A one of a kind, compelling and intimate WWI tale of bravery and heroism."
1917,26 September 2020,10/10,"I generally shy away from watching box office smashes because they are usually overhyped. This film deserves all its applause. The negative reviews seem to focus of lack of characterisation, but that's the whole point, our two main characters were just two young men among millions plucked from their normal lives and thrown into hell. They don't have big showy unrealistic back stories or romantic and unnecessary plots, this is about the total innocence of average men who did very heroic and frankly awe inspiring things.Sometimes living in our times, we are so lucky in what we have it's hard to imagine how it was for them to be forced into war, this film has really awakened my senses to the utter distruction. I clenched my teeth for 2 hours on the adrenaline packed ride we go on. The way the film is shot makes you feel like a third person all the way through. Hours later I'm still shaken because of the tiny glimpse I've seen into the nightmares of our war veterans. And it is only a tiny glimpse, a 2 hour snapshot of what carried on for 4 long years and again just a couple of decades later. I thank Mendes for making a film that will stay with me a very long time and remind me of the sacrafice those men made.'Never was so much owed by so many to so few'"
1917,30 November 2021,8/10,"A solid film which didn't pan out the way I expected it to. The camera work is just phenomenal, the number of long shots that are pulled off is impressive. This film does a good job in pulling you into the horrific scenes of war, in one of the earlier scenes where our 2 main characters are travelling through no man's land I couldn't help but wince yet want to carry on watching at the same time, it was a very tense part of the film. MacKay does a great job carrying the film on his own, filling the scenes with his presence as its just him for a fair few parts of the film. Would recommend."
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"The first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes is all you need to understand the purpose of the movie, the remaining 1:50 minutes is lagniappe"
1917,15 January 2020,7/10,As a history lesson on construction and engineering of WW1 trenches this was an interesting watch. In terms or storyline or action there is more in a single episode of band of brothers than in this entire movie!
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"... people gasping all around me. My grandfather was pushed out of the Naval Academy a year early in 1917 to fight in WWI, and no movie has put me anywhere near his shoes until this one. I was floored. As a photographer, the cinematography amazed me - the best of films draw you in and make you forget where you are. Other than identifying Tommin Lannister and Robb Stark, I was very, very present."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"Oscar race front runner, Golden Globe winner, many other recognitions.. All these were enough reasons to see it on the first day.. Went with high expectations, and totally satisfied by the output. One of the best war movies ever made in Hollywood. It succeeded in evoking the human emotions, and the viewers felt the fear, pain and tension in a war front without many battle scenes. Sam Mendes, the captain beautifully blended all the departments. Wondered by the single shot-like movie flow from Roger Deakins camera and Lee Smiths cuts. The sound design and mixing were top notch for Atmos screen. Production designs were also praise worthy.Don't miss the theatrical experience.
A Must Watch !!!"
1917,2 February 2020,3/10,"From hearing all the greatness and recommendations for this movie, I was really excited to see it. It's has some great visuals, but the story is too unrealistic, and that makes it quite boring. It's like watching a superhero movie, where the hero can handle everything, that is thrown against him. But since this isn't a superhero movie, I lost my interest quite early you're never really feeling with the main characters."
1917,11 May 2021,8/10,I love the effects & that the movie is not too slow past. It's a simple story but what made it feel like a real War was (SPOILER) when one of the main caricatures die in the middle of the movie. It just made movie feel so real that a good guy can also die. I hope Hollywood will do surprises like that more.
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"One of the most thrilling cinematic experiences. Captivating score. Mendes delivers the most realistic WW1 movie ever shot that does nothing to compromise the true horror of War.
This film contains one of the most beautifully shot sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
Hard to say how this movie could have been improved upon. The two hour running time is spot on with the perfect balance between action and Human emotion.
In my opinion this movie more engaging than Saving Private Ryan. Go and watch this film now Epic!!"
1917,11 January 2020,4/10,"This is a film for lovers of cinematography trickery and directorial hubris. The ""one-shot"" affectation is attention grabbing, but ultimately it's to the detriment of the film itself.The actual substance of the film and especially the script tends way more towards the melodramatic than the dramatic, and this is a crucial mistake in how weighty the film ends up feeling.These some decent acting, but unfortunately it's not from the leads. Specifically Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch shine in their small but quite memorable roles.Overall, for all its hype and acclaim so far, it's an empty exercise in cinematic trickery."
1917,26 May 2020,10/10,THIS Story the Soundtrack FANTASTIC! It deserved so many Oscars!
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Poor wayfaring stranger song isn't on a sound track, but if you want something close you should check out Narrow Way's version on YouTube and iTunes!"
1917,19 January 2020,6/10,"1917 is a film that must be seen in the cinema. The cinematography is where it really excels. The long sweeping shots coupled with some brilliant acting and a great soundtrack mean that this film is a technical masterpiece.However, the plot is questionable. It feels like many aspects of the story and realism where sacrificed for the technical achievements. Ok, some scenes show a fairly brutal and realistic vision of life in WW1, but we've seen this before and isn't enough for the film to be considered realistic, in my opinion.Extremely inaccurate weapons. questionable military tactics and odd decisions all let the story down. However, if you can remove your mind from the story-line, the technical skill which has gone into making this film is very enjoyable."
1917,24 December 2020,10/10,I know Stanley Kubrick died in 1999 but I saw him in every frame of 1917; good to see you again Stanley!
1917,20 January 2021,5/10,"""get him some water"" ...??ya, there's problems with the script !"
1917,17 July 2020,8/10,"""1917"" contains some of the best visual camera work I've seen in years. Oscar nomination worthy. From start to finish incredibly enjoyable!! It's not just about war it's about the chance for redemption from a very unlikely person. It delivers! A must see!! Watch it!!!"
1917,2 June 2020,10/10,"What a Movie, Superb Visuals. Top class Cinematography. Good Story. Bollywood guys when can such movie come out from Boll wood ? Missing you J P Dutta."
1917,4 January 2021,1/10,"I feel like people are a little bit exaggerating. It was a fun movie to watch, something different for sure. But the story and the acting weren't that great. People only rate it high because of the filming style and graphics which were indeed nice to watch, but that doesn't make it the best war movie ever according to a lot of people.
Also if I remember the movie ""the Revenant"" with the same filming style it was far better and exciting."
1917,27 January 2020,1/10,"Wow, just wow. I had such high hopes for this film, everyone was raving about this movie, some claimed it was better than a previous favorite of mine, Hacksaw Ridge.They couldn't have been more wrong. How is this movie getting such high ratings?Basically to sum up this movie every bad decision, lack of common sense, and failure to keep to your goal was made making this movie the worst war movie I have ever seen. What an embarrassment, this cannot be based off of a true story, no one is that stupid and was still able to make it out alive. Unbelievable, all of it was unbelievable, ridiculous, and idiots, our main character(s) were idiots in every decision they made. That is what made this whole movie unbelievable because no one could ever make that many poor choices and be voted on to make a movie. Awful, all of it was just so awful that my whole family has decided to forget this movie was ever made or that we even wasted the time to watch this mess of a ""war"" film."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"One of the profound movie making. Difficult to take off your eyes from the screen. Many seat edger plots. Roger has delivered his signature style of shooting a movie at his best. I could imagine Sam Mendes in the place of Hitchcock. The movies simple plot was just enough to show the diligence of two men in the front. Moreover, Great to see leading actors in the supporting roles. A message delivered with pain."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"A compelling story and a wonderful, tour de force of Sam Mendes. Give them the awards they deserve because the movie already has it's place in cinema history."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"I was in two minds about this film. I am a big war film enthusiast, but unsure as to what Mendes' take on it would be. There was however no chance I was going to miss this highly touted film. And I'm so glad I went to see this on the big screen yesterday.First of all it is a simple plot, two lads are to go on a journey into 'no mans land' to send a message to another unit to cease them making the big push into what was expected to be a German ambush. Sounds pretty basic, and in essence it is. However, there is enough meat on the proverbial bone to keep you interested, and allows the familiar team of Mendes and Deakins to work their magic.The acting itself was to a good standard. McKay especially was entirely believable and made you go through a rollercoaster of emotions with him. From the scene with his recently deceased accomplice, the scene in the basement with the women and child, and the scenes at the end listening to the man singing and the scene informing the lieutenant of the passing of his brother, were all a contrast in human emotions, and he took to all of the roles well. After watching the film, I am a little disappointed he didn't get mentioned in the nominations for the Oscars (there are others on the best leading actor list that I felt were inferior to McKay's performance). However on this showing, he looks like he has a bright future ahead of him.
There were some big British names making cameo roles. Mark Strong especially was excellent (as usual).
All in all, the cast adequately supported the real star of the film. The cinematography.For me, the real magic of a film is in the detail. Not a performance from a big time actor (although excellent performances help), or masses of special effects, or a plot with multiple layers. All of these things help towards putting together a good film, but for me how the film looks and sounds is how a get sucked in to a production.
Deakins and Mendes, are a duo who constantly do this. Deakins especially seems to get the most out of the landscape for whichever movie of his you are lucky to watch. The baron landscapes and locations of 'The assassination of Jesse James', the dreamy electrical world of the new 'Blade Runner' and especially for me the typical North Dakotan vistas of 'Fargo', are only a few of his works that highlight how incredibly imaginative and clever Deakins is. Even the pairs attempt at Bond produced possibly the best looking Bond film of the series in Skyfall.
Pairing Deakins artistry with Mendes' direction is always a visual treat. Combining the beauty Deakins provides, with the dark and often brilliantly harrowing style Mendes brings to his films, has previously left me wide eyed and ready for more. This is no exception. The idea of the whole film being presented to the viewer as one whole shot, just works. As we are sucked in, cheering for the main character through his long and arduous journey. It seems relevant to shoot the film this way. And at the end you are left wanting more.
The perfect scene to sum up the Mendes/Deakins combo, is when McKay opens the door to confront a German sniper up close and personal. And in typical Sam Mendes fashion, it's a personal and shocking encounter. When McKay regains consciousness, he opens the door to inspect the dead German and out the window he sees the ruins of the town illuminated by flares being shot overhead. The shadows moving as the flare crosses over it, paired with the soundtrack was possibly one of the most stunning pieces of cinema I've ever seen, producing a lump in the throat moment. Visually beautiful.Because of the digital age we live in, I only now buy DVD's of the films that really make an impression on me. This will be added to the collection.
We have seen the majority of the main Oscar nominated films this year, and 1917 should clear up for me (possibly the odd one for The Irishman).
The film takes you on a journey through despair, sadness, joy, humour, anxiousness, and many other for the full two hours. And you believe every beautiful minute of it. That for me is the mark of a good film."
1917,29 January 2020,6/10,"Okay story. The whole movie seems to be shot with steadicam at a claustrophobic focus range. The camera work becomes intrusive when it carousels, as it does several times, around the character. Even shots that could easily have been made using a tripod still have a slight handheld quality. While this is not a ""jerky"" film, the motion on a big screen still induces a certain amount of motion sickness. This kind of camera work probably is less distressing on a smaller screen.I appreciate that the subject matter is now old enough that it has no real political content.In conclusion, if you want to see the result of a camera man who obviously like to dance around like a ballet star go for it. Otherwise this is the kind of film that, if I had not be viewing it with friends, I would have walked out after about the first fifteen minutes. As it was I just closed my eyes for some of the longer trench runs and spins.I am not looking for a ""genius"" cinematographer; rather I would simply like a competent one. The camera should not be a main character."
1917,6 October 2020,9/10,"Well directed, scripted movie. Great visuals bring the war to life. Great sound effects and performances too."
1917,14 February 2021,3/10,I was expecting more from this movie but unfortunately didn't get much. The scenes look good but the story is questionable.
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,Feels real and brings the emotions of war close to your heart. A must see.
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Saw 1917 & it's the Best Picture of the Year!, Absolutely Phenomenal movie, I've seen all the previous nominated movies and there is none better than 1917, visually stunning in everyway, cinematography excellent perfect Balance of drama & suspense, and the entire movie filmed in one shot wow, I remember seeing a Underrated film on Netflix called The OutLaw King which I liked a lot, in that film the opening scene is shot in one shot and it was the first of it's kind but that's only the opening scene, but whats incredible about 1917 it is filmed entirely in one shot, it is incredible, the best war films when you break it down that I have ever seen from depth of story telling to action has been Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge and now 1917,what's crazy is that 1917 doesn't even really have a war battle scene, it's mostly suspense and intense scenes with a couple of shootouts yet it's still one of the greatest Cinematic war films of alltime, it's definitely the Best Picture of The Year or it darn right should be, 4/4Stars, A+, 9/10 for 1917 it Should receive best picture & Director Oscars forsure."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,This won't be long. I'm in awe. Probably the greatest war film I've ever seen. There are scenes in this movie that drew emotions from me that I was shocked to find. It will simultaneously show you the horrors of war and the scope of determination. A perfect film.
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,Will easily be the best cinematography film of 2020. Stunning visuals captivate your attention the whole way through.
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Pure brilliance, I can see why It had to be filmed in one shot. I felt like I was there with them for entire movie, so good. Shed a tear at some moments I usually wouldn't in other movies. Amazing score perfectly fit for every second. Sam Mendes nailed it, again. Amazing experience."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"Though 1917's story may not be new and its backdrop of war unoriginal, it outshines all of its contemporaries with blindingly phenomenal moviemaking. Not even the pitch-perfect cast can eclipse this monumental feat of direction and cinematography. 1917 manages to immerse the audience into its narrative, forcing viewers to genuinely identify with the characters across its entire runtime.While we have seen long-tracking (no cut) shots (be them true or edited) wonderfully accomplished in previous films (Children of Men, Birdman, Paths to Glory, etc.), the level of superior craft on display in 1917 will not soon be matched, let alone eclipsed. This film has earned its right to win all the awards for best cinematography and direction.The acting is perfect. There are no ""breakout"" performances by the superb cast, but that is intentional. The focus rests entirely on the immediacy of WW1 trench warfare, -literally- not allowing you to look away. See this film."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"It took a minute or two for me to regain composure as this iMax experience rolled it's credits. Devastated would probably describe my state as I returned to the real world.
I wasn't sure how the first person (apparent) single shot structure of this movie would work out for me. I did enjoy, if that's the word, Dunkirk and the intimate view of the setting and characters. Immersive is the word of the decade and it can prove tiresome.
As the opening sets us on a journey, I was aware this was going to be a technical marvel. This is the frustration of being a cameraman. I literally hold my breath when an impossible move or a focus pull is executed. I know the pressure of having to get it right first time, but on these budgets it's ramped up to 110%.
I'm not averse to these techniques, Cloverfield and even the Blair Witch made it work really well. In this case I thought it was so beautifully executed, that after ten minutes, I had pretty much forgotten it and was totally drawn in.
Much of the credit must obviously go to the DOP, Roger Deakins and a team of grips that pulled this off so flawlessly, however the lead actors literally suffered through every step of the way and I take my hat off to them all.
George MacKay has been an actor I have watched grow through a variety of films over the last few years and I think he is destined for a long career. His deeply moving, but perfectly understated performance was the main cause of my emotional connection with the whole movie. He is in every single moment and you feel the brutality and exhaustion for the duration.
Incredibly, Mr.Deakins manages to create a series of beautiful frames, even though he is physically miles away from the camera for most of the time and the majority of the film is using available light. One particular series of shots is a masterclass in dynamic lighting and becomes a work of classical imagery evoking Turner.
For all these reasons I would advise this to be seen in an iMax if possible to achieve the maximum effect, it also proves that we really don't need 3D?
How the leaders of the World's nations even consider conflict after the last two catastrophic wars I will never understand. I can only assume they are too consumed with hatred for humanity to spare the time to watch a film like this and learn."
1917,7 February 2020,10/10,"This movie was amazing from start to finish. Cried a little at a few parts. I don't buy many movies on DVD or Blu-ray. This film will definitely be worth the money. I don't want to spoil it, but it's just amazing!"
1917,13 July 2020,10/10,"With the re-opening of cinemas took the opportunity to watch this again and must say it's still breathtaking despite 3rd viewing! And I'm not even a war movie fan.I felt the war only served as context and backdrop. Above all it's a compelling piece of storytelling, and a very personal one too. To be precise, a grandfather story - from director Sam Menses' own grandfather who served in World War I. Mendes of course is better known as film director for two recent James Bond movies - Skyfall and Spectre.This one however is a completely different genre. There were hardly any battle scenes with the handful being only one-to-one engagement with the enemy, even then only upon being discovered or stumbling upon them and in one scene the protagonist was actually trying to save the enemy. So there was a massive dose of humanity in the film.I also love the way the protagonist was subtly changed midway through the film. And if either protagonist did not captivate you, I think the cameos might just. Particularly in order or appearance, Colin Firth as the emphatic General who took a shrewd gamble, Andrew Scott as the utterly cynical, skeptic Lieutenant in the trench, Mark Strong as the Captain whose parting shot was probably the most crucial piece of advice in the film and finally Benedict Cumberbatch as the totally gobsmacked and gutted Colonel. Each cameo brief but devastatingly incisive in their delivery.I think this film might just be Mendes' magnum opus. With Roger Deakins' illuminating and ravishing cinematography as icing on the cake."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,The story is amazing! Completely original and unpredictable! The best part is the cinematography! The film hides cuts and allows a continuous shot throughout. The film makers took especially great care of where the camera is pointing at all times. I highly recommend!
1917,28 January 2020,5/10,"I went to the cinema to watch this film hoping it to be some sort of Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the gates only to be really disappointed. Me and the person I went to watch the movie with were completely bored by the film and so were the people around us commenting the film as we left the movie theater.The film was low and boring and you quickly realise this is going to be the case in the first 15 minutes of film. I really don't get how this film got the golden globes over The Irishman or Joker. Not at all. Both are much better films than 1917 and both have better performances (although 1917 has good performances also, nothing to complain on that area). I was really disappointed with the film and with the Golden Globes result."
1917,18 October 2020,9/10,Finally got round to watching this movie today.... And just wow. This is a masterpiece. Amazingly filmed. The way its done in one whole scene just pulls you in so much. Great acting. You could literally feel the pain of the characters.
1917,17 January 2020,5/10,What an absolute load of tosh. Pretending to be shot in one take is the only interesting thing about this B Movie.
1917,5 February 2020,5/10,"This movie is a boring crap, 8.5 god how??? Nothing is shown right in it."
1917,29 February 2020,10/10,"No long drawn out review here
This movie is a masterpiece in movie making!!! Watch and agree!!"
1917,28 March 2020,4/10,"Really can't beleive this got the oscar for best visual effects. I didn't see any. If the trenches and some fire are, ok. The film is very boring, slow and ridiculous at times where the german soldier can't hit the lad from 10 metres. Almost all other famous war movies are better. Can't beleive this rating."
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"This is a good film. Visually excellent and gives you a real feel of what it would have been like on the front line WW1. There is a feeling of haven't we been here before referring to Saving Private Ryan and a little Gallipoli at the end. There is terrific tension and drama. However the leads are miscast. They came across as a couple of Eton boys. Perhaps that was the intent, that war heros are not necessarily all tough alpha males, but it detracts from the film. Don't mean Jason Statham or the Rock, but more presence needed."
1917,22 February 2020,3/10,"Impossible not to compare this to Peter Jackson's compelling and very moving WW1 documentary 'They Shall Not Grow Old' so while 1917 is entertaining enough it's not a great piece of art or showing any evident skill on behalf of the director. I really believe that editing is an integral part of filmmaking. The single shot has been done before and is always a novelty piece of filmmaking, even when Hitchcock did it its still weak. This film is more Call of Duty than Paths of Glory. Average film fodder."
1917,6 February 2020,5/10,"The +

Very weak scriptZero character development.Many ""just walking"" scenes should be shorter."
1917,11 January 2020,3/10,"If you read the previews saying what this film is about, well -- that's it. Two hours of following the two soldiers, then one, try to get the extremely important message to save 1,600 lives.It is intended to look like one uninterrupted take, but is actually a bunch of longs takes (longest was 9 minutes) stitched together perfectly at points where detail was not critical, like following William running from the other side of a fragmented wall, in the dark.The good:Outstanding set. Pristine, spotless mostly, even beautiful, but not realistic.Cinematography. From a technical point of view, outstanding. I can't imagine better, given the one-shot requirement by the writer/directory. But, boring after the first long fast walks through trenches.Special effects. Excellent, I think, which means not obvious -- most of the time.The bad:1. There is NO story. Let's just say one, get the message to the commander about being ambushed. 2. Way too many narrow escapes. All those open shots at William and not one hit him. Most of them not even close. 3. Everything dead except a cow. Plus a bucket of milk fresh enough to drink and no one around to milk the cow. 4. Planes flying over that could have easily dropped a message to the commander in a short length of time, but no, let's do it the nearly impossible way. 5. A beautiful woman with someone else's unexpectedly in the basement room where William ducks into while being chased. And, guess what, he has a canteen full of milk. The baby coos and makes happy noises though starving. There goes the one long take. 6. William walks up on a huge group of soldiers with one standing in the center singing and no one notices or questions him, even after several minutes. 7. Plenty of time and skill to tiptoe across the broken side of a bridge and jump 5 or 6 feet from one narrow (6 - 7 inches) beam to another. I wonder how many times that took. One screw up and they have to start over at the beginning -- one shot. 8. Clean cloths, clean, shaven faces, nice perfectly white teeth. 9. Zero character development.I could go on and on.I couldn't wait for it to be over, but always expecting it had to get better because of all the reviews. Two stars for cinematography and set design."
1917,8 January 2021,9/10,"Good story and incredible how it looks like the film is done in two takes. Even better is that the well known actors play minor roles.
Highly recommended by me for what that's worth.."
1917,23 January 2020,2/10,"... felt like watching a video game. The plot is non existent, the acting mediocre, the score disappointing.It starts feeling like this is what we get nowadays; grandiose beautiful looking expensive movies (most taking place in the past so it's easier to romanticize them) but without substance or any real storyline whatsoever.1917 is a pure example of this symptom, a big budget movies with lazy writing. Totally forgettable."
1917,8 July 2020,10/10,1917 is an experience. I didn't feel the movie is extraordinary in terms of story. But the cinematography and the way it is told is amazing. The scenes are so haunting yet beautiful. It is like you are the third companion with the protagonist. Must watch movie.
1917,16 January 2020,6/10,"It's good, very well shot, very. but it's not better than SPR, nowhere near, it's a well told war story with good acting."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"But my god, I'm a fan of this. Absolutey genius. I can't remember the last time a film held my concentration as much as 1917 did.
Thoroughly job well done to everyone involved."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"It's an ok movie, but it's too freaking long. That's it that's the review."
1917,28 January 2020,4/10,"All the wanna be luvvies who are tripping over themselves to give this a high score are the same who look at a banana skin accidentally left on a gallery floor and think it's art. Making one long scene is clever. And I mean FULL STOP
The characters had nothing about them, the mission was bizarre given the importance, there are so many weird things thrown in to pad the story and historically challenged.
Just for one, the accuracy of the weapons was terrible but these soldiers could fire from the hip to within inches, the main character gets shot, falls down stairs and just has a cut at the back of his head. He crosses a river only to end up washed down it, back on the other side, a few minutes from where his random 5 minute truck journey dropped him off and is right at the end of the mission. I could go on about a woman and baby (and somehow talking to her???) drunkard not being taken out and a miracle cow. Imagine how you felt when you first saw saving private Ryan, now remember how you felt when you thought you had at least won a tenner on the lottery only to find out you didn't put it on. Guess which film this is."
1917,25 July 2020,3/10,"This movie looks amazing and the way they shot it was great, but it is the only war movie I've seen that gas nothing to do with war. Prepare to be bored out of your mind while the director amazes you with the cinematics but you'll probably be asleep by then. Dumb movie. I regret renting this boooooring fillm about feelings."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"This is one hell of a movie. A lot of care and detail went in to the making and telling of this story. The story has been told before, but never done like this. The visuals are stunning. The work in making battlefields from a hundred years ago must of been very daunting. Every detail is thought out and well made.Sam Mendes surely deserves another Oscar for making this movie. And, having Roger Deakins as the Cinematographer was a very good choice as well. He shot a lot of the Coen Brothers movies. The movie's non-stop one scene is nothing short of amazing as well. Finding the right actors was also crucial to the telling of this story too..Everyone gives a stellar performance. Wise choices indeed. Having 2 lesser known actors as the lead roles was thoughtful as well..having Colin Firth and Mark Strong only add to it..I strongly encourage everyone to see this film, even if your not a fan of war movies. If your a movie fan, you must see this movie."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"First of all I want to give a lot of credits to one specific scene, the minutes before the populair running ""shot"" of Schofield; After Schofield finds the Devons, he and the Company start moving though the tenches to the front. This is where they enter the battlefield. Different Companies are waiting for their call to go, totally ready for their take off. Two soldiers hanging on the rope ladder against the trench, while all the others are waiting for the whistle. They were probably waiting for their last run ever, without even knowing that. Therefore, this scene gave me goosebumps for more than 2 minutes. Again, lots and lots of credits.Despite I don't have many complaints about the movie, I think there is a lot to say about the ""ons-shot"" production.Concerning the benefits; the technique applied on the movie is brilliant. Especially after watching ""1917 Behind-the-scenes Extended Featurette on One Long Shot"". This gives a good insight about the difficulties that the producers had to oversee.
Secondly, the one-shot element creates a total different content: two soldiers, one day, one mission. By doing it this way, you get to know Schofield and Blake completely different. This made the movie more simplistic and therefore maybe more realistic.This simplicity, however, brings me to the contras. A logic consequence of using just one shot, is that you are bound to specific persons and areas. This directly leads to less depth in the story. And NO: I don't want more shootings, more battles or whatever. I just want to get to know the main characters a bit more. For example, Schofield met the French woman with the infant. One-shot movie making forces you to move on after just one tissue to stop the bleeding of your head. I think, however, including this kind of ""emotional paternity"" could be a perfect addition to this movie if it was more extended.To conclude, 1917 creates a total different perspective of war. Instead of telling a broad story, this intriguing movie present just a day of to young soldiers forced to execute a specific mission. Therefore, the beauty is in its simplicity. But by doing so, depth of a story is hard to include. Fortunate I did not have to choose between them, but if I had to, I would say: you tell me!"
1917,4 March 2020,1/10,The start was interesting and the single shot movie premise is neat but that's it. The movie goes into a ridiculous plot line with the most idiotic twists of the decade. I was offended by how awful this film was and would never recommend it to anyone.
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"No one can say this was not a well-filmed movie. Amazing scenes and action; what appeared to be incredible realism. Lead actor was excellent. Story was exciting. However, I would not put it in my top favorite movies. Perhaps I went in expecting too much with all the hype and the Oscar nomination. But overall, I enjoyed it."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Don't be confused: this movie was absolutely amazing. The way they shot many of the scenes from the No-Man's Land to the ruined village was absolutely breathtaking. This movie along with Blade Runner: 2049 should be studied on how to direct or shoot a film.The film was also edited flawlessly as you could hardly find the cuts between scenes. And it really does work...most of the time. There were some scenes, such as when Schofield has an emotional moment, that take away from the true heartfelt potential in the film. The first ten minutes of the movie, I thought, didn't need the single-shot experience and made me feel distracted by the gimmick and not the movie.But trust me: when it works, it really works. One of my favorite movies is Children of Men because of how the film was shot and edited. The part where Clive Owen tries to cut through the battlezone to get to the girl and her child was one of rhe most brilliant pieces of filmmaking I've seen. 1917 reminded me of that in many ways. Roger Deakins is a master cinematographer and really knows how to make a frame look like a painting. The scope of the camerawork captures so much depth that you do feel immersed in the film. The scene where Schofield runs from two German soldiers in a ruined village stands out the most for me. All of this combined with the incredibly powerful score really adds to the gravitas the film provides.The most subtle piece that needs to be acclaimed, though, is the casting. That the two main actors are unknowns keeps the focus on them and their skills. The biggest names come and go like cameos, but you know exactly who they are. I don't know the two main actors, but you're engrossed with them and not distracted by their familiarity.1917 is a masterful war epic. Beautifully shot, epically scored, solidly directed. There are moments where the style overpowers the substance, but it makes up with moments of solid storytelling."
1917,24 January 2020,5/10,Sam Mendez you had me immersed in your story for the first 10-12 minutes. It really was a great opening to the movie. The one take shot was a fantastic Idea. Unfortunately as another reviewer pointed out you made a Marvel war movie. You could have replaced our heroine with Daniel Craig and I swear it could have been a WW1 time travel James Bond movie. I never appreciated Dunkirk the way I was supposed to but after seeing this I need to go back and watch it. The conclusion is it's a fairytale war movie with beefy over the top (no pun intended) set pieces and no substance.
1917,23 April 2020,4/10,"It's fine, a mediocre war film hanging on a gimmick. It could have been shot traditionally and it wouldn't have made any difference, I didn't even notice the ""single take"" after about 15 minutes.The acting is serviceable, and what little action there is reliant on action movie tropes. It's one unrealistic scene after another.Just a really ordinary, unremarkable film."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Caught this one a little late because I wanted to see it with my dad. Getting to see it in a theater just enhanced the overall experience. If you want to see this, make an effort to see it in a theater. The number one thing that the theater enhances about the movie is the cinematography. This is the movie that deserves to win Best Cinematography at The Academy Awards. At one point of the movie, there is a straight 30 minutes or so that is the best cinematography of the last 2 years by a landslide. You learn about the characters and their dynamics with eachother through their dialogue and how they react to the situations they are put in. The score was used so effectively and made the scenes so much more intense. Also, it (the score) was very good. I wanted to stay for the credits because I wanted to listen to it. I can't decide if this movie, Marriage Story, or Joker should win Best Score at The Oscars, but I'd be happy with any of these. The sound mixing was another extremely effective aspect of this movie, and to quote my dad, ""The gun shots are the most realistic I've ever heard."" This movie should absolutely win the Oscar for it's sound editing. I also really hope that the movie wins the Oscar for Achievements in Makeup and Hairstyling. All of the dirt, blood, and water in this movie looked so realistic and amazing, but Bombshell will most likely win the award. This movie, Parasite, and Knives Out are all tied for me as to what I think should win Best Screenplay. And finally, regarding Best Picture, as long as this or Marriage Story wins, I will be happy. And to top all of these things off, the movie takes place on my birthday."
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout this film. While the basic story is simple the feelings it evokes in you are not. One of the best films I've seen. Would watch again.
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"This film is shown in the bestest format ever seen; a one continuous shooting. Sam Mendes (""Skyfall"", winner for Best Director at the 2020 Golden Globes) made a great two-hour story about two officers in the British army tasked with a very important mission which could save over 1,600 men. I saw the film this Tuesday (14 Jan) and was crying on the inside. My thoughts and prayers are with Mendes' late grandfather LC Alfred H. Mendes; I salute you, sir!"
1917,19 December 2020,7/10,"The movie itself is brilliantly made, shots are stunning, hidden cuts are brilliant, and acting is top notch. The DP and storyboard writer for this movie are absolute masters of their craft to design a film so well cut together so that it becomes a near seamless experience. My personal favorite shot is the shot of the main character running down the line in the midst of a charge. However the movie can be a tad bit predictable and the story itself is not outstanding but its not good enough. But this movie is still definitely worth a watch just for visual brilliance itself."
1917,5 April 2020,10/10,"The attention to detail and realism in this movie is what makes it so good and believable. For instance, I don't know how they pulled off certain character's not breathing after they die. Sure they can hold their breath, but considering one ""dead"" actor remains on the screen for a good minute or more makes that unlikely. Anyhow - awesome movie and highly recommended! It's not your typical action-packed war flick, and that's actually refreshing, but it is indeed suspenseful!"
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"This is an exceptional movie and work of art. While some may be critical of the true grusomeness and horror that was the first World War, I feel this movie captured aspects of it without glorifying it. You don't have scenes of soldiers in a trench being blown to pieces from an enemy shell, but you do hear soldiers speaking about it in a nonchalant way, along with the ""gallows humour"" that developed over the war in the trenches. There is horror all around you, and this movie does well not throwing it in your face but doesn't allow you to ever escape it.The other criticisms I can see comes from a character development standpoint. You are left not knowing much of the backstory to the main characters or why they behave the way they do. But in the first World War, where you could have 30,000 die in a single day for the British, human life did not have the value we assume it should. It's because of this that I think it is fitting to not delve into backstory and character development, since the recurring theme of the movie shows the constant waste of life and futility in these battles. However, I feel you get tremendous character development just by observing their behaviour, a tremendous accomplishment by the cast, where the viewer can predit their past by the way they behave in the present.I hope the success of this movie brings along with it more attention to the first World War. It has set the bar high, and has done a great service to future generations seeking to learn more about the history of World War 1."
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"George MacKay has added to his stardom with this unique war film. This epic tale has little dialogue, but weaves a warrior's tapestry through the organic yet unique filmography. Sam Mendes brilliantly explores the depths of war and how horrific it truly is, and shows his audience the capacity of the human spirit, even in the most dire of situations."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,1917 will always be remembered as a complete masterpiece.
1917,3 March 2020,10/10,"It's a masterpiece. A rare film that will make you emotional you will get in the character skin.
It feels like playing a game.
Those feelings I got with the charge of rohan in the white city, I got here too.
I loved it so much"
1917,1 March 2020,1/10,"Do yourself all a favour and watch Gallipoli, the film from the 80's. Why can't movies be made in a normal manner for normal people anymore. What is all this tripe being dished out."
1917,14 February 2020,5/10,"The movie starts off very symbolically with what it is. Plagiarism. A bit of Gallipoli, a bit of paths of glory, a bit of saving private Ryan. In it's parallel with Brexit, is it trying to show that also Brexit is not original at all?
We soon learn that two boys are trapped in a place away from home. They don't want to be there. They long for the English pastures. Instead they are in hell. They had hoped for their leadership to get it done by Christmas so they can finally return.
Then good old English humor takes over, instead of sending some planes over with letters to the troops that are being drawn into a trap to warn them with, the army sends over those two boys through the German lines. Black adder goes forth again.
It becomes more serious again by showing not a single German can be trusted. They use all kind of trickery and evilness to liquidate those very decent boys.
Even if those boys do every effort, time and again, at the cost of their own well-being, to save those wicked Germans. It's David Cameron going to he EU again with a ""fair offer"" for a better deal, only to be stabbed. So now the English have no choice than to go for it alone.
In the destroyed orchards there isn't even any chance for cherry picking.
And the Germans are ready to meet the UK's reasonable demand with a scorched earth policy.
It does show that they are not totally on their own. A couple of token ""commonwealth"" soldiers are thrown in to prove that. Yes, those foreigners can even be useful to help the truck free itself from the mud.
After some fireworks and some highly entertaining running through ruins while being shot at, another type of continental show up.
A weak French woman. While the folksy British boy soldier knows quite a lot of French words to communicate, the rat-like French woman can help complete the conversation by replying with English words. But it shows a weak France ready to be violated again by the Germans any moment. And alas, our English hero can't stay and protect her this time. Obviously the brother of his friend is more important. Because who cares about a couple of thousand soldiers in WWI? The film shows that constantly that every part of the land is strewn by dead bodies, including French civilians who can only become victims.
Next, the hero is sent on an reenactment of The Revenant's river escape. He's not a simple boy anymore. But a survivor.
To prepare for the very touching ending, with a stiff upper lip, while still longing for the return to the wonderful island, some more comedy with the hero playing rugby with the first wave attack.
It has to be said that the ending is very touching. I almost shed a tear for the loss of the British (boy). The film is technically well made.
Eventually the conclusion is clear. There were only good reasons to withdraw and go go home.Then again, maybe the filmmaker meant something entirely different. Maybe he was just trying to make money on the sentiment that war sucks.
Or maybe the message was that milk is actually far better than some people think?"
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"Great camera work, great shots of the locations i.e the trenches , dead man's land , the dead bodies etc, it is very depressing and bleak which I all loved but the story was overall poor. You never really feel for the characters that much apart from the death scene. The dialogue is poor and the acting starts very poor. The best scene was when the plane came down and the young soldier gets stabbed and dies. A messed up scene which makes you feel rather strange and sick . I think that scene will stay with me for a while. Nothing much else happens apart from a sniper missing him with shots about 10 times even though he is in clear sight, in daylight, a few Germans chasing him and missing him yet again with their shots and him getting away, rather far fetched. An okay try but not a classic. Definitely going to be overated. 7/10 for me because of the amazing camera work and the death scene."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,I wasn't really into war movies but what a masterpiece this movie was. From storytelling to the acting. Everything was just great. No wonder it has already been nominated for 10 Academy awards. This movie deserves it. 9/10 would recommend
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"I wasn't expected the next saving private ryan but i love Mendes and I love American beauty so I was hyped , He successfully captured the emotional state of the two soldiers and the high pressure of the task they're up against, The dialogue isn't that great in fact it's so mediocre and really isn't special, the cinematography is great as expected from Mr. Deakins.
Does it deserve winning best picture and best director?
The answer is simply No, but it most likely will do, IMO The Irishman or Parasite are more deserving
But it's still a very good war movie with great cinematography that mixed perfectly with the production design and directing"
1917,14 December 2020,8/10,"Loved the movie, i like the was this movie have been directed. Friendship, family and what war heroes go through everything things shown so correct.
I felt connection with charecters.
How being nice can cost too much is so true."
1917,10 May 2021,,"Very well shot but adds very little to the war film canon. The two main characters are breathy thesps, better suited to the theatre, both over-enunciating every word in wide eyed overacting. It's a tiresome film, with a couple of promising set pieces but unrelentingly dull. The characters are all shallow and we don't spend enough time with any of them to get to know them beyond war film cliches. The only good thing about the film was a fantastic turn by Benedict Cumberbatch in a tiny role, reminding the viewer that perhaps we take his talent for granted. It's a stark contrast between a very good actor like him and...well..the two main plodding actors."
1917,26 December 2020,6/10,I was really looking forward to this movie. Maybe the hype made my expectations too high. The movie was enjoyable but not a 10 for me.
1917,11 January 2020,4/10,"Just came back from the cinema and I must admit this is not what I've experienced.
I found it boring as the story line was just...flat..."
1917,7 July 2021,10/10,Gripping story with heart touching characters loosely based on real events but we'll directed and with intense scenes that won't let you take eyes of the screen. One shot intense scenes really gets you more pumped and thrilled.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"More than a film. An immersive experience. Everything that Deakins and co. wanted to convey is done to the finest detail, I couldn't take my eyes off it. Honestly one of the most gripping films I've seen, absolutely loved it."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"For nearly 2 hours, Sam Mendes' 1917 kept me on the edge of my seat with immense suspense and almost horror throughout the films runtime. 1917 brings the one shot film style inspired by Birdman (2014) but at an even bigger scale. The one shot style makes you feel even closer to the two soldiers with their intense and demanding mission. The film uses its one shot style to make set pieces feel real, gritty and intense and will leave you in shock and awe when these sequences stop. If you like war films, there is no better cinematic experience delivering the same quality, suspense and emotion in January. With the oscar worthy cinematography of Roger Deakins, the charming and grounded character with the cutting edge directing of Sam Mendes, 1917 is more than just a film, it's an experience, one which all should witness"
1917,29 January 2020,2/10,This did a lot of things right visually but let itself down as a film
1917,15 January 2020,1/10,"Predictable and horrendous. The acting was terrible and the story was common and nonsense. The only exciting part about the movie was the very end when finally people were dying and it represented WW1. I highly doubt he met a strange woman with an abandoned child and I highly doubt any of this even happened. This movie was Saving Private Ryan, but boring and predictable."
1917,18 April 2020,10/10,"I watched this film once, not sure what to expect. About halfway through I moved from tv to headphones and sat on the floor to get closer to the story. Immediately afterward I started watching another war movie released the same year. I stopped after 30 minutes, Second time round, immediately afterwardsI watched 1917 again, 30 minutes in you notice the blue grey walls of the trenches and the details, the burns on the sandbags, You're devastated by the blow out in the trench and notice his red eyes and pale skin. You walk with them through the burnt trees and listen to the story. Eventually you panic in the city with the flares. Crawl out of the river and head to the forest. It is stunning and moved me. This is the first film I've watched again directly after seeing it. I'm not in love with the characters but I reckon that's like life, the characters are flawed but the world the story takes place in is stunning,The barn scene was horrible and real.Everything is covered in mud. Everything should be covered in mud. It is beautiful and reminds you"
1917,26 January 2020,1/10,How this piece of crap has those reviews and is nominated for 10 oscars beats me.
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"It has been a really long time since I have seen a truly exceptional film...so long that I cannot actually remember when that was...probably when I first saw ""The Pianist"". This one has the same merits as the aforementioned, it absorbs you completely in and makes you feel as if you are a part of the events it depicts. But overall I find an even better film because the sets, the special effects and the filming techniques are of the highest level of artistry. Definitely worthy of the Best Motion Picture this year."
1917,4 April 2020,10/10,"This movie I wish I'd seen on the big screen, it was amazing cinematography and one of the best films I've ever seen. It's thrilling from start to end, and yet so touching in so many moments.
The story line is subtle, but the sense of honor that our soldiers displayed in our wars is something the script captured. It's not the heroic version, it's the deep core value that men have sacrificed for our freedom. And a needed message too during our current pandemic, wartime sacrifices and support of others. I felt so much hope. Bravo to all who made this film!"
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"Truly one of the best films of all time. the cinematography is astounding, the choreography is amazing, and the film as a whole will keep you constantly on edge as our protagonists are constantly one bullet, knife or booby trap away from death. this movie does not mess around with keeping you tense, as once the main characters leave their trench, you will be constantly breathless, as the film throws everything it can at you to show just how fragile our main characters are. honest to god, this film will make you fear that the film will end with both characters shot dead on multiple occasions, and that is what is so great about the film: it puts you into their shoes. you aren't just some guy in a theatre, you are a grunt in the british army, who has sent on an impossible mission with high odds of total failure. you will fight through enemy lines in order to succeed, with the only possible reward being the possibility of a medal and a pat on the back for a job well done. but either way, you have to do it, as lives are at stake, lives of which only you and your best mate can save. this is the experience of watching 1917, as well as the reason why it is so great. in the end, amazing flick. if you are able to go see it, go see it as soon as possible. don't worry about getting someone to go with you, or when you'll go see it, just see it as soon as you can. trust me, it is worth it."
1917,5 March 2020,9/10,"Being one of the nine Best Picture nominees for the annual Oscars, '1917' emerged as one of the finest movies of 2019 and one of the favorites to claim the most coveted prize in the film industry. Though the South Korean comedy drama 'Parasite' swept the big categories, leaving '1917' solely with awards for cinematography, sound and special effects, the movie still has become both a commercial hit and critically acclaimed worldwide.The story is set in WW1 era France, and follows (more or less literally) the footsteps of two British soldiers handed the task of impending an entire company from walking into a trap set up by the Germans, by delivering an order of retreat to the commander of the company. In order to complete their mission they need to cross muddy fields abundant of rotting corpses and their stench, make their way through mined bunkers and avoid Germans in towns devastated by war. Will they manage to deliver the message in time?The most immediate and flagrant distinction in the movie is the widely talked-about one-shot technique, meaning that the film is devised in such a way that it looks like the whole affair I shot in one long, fluid take. It is a great device for sustaining the tension in each scene, for instance in the opening scene in the British trenches, where the claustrophobia gradually increases until it's time for our soldiers to set out on their journey. When they finally enter the barren, reeking battlefield the viewer has transformed into a third soldier, feeling the unease with every passing plane and flinching at the sight of the dissolving corpses. The meticulous cinematography is nothing short of an immaculate masterwork, giving the landscapes a bleak, gritty and desolate look, suitable for this kind of war movie. Overall the movie is technically impeccable, both looking and sounding astonishing.Despite its many benefits, ultimately the film's most unique feature remains its greatest obstacle: the fluidity of the camera movement prevents a more elaborate look into the characters and a more emotional connection with them (notwithstanding the poignancy of the subject of war alone), leaving the film rather hollow on an emotional level, something the good acting can't redeem.Acting as the WW1 equivalent to Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan', '1917' shares many of the latter's greatest attributes; being a realistic, non-glorifying and morbid depiction of war. Among all WW2 movies it's also refreshing to see a film taking place in the less exploited First World War. All in all '1917' is further evidence that the film industry after a few years off truly is on its way back."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"Even going in knowing that this was filmed on a single line, I was still astonished how Mendes pulled this off. This is a raw, hard war movie with raw, hard realities. Emotions are skewed in war; there is no time to mourn on the battlefield. Yet the acting is so good that the players appropriately convey sadness, loss, and pain in their own brief way, then continue on with the mission. The scene changes have almost a video game quality to them, from trench to bunker to large expanses of battlefield, from clouds to sun, from soaking wet to dry. I felt imersed in all of the physical textures in this film much like the Revenant, where you left the theatre feeling cold and sore. I want to say no more here about this film and encourage others to go see it on the big screen. You will have not seen anything like this before. Absolutely stunning."
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"I'm a huge WWI buff and had to rate this 10/10.
Everything about this movie was spot on, even the filming setting, looked remarkably like the landscape of the Somme.
Stunning cinematography and could not fault the actors in the slightest. Barely touched my popcorn in the cinema as I was on the edge of my seat the entire film.
Absolutely Brilliant."
1917,30 January 2020,9/10,"Movie is visually great.
Great direction specially cinematography, all actors have done great job.
Also movie was directed to look like in a single shot."
1917,2 January 2021,8/10,"This movie tells the story of 2 messengers in ww1. It's not a grand plot to save all of humanity and as the ""high up army guy"" states in the end, it makes no difference cause next week there'll be a new order. However we are with the message all throughout it's path & we experience the journey of the messengers step by step.Some people complain that they want more action but this isn't just an action flick, if you want one go watch something else. There's tension & there's emotional scenes. Especially the tension of proceeding through the no man's land is very well done. The emotional scenes could've worked better if we had been with these people for a longer time, I don't know why movies these days are made so short? This could've really benefited from us getting to know these characters more. That being said, MOST of the emotional scenes are really good.Another thing I've read people complaining about is that this movie is pro-war, which I find very odd. I'm about as anti-war and anti-military as one can be & I'm currently on forced labour type civilian service for a year because I refused to join the military & I don't think this film is pro-war at all. It clearly shows that war is hellish & meaningles. Medals don't matter, the stopping of the attack doesn't matter & no one is presented as a hero. People are rotting in the trenches or dying in horrendous pain. This movie ends more or less in 1 of the main characters brother crying over his death.It should be stated that this movie isn't 100% realistic & contains some scenes where the main actors doing things that wouldn't be the wisest ones to do, but then again not every soldier in ww1 were a tactical genius. But it's a valid criticism, however this is not a fantasy film level of inaccuracy as some would have you believe.The cinematography is top notch, sometimes amazing. The sound design is good, but not outstanding in my opinion."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is just gorgeous. It's now certain Sam Mendes KNOWS how to do a war movie. And this movie has such beauty in its disgustingness. I only had two-ish problems with the movie but I'll save those for last. I think where this movie really succeeds is the set pieces. There are so many layers you can find. Like for instance a dead dog in the barn scene or just bodies scattered about. Work was put into this movie to make it believable. And if I haven't already mentioned, while gory this movies shots are breathtaking. When Will is in front of the burning building my jaw dropped it was so beautiful. Kudos to the cinematography. Also just saying score and story are great but you would have to watch it for yourself. Also this movie IS a war movie. People die there are no winners or losers. Spoiler: one of the main characters dies halfway through I want to say which shows Sammy boy isn't scared to show the reality of war. Anyways what didn't I like. For one the plot loses me at times I don't want to go too far into this issue because it isn't annoying as it may seem but the main goal is just lost for me. I dunno it felt like Will couldn't succeed but then he runs into the battalion? That's supposed to be like miles away?!?! Not that big of an issue. Also, the movie is one continuous shot (excluding the hidden cuts) however, three quarters through the movie
there is a cut.
(Its when will gets ""shot"" and wakes back up) made me mad but I still enjoyed the movie a mastapiece if I will."
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"First let me say the beginning sequences were shot almost perfectly. I was really into the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. I was engaged and thinking about how I was going to tell my sons that if they get a chance to go watch it in the theater. The cinematography and music were gripping.
Then..... as the 2 main characters (solider A and soldier B) get through the initial German traps, and enter into an open field with a cow, a barn, and a pale of fresh milk, the movie goes down hill fast. I was literally laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and situations. A & B, whose duty it is to transport a message to (2) battalions, warning the battalions are falling into a German trap. Soldier A, has an older brother who is possibly going to be slaughtered in the trap.
With the cow and milk pale in the background, A & B find themselves helping a German airplane pilot out of his burning plane after witnessing an aerial dog fight. This is right after they go through hundreds of yards of seeing their dead countrymen. This is also after they almost get blown up (should have been into 1000 pieces) from booty traps (goonies reference). They help the German guy? Help him? Well, the German guy proceeds to knife Soldier A and kill him. That sequence made me almost leave the theater. I should have because the remaining parts of the movie just got worse. Soldier B still had a message to deliver. B proceeded to get picked up by a convoy of English Soldiers in trucks, who showed up a split second after the cow, milk, plane sequence. As if the trucks showing up was not ridiculous enough, the truck B was in got stuck in the mud moments later. B then convinces 15 or so other soldiers to help him push it out of the mud. Well, they miraculously do this, only to find that they can drive another few hundred yards.
Our message delivering solider B leaves them and then now has to make it past the storm trooper German snipers. I call them storm troopers, because just like storm troopers, they are unable to hit their target. On one of the first sniper situations, the sniper gets hit by a bullet, so B thinks. However, when B goes to check to see if he shot the sniper, he opens the door full swing with his entire body facing the wounded sniper. B then takes a bullet? Or something happens where he gets knocked back down a small flight of stairs. After he wakes, he evades some more storm troopers, then kicks open a small horizontal door to find a woman and a baby, along with a beautiful fire. Thankfully B had fresh milk.
B then leaves as it is getting close to morning. He evades a couple storm troopers only to find a younger storm trooper that he tries to shush. B actually puts his finger up to the storm trooper to shush him? Huh? Was this part of Jedi training? When that doesn't work he chokes him instead. Much to B's surprise, the choking worked better than the shushing. Go figure?
B then runs and runs evading lots of lots of laser guns. Oops sorry, bullets. Then he jumps into a raging river where he smashes his head. Thankfully he has a hard head.
If that is not silly enough, the rivers puts him exactly where he needs to be. Right up to a Battalion sitting in a large circle, listening to a guy singing. UGH, that was so bad.
B still needs to get his dry message that was soaked in the river to the commander. He proceeds to evade lots of bombs from enemy fire to do this. But thankfully B makes it. A cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as the commander cannot save this flop.
B saves the second wave. B meets A's brother, even though he was in the first wave that was already deployed and supposed to be slaughtered.I just have to say why? Why do we need to accept these movies and call them Oscar winners? Yes, the cinematography should get an award possibly. Maybe the score. But the overall movie was just plain terrible."
1917,5 December 2019,10/10,"This film is simply beautiful shot, incredibly composed, fantastical directed and will be seen as one of the greatest war films of all time!"
1917,28 January 2020,6/10,"A pretty good war movie, but it failed to make me care enough about the leads or their mission, and this was largely because the implausibility made it impossible to take it seriously. Too many narrow escapes is bad enough, but I could not get past how that letter and those photographs survived what seemed like a long time in the water, even if you allow that he himself survived it."
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"One Story.
As should be told.
Everything is typed in my memory.
I feel.
Perfection of filming"
1917,21 January 2020,1/10,"I honestly don't understand the high ratings of his film! I see people writing
""it's as good as saving private Ryan"" please do NOT compare this film to saving private Ryan. It doesn't even come close to it. I left the cinema underwhelmed and did not get the climax I wanted considering it's a war movie. I mean, why call it a war movie when there's not even any action ?????!!!!!! And the beautiful visual and single shot film isn' good enough to call it a good film. Save your money and wait for it to come out on Netflix or another streaming service."
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"When i was watching it I felt like i was watching the Greatest Movie Ever Made in World Cinema History.
Performance, vfx, score, direction, camera moment everything was great and the cinematography was like hell. One of the best war drama movie ever made and the best movie on World War I."
1917,13 February 2020,10/10,"I'm a woman and I really don't like war movies. But my husband wanted to see this. So, I figured, the moment it got too violent or gory, I was out of here. Yet, from the moment this movie started, with the way the camera captured the two young soldiers walking through war trenches, something I had never really known about or observed before, and the amazing construction of these war-time structures, I was hooked. I could literally not stop watching this movie, even when there were some gory, bloody scenes.The ending was touching, emotional, and really completed and finalized this awesome movie.Sam Mendes - brilliant producer. Pulls you in until you feel at one with the movie, just the way it should be!"
1917,1 February 2020,7/10,One of the best war movies ever on par with saving private ryan the direction and cinematography take the film to whole new level music is brilliant and one shot scenes are taken perfectly. This film is technically very accurate and the acting from lead actors is spot on kudos to sam mendes and the entire team a well deserve oscar for this masterpiece...
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,"This is a good film, there are some marvellous scenes depicting the horrors of war but there was not enough action involved for my liking, I get its trying to show you that they're all afraid young blokes but they could have thrown in some extra firefights or explosions just to bring the audience further into it. The ending was a bit of an anti climax aswell. watchable but needed some extra touches to be right up there, wish it had been"
1917,15 March 2020,9/10,I gave it 8.3/10 its absolute masterpiece this is the kind of movie that defines hollywood.
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"I'm not a huge fan of Mendes OR of war films. But this one knocked it out of the park! Incredibly emotional, visually brilliant, VASTLY better than Saving Private Ryan (the obvious shallow comparison). I had no intention of seeing it until several friends told me it was a masterpiece. I completely agree! If possible, see it in IMAX."
1917,28 June 2020,9/10,"A really good movie with a simple war story that will hook you from the very beginning to the end. It also does a great job in depicting how scared (and young) most of the soldiers were during those unfortunate times. One of the best war films of the era, 1917 uses powerful storytelling and some of the greatest cinematography of all time to create an overall amazing movie."
1917,21 January 2020,9/10,"Phenomenal. Gripping. Honest. Raw.Firstly, lets start with the bad. Some parts of the script were awful and the CGI was terrible BUT the directing and cinematography were superb, really made you feel like you were there with them.The camera follows the two men and the shots were beautiful, never giving too much away, keeping you attentive, awaiting any sudden movements. You feel every emotion the men felt.THE SCORE. The score! Incredible!side note: I hadn't read much about the movie so it was nice to see a few (beautiful) familiar faces in there!"
1917,13 February 2020,4/10,"It didn't touch me. Not a good war film, I think.
CGI is too polished as if it is a video game.
Several details in a story line are too unreal as if they were put there just for an additional effect."
1917,11 February 2020,6/10,"I found the film watchable enough with some excellent acting. But while it did provide an interesting story it was seriously flawed in many respects. It is important to understand that after 3 years of total war, the frontline was NOT a narrow strip of mud and barbed wire with quiet green fields and lush woodland in abundance on either side. The front moved backwards and forwards regularly and the carnage spanned 50 miles at its narrowest point, with constant artillery barrages and sniping 24/7. Even in the quieter areas this was still to be seen and heard in the distance. With armies of millions of combatants there was a huge and constant logistical/supply network reaching many miles back behind each line. The chances of two soldiers wandering at will through the lines and into untouched farmland beyond are virtually nil because if such an unlikely situation arose they would be accompanied by thousands of their own troops keen to exploit any opportunity and capture even the narrowest strip of turf. The Germans did withdraw to stronger prepared positions on occasion but only in an orderly fashion with a strong rearguard and they were pushed and probed throughout by opposing forces. When the withdrawal stopped, the combatants promptly lined to face each other in this new position. The idea that 1600 men could pursue an enemy well beyond the battle zone on the western front with no logistical support is frankly mere fantasy. If such an unlikely situation did arise, the whole army group would be alongside them. Communications were difficult but contact with such a large group would have been maintained with a series of runners and signallers - even in the highly unlikely event of the group pushing so far ahead on their own. In 1917 this did not happen. I was a little disappointed to see the main character jumping into a raging torrent and being washed to safety down a deep limestone gorge filled with rapids and a huge waterfall - especially as I had seen this being filmed on the white water kayak course at the Tees Barrage (with the later cgi addition of rocks/gorge/waterfall). Anyone who knows the flat lands of Flanders or the slightly hilly Somme (ie the British sector of the front) will have wondered how the set suddenly moved to alpine terrain for this scene - especially given his short walk from the riverbank to the chalk lands of the final battle. Doubtless there are those who will think I am being picky but when the producers have gone to great lengths to create an authentic trench system with equally realistic no-mans-land and destroyed village, they let themselves down by failing to maintain that atmospheric authenticity throughout the film. I just wonder whether an overall historian gets employed in these productions, to shed some realism on the bigger issues rather than just costume and the finer points. I would liken it in this respect to two recent war films which started well but Lost momentum: Dunkirk which needed 300,000 extras not 300 (cgi?) and Fury which needed someone to rein in the big Tarrantino-esq unbelievable finish!
1917 is a watchable film but please dont make the mistake of thinking it captures the atmosphere of the Western Front because it actually falls a long way short. And I haven't even mentioned the similarity in the final storyline of Gallipoli, which is a far better film!!"
1917,24 February 2020,10/10,"I sat down in the cinema expecting a strong war film, perhaps aligned with the likes of Dunkirk - captivating but limited by its lack of character study. As the credits rolled, tears certainly did too, and I felt a true affinity with this piece of such artfully crafted cinema, widely stunning, yet intimately removed from being another Hollywood blockbuster.
The premise of this epic is relatively simple: two young soldiers are sent on a mission to warn another regiment - where one of their brothers is stationed - of an impending attack. They must reach the regiment by dawn.
What follows is not only visually remarkable with the superb cinematography of Roger Deakins, but a compelling journey that the audience is able to follow closely, owing to the film's 'one shot' style. The relatively unknown leads, Dean-Charles Chapman as Blake and George Mackay as Schofield, are similarly superb, embodying the 'everyman' nature of those who served. With the use of star British actors, such as Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott, in the roles of higher officers, Mendes also comments on the social divides that were present during WW1. However, the true worth of this film shines particularly through the nuanced development of Schofield, not only through Mackay's determined performance, but through what he is made to endure - an example of storytelling being pushed to attain emotional, physical, and mental heights.
1917 is certainly a journey, if anything for its constant movement where no settings are repeated, and it is ultimately marked not by a fantastic display of heroism, but rather the quiet and shockingly harsh endurance of those who fought in the Great War. 1917 could have been the story of any soldier. It is one story amongst millions, and a beautifully forceful one."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Wow just wow !!! The whole movie looks like a single continuous take...
Hats off to all the technicians of the film including the director...No wonder the director won golden globe for this film.The plot is so simple : A team of 2 soldiers go from Point A to Point B to deliver a critical message...that's it.But this has been visualized in such an amazing way..I am just speechless.A definite 10/10."
1917,2 February 2020,7/10,"It was good for sensational cinematography, but story was not so much catchy and multiple times, it felt like a set is put there for particular scenes which sparked unreal feeling."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,It was an immersive movie that you don't want to take your eyes off the screen of. It had the feeling of a video game because of the way it is filmed but yet I liked it because it is in real time and you only see what the director wants you to see. There are very few shots of any that pan out. Many are close as if you are right there with the main characters. It makes you feel a part of the story and very well done. I've never seen a movie quite like this. The intensity is great and it makes you feel as if you are there in the war. The trench scenes are amazing and feel as if you are there in the war. It is spot on to detail and I love that the big name actors have a relatively small part and let the young actors shine. They do a great job. One of the best war movies I've seen next to saving private Ryan. It's just as good just different.
1917,16 March 2020,10/10,"I am sad,happy, amazed and i am speechless .. I would like to personally meet and thank the makers of this film."
1917,23 March 2020,10/10,Absolutely one of the finest war movies.... My all time war favorite may be 'Saving Private Ryan' but 1917 doesn't lag behind much....
1917,19 March 2020,9/10,"I have just finished watching the movie 1917...it was a very fascinating movie directed by Sam Mendes. The whole movie felt oh so real that I could not take my eyes off it.The plot is not so intriguing but the way the film is shot and directed in ""one shot"" is pure wonder.You will never regret watching it."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,1917 is simply the best cement experience I have ever had. If you have the option then define fly see this in the Dolby Cinema and take it in. The tense moments and somber silence was all just simply beautiful. The buildup and high stakes made the movie get more and more tense And the payoff is simply spectacular.
1917,22 October 2020,10/10,"It's taken me awhile to get to 1917.
Not even in lockdown did I get the chance to just sit alone and put it on the big TV downstairs no kids, and just for once have a few hours on my own.And for this moment it was the perfect film.
I really don't have words to do it justice.
But the raw emotion and the continuous shot by the camera and the cinematography were just incredible.A beautiful thing in the telling of a story in the most horrible of time.Those boys were made of something else back then.
The horror of the trenches, and battlefield, but the comradary of the man next to you and the focus of sheer will and determination of the story is quite simply epic.I felt as if I was clenching my jaw for the most part due to the building tension, to a end that surely left tears in my eyes.I'd like to think will got home to his wife and daughters.Thank you Sam mendes."
1917,26 February 2020,9/10,"Awesome depiction of horrific war scenes. Captures the audience very well. Great acting, tightly controlled and nicely executed. Loved the whole movie 👍🏻"
1917,17 January 2020,5/10,"Technically it is a masterpiece, but you can't say the same about the story. It has its moments, but you have too often impression, it's just another war movie. Sam Mendes made better pictures."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,Can honestly say it lived up to expectations! The cinematography is beautiful and it's an understatement to say the last half an hour or so had me on the edge of my seat!
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"This film was suspenseful from start to finish. You really rooted for the two actors and felt their fear and exhaustion and adrenaline. It had great use of music to heighten the suspenseful nature but contrasted the movie with softer scenes like the woman and the baby to remind us of humanity and the harshness of war.
The actor George Mackay is brilliant and you really felt his fear throughout the whole story.
This film also helps those who have not been to war nor had family lineage who was in the army, empathize with the experiences ppl have in war and help them understand the sacrifices ppl made during those times. It also shows the senselessness of war and the small amount of power a soldier has in relation to his superiors and circumstances of politics."
1917,31 May 2020,8/10,"Really impressive movie, at least technically. Beautiful cinematography, just jaw dropping at times, which added to the way it was shot as a virtual one take, is just incredible. Some of the lighting is also incredibly well done. The music is also fantastic. I would say the story alone in any other format would still be pretty good, but it doesn't quite match the heights of the technical aspects. One drawback with the format though is the amount of time just following people walking."
1917,5 April 2020,9/10,"This movie was, in a word, amazing. The score, the picture, the story; all of it very well done. This movie will resonate with so many, as a hauntingly beautiful retelling of a horrendous war. This was so impactful and eye opening to the detrimental effects of war. I hope this goes to show how horrific war really is, and I hope we learn to not repeat it."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,Go see this movie. This is the absolute best movie I have seen in a very long time. The tension they create throughout the entire move is intense. It's also refreshing that in this politically motivated word we live in where everything has to push an agenda they managed to just tell a story about soldiers at war without adding any politics or hidden messages. On top of all that it was visually stunning.
1917,3 April 2021,9/10,"I have no other words than the movie what reaaaaaally good. Just go watch it, don't satse your time watching the reviews before deciding if it's worth it to watch the movie. I'm telling you: GO WATCH IT."
1917,26 January 2020,7/10,"With all the fuss going on about this movie I must admit it had set a high mark for me before I went to see it. And don't get me wrong; it is not a bad movie. Especially the technical achievements and unique approach make it worthwhile. But at several points it left me with the feeling that it was very forced in order to add drama. For example the Germans are as good with a gun as a stormtrooper. And the amount of corpses that have to be crawled through that could be avoided is at points hilarious (for example the river scene). I also didn't bond as much with the main characters because you learn virtually nothing about them. And that is something that for me really diminished the dramatic effect. If you had to pick, I would recommend going to Jojo Rabbit instead. A very different movie, but with more depth."
1917,13 May 2020,8/10,It's impossible to watch this movie and not believe God does exist... That's all I can say
1917,24 December 2020,10/10,"The cinematography is mesmerising, choreographed and executed to perfection around the horrific elements of war. The cast and the soundtrack fit perfectly to expand the immersive, and impressive technical achievement of this movie.
Deserves all the Oscars and awards it got."
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,Bad story great actors and very good scenes . Has to be more comprehensive story
1917,30 January 2021,10/10,The cinematography is stunning. The attention to detail makes this picture seem real.The horror of ww1 is brought to the screen with elegance and power.
1917,28 March 2020,7/10,"Overall this is a solid film. The cinematography is outstanding as are some of the effects. There's not a lot of unneeded fluff and the film doesn't deviate or waste time with deep subplots. I like very much that it stayed on point. However, the creators make the same mistake that so many WW1 and WW2 movies make these days. It literally costs nothing to use period dialog in these films, yet they throw the F word around like it's set in the modern day. I'm not being prudish. It's simply not accurate at all for the period. They may as well have called each other dude or homie because it is that much out of place for WW1 military. For me it really brought the movie down because it's not historically accurate. I can overlook mistakes in wardrobe or in set design. I can overlook some plot holes here and there. Some if that stuff is hard to replicate or hard to keep continuity in the story, but you can easily find out which period slang and swear words were used then with almost no effort. In most regiments, use of such language was a punishable offense, yet everyone in this movie uses the F word like a modern crime drama. And even if the rank and file soldier said the word occasionally in the heat of combat, a British officer certainly wouldn't. They did use the word back then, but sparingly and certainly not as it is used today and not in the manner as this film. Not only this, but they used very few words that were actually used as swear words during the period by the British. I've heard WW2 veterans complain about some modern war films that no one used the F word like that back then. I just don't understand why they could research every aspect of the era to bring to the screen, but neglect to make some language accurate. Makes no sense. It's a good film that could have been a great film had someone on the writing staff taken ten minutes to Google the use of the F word during the period. It's just totally out of place."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"When I first saw this movie I thought that it will be on the level of Hawksaw Ridge, Platoon or Saving of Private Ryan buut noooo!
The movie was boring, not emotional at all and the actors are pretty bad. Im so dissapointed in reviews and ratings. And the thing that I almost forgot to say that some scenes are really funny and stupid. They are shooting at him and he is just running and bullet didnt hit him. And all in all im very dissapointed and the movie doesnt deserve all the praises he is getting."
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,"First and foremost, the set designs and filming are superb. Saw the film in IMAX and that was intense, took the film to a whole other level. The one shot filming is different, but personally thought it helped the storyline and the urgency the characters were under. It isn't real herky jerky like other films I've seen where it's live action. The music accompanying several scenes was also extremely well done.If you're in the military, a veteran, or military enthusiast then yes you could probably poke holes in some of the scenes. The cinematography more than makes up for it though.The storyline is simple, maybe a little to simplistic for some, but I personally think it was done on purpose because of how the film is shot. It's basically a race against the clock, move across enemy territory, against terrible odds, and save massive loss of life. You aren't going to get a lot of extra details about the characters or what's led to the situation they are now in, its purely about the journey and what they have to overcome.For those who thought it was boring or slow not sure what movie was being watched. For most of the movie you're on pins and needles anticipating who or what is going to pop out from behind who knows what. This was a great movie, highly recommend."
1917,19 January 2020,7/10,7/10 definitely go and see this film if you have the opportunity.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"From the cinematography down to the editing, it was a rollercoaster of a movie. The last time I witnessed a WAR movie this dramatic was 'Hackshaw Ridge'. I honestly didn't look away, it was amazingly edited to make it feel like a 1 hour and 59 minute take, it sucks you in and doesn't let you grab for your phone while you're watching the film. Bravo to Sam Mendes for his directing excellence and also a massive congratulations to Roger Deakins for this masterpiece."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,Following these young soldiers as they get through the dreadful spaces of No Man's Land during World War 1 in this film is a very immersive experience. I cried a few times watching this movie. It was a fantastic experience.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"Unless you're 6 years old or suffer from severe PTSD caused by war, this will be the best film you have ever seen, even if you're visually impaired."
1917,6 January 2020,10/10,"When the first trailer was released I knew that this was going to be a phenomenal film. The cinematography is one of the best I've ever witnessed and the score is absolutely amazing. I'm glad that the First World War is finally getting the attention it deserves in cinema. In addition, the movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire time along with the rest of the sold out theatre. In my opinion this is the best war movie that we have had the opportunity to view since Saving Private Ryan. Expect this movie to win many awards especially at the oscars and golden globes."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"Not always comfortable viewing, and in places not for the sensitive, but a very powerful film well worth seeing again. Personal issue I had was that the early scenes, running through the trenches, made me slightly queasy as the camera twisted and turned through the trench, following the characters step by step. However, I quickly got over it......."
1917,10 February 2020,7/10,"1917 is an incredibly fun ride and is a roller coaster for your eyes. The visuals are incredible and all the acting as well. Where 1917 falls down is it's very thin plot. Everything happens as a coincidence and it is very structured, like other movies with strong storyline's. Still worth seeing no the big screen though, I'd still recommend watching it."
1917,24 February 2020,5/10,"I just don't get all the 10s. This was good, not great. So many glaring plot/reality holes:
Neither of them getting killed or even seriously when the rat sets off the booby trap in the German bunkerThe whole sniper scene, just silly and unrealistic, considering German soldiers could not hit him at near point blankThe forced diversity of black soldiers on the front line, black immigration to England did not happen until WW2 for this type of thing to be representedThe whole convoy of troops showing up after the plane crash/stabbing without so much as a soundThe letter being completely legible, crisp and folded in his pocket after canyoning down a freezing river and rapidsComing upon the Devons without anyone challenging him, considering he was sopping wet and had no weapons.So much silliness. Worth seeing for the cinematography and set pieces only. Go rewatch Mel Gibson's Gallipoli for a real WW1 story."
1917,14 January 2020,8/10,"Personally, I loved this film. It really managed to bring me out of the cinema and let me into the movie. Unfortunately for me, I watched it with a bad projection meaning there were some juddery swooping shots however the fact that the illusion of one-shot was kept really blew me away."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"Real and gripping this film tells a story and envelops you in the gritty details. You are there alongside the protagonist from the very start all the way through a harrowing journey, a spirit looking over the shoulder taking in the same scenes. If you are fortunate to miss the parts that pull you out of it, you will be living the scenes yourself. This is why I recommend watching this without outside inputs, living the haunting realities of the Great Wars safely from your chair."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,Such a good movie super tense had me intrigued the whole time . Richard madden almost made me cry . Defiantly a must watch in theaters
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"1917. Beginning was excellent, but lost its way in the middle.Too many as if bits for mine, that and german troops making stormtrooperw look like expert marksmen.Do see it on a big screen with a good sound setup as the visuals and audio are excellent."
1917,8 January 2020,9/10,Movie 7-8ish ...but astonishing camera work brings it up to a 9
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes First World War epic is a visual masterpiece which warrants every inch of its award hype. This is not a film driven by introspective character narrative and for some this apparent lack of plot, will seem like a deterrent and boring for some. The film focuses on a day in Spring 1917 in France, following Lance Corporal Schofield (George Mackay) and Lance Corporal Blake (Dean Charles Chapman), being tasked by their General to deliver a message to a nearby battalion, to halt their forthcoming attack as it a trap. And from this point onwards the film follows relentlessly the point of view of the two men as they travel through their trenches, across no mans land and through the apparent abandoned enemy front lines.Mendes decision to film using long tracking shots, alludes to the idea that it was filmed in one continuous take, never leaving the leads sides. This, above anything else, has garnered much attention and has drawn criticism for favouring technological technique over narrative. But I would argue, far from detracting from the story, this type of film-making is a character device all by itself and adds to the individualistic war many soldiers endured. This is not your typical Americanised, action film since very little stylised action takes place, there is very little interaction at all within the entire film. Communication between characters is minimal, there are many fleeting interactions, even between named stars such as Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch but this only adds to the realism the film is trying to portray.Following one man's journey, this is not about the holistic nature of war, it's an individual's experience. With that being sad, Mende's is aware he is making a film and utilises his hero with particularly unrealistic chases from enemy gunfire at mere yards away. There are moments that frustrate and where one would say the Schofield could not possibly survive but he is encapsulating the strength of human spirit, the heroic nature of soldiers, the sheer luck some soldiers experienced surviving a war they were not always prepared for. For many, the Great War was not as it was promised: for many they thankfully never even experienced the ""big push"" and fought of boredom and squalor more than anything else.Those looking for action are in the wrong film, they are in the wrong conflict and they are misinformed at what the years of trench-ware actually meant for soldiers. This was not something many men were proud of, hence a particularly poignant moment where Schofield scoffs at his war medals, for what use is a piece of ribbon to a family who will never have their son/brother/husband or father back? Many soldiers died pointlessly and were mere canon fodder for generals who had no idea what they were fighting nor what their plans were from one week to the next. The deaths in the film are not heroic in grandeur but they are in terms of human spirit and they stay true to how many young men died on the fields.1917 is about the individual, lived experience of war, a poetic and visceral display of the battlefields. Brave in its portrayal, realistic in its cinematography and above all else, a more than fitting homage to the endurance of human spirit."
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"What a great film. The cutting is so seem-less and the action is
so damn documentary style. Bravo Mendes!"
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"Lance Corporals Tom Blake & William Schofield must deliver a letter. 1,600 men (including Tom's brother) are facing certain death if they don't. Rotting horse & human carcasses, flies, rats, barbed wire, tunnels, craters, tripwires & mud"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Unfortunately, I think this film has let itself down to certain audiences by being too realistic. A lot of the reviewers on here seem to envision war as being all ""YEE-HAW""'s and explosions, with awesome Kung-fu fights with cool front flips. If that's what you want out of a war time movie, like the critics, do not go and watch 1917.If you do however, want to see a film with a realistic world war 1 setting, containing believable gun fights, gruesome (yet realistic) props, moments with high suspense and great, well thought out dialogue, then you should go and see 1917.A lot of people seem to be comparing this to Saving Private Ryan (which with all due respect a great movie), but it's like comparing Gladiator to Saving Private Ryan. For starters, 1917 and Saving Private Ryan aren't even the same war. WW1 was mainly trenches, suspense and rubbish equipment. A lot of WW1 probably was boring and actionless, sitting around wondering when you'll be sent to your death. It's like comparing Chalk and Cheese. Of course there are similarities (they're both war films being pretty much the only one), but there is so much that is different. 1917 should be seen as a completely different film, not a Saving Private Ryan remake. If that's what you're expecting, you'll be disappointed.The story, I agree, is slightly unbelievable. But when have movie plots ever been 100% realistic? Especially action films. It's a film, not a documentary. Don't get too caught up on whether this scenario would have ever taken place. If you're going to deduct stars from your review because ""the scenario isn't believable"", I suggest you never step foot in a cinema or watch a film ever again, because there's a lot of films out there that are going to leave you very triggered."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"I have literally just set this account up because of this film.It deserves every Oscar, even the ones that it isn't nominated for!!!Sam Mendes has outdone himself. The cinematography is out of this world with the non stop filming. It is so immersive and impressive to watch. The acting is top class, and the story telling/script again deserves all the accolades.I don't think I blinked throughout the entire film, my partner had constant tears, and the film just sucks you in.We watched it in 2D IMAX and I certainly recommend it. I'm sure it will still be good on TV, but I would suggest this is one you should make the effort to watch in a cinema for the full effect."
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"1917 does a number of things extraordinarily well and makes a smaller number of questionable choices.The thing that most stood out to me about this World War I piece was the beautiful choice Sam Mendes made in regard to cinematography. The entire film stretches out as if in one continuous shot. The camera follows Blake and Schofield, and later just Schofield, in their constant journey through the warzone and countryside. The camera is nearly always behind or to the side of the characters, creating a wonderful third-person perspective effect. The horror of war is very well conveyed through Roger Deakins's floating shots, with the viewer taking in the ambient environment alongside the soldiers.The plot structure was also a welcome surprise, which was intimately connected to the style of cinematography. 1917 takes place throughout one small period of time, from a little before dusk, through the night, and into the next day. The cinematography aides this progression in its unfaltering motion, as if the movement of the sun is also the movement of the characters. The goal was not to create an all-encompassing war film comprised of only the most gruesome and important moments, which many Hollywood films attempt to do; instead Mendes wove action sequences throughout more passive, environmental scenes. This created for me a more palatable and perhaps more realistic experience.The entire film was punctuated with very effective dialogue. I say punctuated because of the none of the dialogue was particularly crucial to the progress of the film. Because of the simple nature of the mission, Schofield didn't have to continuously rely on other characters to direct him and give him orders. The use of dialogue was used passively between Schofield and Blake and between anonymous members of another platoon. The lines functioned as a realistic device-most words shared between people are not important, they are just a tool to bind people together. In the cases of important dialogue between the main characters and military leadership, the lines were realistic and quick. There were no long, rousing speeches, which I thought was appropriate and a little refreshing.The realism of 1917 was thrown off a little by a few of the major plot moments. Blake and Schofield reach a small farm in the countryside and witness a plane dogfight in the distance, the loser of which crash lands nearly on top of them. The scene ends up conveniently killing off Blake, which was obviously the point of the encounter, but it seemed a little far-fetched for me. Later, Schofield encounters a lone soldier in a watchtower, which creates a sort of standoff. The scene ends with the first and only major cut of the film, Schofield and the soldier shooting one another. It seemed unlikely that a single German soldier would remain at that location, but I'm willing to give Mendes the benefit of the doubt. However, the result of the scene, Schofield passing out and losing time, seemed to be a plot device. These moments seemed lazy in comparison to the incredible amount of effort put into the rest of the film.1917 by director Sam Mendes had several questionable moments that failed to overshadow the brilliance of his filmmaking in this beautifully shot World War I piece."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"1917 was very moving and intense. I liked the ""one shot"" way it was filmed. It showed the trenches of WWI and the difficulties therein very clearly. I saw scenes of things I had not seen before in a WWI movie."
1917,23 January 2020,9/10,"The cinematography of 1917 is, as you may have heard, special to say at least. By creating the effect of a ""one shot movie"" the audience is experiencing the emotional, epic and brutal trip through war divided France at its best.The music is great and the acting is good. 1917 is everything that you want and expect from a war movie."
1917,11 February 2020,7/10,Some part the story is in some unknown place with surprise women.For me its ok but need more deep down survival action...
1917,17 February 2020,9/10,"This movie could be described as a well crafted, well represented cinema. The highlight of the movie was the mood it created and was able to make us travel along with the 2 British soldiers. Was an experience."
1917,22 February 2020,8/10,"If your looking for a great all around movie, look no farther. This is one of the best war movies ever made. Film has very few mistakes in it and even the mistakes it does have you don't catch. The only complaints I could possibly have about this movie is I think Lance Corporal Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) got killed off a little to early in the film. It would have been awesome to see Lance Corporal Schofield and Lance Corporal Blake work their way through enemy territory together instead of it just being Lance Corporal Schofield. Other than that, 1917 is a amazing movie."
1917,26 February 2020,8/10,"I loved the cinematic filming and realism of the movie. The movie seemed to portray the War scene in relation to two mens experience in real time differently than any other war movie I have watched. I wish I could have seen more of the backstories related to the characters, but overall I really enjoyed it!"
1917,10 March 2020,10/10,"Really one of the best movies I have ever seen. How they filmed it and edited is exceptional! You feel with the characters and get a look inside the life of a WWI soldier. In 2019 we almost forgot the WWI, because of the many movies that are made about the WWII.
It is a beautiful movie, and if you're a history fan this is the movie for you! If you don't know a lot about WWI I would recommend to do some research first before watching this movie. It will make you appreciate it more."
1917,29 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is such a gem. It has pulled me in from the start. The one shot technique really made this movie hit home. A lot of shows and movies lack that special feeling nowadays. I personally love war movies. I loved Band of Brothers for example, which didn't use this one shot technique, obviously, yet pulls the viewer right in there. That moment, that brutality of war, the sorrow between men fighting for something bigger than themselves. That feeling is hard to capture on a screen in ways other than the horrors of war. 1917 did this.This movie can easily be called one of the best movies of this age. Not for people who like cookie cutter movies tough, you have to love the art of film to love this."
1917,10 January 2021,2/10,The acting is quite good. The English are all represented as sensitive and cheerfull. The Germans are represented as unfeeling computer game bots. The required diversity is introduced into the British army.
1917,13 March 2020,1/10,"Is it pretty to look at? yes.
is it incredibly boring? yes.
do i wish it had a purpose, something to say beyond it being just another romanticised war film? absolutely."
1917,14 May 2020,8/10,A personal experience that displays the emotional chaos and uncertainty of events in war. While exploring the will of two individuals we are taken as if alongside them in their objective. This left me with heavy emotional investment in the main characters. A dive into the action and mindsets of young men at war who show fervently the measures that ought to be taken to protect one another. Wonderfully shot and completely immersive.
1917,26 March 2020,7/10,"Except the ""new technique"" there's nothing so wow abt it
Im a HUGE FAN of war movies tho"
1917,5 April 2020,8/10,"A great ride from beginning to end, but the storyline is SO simple, and the characterization so thin, that we rely on the breakneck pacing and amazing camerawork. It works, and the movie is enjoyable, but at the end it just feels a bit like they could have done more. We finally get a tiny bit of characterization revealed at the very end, so this was the filmmaker's choice, but still I found that hurt what was otherwise an incredible experience."
1917,26 April 2020,8/10,"Excellent cinematography , great acting and some very good scenes. Soundtrack is awesome. Effects are also good. You would really enjoy the movie if u like agood army or war movie.."
1917,30 April 2020,10/10,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary."
1917,9 May 2020,9/10,I felt so many emotions during this film. It shocks with real images of war followed up by equally real reactions from the actors. It was an intense ride that kept me on the edge of my seat for the full 2 hours.
1917,13 May 2020,9/10,"This is the most anxiety-producing film i've ever seen in a few years.At least thrice,i gasped out loud.The tension was so thick that for the first hour,my hand was literally on my heart.Some scenes made me shut my eyes in anticipation of horror that would inevitably unfold.In short,i was a mess.This film is so devastating and powerful is the best sort of mess there is.Roger Deakens as DOP delivers a high compact with high artistry movie.Designed as a single continuous shot,hidden cuts of courses and an experience of an uninterrupted take.Taking the journey with the characters in such interesting way is the best part."
1917,8 October 2021,10/10,Bloody insane. I can't express how good twas in words. I'm not gonna try. Just watch it.
1917,9 June 2020,9/10,"This is a good movie with brilliant features like dead ones,tank, missile blasts etc..so near to real by vfx.. otherwise the story line is apt with the main character domain...all the firings nd acting activities are really interesting"
1917,25 June 2021,7/10,"I'll start by saying that from a technical perspective this movie is a 10. One of the best cinematography i've ever seen. The atmosphere is extraordinary. The subtle sound track complement the movie very well. Acting could be better but that doesn't deter from the technical merits of this movie. This is where the positives end for this movie though. It is one of the stupidest plot i've ever seen. And i'm not talking about the general idea of two guys having to deliver a message. That could have worked. No i'm talking about all the plot holes and mavel like action scenes. I don't mind having to turn my brain off when i'm watching a super hero movie or a fantasy movie and the likes. But when i'm watching a war movie trying to be realistic then nope not gonna work. This movie is improbable events after improbable events for a good 1 hour and a half. Spoilers ahead. Our hero survives a blast making a big trench collapse, he survives a plane crashing next to him, he survives a sniper (yet is able to spot him right away and kill him in around 3 shots), he survives wandering in a burning city at night with germans all around shooting at him from a talking distance, he survives going thru rapids full or rocks without drowning while being obstructed by equipment. The movie at time feels more like a great video game you can't play than a movie. It's unrealistic beyond beliefs. Oh and i forgot he somehow find a woman and a baby in the burning city full of germans and for a while i thought she was well hidden but no he gets out of there by walking thru a door next to where the woman was staying like really you got to be kidding me ... the last time i rolled my eyes so much in a movie must have been 10 years ago. I give it a 7 because it's a visual masterpiece but it's certainly not deserving of all the 10 it gets."
1917,19 June 2020,8/10,This film is epic! The shots are amazing and technical every is good. The story is not very special but that is no problem because they wanted to shoot a oneshot movie
1917,23 July 2020,9/10,"The Great War begins as a movement war but ends up becoming a position war. Unlike the Second World War, with its mobile fronts and its theaters of operations scattered all over the planet, which offer cinema raw material for the show, the First World War is a war of waiting, of impotence of men to overcome defensive barriers excavated by the enemy.The challenge of Sam Mendes, who had already returned formal panache and narrative breath to James Bond (Skyfall, Specter), is to deactivate inertia and start the engine of a completely cinegenic conflict. A terribly long war with the lethal ankylosis of his fights and his abstruse reasons against the allegorical confrontation between good and evil of the Second World War.The mission is at high risk but Mendes overcomes obstacles, adapts the codes of the subsequent conflict to the First World War and launches two young soldiers in a race against time and into a visual torrent. Their odyssey is told 'in real time' with a single true-false sequence plan: 'from one tree to another' with no cuts or apparent connections, with the exception of discrete digital sutures and a single ellipse on black that allows you to pass from day to night.The camera remains stubbornly glued to two unknown soldiers buried in the ghostly décor of the front. Obviously this is an illusion, it will take our staff twenty-four hours to reach the end of their mission and 1917 lasts only two hours. The camera becomes the gaze of the spectator who can edit his film, zoom in, linger on a detail, but can never leave Blake and Schofield.The spectator becomes the third companion, scrutinizes every danger, lowers his guard, becomes a vulnerable target, lives 1917 as a total immersion experience. The script of disarming simplicity, bringing an urgent message to the room unit in Écoust-Saint-Mein to prevent its massacre, is treated with stylistic prowess, an impressive technical tour de force, which accelerates emotions by capturing the daily ordeal without discounts lived at the front."
1917,17 October 2020,7/10,"Reminded me of the feeling I had after Gravity. Great effects and cinematography. Where was the story and dialogue to fill 2hours?
Bit like a Chinese meal - great at the time but soon wanting more."
1917,1 August 2020,9/10,1917 is an absolute feast for the eyes due to the fact that it seems to be captured in one shot. The realistic way in which the movie is made deserves props but for me the real star of the show is cinematographer Roger Deakins who puts forth his best work of his long and illustrious career. A must watch for anyone who loves cinema
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"It will stay with me for a long time. If nothing else it confounds the need to eternally remember those that paid the ultimate sacrifice and serves as a reminder, that the lives we live today are as they are, in large thanks to their valorous acts.
The best cinematography, set design and camera work I have seen in years, perhaps ever. An easy 10/10 for me."
1917,22 November 2020,10/10,"The way it was filmed was simply spectacular, and certain scenes had beautiful lighting and aesthetic. Acting was outstanding as well."
1917,18 October 2020,10/10,"Firstly, I never write reviews.1917 is an absolutely incredible film, from the filming itself and the soundtrack, to the acting and set/ locations.The way this film is shot, makes it look like a single camera shot throughout the whole film. It immerses you into the world. Stunning.The soundtrack used for this film is also incredibly atmospheric and emotional!The acting is spot on and believable.The set design is amazingly put together as well and grouped with the genius camera work, you feel as if you're watching an entire battlefield.Anyone that is even remotely interested in war films, you NEED to watch this. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films this century and I believe it will stay that way."
1917,6 February 2021,9/10,"Simple yet powerful, intense and beautifully. Perfect music accompanied. Well, written, directed and acted"
1917,20 November 2020,9/10,"This film was well done in every aspect. The directing, the writing, acting, cinematography, visual effects and the use of tension building music similar to Dunkirk made the film that more suspenseful. Sam Mendes and his team definitely captured what it was like to be in the trenches and fighting in WW1. I am a huge World War buff and it was nice to see a film done so well on the great War. The cast definitely gave a stellar performance all round and gave good insight into what it must be like emotionally and physically during that time. If I had one criticism of the film is a couple scenes of dialog between the two main characters could have been better written or acted, it felt more like they were filling space between two action sequences. I recommend this film as a must watch to at least get an idea of how horrific that war was and the impact it had on the world."
1917,13 January 2021,7/10,This was a good but not great war movie. The ending could have been better and was left with a couple of questions still at the end. Although the camera movements following the story are phenomenal which is why I rated higher. Not because of story line. Hacksaw Ridge is way better than this movie but for some reason has lower ratings
1917,13 November 2021,1/10,"As a bon vivant of cinema, I want to watch the film entire and proper.Therefore I only blink during scene transitions.Damn you Sam Mendez.I left the theatre with eyes so dry I required an emergency saline flush.How dare you."
1917,21 October 2021,9/10,"One of the best wartime movies ever made! The war isn't really the focus of the film so if you are looking for an action movie you may be disappointed - even though there is action, the characters are more interested in avoiding it to complete their mission as opposed to going in guns a blazing. The cinematography is fantastic, the score is brilliant and haunting and their is plenty of emotion packed into the story. Favourite scene is undoubtedly after Schofield regains consciousness in Écoust-Saint-Mein at night time to find the town in flames which he then has to navigate through rumble while flares overhead light up the area making him visible to sniper fire... It's a beautifully shot scene with breathtaking visuals and the score matches the emotional tone perfectly. It's actually one of my go-to scenes when showing off my cinema room projector. I highly recommend this film to everybody."
1917,15 June 2021,10/10,This movie was very good. It isn't slow at all like some army movies can be. I love the intricate details that pop in the movie every now and then. Very much so recommend.
1917,25 May 2021,10/10,"I cannot say this enough, 1917 is an AMAZING movie. The cinematography alone is 10/10, with the one continuous shot all the way through the movie. There's a good enough amount of little humor, mixed in with the hardships and tribulations of going into enemy territory, and heartfelt moments all the same. The acting is great and you can't help but be engulfed right into this film."
1917,30 May 2021,10/10,"In playing this movie, I had no idea what to expect, but I love a well done war film and this was exactly that. An absolutely incredible tribute to the fallen soldiers of the First World War."
1917,19 May 2020,10/10,Absolutely breathtaking movie! The way it is made and the story is told is genius.
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"An absolute masterpiece , stunning cinematography from start to finish ."
1917,23 January 2020,1/10,"This movie makes no sense. It is inspired by Lord of the rings where Frodo is given a task by the General and then he is helped on the way by prodigious characters.
The only difference is that Frodo dies and Samwise completes the task.
I have never seen a movie that challenges reason and common sense more than this one."
1917,1 January 2020,1/10,More boring then a soap opera. this movie put me in depresion. i have never seen a movie with no action like this one. its incredible how for the first time i felt like i lost 2 hours waiting for action that never came. only walking and chating. i feel like i have to wath saving private ryan. its the only way i can get out of the depresion this movie put me in to. so much money wasted on ww1 soap opera.
1917,13 January 2020,,"I can say with confidence that this is my favorite war movie and one of my favorite movies overall.I was worried that the way it's shot (to seem like it's all in one shot) would be little more than a gimmick, but it really brings you in to feel like you're there with the characters. You'll find yourself constantly looking past the characters to see if there is some danger that they aren't aware of, and you never get a chance to feel comfortable.With the movie essentially all one shot, I was worried that character development would suffer. I can say that you will become attached to the characters and really care about them. They become your war buddies and you will root for them to succeed.The cinematography left me in awe throughout this movie. There were multiple scenes that really stood out, but there is one where lights are coming randomly from different directions. That scene was so terrifyingly beautiful, which essentially this movie in a nutshell.If you're looking for a war movie with constant action and gun fights then this isn't the movie you're looking for. This will take you for a journey with all its ups and downs."
1917,22 April 2020,9/10,"1917 is synonym of Perfection, Hardwork and Dedication. What a cinematic experience. The whole movie is Filimed with concept of One Shot Movie and Oh boy they did a Splendid job or What ! The amount of reasearch done by the Director of Photography Mr. Roger Dekins is nothing short of ""Genius"". The Movie will keep you Engaged from the very Start till the Credits roll out. You will feel like you are literally living inside the movie the whole time thanks to the Mastercraftman Sam mendes. Waiting for More Movies like 1917 in Future."
1917,31 March 2020,10/10,"This movie is a class in every aspect; story telling, cinematography, writing and of course the acting performance. You won't be drawn away from screen for even a second. This is as gripping as it gets.
AWESOME Movie.. Just watch it!"
1917,2 February 2020,7/10,"Let me start by saying this is a very good movie, just not great, and I will try to explain my point of view...
I went to watch this movie with some high expectations, seeking a quality as good as ""Hacksaw Ridge (2016)"".
It was not reached.
The cinematic experience of a ""one shot"" movie that Sam Mendes tried to give made me, at some points, bored of it. There's a lot of unnecessary moments portrayed at the movie, such as going through the trenches, because Sam Mendes did not achieved a quality script to fill the 2h lenght of the movie.
Sam Mendes said in a interview that he wanted to give the experience of 2 ""real time"" hours, but the development of the story is clearly more than that.
I yawned while seeing at the cinema... And I was not tired.
The moments of suspense/ thriller/ action don't overcome the rest of the movie.
If I made a homage like this, I would like people to tell me the truth and not sympathize with it just because...
The acting was very good and I enjoyed that Sam Mendes didn't gave the main characters to Hollywood stars. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman made a great work
My honest rating for this movie is a 7.4."
1917,26 September 2020,8/10,This movie is just great. But it is just half as good as Saving private ryan.
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,A strong contender for Oscars. This is a story of great courage and sacrifice that soldiers make.The movie will keep you engaged and at the edge of your seat throughout the duration.
1917,3 May 2020,7/10,"1917 is obviously a masterpiece of technique. But the awesome single takes become exhausting -- how long can this wend and wind until it breaks? At least two ruptures give relief and punctuation, namely, the trip-wire explosion in the underground hospital and the blackout after being shot by the German sniper (others slip in unnoticed like enormously suspended continuity cuts, made invisible by a greater momentum of the scene). But ""relief"" points to a bizarre irony at work throughout this ambitious film. Those two moments of intensity create an opposite effect -- unrelenting movement is brought to rest, so the height of climax turns into, not anti-climax, but even more opposite -- into hiatus.Those fluid single takes have a broader opposite effect. World War I killed and maimed so many precisely because it was not fluid. Trench warfare was an unprecedented and lethal stalemate. Soldiers were trapped in trenches as surely as bodies on barbed wire. Giving two soldiers (and then one) two hours of movement contradicts the core experience.1917 creates bizarre ironic effects. Oddly, this epic about the horrors of war is an epic anesthetic. The corpses and ruins, even when they crescendo in climax scenes, combine to normalize rather than shock. After such a steady desensitization, the final field hospital sequence had the impact of a dustbin full of mannequins. This opposite effect is heightened by the preceding first wave attack. The field is conversely, perversely green, a relief for the eyes after all the mud and gore. The contrast is, of course, intended, but the freshness undercuts the trauma.Some of the viewing experience is superb, especially the tight point-of-view as the two soldiers climb the berm into No Man's Land. Also successful is a quick, efficient plant that gives an edge to the delivery of the letter -- a single comment that some commanders will ignore orders for the glory of a fight. That warning suspends the outcome until the very moment the colonel speaks. But these successes rub shoulders with odd misfires. The river sequence seems bizarre and make-believe (does Belgium have rapids and a waterfall? Is this the time to find out? Is this Revenant envy?). The flares in the nighttime in the ruined city create a circle of hell, but more for effect than credibility (as are the roaring flames of a building that would already be a shell with nothing left to burn). And milk in a pail in a ruined farm? This odd discovery prepares for the mother and baby later, who are themselves implausible but made-believe for emotional contrast. Contrast again overrides reason when the two soldiers chat pleasantly while approaching the ruined farm where an opposite tone will soon wreak its havoc. The cut hand gives us a truly grotesque, original moment when it penetrates a corpse, but the hand conveniently becomes uncut and immaterial when the narrative is finished with it. Notice too that the ""attack at dawn"" is nowhere near dawn; more important than coherence is a craving for clear and colorful cinematography. The daylight of the ending contradicts the fear of daylight at the start, as if the story is not listening to itself. None of these objections matter if you already are immersed in the film, but once you step outside the flow of the single takes, the missteps you see add up and matter.And what is the driving principle? Can dedication to a single goal make all this havoc turn from senselessness to sense? By the end, the main character has no helmet, no gun, no protection, stripped down to his will. We are asked to feel satisfied by his success at reaching the commander at the end of the dream. Granted, the film delivers an anti-war cynicism -- but it rests on a single throwaway line at the end. When the colonel orders the troops to ""stand down,"" he adds that another order will arrive next week saying to attack at dawn. Close to 1,600 soldiers have been saved -- to be sacrificed a bit later. The betrayal of humanity (writ large by World War I itself) is there, but it takes a sidekick role compared to the closure of the mission."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"This is the perfect movie! Well done Sam Mendes, crew and cast ...!!!"
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"I enjoyed this film so much i didn't want it to end, what a film..A MUST SEE."
1917,26 May 2020,5/10,"The visuals and sound were good. The plot was paper-thin however - very linear, with only one semi-compelling character."
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,Not on par with the best. Shot in an interesting style and overall enjoyable. I would have enjoyed a larger scale view.. ps... the most exciting moments you've already seen in the trailer.
1917,3 April 2020,2/10,"Nonsense movie, soulless characters, bad script, ridiculous and so unrealistic. Awful movie."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,"The cinematography was amazing, good story, slow build up. Acting was good as well"
1917,13 February 2020,,The direction is a bad copy. The characters too young and cold. A total deception. A big peace of marketing
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,"I'm sorry to buck the trend, but I was very disappointed by this. I found it a bit too fantastic. I don't doubt the story had an element of truth, but in filming it became a bit ridiculous. I also struggled with the video game style filming. Constant camera panning made me feel quite sick."
1917,14 February 2020,7/10,"Just want to start with saying the cinematography and visuals are amazing and the first 45 mins blew my mind.. but from there I found myself to become some what bored in the middle waiting for some action. This could be partly my fault though as I went in expecting, I guess, a more 'cliche' war film. Don't stress though, it finished strong."
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"The whole ""one shot"" aspect of this film is used in such a unique way, that from the very start of the film you feel connected to these characters. The suspense is thrilling, the emotion is deep, and the outcome is a beautiful take on a time in history not nearly reflected enough in film as much as it should be. The final frame blended with the beautiful score is a riveting and lasting takeaway."
1917,1 February 2020,7/10,Scenes of the ruined town in the night is impressive.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"Great character development, a story of courage, love, friendship, giving way to interpret different ends, totally recommended, great Movie."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"Every detail, every sound, every moment makes a big impact on your memories while watching."
1917,18 September 2020,9/10,"Although it's obviously impossible to be able to feel what it was like to be in the hell of World War I, 1917 allows the viewer to follow along with the characters almost as if you're in the trenches and on the battlefield - not as an actual participant in the battle, but rather as a nearby onlooker viewing in awe. A goal of the film does not seem to be to create an intricate plot weaving through the complexities of the Great War, but rather to evoke emotion to allow the viewer to become immersed and entwined in a simple story of survival. The long one shot scenes and highly technical chronologically organized set design never seem to feel like a gimmick but merely as a practical and required way to demonstrate the story in a genuine and authentic way. Nothing quite like it that I can recall."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Amazing cinematography and story telling! A gripping thriller as two ment start out on an improbable mission. I can't believe its one short movie, but the after watching it i felt like i live it so must be true."
1917,18 March 2020,5/10,"The film is technically fine, quite an eye candy to watch even. with all the tricks for suspense put to work. but at times, the plot just feels like black and white, good against evil war time propaganda. Every single german soldier displayed, is a literal personification of evil. A mindless drone for the enemy. The lack of reciprocity displayed of german soldiers is just absurd. I'm not buying any of that, and i'm from one of the countries who were on the Allied side.
Come on, the last war against Germany has ended 70 years ago, you dont need to fabricate anger against your former enemy anymore."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,Let's take a look behind the scenes of a bloody disaster on all fronts. Pacifists be damned these Germans were up to no good and needed a good hard spanking. Ooo la la. NO.Now he's my take. My grandfather and my grandfather fought and died in WWI and II. End of story stay out of our business.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Have played numerous games based on WW1. This is was the first time I felt deeply how futile war is. The emotion,the craziness, the hysteria and the sorrows of war. This movie captures war in its true entirety. I expected something like this from Dunkirk but kudos to Sam Mendes you have out done everyone. Easily the best movie of the year."
1917,11 April 2020,10/10,"10/10 for story, 10/10 for cinematography, 10/10 for direction, 10/10 for casting, 10/10 for acting, 10/10 for all other things which are measured in movies!!!Whether you are a Trump fan or hater, when he criticized the Academy for their choice regarding best picture, it was justified as hell, this should had won!!!
Not saying the winner was a bad movie, but it is not even close to the quality of this one."
1917,1 January 2020,1/10,Waste of time. Wait until it hits the redbox if you must see it.
1917,25 November 2020,4/10,"You'd think that these long shots would make the film more realistic and immersive, but for me, it does the exact opposite.You can't have a 2-hour timespan and a main character who covers no more than a few hundred meters of ground, while still mashing in a hundred unbelievable and life-changing events. Yet, that's what they did and the result is a pacing and a set that always feels incredibly 'off'.I don't like the acting performance either, but I don't want to blame that on the actors themselves, but rather the writing. There's no way to give a believable performance when you've got a script that doesn't allow for any pause or moments of consideration. It all falls very flat if you ask me. Giving each act no more than 5 minutes of stage time might work well at a circus, but it's a poor way of making a movie.The next time you need to deliver a message across a short field, just use a megaphone. This way of filmmaking would do a million times better if the film was far less eventful and gave more room for dialogue."
1917,30 January 2020,6/10,"But how can this film be nominated for an Oscar? But is it an adventure film (however boring adventure) or is it a war movie?
I really cannot understand people giving rate of 10."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"Best movie of 2019 hands down and one of the greatest movies of war ever!
In fact, it's one of a kind movie experience of war.The way Mendes conducts the movie make you feel lonely when the caracter is lonely, in danger when the caracter is in danger, sad when he is sad, and so on.
Nowadays, when directors and producers confuse a great movie experience with 3D and tons of CGI, Mendes shows all of us that there is nothing more imersive than a good and thoughtful storytelling."
1917,8 February 2020,2/10,"This film has been given great reviews but personally I don´t get it.Sure, the settings feel very genuine and the acting is good I guess but the story is really thin and if this move turns out to win an Oscar for best movie then it has truly been a slow year in terms of quality films being released..."
1917,2 January 2021,6/10,"I watched this movie and was thoroughly fascinated by the cinematography. Absolutely excellent.
But.... There is one massive plothole that just doesn't make any sense. Our two protagonists have to deliver an important message over no mans land, going through German trenches, that they have no idea if they are occupied or not, to deliver a message to a different battalion 9 miles away. They eventually reach a farmhouse, which we assume is behind the German lines since our two protagonists had to go through a German trench system to get to. Ensuing scuffle with German pilot and Blake dies.
Now this is where it starts to make no sense.
A British Army truck then picks Schofield up.
Ok, where did this truck come from?? We have every reason to believe that the farmhouse is behind German lines, so how did this truck full of British soldiers cross the German trenches to get to the farmhouse???
And if it was that easy for the truck to get there them what was the point of out two protagonists crossing no mans land and going through the German trenches when they could have arrived at the same location, the farmhouse, by jumping on a truck and not putting them selves in danger by crossing the German trenches, which they didn't know were unoccupied.
The frontline in France in 1917 was quite static and trenches stretched pretty much from the Swiss border to the English Channel. So how did this truck just manage to drive through German trenches when our two protagonists had to duck and dive through no man's land.
And that comes to the biggest plothole that makes the whole story absolutely pointless and unrealistic.
Why would two British soldiers have to cross German occupied territory to get a message to a different battalion in the same army that is manning the same front line only 9 miles away.
Is this battalion cut off?? We are told this in the movie. With the trench lines as they were in the First world war, why wouldn't they just deliver the message to the other battalion by going behind their own lines, in much more safety, to deliver this important message.
I enjoyed the movie but the plotholes really make me question the validity of the writers.
I read a review that this is a war movie for the Marvel generation, which I truly believe that it is. A script that has more holes in it than Swiss cheese just like every superhero movie that bombards our screens.
And that's my main beef with this movie. The means the mission was carried out by the two soldiers was absolutely pointless, which is evidently seen by the whole truck part in the movie.
If the movie had a script that actually made sense it would be an 8 or a 9 out of 10. But unfortunately the lack of realism In the soldiers mission really killed it for me."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,.when a movie becomes art. Simple yet amazing. The camera work is unbelievable. A must see on the big screen. So don't wait for it to appear on Netflix.
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"Words can't describe the sheer brilliance of this film. The plot, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the music, the set and costume design and the technical and visual feat of it appearing all as a one shot film that takes you along on the journey with the two main characters.Sam Mendez and DP Roger Deakins are true masters of the art and have really helped reignite my passion for filmmaking. I have viewed this film twice in the past week in the cinema, and can't recommend it more.The film really portrays the sheer amount of devastation, pain and sorrow of World War 1. The attention to detail in every frame is staggering, from harrowing views of the deceased to the huge film sets that really immerse you in the story, taking you on a journey with the film's two main protagonists.I don't want to give too much away, but all I can say is that it left me with a tear in my eye both times at the end and I have never seen a cinema so packed, yet so quiet at the end of a film before, when the final slate fades on at the end.A truly cinematic masterpiece.A must see film for anyone who wants to see what it was truly like to experience the horrors of World War 1."
1917,21 March 2020,10/10,"I really need to see how on earth they made such a masterpiece.
After being on a few movie sets as an extra, I'm just in awe at this movie.I really hope they had someone doing a film of the film being made."
1917,16 May 2020,9/10,"Incredibly immersive movie that manifests the trench warfare of World War 1 from a more personal perspective of two British soldiers that set on a dangerous journey across hostile areas. The excellent acting, visual effects, music, and camera work are key to a more immersive portrayal of the movie."
1917,13 January 2021,10/10,"For me this movie will remain best of the best. In the beginning is kinda weird because of the video but wait for the next 10-15 minutes, you won't even eat food until the end"
1917,26 January 2020,4/10,Walking. Talking. Walking more. Shot like one continuous line so the parts in between the boring and less boring parts are just walking in silence. Characters weren't memorable or had any depth. Story was ant-climactic and and not worth sitting through. Waste. Of. Time.
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"Just been to see 1917 ... wow !!!Loved everything about it from start to finish.The single take non stop action, the ever changing scenes, the amazing sets, the innovative cinematic skills & brilliant lighting, the detailed costumes, the acting, the cameos, the tension, the story, the feeling of immersion, the tragedy, the scale of it, the ambition, the imagination, the sounds, the music, even the titles are worth an Oscar.More of the same please Mr. Mendes & co."
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"First off i actually can't believe the people rating this 1 star. they shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a movie review as they are clearly clinically insane.This movie isn't Saving Private Ryan, nor is it expected to be.. so please don't go into this movie expecting the same level of action, gore etc. There are parts that are quiet, this is a realistic take on war.. its not all gun fights and explosions from start to end.. this a take on the every-man and the brotherhood they form, it is a masterpiece in its own way.. a truly suspenseful thrill ride, that leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It's what Dunkirk should have been.Visually this film is one of the best i have ever seen. Roger Deakins best work to date as a cinematographer, if he doesn't win the Oscar for a second time for this then the awards are rigged.the story doesn't suffer for the sake of the one shot film direction, it is an emotional roller coaster with some superb acting, especially George Mackay who shines in this movie.Please go into this movie open minded, and watch it in a theatre on the big screen. the only way this masterpiece should be experienced. the visuals, the score, the performances were outstanding.. Best Movie I've seen in so many years.. What an experience !"
1917,25 April 2020,1/10,"The brief synopsis of my review is that if this is remotely based on stories from his Granddad, then his Granddad is the Prince of Liars.Or Sam Mendes made them into lies beyond belief.There is so much historically wrong with this movie, that it would be quicker to list what was right.From the fact that 1917 was a year of static warfare until Cambrai; from the fact that in the supposed front line trench in the intro scenes, no-one - literally no-one is keeping a lookout, until we get to the General's dugout; from the fact that never, ever, ever on the western front did troops move into no man's land in a convoy of trucks! from the fact that Colonels in WW1 would never have taken independent offensive action on the Western front; from the fact that nowhere in the British sector of Somme, Picardy or the Calais region would you ever find a white water rapid! The whole film is a tissue of lies wrapped around falsehoods boxed in a laughably comic deceit that a Corporal is going to rush through no man's land in 1917!Utter nonsense form start to finish. and that's before you get to the non existent character development, the poor acting and the lame script.Without a doubt the very worst war movie I have ever seen."
1917,21 March 2020,7/10,"Maybe it's all the buzz that this was the co-frontrunner for the Oscar, but I was merely entertained. Yes, it does convey the loss and futility of war. And if you just want an educational film that gives you ""the feels"", this is great.But the story was very ordinary. I give it a 9 for execution and a six for the story."
1917,10 July 2020,8/10,"The running scenes reminded me so much of the amazing 2012 Japanese/Korean WW2 movie My Way.
Anyone else?"
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"This movie gets a 10 just because they pulled it off. A single shot (real or apparent doesn't matter) really goes a long way into pulling the viewer into the movie, and this movie does exactly that. The story is a bit light, for sure, and it takes liberties with realism, for sure, but they are more than made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and stunning sound & music.Quick note: In the country I'm from, every theater screening has an intermission, which does real harm to the audience's enjoyment of this movie (it especially harmed mine). AVOID INTERMISSIONS IF POSSIBLE."
1917,15 January 2020,5/10,"I was looking forward to this movie for a very long time. Within the first few minutes I was disappointed, because if something so important needed to be told to the front line a.) they could have sent a plane to the front line b.) if that wasn't an option they definitely wouldn't have only sent two low ranking soldiers without any protection to save 1,600 men. With that said, I was able to look past that for a while because the camera work was very cool. Eventually though it became ridiculous. Why would you pull an enemy pilot out of a plane that was shot down by your allies, and if you felt compelled to do so, why would you act like he's your long lost pal, and then act surprised that you end up getting stabbed by him. Whoops that means now the only other soldier with this extremely important message becomes immortal. The Germans can't shoot anymore, and after watching the German pilot kill his friend he thinks telling another not to scream would work. There are other things in this film that annoy me, but these are just unforgivable. Maybe mendes should have consulted with actual military experts to find out more plausible plot points. Still the camera shots were very cool. That's about it."
1917,5 February 2020,7/10,"Overrated, boring and not worth for the bes motion picture, that's for sure. Dunno what people are pining about."
1917,14 January 2020,6/10,"Suffering through the agony of the seemingly-impossible mission, albeit spectacular cinematography, at the end it seems that the whole thing could have been avoided by using an aeroplane to drop the critical order at the front lines."
1917,3 April 2020,8/10,Great movie. Seems like only one take but of course it's impossible and when the camera is close to objects or buildings there's a cut. Extraordinary direction. Good actors. There are some errors
1917,11 January 2020,8/10,"What a wonderfully crafted film! It was intense and engaging the whole time, with moments of fast paced action sprinkled throughout which really got the heart racing.Despite knowing very little about the two main characters, their realistic acting makes you care and worry for them. The one shot technique keeps you beside them and makes you feel like you're there with them.However my only gripe with the film is that it does slow down a bit too much once or twice. Thankfully this barely took away from the experience.Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of saving private Ryan or hacksaw ridge (for me at least), it is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and an amazing ride! Definitely go watch it."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Wonderful film, with great director and cinematography, more than wonderful, I advise everyone to watch it."
1917,28 November 2020,5/10,"Lots of scenes just feel over the top, un-real or impossible coincidences. Lots of guys have rated it too high, even higher than great war movies like Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse now. 1917 is no where near those."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,The cinematography alone is the reason to watch this. But the acting! The 2 main boys are amazing. I was amazed. I recommend this. And that's coming from someone that doesnt really care for war movies
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"It's not often, once every decade or two, that Hollywood produces something so extraordinary it'll last for ages. This is one of those films. I was constantly reminded of Lawrence of Arabia by the cinematography, acting and direction. There may be a flaw in this film, but I couldn't find one. Like Lawrence of Arabia, it's best appreciated on the big screen."
1917,29 February 2020,10/10,"Everything about this movie is top notch. The acting, story line, visual effects, and cinematography all come together to create a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat!"
1917,24 February 2020,9/10,"Brilliant, visceral and poingnant. An exceptional film from start to finish."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"I haven't felt this shook from a war movie (or any movie) in quite sometime. What a feat of cinematography, set production, directing etc etc etc. A perfectly lean story masterfully executed. All the thumbs way up"
1917,28 October 2020,7/10,"The reason why I give this movie a 7 is because the editing and camera work in thid movie is outstanding. Tho I have to say the consistent camera turning gets annoying sometimes.However it is a shame the story is bad. The story is as plain as it can get. The events that happens feel really ""scripted"" in a way that you think it can only happen in movies. And that really ruins the experience for me.It could have been a masterpiece if the story was written with more care. So the camera and editing work really carried the movie to his fame.Editing/Camera: 10/10
Story: 4/10"
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,This is an amazing film and wonderfully technically to do as continuous elements.
1917,21 December 2020,10/10,What a movie it is.....u can't keep your eyes off during the whole movie... amazing movie...
1917,28 November 2020,6/10,Let me state it at upfront I am not a big fan of war movies. However I decided to watch it thanks to the hype around it. After watching I realised it wasn't worth it.
1917,25 January 2020,2/10,"Sam Mendes again. Great production, set design amazing...go the poor folk who built it. But not great. Quite a boring movie actually, but kudos to all that worked on another Mendes movie. Mendes! Your film accolades are commercial only. Enjoy ur Oscars"
1917,4 February 2020,1/10,Bla Bla Bla there is no story ... no action .. very stupid scenario and bad acting ..
1917,16 January 2020,1/10,This is the worst movie I've seen since that crappy comedy movie about North Korea. I think the same people who gave high ratings to that movie rated this movie. Basically it's about to guys running through a field for 2 hours. And one of them dies the most stupid way possible. GREAT STORYLINE!
1917,5 February 2020,9/10,"This is art. Great actors, great directing and great cinematography."
1917,17 January 2020,1/10,Sorry. Me and my brother said this movie was boring for us.
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"Movie was keeping me on its grip from
the very start. Most intense and adrenalin pumping movie I have seen in a while. Any how, there was two (note, ONLY two) scenes that felt unnecessary character building attempts."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"This is one of the finest examples of great cinema I've seen in years, the film is simply brilliant - well acted , well shot, and genius direction from Sam Menndes and another fine soundtrack from Thomas Newman."
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"One of the first movies in a long time to keep me on the edge of my seat for its entirety. Cinemetography is amazing, story is gripping and acting is superb. Highly recommend!"
1917,8 February 2020,9/10,"Sam Mendes' brilliant war epic, 1917, shows us the horrors which so many young men went through in the darkest days of the First World War. It also hints at the rare melancholic beauty of war, with scenes such as a soldier singing the American folk song (The Wayfairing Stranger) as his brothers in arms sit around him listening with intent. The way Mendes masterfully presents the contrasts of war to us signifies a director on the top of his game.The plot is relatively simple and is loosely based on stories from Sam Mendes' grandfather's own experiences of the First World War. Two soldiers, superbly played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are assigned to deliver a message behind enemy lines. It will stop 1,600 men, including one of the soldier's brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. The film puts you in mind of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers (2001), and even Peter Jackson's First World War documentary They Shall Not Grow Old (2018). However none of them delivers the sense of urgency and hopelessness which 1917 exudes.Interestingly, the film is told in real time through a sequence of long takes. Mendes isn't new to the one shot idea, as shown in the opening sequence to 2015's Spectre, but he has never done it for a whole feature length film before. While there are masks and cuts if you look hard enough, this does not subtract from the feeling of urgency at all, in fact it heightens it. There are other films that play with the one shot formal such as Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) and Victoria (2015) that arguably deal with relationships and characters more effectively. Technically, however, 1917 is something quite unique. What makes it remarkable is the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, who creates a beautiful ballet with the camera, putting the audience into the shoes of the soldiers. This technique can get a bit distracting at points, nonetheless it generates images and emotions which you wouldn't be able to achieve with multiple shots. For example, there is one shot where one of the characters is running through some ruins while flares go up all around him. In this sequence the lighting and camera work combine to make something truly breathtaking, and is the stuff that dreams (or nightmares) are made of.The film is carried throughout by its two leads. Both Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are utterly mesmerising, and MacKay in particular gives a performance of a career, and is completely believable in the role. It is a wonder why neither of them were nominated at this year's Oscars. There are also numerous big name actors who appear in minor roles throughout the film, such as Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, but they just act as seasoning which punctuates the overall narrative. That is not to disregard their contribution; Andrew Scott gives a perfectly dry and callous performance as a cynical Lieutenant, while Colin Firth gives a solid matter of fact performance as General Erinmore. It is all credit to the filmmakers' ingenuity for not making these cameos feel out of place or unduly dominate their respective scenes.The tale of love, loyalty and friendship that Mendes presents to us is something which everyone should bear witness to. It acts as a reminder of what those brave young men sacrificed. 1917 is worthy of all the praise given to it."
1917,27 May 2020,10/10,"I can continue to write endlessly about this masterpiece, but keeping it short. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1917,11 May 2020,7/10,"The most redeeming quality was directing/cinematography. That alone made it an amazing film. Acting was faultless too. Loved all the high profile people and their subtle roles. The story was amazing and felt so real, which I think was the goal. I think the point of the movie was to show war in real light rather than the spotlight of entertainment. To show how terrible it is. And if that was the goal they accomplished it. Beautiful scenes and story just not the most entertaining."
1917,17 March 2020,5/10,This was boring eventless movie. its just just an episode of a documetary
1917,14 August 2020,6/10,"Like everyone says, yes it was a beautifully shot film. Other than that, eh. The acting is terrible. These are the most forgettable characters of any blockbuster war film i remember. Not only is the plot boring, it goes from A to Z in the blink of an eye. I hate having to use the word ""boring"" to describe a film because normally that is too bleak of an explanation, but for this film, it is perfect. Will not be watching again. If war films such as Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Thin Red Line just among some didnt win best picture, i was very very relieved this one didnt."
1917,17 January 2020,6/10,"I have watched the movie ""1917"" @ cinema last night and here is my review
1. The movie is poor in Drama scenes which make you live the journey with two soldiers and suffer with them. I didn't suffer , i didn't feel sorry for anyone dying. Director doesnt push to feel pain while watching in war scenes he tried but not too much.2. A lot of talking scenes and i dont mind with that btw but those scenes should be perfect with well script writing & acting but this didnt happen.
3. Silly scenes while soldier runs away from germans to deliver a message and silly way the soldier died.4. Director tried to show his skills in camera , photograph & picture and made it but not affect with Drama which must be the main goal for movie as mentioned in point numbet 1 ."
1917,15 January 2020,2/10,"Tell the truth ....is a bored movie... Saving private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, Peloton and Rambo jajaja better"
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Gripping, visceral, engrossing, and absolutely captivating are all words that I would use to describe this masterfully created work of art. This is a movie that has both atmosphere and action, a combination that pulls you in and makes you forget about who, where, and what you are for the entire duration. War films have been done to death but 1917 brings something new to the table with its spectacle of one-shot cinematics. I counted a total of three times where they used intelligent transitions to make the story flow.Well worth your time, if not to experience the war but rather to experience the art of the directors vision. 9/10"
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"Simply magnificent. There is no other description for it. From the acting, to the cinematography, to the sound, this film is a masterpiece. People are comparing it to Saving Private Ryan, but trust me, this film stands all on its own. Watch it in IMAX and be blown away."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"1917 takes a familiar storytelling approach to the calamity of the western front. Send a couple of fictional characters into a real world event and follow them around. We are introduced to two honest British tommies and literally follow them, without a break, through the crucial details of the conflict. There is no mistaking the intention of the film as memoriam to the men who fought in the war. Mendes dedicates the film to a family member who was there and wants us to remember what happened. The film does not raise the question of how or why. It seeks only to examine the what of it, for this is the only bandwidth available to any Private or Lance Corporal in war.The plot is basic. Two Lance Corporals are sent into hostile territory to call off a doomed attack. The film is structured into 6 set pieces (excluding exposition and coda). Each is their own short story that could be played in any order.Following our two NCOs through the desolation of no man's land, the horrors are impressionistic. We barely notice dead bodies camouflaged in muck. A few misty tree trunks imply the ground was partly forested before being pounded to mud. Further in, we see churned up humanity left to the vermin. In the opposition trenches the German resources are noticeably superior to the Brits. The Brits have sandbags and corrugated iron lining their trenches whilst the Germans have concrete walls. The Brit dugouts are small and dark, whilst the Germans are billeted in underground barracks. And this is the position the Germans have abandoned for far superior defences! The Germans are better trained too. A key facet of the film is the contrast between naive British soldiering and the ruthlessness of the German men. Time and again Schofield is caught out by more decisive counterparts. The key moment in the film occurs whilst demonstrating mercy to an injured German pilot. They do what any decent civilian would have done, but these are not civilians and it does not end well.Must Schofield sacrifice his sense of humanity and decency to be a better soldier? The film's answer is resoundingly no. Following a near fatal exchange of rifle fire with a sniper, Schofield does not fire a single other shot, despite opportunities (and dire need) to do so. It may be the case that he has simply run out of ammo but this is not explicitly shown, so it is left to your own judgement what motivates his reticence. His only other kill is by strangulation, but this is clear cut survival.In a hellish sequence, surrounded by fire and smoke, we meet the only civilian and only woman in the story. A sort of good witch offering safe harbour from a sea of horror. She patches up the wounded man and tries to keep him safe from the outside world. He leaves. A safe harbour is no place for a solider anymore than the burning town is any place for a civilian.The most moving sequence has an eerie feel reminiscent of Tarkovsky or 'Come and See'. After a horrifying scramble over bodies of dead civilians, we hear ethereal singing coming from the woods. Through the trees we see hundreds of faceless men listening to a human voice singing a folk hymn. Here is the lost generation. The millions that left and didn't come home. Their very absence from Britain immeasurably changed its future in unknown ways. Deakins' camera wheels around slowly to reveal some of the faces. Here are teenage boys transfixed by the last moment of human produced beauty they will ever witness. As soon as the singing stops, they wake from the dream and return to human produced terror. We go with them, desperate to call a halt.In the end the officer in command sees no hope for these men. If they are not sacrificed today, they will be next week. It doesn't really make any difference, we will simply follow orders. The irony is that deferentially following orders is what put everyone in these trenches in the first place. New orders might save them today but aren't going to save them in the long run.One technical quibble. By necessity the artillery explosions in the final charge are CGI'd into the scene but they cross the eyeline where Schofield is running and this takes us out of the picture. We lose the very 'you are there' essence of the film up to that point. Nevertheless, expect to see the peerless Roger Deakins pick up his second Oscar on a technically challenging production and even in a strong field for Best Picture, you wouldn't bet against this."
1917,10 July 2020,9/10,"While the script itself is amazing with great storytelling, the one shot try is one of its kind. Amazing cinematography. Hats off."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Great story told in the way real movies art to be filmed. Great sound track, and acting."
1917,31 March 2020,7/10,"Incredible cinematography, Roger Deakins is a god.
Incredible work by Sam Mendes, the one shot idea is clearly the heart of the movie.
BUT
On a personal level, I did not feel as much involved as I hoped I would, all the plot twists were predictable so I was not able to empathize too much with the lead character.
As far as war movies are concerned, there are many better ones."
1917,2 April 2020,2/10,"How was movie not panned right out of jump street? Mendez forces dramatic, impulsive, and out of place behaviors on his characters that casts any semblance of verisimilitude into the trash heap! Why couldn't he have developed the story with characters that bore some kind of resemblance to how actual 1917 era British army infantry soldiers would have carried themselves? We're supposed to believe that Blake - selected for smarts, and practical map reading, all the while driven to save his brother, would have cast that all aside when he pulled the German pilot from the crash only to then drop his guard whilst the burned, bone fractured, German pilot managed to get the drop on him?An aside, is anti-German bias so powerful in 2019, that Mendes had to depict the same badly injured German pilot just rescued from a fiery death by Blake, as being so stupid, callous, and evil, that he would have forsaken every gut instinct in him to provoke the very men who saved him from fire, but instead stab the very man who pulled him out of the fire only to then be predictably shot by the other soldier?Next, Schofield Encounters other British soldiers while he attempts to save or at least be present while his dead friend lies on the ground yet nobody - not least the British officer or any of the soldiers, nor later on Blake's own brother - ever asks about the circumstances of his dying? Hullo! A British officer comes upon Schofield holding the freshly stabbed Blake but has zero curiosity as to how that would've occurred followig after a German plane crash?Schofield's character then can't can't have any consistency as Mendes dramatically depicts him like Hamlet on stage in that town scene with the fires where Schofield forgets he's even on a battlefield watching as the German soldier run towards him, yet he freezes in a bizarre upright stance as if shrieking to the audience ""I'm actually a pacifist how did I get here?"" It's all Hollywood or Pinewood as he strangely escapes from being hit by under the glaring lights of illumination flares, with so many Germans firing at him. OK ""scenejump"" to the basement where he morphs again but with unbelievable dramatic pause into a dude version of mother Theresa helping the Belgian or French lady and her baby - oblivious to his entire mission. After the strange waterfall jump on otherwise flat terrain around Arrass, and subsequently wandering into a group of soldiers listening to a perfectly sung hymn, we're now supposed to accept that Scofield again morphs this time into a passive bot wasting hours leaning up against a tree but not sleeping!At this point it's all copycat Saving Private Ryan and some other movies where the protagonist leaps into his apex mission moment but stupidly selects the very words that best self-obstruct his own mission. Instead of ""Urgent dispatch from General Elsinore"", it's ""stop this attack, stop this attack"" in an homage to future woke scolds. Oh my gosh when will this movie ever end!PS Cinematography was superb!"
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"Dont get me wrong, I dont feel like Mr Mendes Stole elements from Dunkirk but he enhanced the idea of telling a visual story with almost no dialogues. This is great storytelling folks, you know that when you forget there are only two cuts in the movie and thats why you barely breath trough the mains character's odissey."
1917,1 July 2020,9/10,I knew the lead character had to deliver a message and its trick was the apparent one shot beforehand. Admittedly I occasionally was wondering more how they were going to achieve the shot but generally the way it was filmed makes you feel like you are there with them.my fiance cant do suspend disbelief and pointed out a couple of small things but otherwise she paid attention which is unusual.its not the best war film ever but not far off
1917,28 March 2020,5/10,"Let's be brutally honest. With the massive decline, nay, erradication of masculinity in the west there really are no actual competent adult script writers left in the movie industry and boy does this film continue exposing that lossbecause i want to avoid spoilers i will limit my criticism to broad details like this film is only loosely based on WW1, there is no tension, there is only a smidgen of character development despite there being only two main characters.So why the rave reviews? Visual and cinematography, unlike script writers, clearly still hires competent people rather than diverse ones. Speaking of diversity, this film has it everywhere it can (except among the evil white male villain Germans.)
Go watch the documentary, They shall not grow old, and you'll realize that this film like most modern films is utterly racist about Europeans.Meh , forgettable film that very few will bother to watch more than once."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,The best movie best realistic movie from that time is mesmerising me!!
1917,14 March 2020,10/10,"A truly amazing cinematic experience, left me speechless could'nt even eat my popcorn. If you have not seen it in a cinema i recommend you go rewatch it's worth it.The soundtrack is easily the best i've ever heard in movies, absolute masterpiece shame it didn't win an oscar.Cinematography. extremely innovative and masterfully executed, this will certainly influence many films from now on.People say the story is thin, i believe that's how it was supposed to be, after all their mission is not that important or crucial, considering the whole picture of WW1, a disaster from all points of view. This is the harsh truth the story tries to tell, we are all pawns in the end and our actions and emotions mean so little when comparing ourselves to the universe."
1917,26 January 2020,1/10,Stay away from this junk of a film and save your money and 2 hours. I have never seen such an implausible wannabe action-fantasy in my life pretending to be a war film. It can only be a war film for the video game and marvel generation. A poor person's WW1 film. Watch Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' instead - a real masterpiece verses this pile of garbage from an overrated filmmaker.
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,This movie is just amazing it's January and I think this is my film of the year. The cat and crew deserve massive praise for a job really well done
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,Just i can say that it is the best cinematography Oscar next winner..dont listen to those who are sayying it is boring or long movie as it is one of the most marvelous war film i ve ever watched.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"This is a movie that should be seen by young and old. Brilliantly written and directed by Sam Mendes and the acting was superb.
There is nothing negative to say about this film at all - we loved it including the beautiful music and filming throughout."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,Best film I've seen in a very long time. Alot of work has gone into this film and the cinematography is world class.
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"Since the movie is shot in ""one take"" and very close to the scenes, it seems that who is watching is right there with the actors. I really liked it!"
1917,16 January 2020,5/10,"This film is the most realistic depiction of the horrors of the trench warfare of WWI that you will ever see. I can't imagine it ever being surpassed. The sets were just amazing. What a shame to waste it all of such a boring and irritating script.There were just so many plot points that struck us as absurd and unrealistic. The frequent occasions when you found yourself thinking ""Well that's stupid"" or ""That would never happen"" kept you from being fully involved with the film. Surely the Generals in command would not have trusted this mission to just two grunts. A squad could travel as quickly as a pair, and would have allowed them to include at least one experienced non-com who could make better choices. And the choices made by the two soldiers were so unbelievable. Like entering the German tunnels as a way to get to their destination. That's just insane. And the recovery of the one who was buried in rubble and the explosion was dramatic, but unrealistic. And once back in the open they come across a farm house and say they need to check if it is abandoned. Why? If your mission is so important just go around it. Then when the German plane crashes into the shed at the farm why would they risk their lives to rescue the pilot? They've been cursing the damn Germans since the tunnel explosion, so it would be more likely for them to run up and shoot the pilot, not rescue him. Then the endless scene with the French girl and the baby. And on and on.And just a comment about the ""one shot"" technique. At first it is captivating, and heightens the realism of being in the trench. But after the novelty wears off you find yourself frustrated with the slow pace of the action that is forced upon you by being stuck in real time. A blend of ""one shot"" and traditional editing would have improved things.Most people seemed to enjoy it, so you probably will too. But my advice is to wait for the DVD so you can make good use of the fast forward feature."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"1917 is special. In this, two soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to stop an attack on the other side of their line. This movie is more than just a war movie, it's a journey. It captures the terrifying and realistic moments of war in horrifyingly beautiful cinematography. One of the best ways it does this is in the way it is shot. The entire movie is made and edited to seem as one long take. You'll hardly ever see a cut away or anything close, and it matters. It makes you feel like you're there, you're in the trenches with them. You're dodging bullets and holding your breath with them. The entire film doesn't hold a thing back. Whether it be the gruesome casualties or the emotional content within it. The acting is phenomenal. I can't put to words how much is portrayed on their faces in such subtle ways. The co-writer and director of this movie has a grandfather who is mentioned in the credits of this movie because the movie was made for him and the stories he told. This of course doesn't mean it's a true story, but it makes it feel just so much more real. I was blown away by this movie in a way I didn't expect to be when I came in. If you like war movies or just want an emotional rollercoaster of a film, then this is one of the best. I highly recommend it to everyone who can get their tickets into a rated R movie. 10/10. This one is sticking with me."
1917,4 January 2020,8/10,"**Spoilers**
It's a beautiful visual experience but with a predictable screenplay. Germans are the bad guys the main character save the day. I wanted something different!"
1917,23 May 2020,6/10,Started off so well with both story and visually but then just went down hill from there. Scenes set were very good and almost felt like you were there. But as the movie went along just felt rushed and unrealistic.
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,Watch this movie. Every scene was just so visually fantastic.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Every warfilm that gets released people instantly jump on the ""cliche"" band wagon. War is war and always will be so ofcourse there will be similarities so just get over it..
I'm a huge warfilm buff and being in the military I see more things in war movies that annoy me than an regular person but I dont let them reuin the entertainment side.
If you dont want a cliche dont watch a war film simple.
Back to the topic, 1917 is epic.
Totally gripping through the entire movie it blew my mind. It truly was a techincal mastepeice and deserves every acolade it gets.
Cannot wait fir 4k with an atmos mix!"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Wow, just wow!
Saw this film last night and I've been raving about it since. It is so unique in the way it has been shot, seemingly as one continuous shot so you really feel as though you are in the trenches with the characters. It is incredibly emotionally and I was on the verge of tears several times. I also jumped several times during some very tense moments. The cameos from several famous British faces are not distracting as some critics have claimed and you feel mild relief during these moments as if you have seen a familiar face.
The two leads are very good but it is the outstanding direction that makes this the best war film I've seen. The set pieces are almost beautiful at times (strange to say about a war film I know). There are two sequences in particular that my mouth dropped open watching for the visual effects alone.
I could not recommend this more and it certainly deserves the awards it is getting."
1917,15 January 2020,4/10,"The acting from the main character George MacKay (William Schofield) was brilliant and the way this film was shot was fantastic, but overall I was bored and waiting for the end. To deliver a message from one location to another avoiding obstacles and being shot. That sums it up for me.I can appreciate the horrors of war and that part makes it a worthwhile watch in the hope we could learn from it. The scenery, costumes and amount of extras needed are unimaginable. Firth and Cumberbatch only in it for a few sentences and that's it!!Wouldn't watch it again but glad I have seen it. Not exactly entertaining for me though but I can tick it off this years list."
1917,10 May 2020,8/10,"1600 British soldiers in two battalions are being steered into a trap set by the Germans in World War I. Their only hope is a pair of British soldiers assigned the impossible mission to deliver a warning about this impending disaster. To raise the stakes even higher, one of the soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) has his older brother in the 2nd Devon - the first battalion scheduled to charge the Germans the next morning. Fueled by his personal agenda, Blake takes Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) along on this harrowing journey across no man's land into enemy territory.
Brilliantly shot and edited to appear as a single take, every camera movement is intelligent and serves a purpose as the mission unfolds, because the edits are camouflaged behind them, combined with precise blocking. But well beyond the ingenuity of the one-take shot, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is reflected in the performances as well, with both leads swapping the narrative focus from each other in meticulously planned storytelling beats. The performances of the two young leads Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are engaging, as facets of their otherwise ordinary personalities come through. The mission is the key focus as the two soldiers make their way through increasingly dangerous situations. Along the way, they encounter key army personnel, played by a cameo row of British actors, including Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden who put in brief, but impressive performances.
The cinematography by Roger Deakins is mesmerising, choreographed and executed to perfection around the horrific elements of war. Some of the frames are visually breathtaking, and demand to be revisited to absorb everything they have to offer. Thomas Newman's score escalates the experience to soaring heights. This film could easily sweep up all the technical awards at the Oscars this year. All these factors firmly put director Sam Mendes in the upper echelon of directors currently working today, if he wasn't there already. '1917' is tense, captivating, meticulous, horrifying and stirring - an exceptional achievement in filmmaking."
1917,20 January 2020,1/10,"Well, my first review... this is a ps6 game without gaming.... are you joking?
Then they tryed to loop it lol, oh boy... best regards and play the game even if urnt playing it."
1917,1 May 2020,10/10,"It's just that one question. The rest is history. You watch and decide yourself. Not only the best movie of 2019, it's the best movie in last couple of decades. Parasite doesn't even stand anywhere near this epic."
1917,13 March 2020,5/10,"1917 is a really beautiful, well produced movie.
The illogical elements in the story just ruined it to me:
1) Why to send only one duo of soldiers to such an important mission
2) In the middle of the movie the protagonist meets a group of fellow soldiers, but does not ask or receive help from them, but continues alone.A simple risk analyses would say that this is absolutely moronic. Any military leader with more than 2 brain cells would have either let those scout planes (seen in the movie) to carry the message to the front or to send multiple teams to deliver this important message. Also it is non-sense that the allies in the middle of the movie would not have send soldiers to assist our protagonist to increase the chances for the mission to succeed.5/10. I hate nonsense stupidity in plots."
1917,5 July 2020,7/10,"Overall I really enjoyed this film. It was tense and emotional. The long take trench scenes were amazing and so was George Mackay's acting. But I couldn't help feeling the use of long shots outside of the trenches were not really adding to the story. I'm fact they made the film less realistic. Events became far to convienient and scripted. It destroyed any feeling of distance travelled. Then there was the cliché dumb soldiers missing every shot on our main character making him look like a super hero.This will probably win all the awards for fancy camera work but for me it was a little style over substance. Having said that I still enjoyed the film, it's worth it to see the trench sets alone.So it's a solid 7 from me but doesn't make it in to the masterpiece pile."
1917,12 March 2020,8/10,This movie radiates some kind of nihilistic atmosphere that enforces the characters and story. The movie is brilliant in its simplicity. It's dark and gritty and luckily different than the usual Hollywood brainless blockbuster.If you like war movies: a must see.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Best of the highly-acclaimed movies I've seen of the year. Great scenery, photography, story, emotion, sound, and acting."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"1917 was a very moving display of the First World War and if any long loving veterans were alive today to see such a movie, I'm sure they would have been glad to see their experiences and stories told in such a successful way and if they could see the profound effect it had in some people I'm sure they would have been moved to tears. Overall will not be a movie to forget!"
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,"It is unfathomable that this movie gets such high ratings. Mind-B-O-G-G-L-I-N-G.I don't know where to start..(no particular order) The Geman pilot that just crashed managed to stab Blake while Schofield rushes to find water for the hurt pilot. In WW1 pilot's where men of honour and they would 1. Just not do such a thing, and 2. it's idiotic that a weakened haf burned pilot finds the strength for it. The town is levelled, but the church tower is stil intact. Bot only is it intact, but apparently there is someone there to sound the church bell at 5 am? Really? Just before the woman in the basmeent appeared I thought: ""soon he finds a woman"", and bingo. And yes, she cares for a baby that is not her's without any further context. And yes, Blake is the only soldier in WW1 to have carried milk in his canteen. What Luck for this baby! And so unexpected!The river he jumps in to suddenly turns into a wild stream? Really? In otherwise flat scenery there's not only a wild river but even a 20-foot waterfall? PleaseAs usual, Germans can's shoot straight and a re all drunk, bad, puking, and have I mentioned they can't shot straight?Later he hears singing in the woods, and walks up to a large group of soldiers who did not think it was handy to put up a perimeter guard of any kind, near enemy territory. He sits himself down amongst them but no one notices.Blake (a Corporal) asks every second soldier and officer he finds where MacKenzie is, and they all point him to him, never asking any questions as to who he is and why he wants to see their CO.Scenery: too clean just like the soldiers. explosions take place next to soldiers, but the stand tall without any reaction, or, they stand still for one second and only then get blown to the side (slightly) by the blast.This movie better than Saving Private Ryan? What travesty and utter crap. This movie can't hold a candle to the muppet show. Do not waste your money. I you're looking for brainless entertainment: good for you you might enjoy it.You are a war-movie/history buffin like me, avoid this one. It's just another Dunkirk-like mediocre flick. Dead in the water and a missed opportunity. I'd give it two stars. One star because of all the fake 10/10 reviews.Oh, and the one-take camera approach leaves you longing for a cut after 10 minutes."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,This is a must watch film not one for theses films but am glad I had the thought to watch it the way the actors and the way it was directed was just brilliant
1917,15 January 2020,1/10,We left after the first hour. I can't remember ever doing so previously.
1917,6 February 2020,9/10,"Fantastic movie
Lots of director brilliance can be observed
Best film of the year."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"After Schofield went through hell and lost a friend, that had to be crushing to hear. At least the other Blake appreciated the lengths Schofield went through to get to him.Also, the scene where Schofield woke up during the night and the lights/flares were going off has to be one of Roger Deakins' coolest use of light. He deserves another Oscar just for that sequence alone. That entire sequence in the burning town was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had watching a film. The colour palette being drenched in nothing, but black and orange, the use of shading that really made any hint of light pop out, the music, the camera tracking Schofield running through the town... All of it was gorgeous and harrowing eye candy, but that slow creep through the window is a moment that will stick in my mind forever."
1917,9 May 2020,8/10,"This movie a a masterclass of filmmaking. The color, the sound, the set design and costume accuracy are all brilliant. Then having the nerve to use a lot of natural light and filming in high definition where any flaws are visible is quite an achievement.
The story is rather routine and the acting is good. The actors do not stand out but the journey is more the character and the lead just navigates and survive by dumb luck in most cases."
1917,8 August 2020,8/10,"Absolutely incredible, I loved just about every second. Filmed masterfully by the legendary Roger Deakins, I was engrossed in the story from the first scene. Can't wait to watch it again!"
1917,27 September 2021,8/10,"This movie is a technical masterpiece, every scene has been crafted with so much care, creativity and mastery it really is a feast for one's eyes. I can talk hours about just how good the technics used in this movie are, but there was something else that sadly kind of broke the movie for me, and that was the plot.I have studied a lot about WWI in my life, and let me tell you, it was utterly brutal. The cruelty seen in WWI is hard to explain with just words, the stupidly unfair reality of soldiers having to either run into the enemy trenches just to get shot by the enemy, or try to flee the fight, just to get shot, but now by your own side. The inhumanity of the chemical warfare, the diseases ravaging the trenches, the miserable conditions of soldiers. This was WWI, and this was what I was expecting. Something that showed all of this. But instead I got a technical masterpieces, yes, but a cliché American plot of the hero saving thousands with a happy ending and pretty much nothing of what I mentioned.It's not often we get to see a WWI movie, most focus on other wars, for every 50 WWII movie we might get one set in WWI instead, and I wanted it to be something different, I wanted it to be something else. I know this is a personal matter, but I still feel like it was a massive let down, you can't create a great movie just with great technics, movies are trying to tell a story, that is their heart and soul, everything else is built in top of it, and the story was by far the worst part of this movie. My score has reflected this, I really cannot rate it higher than this with this story, even though the technical department is brilliant."
1917,14 July 2020,8/10,"Similar to 'Dunkirk' in direction and feeling.
Not as action packed as saving private Ryan but nonetheless, wouldn't look out of place in any favourite War movie collection.Well written, well directed, well acted. Thought provoking with outstanding cinematic scenes."
1917,20 January 2020,6/10,"Very disappointing that this story was ruined with one long shot. The story has potential and there were definitely some emotional and good moments. But the style the director chose to film with ruined this for me. It limited what they could show the audience and rather than make this a great untold war movie , Sam Mendes decided to film an art project to try to win best picture."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"One of the reasons I watched the movie was because of the Golden Globe win and the interesting camera work, but I witnesed something really special.The outstanding cinematography brings to life the WW1 battlefield and it feels so real and ""magical"" at the same. The amount of months that were invested in this piece is impressive. The main characters did a great job, the only thing I noticed was that there wasn't much to their background, it was just kind of a mediocre character built honestly. Roger Deakins deserves an Oscar nomination for the camera work and so does Thomas Newman, for the soundtrack. The music is very memorable and melodic. There are scenes conducted by Sam Mendes that make all the film departments work together and those are one of the most satisfying scenes I have seen in a decade.It's a great film to end the year with. If you are intersted in history and love a good piece of drama, then I highly recommend it. The tension is real!"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"We just saw 1917. Oh my. What an excellent film. Normally if critics love a film (as they do this one), it will be too artsy or hoity-toity (there's a term you haven't heard in a while!) for us (like Uncut Gems, which was a total waste of time and money), but this time, the critics are right. Ignore all the blathering about directing techniques and just revel in this amazing story of courage way above and beyond belief. 10 big stars from both of us."
1917,30 December 2020,10/10,I watched this movie about a month ago and it still occupies my mind. I can listen to the sound track and still picture the scenes in my head. Brilliant use of cinematography that really grabs your attention.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,1917 is like playing or watching video games. No big talks it might be the greatest war journey u have been to since Apocalypse Now(1979) not comparing them but i haven't seen any war movie till now that can beat Apocalypse Now 1917 didn't beat Apocalypse now but it surely became one of the greatest technical achievement Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins really pull this new technique 1 cut.
1917,19 February 2020,10/10,I can confirm that it deserved all the nominations it got awarded
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"It's nice movie to watch, however! I think that the story is very simple and the most immersive things in the movie are the editing, lighting, custom, etc. rather than acting level! Actors performance were very normal and nothing was high level! Marriage Story is way better in my opinion"
1917,10 March 2020,9/10,"I genuinely hate war movies. I honestly found myself loving everything about this masterpiece. It's well directed, well acted, well written and fabulously scored. It's so beautifully filmed that I want to watch it again."
1917,6 December 2020,10/10,"I have nothing more to say than, in fact I don't dare to say more than that this movie is superior to every other war movie I have ever seen with my young eyes.It's never boring, in comparison to the critics' reviews, and is in my Top 5-list of my all-time favorite movies. If I'm not mistaken it's also based on real events and that is really the base of this fantastic representation of 1917.The quality... I have never seen, before in my life, such good movie quality (in regards to video-quality, but also the story itself).In fact, this is exactly everything I'm going to say about this film and where I end my review. I'm still too much in the obsession-fase and thinking-about-fase after 5 months to say anything.One more thing, the movie is not filmed in 1 shot, like you might believe, but it sure looks like it! I always believed it was in 2.
Fantastic representation of the war cruelty and I recommend it loads!"
1917,29 January 2020,2/10,"I had high hopes based on the buzz, but after the movie my wife and I looked at each other and laughed. THAT'S what all the hype is about?? Yes, it was filmed in a one-shot style and that was pretty cool. But the story,....blah. Two grunts are sent on such an important mission...why? 80% of the film is just him running or walking. Then the guy get's killed by the German pilot...are you kidding me? How forced was that? That just proves how stupid these two were.1917 deserves praise for cinematography....but that's it. It's 10% of other great war movies. It's a movie that will never watch again...at least intentionally."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,Hands down the best war film I have ever seen. Left the cinema with tears in my eyes. Unbelievable cinematography. One of the best movies I have ever seen. A must watch.
1917,23 January 2020,6/10,It's good but nowhere near great.A few good shots and suddenly it's oscar material?
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,I was surprised at how well put together this movie was. Beautiful and yet disturbing in the right way.
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"An achievement in movie making, for sure.. but Best Picture? I don't think so.Lets start with the good. The most obvious is the telling of this story in one single view. No cuts or passing of time. Everything occurring real time. The number of extras involved, the battle sequences, its is choreographed so wonderfully that the movie offers something that no other movie provides. A real perspective... as if you are on the journey with them. It is wonderful way to view this story and one we don't see used often (like in Birdman). However, this perspective in story telling does come at a cost and that is a lack of any real emotional connection to the characters.The movie begins with two soldiers being told to see the General for orders for a mission and from that point, they are off. How much do we really get to know about these characters? Why should we care about them other than the importance that they be successful in the mission they have been tasked with? As they are trekking through No-Mans land, they are on the look out for enemy Germans. Not really an opportune time to have any real conversations of any real substance so we never really do get to know the characters. The mission, and ONLY the mission seems to be real focus.1917 is definitely fascinating to watch and certainly worthy of a trip to the theater but it carries very little emotional impact on the viewer as compared to other war movies that have used more conventional methods of film making (Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Band of Brothers). I feel that the movie would have been better served allowing us to get to know these characters through a standard narrative format before moving on to the one take perspective in order to give the audience something to connect them to these soldiers. That perhaps may have given the mission itself more weight.Yes we know the stakes are high, for them and for the success of the mission... but if we know our history, we really already know how the story ends, so what is needed is the a reason to care beyond that. That all gets lost without at least SOME focus on the characters.The point is this.. The movie is interesting BECAUSE of its perspective, but without it, would it be as interesting? Probably not.After watching, does it make you think? Does it make you feel? If it doesn't, then as war movies go, well. isn't that kind of the point and isn't it kind of a failure if it doesn't leave you with some kind of impression?For me, this movie simply felt like I came in at the point where the film was starting at the beginning of its build towards a climax but I had missed some of the exposition prior to it. So while there is tension and there is peril, there was nothing to connect my interest in the characters other than the success of the mission.The movie deserves high marks for its direction (no easy feat to coordinate a one take perspective for 1hr 30 minutes) and I certainly have no issue with the approach. After all It worked well in Birdman... but the difference in Birdman, is that we also got to KNOW the character and connect with him through the length of that movie and there was a depth to the character at a psychological level, and it worked because the story itself was completely character centered... not centered around an entire event.I would certainly give 1917 its props for cinematography, set pieces, visual effects, and perhaps for its way of telling the story, one could argue that it could deserve at least a Best Picture nomination. But considering the current lineup of nominees, there are other films far more deserving of that honor."
1917,24 March 2020,9/10,"One of the best films I've seen in a while, would highly recommend this film. It is beautiful made"
1917,8 August 2020,10/10,"GREAT movie , excellent story , the main actor does an incredible job, really good performance. The camera movement, all the angles we're just amazing you could feel yourself in the trenches running alongside Schofield , the camera work makes you enjoy the great story and the excellent excellent set. The music was an important part of the film too. That last scene is just amazing. Recommended 100% if you like war history specially ww."
1917,19 February 2020,6/10,"It is a straightforward story with only one subject. Audience is equally in the dark alongside the subject with what's going to happen next. That's the idea of direction which is a great work. A simple story presented in a mysterious manner. That said, the continuous camera sequence is a great deal of editing but it's missing the continuous flow of sound, background sound so to say, which is equally important.It is 1917, not 2017 where trucks can be electric and soundless. Those are army trucks from WWI. When a subject is grieving on his mate and suddenly there are two other army personnel appear in the scene out of nowhere, and the next thing you see is a line of army trucks loaded with army personnel, question is, when they were getting closer to that location where the subject was, where is the sound of those trucks appearing closer and more so, of all those personnel?!Also, continuous camera flow is not required everywhere. To me, it's basically waste of some seconds, for example, where camera also moves into the truck along with the subject. Nonetheless, it is indeed a great camera editing especially all the water scenes including the small pond with dead bodies as well as waterfall scene with the river, overall a beautiful cinematography.Quite gripping to watch this film except that it could have been much better with the flow of missing important background sound.Rating: 6/10"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Camera work more than exceptional, acting perfect and believable, one of the greatest."
1917,27 January 2020,8/10,"Absolutely brilliant film, really shows the true horrors of war and what the brave soldiers had to go through. Some would say a slow film but I would say a brilliant story told with every detail spot on."
1917,27 January 2020,8/10,"Its not as good as Dunkirk, but not far behind. worth a watch."
1917,25 March 2020,4/10,I love a lot of Mendes' movies but as an action director he's lazy. Every time a hero gets into a tight spot he gets out in seconds with almost zero effort.
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,No idea how this got such good reviews. Worst war movie ever. Saving Private Ryan is a million times better. Only good 3 scenes were in the trailer.
1917,17 February 2020,10/10,"I'm so glad I saw this and that I saw it on the big screen. It was (I believe) a gruesomely realistic depiction of WWI. I feel that I now have a better understanding of what those combat soldiers experienced. The connection to the soldiers' journey was very much enhanced by the cinematography, but the collaboration of all the parts - the story, the direction, acting, editing, etc. - was all very well done. My humble opinion."
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,"One of the best movies by far , huge cinematography"
1917,25 September 2020,1/10,"Overhyped, total let down. Expecting something extraordinary. Fell asleep 3 times."
1917,24 January 2020,6/10,"I don't understand the great reviews. The cinematography was a 10. I'll grant you that. But the stories dialogue was mostly uninteresting. It was very slow and talkie.The last half hour was decent though.
Basically the movie lacked drama. That would seem impossible in this kind of movie.
Sorry, but I wanted to love it and was very disappointed."
1917,22 March 2020,5/10,"Impressive cinematography and some great set pieces, but ultimately doesn't amount to much at all."
1917,31 October 2021,10/10,This movie is a piece of art. The cinematography is outstanding. By the first 20 minutes or so I knew I was watching a masterpiece from the range of Apocalypse Now.
1917,12 February 2020,10/10,"A very strong film about the events of the First World War.
Definitely worth your time.
One of the best films I've watched.
10/10"
1917,27 August 2021,,"I really think it was good. All in all, a really good movie."
1917,13 June 2020,6/10,"I really like the movie, the technique is great, the actors, the quality, and almost everything, but the story is too short."
1917,20 June 2020,5/10,"The takes are really cool but when you build a war movie you cannot use fantastic things, in the way to create a real environment you must keep realistic and I think in this movie you dont have that so you'll never be able to keep your mind in the scene and feel something like for example you can in dunkirk or similar movies."
1917,4 February 2020,3/10,"I don't know what people see in this movie. It's not about war, it's about a superhero. Would not go about spoiling, but expect to see the grand-dad of John Maclain fight out in an unrealistic sequence of events. No real soldier ever went through so much stuff (let alone survived it all).They took a list of ALL things that could happen in a war and made one soldier experience them all, supposedly in one day.And political messages... There were very few black or Indian soldiers fighting in WW1. Sure, i never knew that they thought in it at all, before this movie, but come on- the fellow2 went through a lot as it is - you mean he'd be lucky enough to meet a balck soldier and an Indian soldier too?
Mendes should have made a documentary"
1917,4 February 2020,3/10,"Why send an airplane, or a pigeon to send a message, when you can send a soldier on a 2-day checklist of adventures, with sequence of even that even an entire company of men couldn't realistically encounter during an entire war. After all, Mendes an action-hero movie to shootI rest my case."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"I was more than intrigued to learn that Sam Mendes was making a historical title, 1917, about WWI. After all, regardless of his wonderful touch on interpersonal war such as Road to Revolution and many others, Mendes isn't notorious for a grasp over an epic of any real, bloody war. When I set my feet into the cinema, my doubts are simultaneously holding me back. I don't want the figure of the director, talented and dedicated, to be ruined by a movie that doesn't match his talents.
Fortunately, Mendes is clever enough to make both his old audience and new viewers ecstatic. The movie is about a soldier who is responsible for delivering a message that can stop a massacre of 1600 men. He has to traverse the fronts, dodge the bullets, and survive himself at the most dangerous area man can ever imagine. The appliance of single long shot and on-foot cameraman, a signature of Mendes-made, carefully tracks the character alongside the destined adventure. In a manner, Mendes is generous enough to allow the audience, with breath held, to follow every step the soldier takes.
No doubts, Mendes names the title with four digits, 1917. It not only denotes the year in which the plot takes place but also marks the most devastating and hopeless moment of WWI. For three years straight, European powers have been struggling with an internal conflict, which may eventually jeopardize the whole of human civilization. As a result, millions of innocent young men are drafted and sacrificed; women ignored and exploited, dedicating to a holy purpose that gradually makes less sense.
Even though it merely costs less than 24 hours for the plot to develop fully, 1917 is well articulated. Almost none of the length is wasted, killing the motive of the audience to pee in the middle. Mendes also deploys his talent to narrate a seemingly boring story; in the movie, important details are so nicely concealed that their existence won't bother the progression of the main thread. For example, it all together takes the audience three wild guesses to figure out the function of a tiny metal box carried by the soldier, until he takes it from his inside pocket at the very end.
Mendes still owns the movie, despite the uncommon story it employs. As most of Mendes's stories, the plot itself can't even substantially constitute an event in history books; instead, reflect a trivial day of an ordinary soldier. However, all the trivial elements demonstrate the absurdity of war: the perpetual peace lies in the graveyard of all the sacrificed.
Actually, I have to brave myself to the cinema for the sake of witnessing the turnout of Mendes endeavor. When I hit the road, the panic for Coronavirus is spreading across the globe, causing a lockdown of cinema in many places in Asia. I, indeed, beg for the stroke of luck, which I may gain more easily than my Chinese counterpart, considering the rather limited size of the crowd in Europe. Awkwardly, the reality goes against my mind. The cinema is almost full of audience, regardless of the four recent virus cases confirmed in Bayern.
In the epidemics, as same as various wars, we can find a state of mind juxtaposing determination and panics that gradually normalizes itself. By targeting the security of life, the epidemic is seriously causing all sorts of unconventional warfare that may eventually echo Hobbes's theme, ""everyone against everyone,"" while people, on the other hand, are accustomed to internalizing fear to understand the unnormal. Emergent measures can be assumed to make the country into a warzone: cities under siege, road cut down, people locked up at home, while any attempt to counter back these efforts can be deemed as inappropriate, unacceptable, or even traitorous.
I have no intention of questioning the state of emergency as the justification for all precaution efforts; after all, the sentiments that people have under the threat of global epidemics are also haunting me (sometimes more than I can suffer). Notwithstanding, it needs to be admitted that all of us, under threat, is troubled by a psychological condition that makes rumors, suspicions and baseless allegations convenient.
After all, in the midst of an atrocious, brutal war, what we are expecting is something different, something other than the enmity in human nature, which may declare the farewell to wars, once and for all."
1917,17 February 2020,9/10,"Just for the Cinematography i can give a 10/10
Hat's off to Roger Deakins."
1917,11 January 2020,4/10,"I was expecting an exciting war film right up there with saving private Ryan.
What I got was a slow, boring and unimaginative story line..
Well shot but at times i wanted the camera to pan out so i could see more.. Overall I walked away very disappointed.. How some people give this a 9 or 10 is ridiculous."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,"Cinematography 10/10 - stunning
Plot 6/10 - too much plot armourOverall 8/10"
1917,8 August 2020,,It's not totally empty but the story is clearly left behind. When you send 2 young people for a mission you would add 3rd or 4th men. Also you'd give them some water and food but noone cares in this movie.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"The subject matter of this outstanding film, although important, takes a back seat due to the beautiful filming techniques that makes the movie to appear have been shot in one take and the absolutely stunning cinematography! This film take an absolutely devastating moment in history with remarkable visual clarity of the horror of war and turns it into an unbelievable cinematic masterpiece. In one night scene the dancing shadows of airborne flares on the bombed out walls of a town is filmed in such a manner as to make it a beautiful picture. With many other outstanding examples of this style of filming this movie is a beautiful piece of art. If you go to see this film as a ""regular"" war movie you may be disappointed, but view it for a visually stunning work of cinematography and you will come away awestruck."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is easily movie of the year. This movie has everything. Every detail was perfected. Such an amazing story, and it was told phenomenally. It was fairly graphic, but that was the best part of the movie. Nothing was sugar coated. Everything made you feel like it was super authentic."
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"20 minutes in the movie theatre, I wanted to leave. Anxious, claustrophobic, I felt trapped! I could not get it out! I knew they would make it. I had seen the trailer but it was nothing compared to what I was feeling. I was going to embark in a journey with two (unknown) actors, into the unknown!
1917 is a masterpiece! A breathtaking, riveting, beautiful film about a simple mission yet complicated during World War I.
I closed my eyes couples of times and yet I knew it was something to be seen. Sam Mendes' one shot directing is so immersive, I wanted to take the boys and bring them to 2020!
Everywhere the camera didn't look, there could have been a German soldier. What are you doing here? is what I asked myself over and over again which is why the end is so fitting and sweet and the resolution I needed. This was more important than the mission. Get out of this war! I know the end! Im from 2020 and I wanted to tell them, it's not worth it!
Then again in 2020 we almost had War World III !
I wanted to escape, the journey was long!
Then, the blazing fire kept me mesmerized with the beautiful score of Thomas Newman! I could not believe my eyes! How can something so destructive be so beautiful! Isn't ironic?
Then the climax, I kept screaming inside WHERE THE F%&#@ is Colonel Mackenzie! I couldn't wait any longer! 1917 exceeded all my expectations.
From the story of his grandfather to the end of the credits, Sam Mendes gave us the best movie of the year! Thank you Alfred Hubert Mendes!"
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"Everywhere the camera didn't look, there could be a German soldier."
1917,23 May 2020,10/10,It's been a while since I've watched a war movie that I have just loved from start to finish! This one is truly great!
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"*Spoiler Warning*
1917 is a film about 2 WW1 soldiers sent to send a message to a battalion telling them to call of their attack as they are walking into a trap.
This film is full of suspense and will have you on edge at all times as every moment is full of tension and surprises that will freeze you in your seat making you continue watching.
The thing that stands this film out from the other war films is that it was filmed on one continuous shot which gave it a more realistic feel as the actors would be feeling similar to how the soldiers would have felt in WW1.
The camera angle were mainly low and over the shoulder which helps make you feel like you are there with them which helps make the viewer emotionaly attached to the characters and feel sad when they die.
You can see the sheer emotion in the actors eyes and actions throughout the film which gives a realistic tone to the film.
From the conditions of No Mans Land to the Frontline Trenches, the settings of this film are realistic and mesmerising which make the film look like it was actually filmed in WW1 due to the detail in the settings.
Don't watch this film if you don't like to see dead bodies and animals as this film is full of them, showing the impact of WW1 and how soldiers and animals where killed. For example, in one scene they talk about how the germans killed all the cows just so the british couldn't use them for food.
The bond between Blake and Scofield really makes this film better as their friendship really helps the audience understand how they feel and after Blake dies the bond seems to get stronger as Scofield completes the mission in memory of Blake which ends up saving many soldiers who where about to walk into a death trap.
The film is really worth watching as it is emotional and informative whilst creating bonds between audience and characters making the film stay with the audience after it is finished."
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"Excellent film. Nearly lost me early on with the dodgy accents.
(the average Tommy wouldn't sound the Ts like that) but that's nitpicking.
This film is brilliant."
1917,3 February 2020,8/10,"Since the movie plays in real time, the viewer is put directly into the story and feels like the third soldier.At first, we accept Lance Corporal Tom as the lead character, since he has way more lines then William at the beginning. However, we get to understand that we need to switch to William. This rare in movies and brings a lot of depth and excitement.The storyline is very simple and easy to follow. We don't question the actions seen on screen, because it is always very clear. This forbiddens the interpretation of the viewer to a certain degree.The little dialogue helps us to perceive the environment and circumstances the characters are faceing. In return, we only know the main characters superficial which makes it hard to feel deeply connect to them."
1917,17 January 2020,,"Offensively bland, predictable amusement park ride of a movie. Professional cinematography of course from the expert Roger Deakins, but that is simply not enough. See Paths of Glory, Come and See and Apocalypse Now instead of this cliched empty spectacle"
1917,9 February 2020,1/10,"If you only look at the Cinematography then this movie is extreamly good, but a movie like this also have to have a story and that is what this movie is lacking - the story is not interesting and it reminds me of a bad vision of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with acting not nearly as good. It is hard to understand how this movie kan win a golden globe for best movie.
The lead actor does not even give a convincing performance of his personal struggle with the mission that he has been choicen for and how he goes from being against it to make it his own personal mission after his friends dead.
It is not a movie I will watch again, because it is very simple borring."
1917,5 August 2020,1/10,"The professional reviewers loved this movie (should have been my first clue). Kept waiting for it to get interesting/good. Then the final credits ran. ""Special Features"" are very self-serving and added nothing to the presentation."
1917,22 February 2020,6/10,"Lots of hype about this, frankly the plot is paper thin and it paints a rather straight forward picture of WW1."
1917,18 June 2020,4/10,Damn what a crap movie realistically and historically. If only the movie maker would've taken the time to check two subjects: Psychology and History - that would've made a movie of WWI...
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,Just outstanding. Brillant performance. Sam and the boys have nailed it. There is so much to take away from such a awasome performance.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"I saw it and it was great! i recommend it for everyone, even if you are not interested a lot in the topic"
1917,28 January 2020,2/10,Boring movie compared to hacksaw ridge and saving private Ryan.
1917,9 December 2020,10/10,"Top level cinematography and acting! The color and sound was also brilliant. I will note, since it is not mentioned about a lot, set design should win every award for this film! My favorite war film next to Private Ryan. 10!"
1917,25 April 2020,9/10,A very thrilling experience. Do watch. Highly recommend to all serious movie watchers.
1917,28 December 2019,4/10,"Not sure how a movie with so many actions scenes can be so boring... Just a noisy, busy pointless mess with no real plot."
1917,24 October 2020,10/10,Both the storyline and cinematography are amazing!
1917,10 January 2020,8/10,"Overall, the cinematography of 1917 is some of the best I have ever seen. As for the main character ""Corporal Schofield"", the pacing of the 1-take methodology provides a far too fast-paced story for it to make sense. He dodged death countless times, some that I remember:1. Tripwire explosives bury him without a scratch
2. Small amount was enough to prevent a large hand wound from getting septic
3. Dodges plane that incidently crashes next to him
4. Gets helmet shot off by German soldier and gets a major concussion (magically heals in 2 scenes)
5. Almost hit by rock in white water river scene
6. Survives falling down a waterfall with a shallow bottom
7. Dodges sniper shots when in plain view multiple times
8. Escapes German soldiers twice
9. Wins wrestle with unarmed German soldier, as the other is co-incidently drunk, allowing him to run away
10. Shoots 8 rounds of suppressing fire throughout with 2 gone from shooting plane pilot after ""3.""
11. Almost blown up ~8 times by artillery shells in the final scenesSo yeah, a little unrealistic storytelling wise: may fit nicely into the Dirk Gently/Hitchhikers Guide universe though :-)"
1917,4 May 2020,5/10,"The film disappointed me. The story being told is truly shocking and terrifying, but it is poorly conveyed. Important details were not taken into account in the film. I have seen many better war movies."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Spoiler free review of 1917,To be honest it is one of the best war films I have watched. The film was perfectly balanced with shocking scenes that were somehow made to feel like everyday experiences in the way the characters must view them before you realise that what your watching is truly horrifying, then moving into scenes that could draw out a sense of realisation as you remember this was something that people actually went through.The whole range of techniques lent itself to the story telling such as the music, sound effects and use of silence to completely deprive you of comfort or to shift your emotion to exactly the right place. The way to the camera worked made you truly feel like you are there with the characters feeling everything they felt. The acting was phenomenal and made every scene feel tense, happy or lonely depending on how the story progressed.Truly an amazing film that leaves out none of the horrors of war, I would definitely recommend you watch it."

1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"Mendes handles his subject with conviction and deep respect. He provides an inquiry into the resolve of human endurance through an unrelenting portrait of the Great War, delivered with great esteem for soldiering. 1917 is an impressive technical accomplishment. The execution of its concept, the appearance of a 'one-take' continuous shot that propels the viewer through the narrative into a meticulous designed environment. It demonstrates a level of ambition given the genre but feels natural for such a portrayal.
The continuous shot provides a subjective experience of The Great War. Often 1917 paints an abstract reflection of the Tommy's state of mind in its atmosphere. Its awareness almost primitive, operating on the fumes of instinct. The imagery conjures up Romanticism in its textual analysis provoking both beauty and horror. Mendes has command over the audience's senses with overwhelming audio-visual shock and awe!Praise will no doubt fall, and rightly so, on the cinematic prowess of Roger Deakins and the design of Dennis Grassner. Grassner provides an authentic quality that complements Deakin's lens. All of which immerses the audience in Mendes's world building. This is a finely tuned collaboration."
1917,12 January 2020,4/10,Whilst the cinematography is beautiful the movie is slow and at times down right boring. Some great actors who spend less than two minutes on screen leave you wanting more interaction. Definitely one to miss at the cinema.
1917,16 February 2020,10/10,"Really great movie,storyline,narrative, acting very thing is just great"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I can't describe in words how deeply impactful this film is (through the one-shot filming, the actors, the sets, costuming, locations). The soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman will have tears streaming down your face by the time the movie is over! You will cry at least three times if you have ANY emotion at all!
There's a reason this film won two Golden Globes and was nominated for nine BAFTA awards. This film truly does not go unseen in detail. Showing the true horrors and traumas of WWI, this film is unnatural in its beauty. Brilliant brilliant brilliant! GO SEE THIS RIGHT NOW!"
1917,5 May 2020,10/10,There's so many amazing things I could say about this film and it wouldn't even come close to how I feel about it. It completely sucked me in and kept me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. It really made you feel like you were there rather then just watching it. George McKay was an absolute revelation. His performance was absolutely stunning. Definitely didn't expect that twist that happened less then halfway into the film (it was a real gut punch!). I have a lot more appreciation for war films because of this movie. It truly is something special. It will stay with me forever.
1917,20 January 2020,8/10,Great movie with a beautiful storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Well worth seeing!
1917,7 March 2020,2/10,Barely any action and the movie just ended. Horrible ending
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"Ok I went into this knowing only something that I'd learned from a rumor.. that it was all done in one take. Spoiler.. it wasn't, but they tried to make it look like it was. So I kept focusing on whether or not I could see any cuts, and that detracted from my ability to focus on the action. I know this gimmick has been done before, but I've decided I'm not a fan. That said, the movie was fantastic, and I highly recommend it. It was mostly believable (other than the plane crash scene), and as a fan of history I enjoyed the graphic portrayal of trench warfare. Highly recommended."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"This is what cinema was and hopefully will be again when the brain dead Millennials and GZs and those who serve them give way to a renaissance generation who embrace true film making anew. I feel sincerely sorry for the current youth who never grew up with classic film making. The marketing oriented sausage grinder tripe of today is enough to make those of us who know better weep crocodile tears (how's that for two run on sentences?). The franchise era should tossed on the scrap heap of history and be as quickly forgotten as it arose. Either that or relegate it to online streaming platforms that cater to the comatose masses. I sadly saw the last Star Wars installment a week before seeing this 1917. I thought I'd never go to the cinema again (it had been two years without a visit). I had abandoned all hope for film, but it sprung anew thanks to 1917. If it doesn't win best picture it will be all the evidence you ever needed that the fix has always been in, in Hollywood."
1917,29 January 2020,4/10,"The hype and hullabaloo surrounding this film leaves me feeling isolated - because I really didn't like it, even though I wanted to. Yes, it was convincingly filmed; yes it had moments of genuine shock (not many, actually), and yes it had a decently realistic ending instead of sewing matters up a la Hollywood - all to the film's credit. But all this was let down by the script and storyline, which I found hackneyed and predictable. It felt like plotting-by-numbers, reaching for old tropes - not because old tropes are true, but because they were convenient, moving matters along in a way that seemed to disrespect the critical viewer. Some examples:
The set-up was too loaded and trite to take seriously and in any case borrowed a fair bit from Saving Private Ryan (I'm avoiding spoilers here).
Soon after this, sniper's bullets clearly come from the 'wrong' direction, presumably because it made for a more exciting attack scene. I found myself coming out of the moment to mutter, 'Hang on...'
Dwelling so abnormally long on the 'milk' episode told us all way ahead of time that we'd be witnessing something pretty moving later on. And so it proved.
The discovered route through enemy lines seemed bizarrely unlikely, (again, I'm avoiding spoilers). 'This is the way!' they shout. Really? On a reasonably flat battleground? Again, I was forced out of the moment.
And that waterfall scene. Niagara in the French countryside. Who'd have thought?
And so on. I could go on. I already have. As I say, I really wanted to like this film but felt let down by convenient blurps that moved the story along faster but left me feeling cheated by the end."
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,The one shot technique is brilliantly done. Edge of the seat stuff
1917,23 January 2020,7/10,"Vets need our support. War is hell, so we can have peace. May this help us be wise and brave, as our fellows were."
1917,23 January 2020,1/10,"I really can't understand how this film won any award for best picture. 2019 provided many films that are far better than this one. Technically it is very good, but the story is extremely poor. If the intentions of its makers is to show how bad war is for people, this is a very worn out goal that was much better delivered by many war films before, especially ""saving private Ryan"".
In my opinion, it does not deserve at all to be nominated for a best picture category in any kind of awards, but we certainly live in a very biased and unfair world, where real talents still didn't get the recognition they deserve.
The Joker is a much much much better film."
1917,23 January 2020,3/10,"I can not understand for what nominated this movie for oscar... so poor story, poor acting. I like just musics of movie"
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"A movie which you just don't watch but become a part of. After watching the trailer of the film in 2019, I was sure that I will watch this film on a big screen. Although the trailer style did look like Dunkirk but the objective in the movie is completely different. This is a one shot film which means there are no cuts throughout the film, except for the forced cut during the interval by movie theatre.Movie starts with a wide shot like one of a windows wallpaper, which makes you feel comfortable watching it, but as soon as characters starts walking from wide plateau towards narrow trenches, we start getting uncomfortable with the space and feel more claustrophobic, thus we become part of it as we as a character feel what's happening in the film and this is without any fancy 4DX setup. As we move in the film, there are many more instances which makes us go WOW.There are many movies made before this film which were one shot, Birdman was one of them. But unlike Birdman, this movie has very less camera pans in dark alley to make a cut, plus changing lighting conditions and landscape makes it more complex. Credits to Sam Mendez (Director) for having a vision of making a war film in one shot and full credit to Roger Deakins (Cinematographer) & Lee Smith (Editor) for making it happen. Truly a masterpiece.This movie must be experienced in IMAX for true cinematic experience which will stay with you for longer period of time."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"The only thing missing was the mustard gas. Viewers are drawn into the story from the onset. The portrayal of what conditions might have been like during WWI were spot on. The story was gripping and at times appropriately tense.I can't understand some of the criticisms I've read. Germans being a lousy shot? Everyone is a lousy shot when running through rubble while shooting at someone also running through rubble, firing what is essentially a short barrel single shot bolt action 30-06.Despite some reviewers complaints, the story did in fact end clearly and appropriately. All loose plot lines were tied up.I agree that the plot is a little Saving Private Ryan like, but don't let that deter you from this film. It was very, very well done and time well spent. Everything from the scenery, to the cinematography, to the musical score were perfect."
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"I have been reading reviews for years but never wrote one. This movie was so special that I had to do it. From start to finish it is one hell of a joyride owing to its 1 shot. The cinematography is beautiful, the emotions are high, the war is intense and the story is real.
Do yourself a favour and find the biggest group you can find to watch this movie with."
1917,15 February 2020,9/10,"This movie does not contain a good well-thought-out story, and yet, you're watching the movie excited for every second. I think you have to be a very good director to make such a movie The ""all-in-one-shot"" is something unique, and it gives the viewer a feeling of being in the film. It gives another perspective, I would say another dimension, to the viewer's experience."
1917,25 January 2020,8/10,"""1917"", a great movie for people who loves historical films, with just a little bit of action, and not to exagerated. I just found particularly interesting, that in all movie you can't notice any cuts, it's like the all film was record at once. I'm giving this movie, for sure, 8 stars."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"This film made me create an account on this site and leave my first ever review on anything. I was not expecting this. I was hooked from the start and felt like I was in the movie experiencing the journey myself. I have never been so attached from reality while watching a movie. Or should i even use that phrase because what this movie showed was actual reality once. Let's say this movie attached me from the reality of our modern time of peace and just for few hours brought my mind to the reality of war over 100 years ago. This is a movie for all humans with human emotions.
I got watery eyed multiple times during the movie. I have got watery eyed during some emotional movies before and I thought that was the level of emotion this movie could bring me and keep at. Not the case. I was shown a whole new level of emotional movie experiences. This movie experience was going to be like nothing else before. It felt like I was building tension inside my body from holding back emotions during the movie. After the movie finished I was in shock. I could only stare at the credits without moving a limb except clenching my fists to hold back tears because I didn't want to start crying in the movie theater. I could feel my heart rate go up and breathing getting shallower and faster. I was even shaking a bit. This was a real moment for me. There was only one couple of people left in their seats clearly emotional too when we finally slowly left the theater after I got back my ability to move. I couldn't say much to my fiancé while we were walking home. She was concerned because I was so quiet and asked me how I was feeling and I only could tell her that I just wanted to go home so I could cry. We got home, I let all the built up emotions out and cried my eyes out to my fiancés scarf while hugging her making her cry too. It felt like my soul was washed when I let the emotions loose with the tears flowing out. It was a relief. I felt pure. This was very unique and personal experience. It's amazing how art can have such an effect on human emotions. I had never been made feel likes this before by a piece of art. Now I have. I am grateful."
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,"So why did this movie not won the Oscar for best movie? True story, great acting, action and this movie really takes you into the story. Great camera work and beautiful sets.Just watch it and you will be taken away in a great story/advanture."
1917,31 January 2020,8/10,"Yep. Everyone know what master shot is. But, what do you say about master-shot-production? Ok. I'ts not really master shot but still make great impression. 1917 deserved for my TOP 5 WAR FILMS."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,Need to see it in order to know how the real story was.
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes greatness lies in making a plot that virtually has no story so enjoyable and intriguin, even with a dose of sentiment."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,I absolutely loved this movie. The first few minutes moved a little slow but it soon changed and I was complete enthralled in every scene. I was moved. I felt like I was right there going on the journey with the main character until the end of the movie. It was hauntingly beautiful and the music is moving and powerful. I will buy this movie for home viewing
1917,4 February 2020,8/10,"The film has a spectacular direction, but fails with a generic script, which makes it a superficial war film, which is saved by its direction, but it doesn't make it a masterpiece"
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"A movie that excels in all areas.Technically- visually amazing. The one shot camera works really well for 98% of the film (only missing on some fairly important reaction shots), it especially helps during scenes of tension. Lighting is done really well considering the work arounds they had to go though, and there's one scene where they use creative lighting to create the most spectacular images. Sound is amazing too, my first watch through I barely noticed it as it blended so well with the scenes - it definitely helps set a tone (especially in the Van).Story and characters - brilliantly done. So many movies miss this mark (in my opinion) but the characters we are presented with are so lovable and real and it's hard not to get attached to the two main boys. The others all do their roles amazingly well with either setting up a sense of danger, being a helpful - sympathetic, and so on (won't say for spoilers).
The story is so well told, brilliantly paced and just so well done. A simple story about a single day and it's told to perfection. Things from the start come back later (which is always fun and rewarding to the viewer). It also shows the daily horrors of war in a casual way and it is most haunting.I adore this film and recommend it to everyone and anyone."
1917,5 February 2020,10/10,Only thing unacceptable was that the short and fat one died. It should have been the tall and skinny one.
1917,13 February 2020,8/10,"Firstly lets get something out the way, if you're expecting a war film with action on par to Saving Private Ryan, then this is the wrong film for you. It reminded me much more of Dunkirk, sporadic action but even in the slow bits still maintained a sense of tension, not know what would happen next gave it a more real feeling.
The one shot cinematography was very nicely done, combine that with an eerie score and beautiful sets, this film creates a sense of atmosphere rarely seen in movies today.
A few nice little cameos from some top British acting talent, so ye, good film, i can see why it won several Oscars."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"In two words, ""PUNK ROCK"". This movie makes/lets you experience the dark, unexplored side of a war.Generally, war movies are based on WW2. This one is inspired by the WW1 stories told by the director's grandfather. Due to his short height (5.1""), he was usually assigned the tasks of delivering the messages, crossing German territory. Inside the German borders, the mist used to hang at about 6 feet, so he wasn't visible above the mist.Thanks to the smart editing of the movie, it creates an illusion of the continuous shot. It leaves an immersive effect on spectators. You feel like you are also going inside the German borders with the two English soldiers. This movie is going to win three Oscars for sure : 1 Best movie, 2 Best Cinematography, and 3 Best sound mixing... and (Maybe, 4 Best director..)The story:
""Two young British soldiers, resting under a tree, receive new orders. They are instructed to pass on a message to the troops at the front line who are planning to attack the Germans, who have retreated. The English command, however, gets to know that the German withdrawal is a tactic, an operational Trojan horse. The telephone lines are down. The two messengers must quickly traverse the dangerous ground and physically deliver the order to the fellow British troops who might charge directly into a German trap, thereby saving countless lives. Among those troops, one soldier is the elder brother of the messenger ""Lance Corporals Blake"".They go to a nerve-shattering journey: an unfortunate barbed-wire encounter, a mysterious bunker to contend with, a German warplane crash-landing, an intense clash with German soldiers during the night, and swimming through the blood-freezing water of a German river.In their dangerous mission, one of those two soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake, gets martyred.""According to me, the most emotional scene is the conversation between the surviving messenger and the elder brother of the martyred messenger.There wasn't a single person in the audience with dry eyes when the elder brother of the martyred messenger asked the surviving messenger, ""ohh!! My brother has also come! Where is he?""."
1917,10 February 2020,9/10,"The filming impeccable, the acting was amazing and the story line which was based on a true truly breathtaking.
I would recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to go and watch it whilst it is still in cinema!"
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,Great movie. A must watch. Really enjoyed it. Great acting and everything. Hollywood needs to make more movies like this.
1917,12 February 2020,9/10,I saw this movie in cinema and its one of the best movies I have seen this year. I love the cinematography and highly recommend everyone sees this movie.
1917,12 February 2020,10/10,"Everything was just incredible. Must watch.
Production: 10
Acting:10
Visuals: 10"
1917,2 March 2020,10/10,It only has like 3 shots and produces one of the most beautiful scenes in movie.
1917,2 March 2020,10/10,It only has like 3 shots and haves one of the most beautiful scenes in movie history.
1917,20 February 2020,10/10,"1917 was a masterpiece, it showed you the true terror and feelings of being there in that war, and the losses of your loved ones. When Tom died, the protagonist had to keep going no matter what, and although I was heart broken, sobbing in the theater, I as well had no time and had to keep going. Every second that I watched, I was tipping out my seat, terrified of what was going to happen to your protagonist. Although you don't learn much about the protagonist or their life, you still wonderfully get drawn to that character and attached. Some people may view the women and the baby scene as unnecessary, but it really did have a purpose. When our protag is asked if he himself has children by the women, he has no response. We later find out at the very end he does have a family, but the reason we find out why he didn't explain was to think about his family is too much to bare. The amount of things he goes through is truly tragic, and when he finally sits at that tree at the end, your heart spills out. It hurts to have all those feelings at the end come out, and the story did have such a deep meaning to me. Thank you for being one of the best movies I have ever watched. Also mind me, the one shot idea was amazing. I do wonder if the protag did end up dying after the movie though. It wasn't like the war ended that very second. I do speculate that he didn't though. My reasons are because 1917 was based on the creator's father, and his hardships in war."
1917,29 February 2020,3/10,"Wow where do i start? Of course seeing Tommen from GOT isn't pleasureable and he dies very soon and in the most rook way. He's all oh yeah no body's stopping me in the beginning and 30 mins later he's gone. Like ok bro. Then we got the other guy who like you can't tell whether to feel bad for or not. He cheats death like 5 times? That was some nonsense. Hmmm i enjoyed the settings, outfits, and seeing Rob Stark that was it. The last scene too where that lieutenant is all tough and stuff and then 5 seconds of looking at a sheet falls off the attack. Cmon now. One of the weakest war movies I've ever seen, i don't reccomend anyone to watch this, Honeslty truly embarrassing of a film. If you enjoyed this i feel bad for you, your opinion probably suck and your friends think your a loser. Get help."
1917,1 March 2020,8/10,"The movie is good, i will put a little more of action but it´s ok"
1917,1 March 2020,9/10,"Personally, I've always wanted a First world war movie with a budget of more than a indie project, and 1917 fulfilled this role, and more.
Spoiler Alert! You've been warned!
1. The Plot: It's simple. Two soldiers are tasked with delivering an urgent message or 1600 men (Along with one of the twos's brother) will fall into a german trap and die. The way it goes about this is what stunned me. One second your telling a funny story, the next your holding your dead friend. It never bogs down, even in the slower parts, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. One minor problem I have, is that they could develop the characters a little more, but that doesn't matter much.
2. The cinematography: It is amazing, like everyone else says. The 'one continuous shot"" thing actually works, and I could only count one time where they made a cut. There were also scenes that genuinely took my breath away. The Town being lit up by flares (for example) is easily the best cinematography I've ever seen, and one of the best scenes of the entire decade.
Conclusion: One of the best movies of the year, and sure contender for best picture 1917 is an incredible, gritty joy ride but is ever so slightly bogged down by less character development.
9.6/10"
1917,3 March 2020,10/10,"This film is brilliant, extraordinary , moving... I think you get it, I loved that movie. Throughout the film we could see special effects such as the crash of German plane. All these effects and all the scenes were extremely well filmed. The director managed to make this film very dynamic without reminding us of the long history of the war. We followed the two soldiers on their grueling mission, which cost one of them his life... It was a very emotional moment beacause he died trying to save a German soldier from the flames. I think anyone would have been moved by that scene. Also, the last scene of the film is really touching. In this film, Shaw Mendes showed us that thrilled to see this film and to see the heroic deed these two soldiers performed."

In this film, Shaw Mendes showed us that in spite of the war and these disastrous conditious of living there was a form of hope and humanity. Nevertheless, I find that the director did not put much emphasis on the war in general. It was not at all extended in time and we hust saw a few days of these difficult moments. That is my only regret. After seeing this film I understand very well why it received a prestigious award at ta ceremony that took place this weekend in London. I was thrilled to see this film and to see the heroic deed these two soldiers performed."
1917,14 March 2020,6/10,"The cinematography and general artistry were impressive and no doubt majorly influenced such positive reviews. I was a little disappointed with the two leads' acting. It seemed overcooked quite often, almost slapstick, which didn't resonate with the film's otherwise ultrarealistic aspirations. A few other reality checks would also have improved the believability index. Examples: Soldiers have always been trained never to let go of their weapon, but this happened too easily. Also leaving his helmet behind even as ordinance and danger intensified. Beautiful and purposeful as the forest a capella ballad scene is, would an exhausted stumbling combatant manage to infiltrate a military division at the front line, unnoticed much less unchecked, sit down and enjoy the stirring performance as portrayed? To tweak these issues would have increased engagement, without compromising essential artistic licence. The tone would be more smoothly maintained and enhanced. Maybe the passing off WWI survivors has left a gap in the veteran consultancy industry."
1917,21 March 2020,10/10,"An impressive movie that shows a big idea,every shot has a meaning,The photography is AWESOME,camera fill the gap that actors cant fill, shows emotions,tells the story and prepare the audience for next thing happens"
1917,25 March 2020,1/10,"Interesting story, but read about it. Not worth the 2 hours of your life it robs from you."
1917,7 July 2020,9/10,"I'm personally not the biggest fan of war movies. But when many among my friends told me that the movie and the graphics was wonderful, I was interested and wanted to watch this.
Most war films are intense but this goes to a whole new level in its own way. The film being set in one since quite a while ago shot is remarkable however works splendidly.
1917 is the latest Oscar bait war movie to come out, though this time set in World War 1. An instinctive, enthusiastic and effective depiction of WW1. It finds the perfect balance between a moving story and depicting the harsh realities of trench warfare.
The story line is basic, possibly a little to shortsighted for a few, however I for one think it was done deliberately on account of how the film is shot. It's fundamentally a race with time as the opponent, move across hostile area, against horrendous chances, and spare huge death toll.
The film follows 2 soldiers Lance-Corporals Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Will Schofield (George McKay) who are crossing enemy lines to deliver a message in the first World War. However, their task is far from easy & plain sailing as they encounter many dangers ahead of them.The script is spare but gripping as not just MacKay and Chapman put in great performances; there are also great supporting turns by Mark Strong, Colin Firth , Nabhaan Rizwan and Benedict Cumberbatch.
The on-screen characters exhibit exceptionally common, stunning cinematography, realistic locations, wonderful score and a genuine bleeding edge war understanding, this film really lived up the advertised and is the following best film since Hacksaw Ridge was released a couple years back.
Those who haven't watch the movie yet thinking of boring war movie, I recommend you all to watch it , believe me its different and you won't be bored."
1917,5 April 2020,10/10,"This film is inspiring!
While watching 1917, I found myself absorbed with a sense of stress and desire by every scene.
The behind-the-scenes of the film is only reinforces the great work.An inspiration for many artists in the industry."
1917,6 April 2020,7/10,"Besides the great direction, landscape and cast i think that the plot is quite boring actually.
The main problem is the ""heat"".
When the action started after couple of seconds it stopped to show something irrelevant and this kinda of thing happened multiple times. As a result it was boring and distracting."
1917,23 April 2020,10/10,"It is absolutely masterwork, everyone have to watch this film.I beg u pls watch this.I have never seen like this."
1917,16 August 2020,10/10,Just awesome.My respect towards the soldiers increased 1000 folds after watching it
1917,14 May 2020,8/10,"This is undoubtedly a good film. It can be seen that the director is very attentive, and the actor's acting skills are also remarkable. The performance is very meticulous, which can arouse the interest of the audience. I like every role in it. Every actor is very attentive in performing."
1917,14 May 2020,9/10,It's one of the most tense and exciting movies I ever seen
1917,15 May 2020,9/10,Don't watch it because you must be will love it very much.
1917,19 May 2020,9/10,"This film left me completely drained, absolutely stunning piece of cinema. Highly recommended."
1917,20 May 2020,5/10,"I was disappointed! I've seen other WWI movies, and I just thought this was the same."
1917,3 October 2020,6/10,"It has great acting and the production is well made! Love the camera view throughout the whole movie and it kept me interested, but, I expected so much more because it have 8,3 rating. I was like ""damn, this movie should be awesome!!"" But I got pretty disappointed. I think this one deserves a 6.5 or at it's very most a 7.0 rating, definitely not an 8.3!"
1917,9 June 2020,9/10,This movie is great in depicting the actual gruesome of war and making it all look as if it is one shot definitely helped. 1917 shows the progression of war where everyone fights for survival and nationalistic obligations. I loved how it is a combination of Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan; both balanced on a razor blade.
1917,19 June 2020,10/10,Absolutely beautiful. I was so impressed by all aspects of this movie that I almost didn't want it to end when I saw it in the cinema. It was touching and terrifying all at the same time and its definitely a firm favourite now.
1917,13 July 2020,10/10,"I just can say that 1917 is a miracle of filmmaking that I will never forget, all of the scenes in this movie are flawless to me and its hidden cuts has made this movie more attractive.
I have ever watched it 3 times and still able to watch it 10 more times."
1917,24 June 2020,9/10,A very good filmed story which shows how the world war 1 vas.
1917,23 August 2020,10/10,"Knew nothing of this film before seeing, so no expectations but what an amazing experience.The story, acting, directing etc are incredible.
The set design / production is beyond words.This movie tells the story of the horrors and small triumphs of war in a way that is equally disturbing and awful, yet beautiful and cinematic.This movie is not a light hearted fun fest or a justice triumphs hero movie. It is the savagery of real life presented in cinematic quality second to none.The continual scene flow style drags the viewer along in an unstoppable and inevitable fashion, giving you the sense of being inside the experience along with the characters.Brilliant to watch.
Best movie of 2020 so far easily."
1917,4 October 2020,10/10,"Amazing! Everything about this movie is beautiful, and though most would say the plot is basic and simple i found it perfectly fit the style and characters of the movie. Truly emotional and engaging."
1917,21 October 2020,10/10,Just perfection in every way. Felt like I was there. Obviously glad I wasnt
1917,23 November 2020,10/10,"The message of this movie is as great as it's cinematography.This film is about Perseverance through hard times and fulfilling your duty.
Because of the plot and it's message it appeals to any good-willing man, who seeks to do the right thing even in the hardest of circumstances; to anyone trying to make the most out of their lives.It also appeals to the average cineast because of its cinematography. The one-take method and the position of the camera gives you an intimate relation to the main characters as they struggle to complete their mission, fulfill their destiny, and become great.
The plot is flawless, as the characters and their development.
For example, in the beginning Will Schofield gets angry at his friend for choosing him to go on the mission; he's scared. But as the movie progresses he pushes through the difficulties and finishes the mission. He also goes above and beyond: he doesn't rest until he has fulfilled his friend's death wish.
It's also historically accurate: even the ammo capacity of the Lee Enfield Mk was realistic, I'm no historian but I didn't notice any blatant laws.In conclusion, it's historically accurate WW1 movie with superb cinematography, flawless plot as well as characters, and a great message.I recommend it to all men, specially young men who seek virtue, and for women and young women so they know what to look for in a man."
1917,21 November 2020,9/10,"For me it's one of the best, a great mix of drama, action and thrill. Showing the reality of everything not just making US or England so brave and intelligent as most of war movies, also showing the human side in each character which was a smart add to the story by showing war lovers and rational also who is escaping from his past or life and many other side stories. In short way it made me feel world war 2."
1917,21 November 2020,10/10,"Best film I have ever seen, good acting, camera work is fantastic."
1917,14 September 2021,10/10,"It took a while for me to watch this film. I just didn't feel like sitting through a war movie with all that has been going on. But today I finally felt I was ready to sit through one of the best I've seen.Sure, I knew about the long shots, the enormous amount of prizes and the terrific camera work. I just didn't know the story, yet.If you don't like war movies with explosions, gunfights and dead bodies, then maybe this is not your kind of movie. But I would strongly advise you to give it a go. Not only will your eyes enjoy amazing actors (lead and supporting), great visuals (decor and clothing) and camera work that will give you the feeling you are joining their quest. Your ears will be pleasantly amused by music, sound and speech as well. Man, I almost died when I heard 'wayfaring stranger' in acapella!I hardly ever give out 10 stars, but they deserved it!1917 will definitely hold a spot in my top 5 for a very long time."
1917,6 January 2021,10/10,The one shot thing is amazingly working the story is real and the shots are awesome
1917,4 April 2021,10/10,"There's nothing here to analize or really discuss . Watch it, experience it. It leaves no words to be said, the movie speaks for itself."
1917,2 January 2021,2/10,"This movie is bad. You discover just how bad it is pretty soon, I realised when the general tells the soldier he was chosen to go save the other army because his brother is in it. Worse, the soldier doesn't have to go far at all, I could have run it in 3 or 4 hours. But he needs water, food, a friend to take with? Really? Contrived and unbelievable, and so was the rest of the movie.Cinematography? Unfortunately no one told me before I watched it that it was made with some special technique that is really hard to do, so I thought the cinematography was nothing special. In fact, check out the part where the soldier is at night in a town more or less in a war zone, and tell me that that is not really bad cinematography. It doesn't look real. And nor do most of the scenes. Other war movies are much more real. Now go read that review by a ""war veteran"". If he really is a war vet, he must have a very bad memory. So much for the fancy filming technique, I'm pretty sure no one will try that again. At least I hope not.But how is it possible that such a movie could get rave reviews from so many? I discovered the answer by speaking to someone who raved about it. In fact, it was on his advice I wasted my time watching it. Apparently he didn't notice any of the many, many contrived and totally unbelievable events and scenes. If you think about it, the movie loses all meaning, and a person stops enjoying it, only after they notice the weird stuff going on. After that, you just want to leave, as I did.So how did the majority of the people who watched this movie, and all the critics, not notice any of these weird happenings, most of which have been described by the few bad reviews here?I don't know. I know I'm in good company, just read the bad reviews vs the good. I will resolve this conundrum by concluding that most people are idiots."
1917,20 January 2021,9/10,The lives of soldiers are a stressful life. The filming and directing are also wonderful and it is one of the best films that you can watch from the directing side
1917,26 January 2021,3/10,I mean cmon. It is very hard to enjoy a movie when the main character is being shot straight on from 10 feet away and the enemy completely misses this movie should have ended 20 minutes in but the plot armor is so thick that the main character dodges every single shot. Unrealistic
1917,6 March 2021,9/10,"The film dazzles at each step, one encounter and adventure after another shot like a set piece, complete in itself with MacKay's stoic presence adding to the pathos and poignancy."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,A visceral experience from start to finish. The lingering shots on our lead tells you all you need to understand his struggle and his motives. No other film has had such an emotional impact on me. I highly recommend a visit to the cinema for this one.
1917,10 May 2021,10/10,The cinematography is amazing and the storyline is super tense and exiting with many ups and downs!!
1917,22 October 2021,9/10,"Best movie to do with ww1 I think.One of the best war movies over of all time.Making look like the whole movie was just one shot was, just great.Also loved looking around in the background of shoots to see what the extras was doing. I want to watch the movie agian, just so I can look in the background of shoots and see what I missed the first time."
1917,13 September 2021,4/10,"1917 is a well produced & directed movie.The problem is,it's runtime is to long
& the movie is very slow & very,very boring &
Uneventful!!"
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"While the movie was enjoyable, it doesn't live up to the accolades it's receiving.The stylistic long shots are a welcome change of pace in an era where 3-second clips are spliced together have become the norm. The flaw in pacing the entire movie in the characters' real-time is it doesn't allow much meat on the bone when it comes to story or character depth. It's too much of a good thing."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,Very likely the best movie I have ever seen. Amazing from beginning to end.
1917,5 July 2020,7/10,"An excellent depiction of action and the film was second to non but actors failed to portray the real horror of WW1 for me. I will watch it again but just for the cinematography alone. Oscars well deserved, a fantastic depiction of scene, I felt I was running along with the action.7 over all but 10/10 for Cinematography."
1917,28 January 2020,8/10,It really makes me nervous. It surely has its own achievement in one take continous filming techniques. Most of the time I was involved inside the movie just like a one person PlayStation 4 video game (call of duty or something like that) but with their emotional factors and fear resources that are fully used. It's totally recommened
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"I haven't ever written a review on here before, although I always read them, but am moved to do so after watching 1917 last night. Quite simply a masterpiece from start to finish. Two hours of gripping, expertly filmed story-telling. Much has been said of the ""one shot"" effect, but it really does build tension and immerse you in the story like no film, for me, has ever done before. The unknown lead actors and the well-known actors in supporting roles gel together brilliantly, and I for one was transported through time and space and when the credits rolled I was left stunned, blinking, wondering what had just happened and how on earth Sam Mendez had managed it. Quite simply spectacular."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Intense, heart stopping, shocking, traumatising, raw, sad, heartwarming all rolled into one. This film - with a simple storyline - reveals the horrors of war yet pulls you into the characters as if you're there experiencing it with them. I was on the edge of my seat one minute, feeling sad the next, and finished the film reflecting on what it must have been like for those who fought for us to have the freedom we have today. Usually when the credits come on in the cinema, everyone rushes up to leave. Not this film; the whole cinema was silent and still, even while the credits were rolling. I have no other words to describe this emotional rollercoaster, other than to go and see it!"
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"I've just left the cinema after watching 1917 and I'm not ashamed to say that I've just cried my heart out.What a powerful film with beautiful and painstakingly clear cinematography. Perfectly timed emotion invoking elements within a perfect and perfectly executed script.Oh such excellence in direction and camera work, together with superb acting.Shame about the unnecessary ""F*"" words which probably would not have been common in 1917. Why do they have to be included in this script?"
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"This film is a masterpiece, pure and simple. Reminiscent of Gallipoli in its plot, but much more intense. I felt the ending was a tad disappointing, and it had a few oddities (doesn't ink run when paper gets soaked?). But it was otherwise powerful and beautiful."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"I'll get my 1 ""negative"" out of the way first, and it's not really a negative at all. The film is promoted as the cameras never leaving the 2 primary actors (or at least one of them). Counting the opening shot, the camera does indeed leave them -- 10 times. But even those are almost all the viewpoints of one or both of those characters.
A fictional story that nonetheless doesn't shy away from the horrors and humanity of war, it is worth the watch, and is sure to win lots of awards."
1917,8 April 2020,10/10,"The acting, directing and cinematography was top notch...it gave you a sense of almost being there!"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Everything about this film was beautiful. The acting was superb, from everyone. The cinematography and visuals were engaging and real. The music was perfect. I was seriously hooked immediately and the movie never lost me. George Mackay did a fantastic job. I really can't say enough good about it. I wouldn't say it was as emotional or intense as Saving Private Ryan, but it was just as good!"
1917,19 January 2020,9/10,"One long shot from start to finish, you follow two men on a journey across enemy lines to save an entire battalion of men including the brother of one of them. Great performances, brilliantly shot to show the horrors of war, and riveting from start to finish, this is a movie you definately should see."
1917,11 February 2020,6/10,"Given that it is a bug budget historic war epic I was not expecting anything groundbreaking. But this follows every rule in the book and is so hideously predictable that it fails to excite and is often boring. Thank you for the CGI rats to offer at least a bit of emotion. Like with a lot of modern films, this is a movie we could all easily do without.
Lowest point for me was the cinematography. It is that Matthew Libatique working with Aranofsky (think Black Swan) sight abuse. I know it's the modern style of camerawork but that does not make it less insulting for the eyes.
Despite all the shortcomings Sam Mendes is brilliant, so is most of the cast. Always lovely to see Cumberbatch and Strong, Andrew Scott is very refreshing here, would have loved to see more of him.
This is not a bad film or complete failure, it's just lacking. Weak script, mediocre picture balanced out by great directing and acting. Worth the watch, not worth the hype."
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"Extraordinary stuff, put together to seem like one continuous shot with the camera dancing rings around the characters. It is virtually impossible to see any cuts, the whole thing, apart from a fade-out/ fade-in two thirds the way through, appears to happen in two hours of real-time.The script is intelligent and loaded. ""When you give the orders (to abort the attack) to Colonel Mackenzie, make sure there are witnesses. Some people like to fight."", the settings are astonishing, the camerawork remarkable. And the story is riveting. The sequence where the protagonist runs 300 yards across the field of advancing soldiers must be one of the great sequences in movie history.
It is difficult not to wax lyrical about this filmIt's clear to see why this won Best Dramatic Film at the Golden Globes, and it now seems destined to win the 2020 Best Film Oscar, too ( a week away at time of writing). Certainly a second Oscar must be a formality for Sam (American Beauty) Mendes as director.
Alas, I had hoped for an Oscar win for Quentin Tarrantino. Unless the Acadeny has an attack of sentimentality at ignoring the great Tarantino for so long, that is a forlorn hope.However, I'll bet on him getting his THIRD screenplay Oscar.Film as a creative art form, despite the plethora of Disney remakes and Star Wars rehashes, is alive and well."
1917,10 January 2020,6/10,"1917 is wonderfully shot but poorly written. Each of the approximately 9-minute segments is neatly interwoven into the next, but it's not enough.First, 1917 is more of a bad thriller than a good drama. Early jump-scares keep you on your toes, but predicting the next jump-scare becomes more important than the story itself because there is little story to begin with. Surprisingly; it is only when the lead characters are being shot at that you feel they are safe.Second, the film does not find balance. Cliché writing gives the impression that things conveniently ""work out,"" while body-strewn battlefields contradict that impression. The result is a feeling of being caught in the crossfire between idealism and realism. I left feeling like I had dipped my toes in two pools without diving into either."
1917,17 January 2020,7/10,"For me this is a solid 7 out of 10. It achieves my main objective of not having a contrived storyline whilst indulging in too many myths which surround the war. It was gritty, superbly shot, decently acted and had some genuinely beautiful moments in. There are only a few bits which let it down. And it is only a few. Some of the action sequences were a bit too unrealistic. And some of the dialogue was a bit awkward. But overall these things detract very little from what is a solidly good film in a war which is seldom touched by filmmakers."
1917,1 June 2020,7/10,"I am well aware this movie will be great at cinematic shots, this part was very well done. However, the story itself fall apart as it unfold, it was rather linear and sometimes forced. Without giving out any spoilers, I would point to ignore the story but enjoy the feast of filming.The most part bothered me from the story was William do not act as like a well trained soldier, may be he never is one in the first place. Simple common sense and logic seems lacking especially they know their path will likely across German defend.It was quite a let down when I was thristed to watch and enjoy a great war movie, sadly this one did not deliver."
1917,14 April 2020,3/10,"I think there are at least two dozens of much better and entertaining war films, some of them from even eighty years ago.
I found it quite boring from the scene where the Lance Corporal encounters the sniper; the long scene with the girl and the baby; after he is ¿shot? by the sniperand when he finds the soldiers singing. The film drops its pace substantially during those what, ¿20 minutes? Somewhat it improves when he meets his friend's brother but to my feeling, it never gets to an 8.4 rating.
Could have been omitted some scenes, including these two and the film just might have deserved a better rating. In one word, disappointing."
1917,6 January 2020,10/10,"When I first heard that this movie was going to be following the one-shot technique, I was hesitant to watch it. There is a reason why cuts are made. So that the eyes don't get stuck on one scene for too long and the viewer loses interest.
But while watching the movie, the way Mendes and his cinematographer cleverly use their sets and surroundings to change the scene and the location of the camera without having to cut... For that type of coordination and control, a lot of effort went into set building and scene planning with cast and crew.Basically, the cinematography was brilliant.That, and a really good cast of talented actors with incredible music from Thomas Newman...Of course the movie won best picture drama at the golden globes.Do yourself a favor and watch it."
1917,27 November 2020,6/10,"Attention was paid to trying to depict some horrors of WWI, but too many of the characters actions didn't make sense."
1917,5 February 2020,1/10,"A war movie made for 5 years old children, predictable with lots of stupid arguments, who send only 2 soldiers to save 1600 men?"
1917,1 February 2021,10/10,"I just saw the movie and I can still feel the touch of the last tear. It is just beautiful. One of those you wish it never ends, one of those that make you hate the wars and wish the bloody things will never happen again. It makes you feel a drop into the ocean, a point into the sky, it makes you cry for the hundreds of thousands of prematurely death people because of some idiot roulers. The music really makes you feel part of the epic journey. Enjoy! Great acting too."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,I was skeptical if it would live up to the hype it had received. It did. It absolutely did. It felt like you were there. It's one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
1917,14 April 2020,6/10,"Most overrated movie of 2019., for me the writing just wasn't good enough. I could not sympathize with the characters. Great music and cinematography but those two things failed to connect to the story, frankly i was glad when the movie finally ended."
1917,3 February 2020,1/10,"Unless a family member is in this movie, don't do it!"
1917,30 January 2020,1/10,The worst movie ever. Don't waste your time. I don't know why the rate is 8.5. If I could I would give -10
1917,12 February 2020,10/10,The one shot style the movie was shot in combined with the great acting makes this a must-see movie. Historically accurate and the best movie in 2020 so far.
1917,14 February 2020,7/10,I'm so conflicted after having just seen this movie. There were lots of parts I liked but also lots that left me frustrated and bemused.If you've ever played the 'Call of duty' video franchise then you'll be familiar with lots of the scenes where there'll be items available for pick up or little safe havens.It is visually fantastic but I really left the theatre wondering whether I liked it or not.
1917,22 February 2020,9/10,"A different take on the war movie genre. The movie is well made, well acted and decently paced. Even though the genre is a little overcrowded, I would recommend watching this movie. Keep your expectations tempered though, as this one is not as good as the greatest war movies."
1917,6 June 2020,3/10,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It seemed like a bunch of cut screens from a war video game sewn together. There was no tension. The characters make the absolute dumbest most counterintuitive decisions. No consequences and dude more bullet proof than John Wick. My advice is to spend your 2 hours watching something better and less insulting to your intelligence.
1917,24 February 2020,6/10,"Plain, pale, plot hole-ridden, incredibly overrated. No doubt the cinematography is good, but the story is soulless.O how I miss the time of Saving Private Ryan!"
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"Keep in mind, war movies are not really my thing. Some get preachy on this topic or another (usually ""war is bad"" or ""(insert opposition name here) were evil""). I was ready for a message of some sort. How wrong I was! From remarkable writing, engrossing action, stellar acting, compelling storyline, and being along with the main actors...top notch all the way with nary a message or lesson.
The cameos were long enough to provide some detail or help while short enough to be important to the storyline. Any goofs are not noticeable nor do they detract. I felt as if I were along with them: ducking shrapnel, doing this job, feeling time pinch, nervous, and curious.
Very much worth a watch. Especially since it is an ""A"" game film all around."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"This movie starts and does not stop! The suspense rivals an intense Stephen King horror movie, except this is every bit the most realistic suspense you can experience on film. The acting is fantastic, the story is exceptional, but the setting and camera work puts you there. I felt transported back 100 years to the Western Front and the hell, anxiety and horror that the First World War truly was. The characters are likable and engaging. This movie rivals Saving Private Ryan in its intensity. It also has occasional subtle laughs to break up the tense plot. There are hints of warmth and humanity in an otherwise dark, cold brutal war movie. The best movie I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend!"
1917,7 August 2021,8/10,Not a moment of dullness. Great sound track. Believable story. Outstanding acting.
1917,8 April 2020,7/10,"Saw this a bit overrated in a theater. Though the storyline is a bit thin, this movie shows the madness of warfare during WWI. Great shots btw."
1917,19 January 2020,4/10,While visually it is well made it is the most boring sleeper I've ever seen!
1917,13 December 2019,10/10,Guaranteed Oscar. A technical and visual triumph. Bravo Roger Deakins!
1917,16 February 2020,7/10,Truely a beautiful film for it's visuals and the way it was filmed. In terms of content though I was a bit disappointed. The plot was very weak losely following the 'saving private ryan' theme and there were some 'cheesy' moments with the woman with the baby etc. The beginning and end were very good but the middle just dragged and was a bit painful. I expected more from the hype and expected to be totally gobsmacked as I was with saving private ryan and black hawk down but this doesn't make my top 20 of war films.
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Title says it all.
There's not many films where you can go to the cinema and be glued to the screen from start to finish, but this definitely does that.
From the moment I sat down to the moment the credits rolled up I was in suspense. The way this was filmed was on another level, which grips all the audience.
I have recommended to everyone who has asked about it and even to those who have not.
I watched it in a Superscreen which added to the cinematic experience.
A must see."
1917,7 February 2020,9/10,"I'm not one who enjoys war films. I often find them boring and action-less. So to say I was apprehensive to see 1917 in the cinema was an understatement.Faultless.Mesmerising.Compelling.Emotional.Just some of the superlatives I could use to describe this film. It deserves every award it has been nominated for, especially those it has already won. The combination of Mendes' direction and Deakins' cinematography make for medium rare excellence. It was cooked just right.The attention to detail and effort it must have took to make this film flow as one continuous shot deserves the Oscar for Best Film alone. I couldn't recommend this piece higher. I'd recommend you see it in IMAX!"
1917,5 March 2020,10/10,"The plot is weak but amazing acting and cinematography more than make up for that. I liked the film enough to see it a second time on an imax screen. If you can, choose imax."
1917,19 December 2019,5/10,"If you have seen Saving Private Ryan and practically any other war movie you will recognize all of these tropes:"" No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"" - after saving the life of an enemy combatant
""Language Barrier Encounter with a Female"" - however she just happens to know enough English to convey her love
""The Combat Fatigued Soldier"" - snivelling and crying , unable to lead men over the wall into battle
""Horrible Marksmanship by the Enemy"" and its cousin ""Pinpoint Marksmanship by the Hero""
""Gunshot Nicks and Grazes to the Hero Does Not Stop Him""I could go on,...but you get the point.Maybe I am too old and having seen nearly war movie, they are all starting to look the same."
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,I am awed by the cinematography and direction of this movie. Each and every aspect of this movie is in such details that I was left speechless after watching it
1917,14 February 2020,7/10,"I thought 1917 had a lot going for it: good acting, amazing cinematography, and a good story. The issue was that there wasnt much story within the story. You have the two main characters, and you do get into the mission at hand; however, there wasnt much going on other than a constant following of them moving to get from point A to point B. I do not see how people are putting this on a level of say Saving Private Ryan. That movie had so much more going on, including way more characters, better screenplay, and an equally good if not better storyline. I rated this a 7, and I think it should settle between 7-7.5."
1917,5 January 2020,10/10,Amazing. Almost too good. Don't have much to say other than SEE this. It feels like a video game.
1917,14 September 2020,3/10,"This movie could have been a statement against war, a statement against nationalistic ideology, it could have pointed out the madness of war, of this war in particular. Instead it is just another English war hero movie with some artsy scenes that aims to be interpreted as 'very deep'. Germans are depicted as corrupt, inhonorable, cheaty swines throughout the entire movie, an inhuman, overpowered, immorale enemy that deserves no mercy. Our English hero is facing this enemy and -what a surprise- is successful in doing so. What a disgrace to our century, to history and to our society. In times of our-country-first attitude and even nationalism rising in many European counties, this is exactly the movie we don't need. I wish I could spit in the makers face."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"Beautiful cinematography, emotional score & George MacKay was exquisite! Why he isn't nominated for any awards is beyond me!"
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"Wonderful cinematography, beautiful pictures, great directing throughout the multiple minute-long shots.
Must be seen in cinema!"
1917,10 March 2020,9/10,"I have never been a massive fan of war movies because of all the distracting explosions and chaotic nature of war. However, this film was shot in a way that lets you follow the main characters in a very immersive way, almost like you're sharing the journey with them. Distractions are there obviously but this film captures the chaos and makes you feel like you're part of it. If I had to compare the cinematography to something (and certainly not to undermine it at all), I would compare it to a 'call of duty' game because it's filmed in a first person style way. This has been done before with others film titles but never quite so elegantly in my opinion.Overall the visuals were stunning, the acting was excellent and the true story was mind-blowing. A masterful film with a 9 out of 10 rating from me - a must see."
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"...other than this film deserves multiple Oscars, including the cameraman!"
1917,17 April 2020,8/10,"Excellent war drama amazing, direction from mendes strong performances from the actors, don't expect something like platoon or saving pt Ryan, this film is all about the relationships between the characters."
1917,10 January 2020,1/10,"2 men go for a walk, the end! I can't think of anything else to write but I have to type more as my review is too short to submit. That's done it."
1917,27 March 2020,10/10,"I don't write movie reviews, and this is my first in my 70+ years, so forgive me but I am new at this. Oddly, I thought no movie would ever replace my all time favorite, Lawrence of Arabia, which strangely was also about WW I and a real British hero. Once it starts you cannot stop watching it and it brought me to tears at the end. You are with these brave soldiers all through it as an unseen witness.I watched 1917 last night and again this afternoon, for two reasons:1. Sam Mendez had a great uncle who inspired him to write, direct, and produce this movie. So did I. My great uncle, fought along side Major Charles Whittlesey,
during the American effort to end WW I in 1918. He was a survivor of the Lost Battalion in October of 1918 where only 194 were rescued, and 197 KIA, the rest never found or captured out of 554 men. If this movie inspires you to learn more about the Great War, that most have forgotten, I recommend: Finding the Lost Battalion, Robert, Laplander, Lulu Press, 2nd Ed, 2007, 611 pp.I wanted to get some idea of what my great uncle suffered in that War, beyond the diary he left me of those terrible days in the ""Pocket"" and all the medals he was awarded for his bravery along with Major Whittlesey, his hero, serving as his aid-de-camp and interpreter for German prisoners.2. I needed to escape for a few hours away from all the current gloom and doom of the world's current War against an insidious virus. I thought there might be some lessons to learn in courage, bravery, sacrifice, and good and evil of mankind during all our wars against illness and each other.Impressions:1. I have never seen a movie like this. The entire movie is shot with camera angles between 0-6 feet from the ground, with the exception of a brief water fall scene. You are in the trenches, shell craters, open fields, rooms, and streets, day and night. You can feel the fear and sense what each actor is thinking. The scene at night with all the flares and fires with the music is something out of this world.2. The cinematography is spectacular and the sound was wonderful. I had to watch it on my 4K 65"" HDTV at home a second time today with my Sennheiser
headphones just to capture the sounds I would have heard in a theater now that they are all closed around here. It was fitting that both the first and last scenes of this movie were almost the same place for a complete emotional round trip to give some peace to everyone watching it.3. Although the story was fictional and was focused British soldiers in 1917, many Americans and others around the world, especially will sense
what real wars and battles are like against a common enemy, even a pandemic
virus. It will make you proud to think we all have heroes out there now fighting for our lives in hospitals now in the ""front lines"". The bottom line is we can fight any foe, anytime, and anywhere if we all pull together, like they did in this movie.
The minor flaws that others point out in this reviews miss the point. Any good war story needs a little humor and small miracles to break up the tension.If you want to get away from your day-to-day, and you are old enough, watch this movie, anyway you can. You will feel sad and scared at first, but proud and satisfied at the end, as you remember, life goes on. My final thought is that I hope Sam Mendez, might consider a sequel someday, ;maybe call it 1918 with the American perspective on WW I and contributions of our heroes like Major Whittlesey"
1917,18 September 2020,10/10,"I thought a lot about this movie and in the end, i can say its my new favorite movie of all time. The last time i walked out of the cinema so satisfied was Inception, but after 1917 the feeling was even better. Sure, there are many better acting performances in other movies, but the actors in 1917 made the best out of their short dialogs. The soundtrack was terrifying, beautiful, illuminating, exciting and fitted every scene. The movie shows on the point how ugly this war was. It's a simple story, but a movie doesn't need a high intelligent plot to be good. The best on this movie is for sure it's cinematography, it's a hole new experience to watch. There are many different movies/tv shows with one shot scenes, but the whole movie as a one shot is just extraordinary. Before i went in the cinema, i tought, it maybe will be a little bit hard to watch a movie in a full one shot, but it showed me, that exactley that made the movie different in a very very positive way.I highly recommend this movie for everyone, also for people, taht doesn't like war movies, because this movie is a exciting and incredible experience.Sorry for my bad english.."
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,I would give this movie a solid 6 for the cinematography and 1 for the story. It's very very boring. Everyone in the cinema was yawning every 10 min. If I want with friends I would have left 10min in the movie.Nothing really happens in the movie; some dude just walks from point A to point B to deliver a message which he fails to do it on time anyway.
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"Honestly one of the most beautiful pieces of cinematography I've ever seen. Using extremely minimal shots and having only one noticeable shot change in the entire film, this epic story grips you every second. This film holds you by the heart as it shows the hell on earth that changed the life's of millions during WW1. Please, please, I implore everyone to see this and experience a battle of emotions as you follow the characters mission across the frontlines."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"The cinematography is brilliant , and the story shows the courage and the selflessness of the British soldier which remains to this day 10 /10 from me ."
1917,18 March 2020,1/10,"An emosional drain on time. There is nothing to look forward to and nothing happens. Really, nothing! It was a dissapointment, no real acting needed due to the lack of progress in the film. Predictable and bland!"
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,"Not the best war film I've seen, not a lot acutally happens, the wrong main character dies. Around average and totally over rated"
1917,27 November 2020,6/10,"This movie was awful. One part ruined the entire movie for me. Well besides from the fact that this movie is literally 80% walkingThere's a scene at a barn where one guy wants to help a German instead of killing him, and the German ends up killing the guy who wanted to help him. They show NO anger or any emotion at the German, just shoot him and not mention anything. The friend should have smashed his head in or something. It was so stupid . A main character dead for the dumbest reason with no emotion from his friend . I hate this movie. All they did before this was walk. It's a movie about walking through trenches, that's it"
1917,6 February 2020,3/10,Like watching the same game of hide and seek for two hours. Watching this once was enough.
1917,14 January 2020,6/10,"I've just seen 1917 and have to say I expected more than it delivered.It is not a bad movie but it's certainly not a great one either as many would have you believe.The acting is ok and the scenery convincing but the pace is often slow and some action scenes defy belief.For some to compare it to Saving Private Ryan is fancifull.It prompted me to watch the latter again reminding me what a great film it really is.Despite all the hype surrounding 1917 I doubt it will be remembered by many in years to come,unlike Saving Private Ryan which remains a classic of it's genre over 20 years since it's release.."
1917,29 July 2020,10/10,"This has been one of the few times that during a movie I just stopped paying attention to everything around me and stood silently watching the screen with my mouth open. I deeply regret not going to see this movie in the theaters, it's simpley a masterpiece."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"The film should be compulsory viewing for everyone in the UK! Shown to every school child (15 and over) to serve as a reminder of what we all owe to the many that have sacrificed for us in the past. The film is not glamorous or indeed gruesome, it doesn't say 'hell, yes we did it!' or have a wholly negative spin in an attempt to prove a point. It shows us moments of friendship, sadness, courage, kindness, duty, fear and honour. I came away from the cinema knowing I had experienced something special. Thank you Sam Mendes for crafting this so well!"
1917,5 February 2020,9/10,"Harrowing tale of war, despair and determination told in a masterful way. Must watch for all the fans of the genre."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Such a visually, stunning and beautiful masterpiece. Could not take my eyes of the screen. If you get the chance watch it In IMAX. Sam Mendes can add a few oscars to go along with his golden globe and knighthood! Take a bow Sam and go and book your tickets for the cinema ASAP!"
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"After the disappointment of Dunkirk I was nervously looking forward to seeing 1917 and thankfully on this occasion the wait was well worth it.The cinematography is just mesmerising, it truly makes you feel as if you are there filming the whole series of events yourself.There's a solid storyline, superb acting and great pacing that made the nearly 2 hours in the cinema literally fly by.Go and see it, you won't be disappointed especially if you have an IMAX near you!"
1917,15 August 2020,1/10,"I've seen some good war movies in my time. This was the worse ever. Wooden acting, predictable scenarios. I felt like I was watching a pair of high school aspiring actors. What a waste of time 👎"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,This is like actually being there in the war. The film leaves a long lasting impact of getting some sense of what it was like in world war 1. Superbly made - excellent acting. Well worth seeing on the big screen
1917,8 February 2020,6/10,"Movies like that would be worth watching if left a sense of reality with the viewer. As a woman, I find it highly unlikely for soldiers and officer in the movie to display emotional weakness during wartimes. Especially as it's our granparents' generation (my grandpa fought during WW2). This generation was unlikely to show a lot of emotion, even towards immediate relatives such as btothers, sons, etc. This was the mentality of those Times. Men should not display emotions or weakness at any time. Otherwise, the movie reminder me somewhat of The War Horse, another case in Point."
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,If Amy Farrah Fowler reviewed 1917 she would ask why they didn't have the RAF deliver the message.
1917,26 March 2020,9/10,This film deserves all technical awards. shouldnt win anything else.yo be watched on the big screen
1917,24 February 2020,10/10,"1917, the most recent film by acclaimed director Sam Mendes (skyfall, American beauty), is a phenomenon to say the least. With a magnificent combination of excellent editing, superb acting and an outstanding score from Thomas Newman, 1917 is a rare example of absolute cinematic perfection. Like 2014s Birdman (A personal favorite of mine) 1917 has been, to my delight cut so cleanly it gives the illusion of a single take and like Birdman, it works exceptionally conveying a feeling of realism and desperation never before seen in a film. The movie is to my understanding shot entirely in Scotland, and Mendes makes use of the stunning landscapes whilst also creating his own sets providing a dramatic and even shocking contrast between the two. For example, The film opens in a luscious field full of plants and other wildlife, but very quickly as our protagonists enter the trenches you are introduced to the desolate wastes of No mans's land. Thomas Newman really does a fantastic job with the movie's soundtrack, which feeds wonderfully into the already immersive atmosphere. It strikes the perfect balance of being calm and soft in some instances, or extremely intense in others. Another thing that really stood out was the incredible sound design. Here, every gunshot has weight, causing each and every one to make you question whether or not it landed.
The cast is also brilliant, with each actor giving stellar performances and countless cameos from well renowned figures such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Richard Madden. The story remains consistent throughout the film keeping you guessing and on the edge of your seat at all times, but some could (maybe) argue that there were some minor pacing issues, but other than that there is no more I can say. 1917 is without a doubt an absolute masterpiece, and I recommend everyone watch it."
1917,23 August 2020,10/10,This is arguably the best war movie ever. Such an amazing cinematic experience.
1917,12 July 2020,10/10,"I have went to college for media, worked in media, been in films .... I am that person people hate watching films with because I break them down and appreciate great film work... this movie is a perfect 10!"
1917,21 January 2020,4/10,"I was really looking forward to watching this but was so disappointed with it well before the half way mark. The decision to make it look like it was shot in one take was the wrong one. It did not make me feel like I was in the movie at all. In fact, it was the polar opposite. There was no emotional investment for any of the characters either. We've seen this movie done 100 times before but also way better. I will never watch this mediocre war movie ever again as it was devoid of every single reason we go to the movies in the first place..... Entertainment!
I gave it a 5 for the musical score and the fact that it was just a middle of the road war movie. Mendes may have had an emotional attachment to the story, it's a pity none of it transpired to the screen."
1917,18 January 2020,4/10,"The movie starts off slowly hampered by unnecessary dialogue. Whilst the camera work is terrific, the movie lacks both drama and tension and the action scenes are below par.
With all the emphasis placed on making the movie realistic, which they did, the movie makers missed the target with the story line."
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,I don't feel like I know the characters at all. I have no idea why the two soldiers were friends or what they had been through together.The cinematography tried so hard to make this an emotional shocking movie that it had the opposite effect. War scenes with gratuitous up close views of corpses and body parts that don't add anything to the story got old quick.Good effects crappy movie.
1917,11 January 2020,6/10,"To put it succinctly, the movie is vividly full of both gorgeous environmental scenery and the horrific carnage of war.The storyline, on the other hand, is terribly empty coupled with some realism problems (i.e., as if they didn't hire a military advisor). It's like all the effort went into the former, and very little into the latter.To keep from any spoilers, I will put this generally, even in the film's culmination- which took nearly two hours to build- it felt utterly lackluster."
1917,26 May 2020,9/10,"I enjoyed this one. So much. Not as warlike as I thought (Cus i like war movies a lot so....) More of a drama with pieces of war. But who cares!The movie has been made to look like it's been filmed in just one shot. Some may find it boring because the main characters don't talk much and it's like following someone's morning routines without breaks. Everything is on camera, every movement, look and word.
We're talking about a war movie so basically there's always something going on, physically or mentally to the characters.I don't wanna give much away. Let's just say that I felt a lot of things while watching this and that is exactly what a movie should give."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"The film has no Good dialogue or best actors , but the film is a miracle of a cinematographic film. You do not see a movie. You live the experience of the movie. The soundtrack is great."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,This movie is a masterpiece like almost no other. It is a must watch. Raises the bar for cinema.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"What an extraordinary movie. I believe it's the most anxious and terrified I've ever been in a cinema watching a non horror movie. Everything works perfectly and smoothly that you just cant hate it. I believe the main ingredient for this masterpiece it's the long take that happens at real time with the plot. Outstanding work from the crew, the cast and Sam Mendes. Definitely deserves all the 10!!! nominations for this year's Oscars."
1917,20 June 2021,10/10,One of the best war movies ever and definitely didnt glorify war either just a great story of some of the sacrifices made for freedom. The cinematography and the soundtrack make for an excellent movie and Id have to say the best Ive seen this year.
1917,21 May 2020,10/10,"I always knew it would Win best Cinematography at the Oscars. But, Come On! Not winning best Picture or Original Screenplay is just Mystifying. And it should've Won best Director, as well. This film is a work of Art. And the Poetry about it is Mesmerising. Some things in life Baffle me, and 1917 not cleaning up at the Oscars is one of them."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"Hands down, a flawless masterpiece that became an instant classic on release day. Do yourself a favor and watch this on the big screen."
1917,17 February 2020,10/10,"An absolute beauty of a film, enjoyed every emotional second......."
1917,28 March 2020,10/10,In this movie every scene is epic.bgm music makes perfect movie best war movie i have seen
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,Saving Private Ryan in WWI but boring and tedious and unrealistic. OMG someone died in a war-stop the presses! I felt like Elaine watching the English Patient with Peterman.
1917,20 December 2019,10/10,"Not many films have been made on World War I, so I was interested in seeing what Sam Mendes would bring to the table when I went to an advanced screening of this. The movie is absolutely breathtaking and thrilling. The cinematography makes you feel as though you are joining these 2 soldiers every step of the way. Each action sequence in the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would definitely say this is an IMAX kind of film and highly recommend that everyone sees this in theaters for the best experience. This is without a doubt the best war film since Saving Private Ryan."
1917,13 September 2021,3/10,"Horrible movie; it's like a diary of 2 low IQ people into war with a mission to deliver a message. And that's it, nothing important happens and the history itself is a diary. There are no secondary caracters, villians, whatever, just the 2 main characters and all others are treated as extras."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,Except for when the pilot was shot the marksmanship abilities resemble those of the Imperial Stormtroopers in Star Wars. And I cannot believe that snipers would miss their targets no matter how many times they shot at them. I very much doubt that the snipers would keep shooting at them as many times as they did because that would only give away their positions. All in all I thought the movie was ok.
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"This is nothing for the instant gratification generation. They will haul out their cellphone after watching a couple of minutes.
For everyone else, everything... The music, drama, the rythm of the scenes, the story that is being told, brilliant.
Quite an astonishing creation, this movie.
The white knuckle tension combined with long harmonic takes, creates a knot in your stomach that will last.
A superb balance between the feeling of terror in the eyes of the actors without dwelling in the gut wrenching gore and the results of a war.
This is one of the greatest movies ever made, telling a wartime story and portraying it for what it really is. A sad, sad thing!"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,I saw 1917 for the second time last night. Words can't express just how stunning it is.I won't say anything else besides go see it. It's truly a masterpiece.
1917,1 May 2020,10/10,"1917 is a World War I drama directed, co-written, and produced by Sam Mendes. The film stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, with Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Claire Duburcq, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden in supporting roles. It is based in part on an account told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes. The film tells the story of two battalions of the British Army are being steered into a trap set by the Germans in World War I. Their only hope is a pair of British soldiers assigned the impossible mission to deliver a warning about this impending disaster. This message is especially important to one of the soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) as his brother is taking part in the pending attack. Blake takes Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) along on this harrowing journey across no man's land into enemy territory.This brilliantly shot drama that won best picture honours at the Golden Globes - Mendes uses his favoured ""one-shot"" format from his previous works like 2015's Spectre, but this time stretches it out to feature length. 1917 uses several takes and set-ups, seamlessly conjoined to give the appearance of a continuous cinematic POV, albeit with periodic ellipses. The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917. But well beyond the ingenuity of the one-take shot, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is reflected in the performances as well, with both leads swapping the narrative focus from each other in meticulously planned storytelling beats. The performances of the two young leads Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are engaging, as facets of their otherwise ordinary personalities come through. The mission is the key focus as the two soldiers make their way through increasingly dangerous situations. Along the way, they encounter key army personnel, played by a cameo row of British actors, including Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden who put in brief, but impressive performances.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is mesmerising, choreographed and executed to perfection around the horrific elements of war. Some of the frames are visually breath-taking, and demand to be revisited to absorb everything they have to offer. Throughout this journey, Thomas Newman's pulsing score builds up the tension, travelling ""up the down trench"", through the body-filled carnage of no man's land and into the eerie surroundings of deserted farmhouses and bombed-out churches. Occasionally, we hear echoes of the rising crescendo while elsewhere, the score is full of piercing melancholia mingled with distant threat. In a film in which music plays such a crucial role, it's significant that perhaps the most powerful scene is an interlude of song. Emerging from a river after a baptismal episode of death and rebirth, we find ourselves in a wood where a young man sings The Wayfaring Stranger. It's an interlude that brings the characters and audiences together in silence, communally experiencing that still-small voice of calm that lies at the heart of so many great war movies."
1917,28 January 2020,5/10,"A movie should not be rated on just the one amazing aspect it had, which is the one long cut directing and great cinematography. The movie is long, with characters you can't believe will make an impossible dumb mission that you will never care for or feel any emotion for. The soldiers themselves plenty of times don't even act like they're at war but trying to make friends with the other side. Just a waste of time, money, and sense."
1917,21 May 2020,,"This is a war movie made for women, children and idiots A war movie were everything is clean and sanitized. There isn't a single battle in the film, it starts when troops are just waiting
The main plot isn't about achieveing anything, just stopping one battle to save a bunch of troops and that's it
The cinematography is bad because the idiot director wanted to make a gimmicky one shot movi. It's the worse Roger Deakins film he ever made, he was constricted by this stupid imperative that doesn't film the grand scale of a war film. The protagonists are unlikeable, the plot is extremely dumb. The germans are evil and can't hit anyone despite shooting repeatedly. Really it comes off as a chauvinistic british movie and very anti german. It's embarrassing that after 100 years there's still so much bitterness.
The press will present this as an anti war film but in reality it's a opro-war film, makes it glamour and heroic, there isn't much blood. It gives a false impression of war and there is no moral in this film, they don't question why they're doing this, they're just good little soldier boys. AWFUL."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"It's just magnificent work.
There's not much more to say.
For me personally - a masterpiece!"
1917,26 January 2020,1/10,"Worst movie of varun sir, I'm a huge fan of varun sir. (I'm lying) but I only like varun sir's 2 moviesinception and titanic"
1917,18 January 2020,6/10,"This movie is dull and extraordinarily disappointing. Maybe my expectations were too high. Deakins cinematography is the only reason this film is somewhat watchable. I can't fathom what awards season saw in this. Academy Awards once again has proven to be about releasing your film in December, regardless of its quality. This movie is not worthy of the accolades it is receiving. The main character stumbles into the end result the same way he stumbled through every challenge in this film. The most compelling characters are the A-listers that sneak themselves in and command every scene away from our protagonist. Highly disappointed in making time to see this in theaters."
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"As Michael Scott writes in his book The Enchantress, ""There was no honor in war, less in killing, and none in dying. But there was true dignity in how men comported themselves in battle. And there was always honor to be found in standing for a just cause and defending the defenseless"", the drama war movie 1917 perfectly illustrates this quote and depicts the horrifying struggle for survival in the First World War.The film opens with a calm scene from which we're directly introduced to the protagonists who are about to find out the ""heroic"" mission assigned to them. The camera cleverly moves along the trenches first in front of the two soldiers then behind them without a single cut, creating a war game like atmosphere, placing the watcher among them as the third man. Roger Deakins who has proved to be a master of cinematography makes good use of the shadows to obtain a continuous shot as the two comrades receive their orders and begin their race against the time.Throughout the film Deakins makes use of numerous procedures and tricks as cameras on scouters or drones and props that can be moved or disassembled to create the feeling that the film is a continuous shot filmed by a single camera much like the 2015 Oscar winning picture Birdman or Gaspar Noe's films: Irreversible and Enter the Void.As the two boys prepare themselves to cross the no man's land an unsettling feeling captures their faces, the same terror seen on the eyes of the men covered in soaking wet uniforms, crouched in the cold, muddy ditches.
The music score beautifully written by Thomas Newman builds an incredible thrilling suspense that slowly grows with the ongoing mission and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie creating a parallel to Nolan's Second World Word masterpiece, Dunkirk.The images of the young lads crossing this muddy fields as the rats rattle and stroll besides their feet in searching for dead corpses to eat, combined with a tense music gives you a cold shiver down the spine. In this moment one realizes how brutal and senseless war really is for the common infantry soldiers who must follow any order given by their superiors.Finally, they reach the enemy's trenches just to see them destroyed and abandoned. Along the way to the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment there are multiple impediments that Germans make sure to leave behind their retreat such as planted bombs in the bunker in the scope of burring them alive, destroyed artillery that cannot be used, trees that are blocking the roads, destroyed bridges or even dead cows.The garden of blossomed cherries cut down is a metaphor on death which is coming to cut short the life of a man in his prime. Blake and Scofield find themselves at an abandoned farm where after a two versus one plane fight, they save the German pilot's live by pulling him out of the burning plane. The pilot cowardly stabs Blake in the guts and then dies as he takes two shots from Scofield. The young boy who without any hesitation rushed to deliver the message in hope he'll save his brother lays now on the cold earth with blood gushing through the fingers of Corporal Scofield who tries to comfort him.
Later in the film the same flower petals technique is used to depict the eminent approaching death who's after the lives of young men in the Second Battalion.Scofield is determined to continue the mission alone and after some struggles, he reaches the small town of Écoust-Saint-Mein as instructed. He encounters a young German and after sparing he's life he finds himself in the posture of running to save his own.On the scene of the night in Écoust, Deakins shows us once more why he's a virtuoso of his craft perfectly shooting a long chasing scene in the dense and dark night that is shattered from time to time just by the flares of the enemy.
The corporal miraculously escapes by jumping into a river that eventually will lead him to the Second Deavons. Exhausted after all the challenges encountered on his journey, he almost drowns but somehow finds the strength to swim and climb over the dead, swollen and disfigured bodies washed ashore.Singing in the Croisilles Woods is a symbolic and very powerful scene that shows stunted, marbled faces looking at a young man who sings a song before they're supposed to follow orders and go blind into war. The song refers to their mothers, their fathers and home and the main idea is that men do not fight for motherland or honor or some cheap metal object with a ribbon that is equivalent to a wine bottle, they fight to stay alive one more day and hope to make it home in one piece to see the loved ones.In the end Corporal Scofield must run along the battlefield bypassing the flying bombshells and avoiding the brave men who have no chance of triumph, to reach general McKenzie and to stop the attack immediately.
The chaos is choreographed with great talent by Mendes and Deakins who used extras, special cranes and cameras attached to a car to film the emphatic run of the main character.Although the Lance Corporal succeeds in his mission, we're left with the sorrowful contemplative words of what it looks like an experienced Colonel MacKenzie, ""There's only one way this war ends. Last man standing"".
In the end Scofield strolls in the medical camp through injured men who grunt form unsupportable pain in the hope of finding Blake's brother making this rescue mission to feel like a Saving Private Ryan story, only now the action is taking place in the First World War.In conclusion the film 1917 is a well-done braiding between great directorial vision, intelligent cinematographic means, thrilling music score and prominent acting that portray the horrors the world has seen in the darkest hour. In these times honor and justice are just two simple words, medals and decorations are worthless as Lieutenant Leslie says with contempt ""nothing like a scrap of ribbon to cheer up a widow""."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"One of the most technically challenging, amazingly executed works of art I have ever seen! Guaranteed to win technical awards, and worthy of Best Picture, even though the story and character development are thin.The imagery is haunting, as is the score. The sets and lighting, even the color palette, are perfect. The suspense is palpable, and the horrors of war are mostly seen in the aftermath.I was in absolute awe at the masterful craftsmanship. Six months of rehearsals were needed to pull off this ""one take"" movie, and it shows.My son also loved it. My girlfriend hated it. So, leave her behind?"
1917,13 December 2019,9/10,"Engrossing film from the start. The cinematography, the production, the sound editing were great. Acting was credible. A few spots make me take one point off. Definitely worth seeing."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"My word. This will grab you at the start chew you up and spit you out. If this doesn't get an Oscar I'll be very, very surprised. Sorry to go on about this but it was way better than Dunkirk. What a movie! Make sure you go and watch this in the cinema! Don't miss that opportunity. It really does capture the brutality, loss, emotion, heartbreak, waste, struggle and all the realities of what WWI probably was for those soldiers. The cinematography is amazing. It's basically a continuous camera follow shot from start to end with only one obvious cut. I can't stress enough how much you need to go and see this movie. It's not easy to watch by any means but it's a period in our modern history that should be remembered."
1917,22 December 2019,10/10,This is a stunning masterpiece of filmmaking. Unlike any film I have ever seen before. Cinematography is overwhelmingly beautiful and yet suspenseful as it puts you right in the scene as another soldier. Shot in a pov perspective and almost one continual shot from start to finish. Now go see this movie.
1917,21 February 2020,10/10,10/10 only for that ruined town lit up by flare scene. Truly masterpiece !
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"Every scene of the movie will put you there on the scene . Amazing camera work , watch it on IMAX screen for maximum effect ."
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,"This movie joins a relatively small number of war films that envelop you with the complete visceral, immersive experience of combat, such as ""Platoon"" of the Vietnam era and World War II's ""Saving Private Ryan."" The continuous shot works brilliantly and does not come across as a gimmick. The momentary glimpses of war-weary soldiers sleeping, smoking, snoozing and snacking are riveting. The bloodied, muddy uniforms are hyper-realistic. The pervasive images of the dead, both animal and human, are striking. The acting - depicting the camaraderie, devotion to duty and the mounting tension - is superb. The movie will leave an indelible mark on your mind as it provides a grunt's-eye view of World War I trench warfare, as well as the misery of hunkering down in those narrow ditches not knowing what the future holds."
1917,1 October 2020,10/10,A wonderful watch from start to finish. Good script and wonderful delivery on the acting. Love that the movie focused on one story within the war and not the entirety of the war.
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"The way it was filmed with no cuts creates the raw emotion in the film grasping the viewer with the entire weight of the situation. The one take camera view is what made this movie. It was sort of slow for a war movie but the scenes with action definitely get your blood pressure and anxiety up. With no cuts in most of the scenes though you grasp the raw emotion of fear and uncertainty that most young soldiers would've had. If you're a violence junky then this movie isn't for you. But if you'd like to see some truly beautiful cinematography and gripping emotion, it's incredible. Definitely up there with saving private Ryan as I use that movie as a staple for all war movies. Saving private Ryan is definitely more realistic with violence and pure chaos but doesn't quite capture the emotion that 1917 produces."
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"This film is about as close as it gets to a theme park. But it comes with all the negatives as well as positives of the Big Dipper. I have to say the 'one shot take trick' is very impressive, so full credit to Sam Mendes for pulling that off. It gives a really good sense of what it was like on the front lines following the protagonists throughout there journey. The acting is good but like a rollercoaster there were so many fast loops and quick cameos that I wanted to enjoy the presence of Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch for just a bit longer.
I felt sick after watching this film, dizzy from the swooping turning camera I was desperate for an edit! A cut away anything to take me out of it for just a second. It feels like a good one off, but if every film was like this I could see myself becoming sick (literally) of cinema."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"Just an amazing film all together, highly recommend watching in IMAX."
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,Very clever well produced film. Humbling to watch. Reccomend it.
1917,25 December 2020,10/10,"The one take style is just impressive, such a Great War movie!"
1917,6 February 2020,2/10,"Went with high hopes, left disappointed.
What was all the fuss about?
This is a very average movie based on the flimsiest of plots. There are so many holes it's like a swiss cheese.
why would two very average corporals be chosen for such an important mission? Surely a officer would be sent?Could not an aircraft have been sent to drop a message?Why were truckloads of British troops driving around no mans land heading for the same place the corporals were going.Why did these troops not assist with dealing with the sniper?Where in northern France is there a river with a 25 foot water fall?How come the letter survived the river...waterproof ink? I doubt it.What was the point of the meeting with the girl in a German occupied town? and why had the Germans not found and removed her?Why was the surviving corporal allowed to wander into the group listening to the singer? No sentries posted? Unlikely.In 1917, would a Lt Colonel really tell a corporal to F off?Why was no mans land in the final attack just an open field? No mud, no wire, no shell holes, no bodies...Add to all this the contrived coincidences scene by scene and it all adds up to a very average mess.
The so-called wonder filming techniques used were...well underwhelming. If I had not know about them, I would never have noticed.
Is it BAFTA or OSCAR worthy? no, not by a very long way"
1917,25 December 2020,1/10,It's another war film. Mediocre acting. All those who believe it was excellent are just deluding others.
1917,10 July 2020,10/10,"1917 is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The directing is brilliant. I love how Sam Mendes made it seem like it was all one shot, even though there were cuts here and there. I definitely think George MacKay was the better actor of the two main characters, and his journey throughout the film is stunning. The running scene is the best shot in the entire film, as it channels his determination to fulfil his task. 1917 is a masterpiece, and it will go down in the history books as a classic."
1917,20 January 2020,6/10,"Before watching i expected to give a 10 , However a 9 is enough"
1917,24 January 2020,6/10,"After reading the reviews and watching the trailers , I expected to give a 10.
After watching the movie a 6 is a good score."
1917,12 January 2020,3/10,"Dumbest war movie I've ever seen. Loaded with cliches, like the girl in the farmhouse with the baby, him being shot at a zillion times and surviving, jumping off a bridge into a French river that becomes a raging rapid culminating in a ,gasp, hundred foot waterfall. Anybody ever see a river with rapids in France? Or a monstrous waterfall?
The cinematography was terrific but the story was lame beyond words. Oh, did I mention the German plane that just happens to crash into the barn where the two doughboys were standing?
Terrible writing"
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,"Gallipoli x Saving Private Ryan 0.2 That is all you need to know. Kudos to Sam Mendes for his two ""one shot"" format. I can hear Stanley Kubrick rolling in his grave. A most excellent, triumphant piece of cinema. Well done!"
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,Unlike any war film I have ever seen.... I mean the attention to detail is impeccable in this movie as well as just the sure realism that is portrayed through not only the acting but the action as well.
1917,12 January 2020,6/10,"I expected so much from this movie but when i went to see it me and my friends were disappointed. The acting was not so good, the dialogues are very boring, the ending is the most boring ever. I understand that this movie was based on real events and it is not supposed to be entertaining or have an amazing storyline. I have to say though that the way this movie was filmed is indredible, everything looks very realistic and detailed. However, everything else to me was very disappointing. This movie is overhyped"
1917,3 November 2020,9/10,"The best war film I have ever seen, a genre I generally steer clear of, but this gripped me from start to finish."
1917,21 March 2020,9/10,"One of the best ww1 movies I've ever watched. Its intense, real, clear and very important you fall in it right after it starts. I would really recomend these movie to anyone who loves history or to anyone who just likes action. The actors are also perfect for the movie and know how to get in the roll. All seems so real like you were a part of it. I was little shocked when one of the main charachters died... I really did not see that comming. But that is actually good, becouse you can see what could really happen. The trenches in the 1st movie part are awasome made too, also the battlefields,... Only thing i would maybe change is that i would add more germans into it, becouse its interesting to watch different uniforms, equipment etc... But generally excellent movie."
1917,18 April 2020,5/10,Not that realistic in terms of what would happen during wartime.
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Wow wow wow. What a fantastic film. Not much battle scenes but doesn't need it. The suspense is painfully good. The scenes make you feel like you are there with them and it gives you an idea of how hellish ww1 really was.
One for the cinema!!"
1917,21 January 2020,8/10,"This is a great film but I found it slightly silly that the main character didn't use his grenades (that were mentioned earlier in the plot) when he came into a situation where he obviously should have, and the pursuing Germans really were rubbish shots."
1917,23 February 2020,5/10,"The General only sends two guys to give the message that would safe the 1600 soldiers? Two that ended in one because the other one died? This is so stupid! I would of sent an army to guarantee the delivery of the message! And worst of all, they found a living cow and fresh milk after the germans killed a hundred cows and cut all the trees?"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Every element of this movie was excellent - script, acting, cinematography, music, etc.Definitely recommended to view in theaters. You'll be on the edge of your seat for the whole movie."
1917,9 May 2020,3/10,"I couldn't wait to see this movie as everyone was raving about it. This was a complete waste of 2hrs. 15min before the end I was still waiting for some real action to start or at least a strong ending that will make me cry. I mean... c'mon it's a war movie! It should've glued me to the screen in the first few minutes... there are so many ridiculous moments, completely unreal war scenes that it made me just laugh. Maybe I expected too much of it but in my opinion a strong war movie is the one that brings a sea of emotions. This one didn't, not even once."
1917,15 March 2020,5/10,"I watched 1917 yesterday. The storyline in this motion picture is so thin and shallow that it's offensive to an intelligent human mind. I get it, German soldiers always have to be portrayed in Hollywood movies as the bad ones, but in this one, they are pictured as blind drunkards and straightforward morons. Those poor two English soldiers run like crazy for two hours around the place in this movie, Germans shoot at them like forty times and always miss. The scenes are unrealistic, a German sniper in higher ground shooting seven rounds at one of the main heroes of the story, and missing every time? Common! There is also the scene where a Samaritan French lady helps the English soldier and cares for his wounds, so stereotypical that it hurts to watch. On the good side, the film builds up and holds tension, mostly because it was cut as if it were shot in one go. Summary: not recommended."
1917,26 March 2020,9/10,What an amazing piece of long shot film making. A masterpiece in my opinion.
1917,8 July 2020,4/10,1st. The cinematography is good. 2nd. The protagonists engage in a series of mind boggling dumb non-soldier like behaviors. They continually stall and sidetrack on what should be a straightforward messenger mission. The story is predictable and boring. The main characters go about their mission in an insufferable idiotic way. The view is not worth the ride.
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"I was worried that the way the movie was shot would be boring. I was skeptical if the movie could keep my attention because everything happens in real time. When the characters are walking from one point to another, we watch every step they take and there are no cuts to pass time. This movie had my attention the entire time, even during the scenes where they are just walking, there was always something going on. There is so much much going on in the background in some scene that I caught myself watching some of the extras and what they were doing. The biggest thing I liked about this movie was the cinematography. There were many scenes where I was blown away with how beautiful the shot was. This is an amazing movie and for me, it is up there with Dunkirk as one of my favorite war movies."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,A truly mesmerising cinematic experience. Watch it on the big screen if you can.
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"Awesome film, not sure about the water fall in northern France though"
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"This film is incredible, the way it is shot allows you to become easily and fully immersed, it's such a simple story line but of course as you would expect in war it isn't easy. I love that it is mostly just based around the two characters who then meet a few others along their mission. I really don't want to ruin it for others but honestly I highly recommend you watch it, it's just pure brilliant and has some big names for the higher ranks."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,"Masterpiece. Great acting, with no real big names in the leading part. The awards are so deserved."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"I realise this is a true story and respect the real life horror of the Great War. However, this just appears to be Sam mendes having a massive........ego trip, about doing it all in one shot. Show the story Sam, tricks are for kids"
1917,9 April 2020,10/10,"I saw the movie without any expectation. War movies entertain me but they don´t usually move me. This movie made me part of a journey through human misery and delirium. The technical aspects are flawless, sure. But its the journey that makes this movie a fantastic work of art that shows humans as a pointless occurence in time and space. I loved it, watch it with care, with a critical eye on yourself and with the knowledge that the creator of The Lord of the Rings made more or less a journey like that and came out of it with a story to rival all stories. And, also, Wittgenstein came from the same journey and tried to make us go to the realm of formal logic to try and close the gaping hole that war on that scale and magnitude left in our collective souls"
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"The sequence of events flows right-off the bat, centralised around the main charter(s), drawing you into their world, their situation, and their mission at-hand, whilst facing the most server of perils on the frontline. This unforgiving task is recorded from start to finish with long sweeping tracking shoots, with cuts only ever being made at key sweeping intervals, which are fantastically executed.The story whilst simple, is an eye opening experience, and truly sad at it's core, however it's driven by valor throughout, brilliant cameos, amazing cinematography, and a heroic story at it's core.A must see on the big screen, and certainly a contender at the awards."
1917,19 June 2020,9/10,A very simple story but the cinematography is amazing. This film keeps you on your toes all the time. Hardly a moment when you want to get your eyes away from the screen.I regret not watching it in theatres. The background score is amazing too. I am glad I had my headphones on when I watched it. A brilliant movie which I recommend everyone to watch.
1917,28 January 2020,7/10,"Not as good as all the hype !Not a patch on saving private Ryan , would even say where eagles dare is a better film.Worth a watch though"
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,Beautiful visual cinema.Plot wholes wider than the Western Front.Story goes nowhere in no particular hurry.But not nearly as bad say as Bumblebee or Hacksaw Ridge.
1917,7 February 2020,3/10,Was expecting a lot more from the film going off the reviews
1917,1 May 2020,10/10,"It worth a loud clap for its performance, direction, storyline basically everything in this movie is excellent and enjoyable."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,"On the same day that the United States declares war on Germany, two young British lance corporals are faced with an apparently impossible mission: to cross the french battlefield carrying an order to cancel an attack and prevent the massacre of at least 1600 british soldiers.Set in the penultimate year of the First World War, 1917 is one of those films that arrest the viewer in the first minutes and then drag him up and down without giving him time to breathe.Merit of director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, 007: Skyfall), who also signs the script, based on stories told by his grandfather, a former Great War fighter.Recorded as a great sequence shot, with really imperceptible cuts, 1917 throws the audience into the drama of soldiers Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman, from Game of Thrones) and Schofield (George MacKay, from Captain Fantastic) on their journey through a France in pieces, which will test their beliefs, courage and friendship to the last strength.The cinematography of the veteran Roger Deakins, an Oscar winner in 2018 for Blade Runner 2049, is a complete show apart, always leading the narrative to the best of the script, at the right time - there are no mistakes here.With 1917, Mendes managed to make not only one of the greatest (and best) war films of all time, but also present the audience with a great cinema class and a true dramatic experience. An instant classic.Let the Oscars come."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"A relentless film from start to finish and emotional journey, there is never a full moment in this movie. While I do think there is no greater war movie than Saving Private Ryan, this one comes close. Expertly shot with realistic set designs and violence, 1917 blew away expectations for me and my friend, who thought we were going to see another cheesy war movie. A must-see!"
1917,18 January 2020,5/10,"Wow, what a letdown! The best picture nomination is misplaced on 1917. The movie lacked an interesting plot, meaningful action, any kind of character development, and overall watchability. There are long stretches of complete boredom while watching the movie. Aside from some good camera work while walking through trenches, it was truly a mediocre movie."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This film told a great story. Filled with a rollercoaster of emotion. Not much action, but that did not take away from the film at all."
1917,2 April 2020,10/10,The movie is amazing. The build up is great. The acting is awesome. Highly recommended.
1917,14 January 2020,4/10,"OK I did listen to the hype so was expecting the continuous shot footage to be engaging and special. But no, this film has the same hype as Dunkirk, both films are boring frankly, I did not care about the characters at all, running around without any common sense to their actions. I think I will give up on the cinema I am so fed up of the critics over hyping how good a film is.
On this film the characters were instantly forgetful and the poor actors will now be dragged around the world.being interviewed about a very less than average film."
1917,2 September 2021,10/10,"One of the best movies i haver watched ,will be watching dunkirk after that!!!"
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"This film is easily the most immersive movie I have seen all year. From the time the title card was displayed until the time the credits rolled, I was totally enthralled by the events of the film. 1917 had me on the edge of my seat for 2 hours straight and left me feeling as if I had just endured the events firsthand.
Storytelling - 1917 was basically 2 hours of great decision-making. The film drops the viewer off at the best possible moment so that we truly feel as if we are in the situation. This is a feeling that, although established immediately, lingers for the entirety of the film's runtime. Every emotion that the characters felt throughout the movie-dress, fear, despair, triumph, anger- I felt right alongside them. The film strays far from the formula typical to most movies, causing a pervasive sensation unpredictability and fear. Overall, while the story was limited in its scope by the fact that it was almost actual-time, it soars through its unique style and extreme realism. 9/10
Acting - The acting in this film is truly masterful. The two leads did a fantastic job of portraying their characters in manner that helped the audience sympathize with them almost immediately. Certain sequences required the actors convey a wide variety of emotion using nothing but their facial expressions. Once again, the film moves at such a pace that it is very hard for the actors to slow down and really explore deeper emotions, but the still played their parts expertly. 9/10
Script - 1917 has considerably less dialogue than many films that came out this year. This kept it from being as deep as other films, and yet, like all the other categories, it worked fantastically for the film. There were definitely hints of depth and history between certain characters found in the lines, and I cannot complain on any level. 9/10
Characters - This is where the film was impacted most by the frenetic pace. It was very rare that the two leads were not in an extremely tense, life-threatening situation which made it very hard to delve into their characters and understand more about them. It's hard to truly complain about the characters, but they certainly were not as well-explored as some other films. It worked great for the film, but I still feel as if I should maintain a single standard for all films. 8/10
Cinematography - I'll keep this brief. The best cinematography of the year. Hands down. Constant, superb decision-making from Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins made this film stand out among the dozens of war films that have been released and created one of the best film experiences I have ever had. 10/10
Personal opinion - As always, I factor in the way that I personally felt about the film. I left this movie feeling as if I had seen a huge step for film in general. The way this film was crafted truly make it a work of art. I typically prefer strong er characters, but 1917 did everything he could do to strengthen the characters and, with minimal work from the audience, the characters develop quite nicely all things considered. I adored this film and cannot wait to experience it again. I personally give this film a 9/10. Overall, the score evens out to be 9.0/10."
1917,9 August 2020,3/10,"It is nicely shot, that's all on the plus side.
The story is as bad as it takes. Ridiculous scenes, zero sense of reality. Germans shoot worse than imperial stormtroopers, and are always alone. Artillery is placed right behind the first line, like in a fairy tale. A pilot who barely survives, and is rescued stabs the guy who rescued him wtf? Not a single machine gun fired in the entire movie. For God's sake it was the main reason why the war was so bloody. If you want to see a fantasy of a 12 year old about WWI go ahead. For a history buff it is a complete, total waste of time. The main characters are annoying, boring and acted so bad it hurts. It is a relief when one of them dies, whish they both had died early the movie would had ended a lot sooner. The only few seconds which were enjoyable were the ones when the messengers were leaving the trenches, the guy playing the officer at the Yorks at least showed some talent."
1917,29 June 2020,10/10,"Great movie. Didn't want to watch where what and how. Just watched it, beautiful. Thank you guys for making such a great movie as thought. Roger deakins and the team are perfect."
1917,15 July 2020,10/10,"One thing to say:
BEST WAR MOVIE EVERThis movie is the best War movie of all time"
1917,9 May 2020,1/10,1917 bunch of PC crap!Journeys End movie based on how War really is...Yet those that have no experience in real war prefer crap PC movies like 1917 over realistic movies like Journeys End.Why? Because people have trouble accepting reality.If you like fantasy maybe this movie is for you.
1917,20 April 2021,10/10,"1917 is more than just a movie, it's a poem. Perfected with excellent cinematography and a brilliant score. After exiting the cinema I was stunned, as if I went back in time for two hours and experienced WW1 in real life. It wasn't the action scenes that made it particularly good, but the fact that this entire movie was one shot somehow made it so raw and realistic. Many emotions arose in me, especially during the scene when Blake died and the scene where Schofield met his brother. The acting couldn't have been done any better in my opinion, although this movie doesn't quite rely on the performances by the actors, but more on the cinematography. All in all, this might just be one of the best war movies I've ever seen. Thank you for this masterpiece, Mr. Mendes!"
1917,14 June 2020,8/10,"Actors' acting needed more , this movie became a great ones only because of director,producer,cameramen,flim settting,all the group effort"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"I went in on 2 hours of sleep, delusional off of sleep deprivation. Zoning out at the beginning without any caffeinated drink or popcorn, but the second the action picked up I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Beautifully directed, beautifully shot film!"
1917,27 January 2020,1/10,The most pathetic movie from Sam Mendes.I think this movie is over hyped by some people since Sam is one of the best Director.
1917,22 February 2020,10/10,Hopefully more will watch this and understand how horrible war is (Capt Bonespur) . I recently visited Hellfire Pass in Thailand and was moved to tears thinking about all the people who suffered so much there. This film did the same. It's a stunning piece of film and remembers what so many suffered in wars. Wish for better
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,I guess who rated it low don't know a lot about WW1 and not mature enough because the war itself wasn't 'sexy' as WW2.
1917,10 February 2020,9/10,"The movie that tells everything, Movie that make you cry. Movie with best visual effects. Congrats."
1917,29 March 2020,1/10,"I'm wondering about some movies and some reviews because i don't know why some movies has given good rating numbers ,like the first review that i read about this one , it is talking about expensive shots and his late great uncle and ... ?
WHAT EXACTLY CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIES ?
I found that like a big number of people have forget about a movie as a entertainment subject , like everyone is a filmmaking student and just pay attention to technical matters ??
it is a linear rotten story with an obvious ending from the beginning , some famous actor to keep the flag up but the movie is tearing apart and director try hard to keep it together."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,Watching this movie is such an experience. I truly recommend it. Cinematography is incredible and the most awesome thing about this movie is that it was filmed with only two long takes! So elaborated! Such an excellent job.
1917,5 April 2021,1/10,I don't watch a movie just coz it looks like a single long take. Movies shouldn't be made around the cinematography it should be made around the story which wasn't strong.
1917,20 January 2020,3/10,"Camera work great, story so so, but what annoys me are the impropabilities:
where in the Somme region is this fast flowing river???the story sets of in april, why are the woods not barren of leaves?is there really a pristine landscape just a few miles from the front?In everything I've read about the great war (and I've read a lot) the constant shelling comes up, even in quiet sectors and on relatively quiet days. In this movie there is silence all around, except when the men go over the top...All in all: too many impropabilities to communicate a real feeling for the great war. Not individual/small platoon actions (which Spielberg did infinitely better in Saving Private Ryan) but massed attacks where characteristic of this war."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,Worth seeing on the big screen because visually it's brilliant and the set fantastic but it's let down by the acting inability of Dean-Charles Chapman who might as well have had the script in his hand to read from. (George McKay was very good though). The dialogue wasn't quite right either for soldiers enduring that. It was all a bit luvvy and stood out as weak amongst such a strong production. So a pity it came up short and lacked those elements which could have really made it special.
1917,14 January 2020,3/10,"Movies are a condensed version of real life; this movie is real life itself. As such it is mostly mundane and boring. It is like watching a live-stream of somebody as he or she journeys through the streets of New York in order deliver some bagels to grandma. Although the camera work and filming are amazing! Top notch! If you however, find the characters rather lacking in depth or you're unable to connect with them emotionally or intellectually, you click away, you click ""cat videos"" instead. This is my main gripe with 1917, although the filming is splendid, the characterization is severely lacking, the character arch is nonexistent. The characters don't change; they were the same at the beginning of the movie till the end. This is a true plot driven story instead of a character driven story. And the plotting by the way is quite slow with a few plot holes I might add, how can it be anything else but slow? The story is lacking in depth and breath. It's basically a get from A to B video game type story; as such it is very predictable. There is only so much you can do with this type of filming, and once the technical oddity or marvel of one long continuous shot (although there were a few cuts) wears off you realize the emperor has no clothes, no characterization, and a very simple story arch. This is a 10 minute movie or 2 hour long documentary/live-stream. This reminds me of a movie with all the great special effects of light sabers, star destroyers, and Jar Jar Binks but with muted and flat characters. The sugar quickly wears off and you're left wanting something more substantive."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"What a stunning film, please go see this, I recommend it in imax for the full experience"
1917,17 February 2020,9/10,"Easily the best war movie of the year and possibly the decade. The ""one take"" concept, while also a technical marvel, made a spectacle of the passage of time and distance in a way only a filmmaker with a clear vision and mastery of pacing could accomplish effectively. The plot felt purposeful, the stakes felt high, the actors felt talented beyond what their experience would suggest, and the climax had hearts pounding audibly throughout the theater. A small complaint is the film was a bit over-scored. The thunderous and booming soundtrack clashed with the gritty and visceral imagery. A tense but altogether quieter score would perhaps have had more of an impact but even the tracks used were not distracting enough to break immersion. 1917 is a movie that has earned its place among the year's best pictures and should be remembered as nothing less than a brilliantly made ode to the brutality of the first World War."
1917,20 January 2020,9/10,This movie is such a thrilling cinematic achievement that truly captures what it would have been like to be in war. The one shot take really serves the movie's suspense and feel.
1917,13 March 2020,3/10,"Not sure why people are giving it 10, it doesn't come even close to ""Saving Private Ryan"". The action are very average, story is weak.Maybe British loved it since it is a british movie! maybe."
1917,27 January 2020,9/10,"The new movie of Sam Mendes tells the story of two british soldiers that have to take a message to stop another battalion from falling into a trap. The story is simple but Mendes tells it in a very effective and humane way. Moreover, this is, probably, one of the strongest points of the movie. Mendes shows the humanity and the cruelty of war at the same time through an amazing technique, making the movie look like it was filmed in one continuous shot. This fact, allied with a fantastic work of Roger Deakins and tremendous work of two relatively unknown actors (George MacKay and Dean Charles Chapman), makes this movie an immersive experience and seeming that we are accompanying the two soldiers in this mission as if we were also there. The soundtrack also plays an important role in elevating this film and, certainly, we cannot exclude the amazing visual effects that show clearly what happens during war and the fear a shooting or a bomb may cause.
To sum up, this is an immersive experience fantasticly directed that brings the world war I to the spotlight (rare in Hollywood) making us feel as if we were with that two soldiers that have a very simple, but at the same time, difficult mission. For me, this is one of the best movies of the year and, probably, the decade."
1917,22 January 2020,6/10,"Even though it was based on a true story, the storyline was not interesting at all amd it was very boring. Not a whole lot of dialog and a lot of dead moments"
1917,23 June 2020,3/10,"Boring. Does not justify 2 hours. The first hour was just the main characters walking, and the second hour was just one of the main characters walking again.Couldn't careless about either of the characters"
1917,28 October 2020,6/10,"It just didn't make me care for any of the characters and so it was hard to get involved in the story.I can be brought to tears at the sight of original ww1 footage/photos, but this didn't move me at all - and I think it's just because of a lot of little things that just didn't seem realistic and the bland acting."
1917,10 February 2020,9/10,"This movie is an intense journey of how the human drive to complete something you've set your heart and mind to can be accomplished, but not without it's loss and hardship. The film centers on a guy whose brother is part of a bigger division of 1600 men total who are walking into a trap on enemy lines. The ""main"" character is told he must deliver a message to save the men and call off the attack. He brings his friend Will, the actual main character along. You see the true experience and emotion of the whole film arguably through will even from the moment he enters the scene. He has been in past combat before and gives advice to the novice comrade but alas his cherry blossom mindset and rational gets him killed by trying to be compassionate in times of war. This movie pulls no punches in showing how real the world is and how war likely is and was then. Especially when characters give speeches about how orders are always changing and always coming. There will always be another fight and more dead. No matter what. Was it all pointless in the end? Maybe so. I love the poetic end of the film being like the beginning as well. The plethera of brithish actor cameos was a little distracting as well was the constant shot at times but at others it worked very well."
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,The cinematography in this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The movie seems like a one long take where you feel you are with the actors in the war. Sam Mendes deserves an oscar nomination for the best director and even if he wins it instead of Scorsese it won't be a surprise to me. This movie is full human emotions that were outstandingly captured. George MacKay was outstanding in character decision development and also showing his weakness and inner feelings. Again and again and again this is the best cinematography of the year and it deserves 100 % an Oscar.
1917,21 January 2020,7/10,"This film does a good job of keeping the viewer engaged the entire time. It highlights certain aspects of WW1 without doing a deep dive into the war or particular aspects of combat. The characters are interesting, you don't need a lot of dialogue or background to feel connected. The acting is good as well. This film was done as long shot, which keeps the pace moving. However, it makes the transitions awkward, as it is roughly 18 hours of time for the characters condensed into a 2 hour run on scene for the viewer. That awkwardness of characters flowing from one situation to the next too quickly, some war movie cliques, bad physics on the plane crash, and good, but not great combat scenes prevent this from reaching the levels of Dunkirk or Saving Private Ryan, but still very much worth your time."
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,"Really, i dont understand why this movie have a good rating, I expected more"
1917,29 April 2020,10/10,I have no words for this movie. Tense and suspenseful throughout. Beautifully shot. One of the best films I've ever seen
1917,18 February 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes has truly gone beyond the call of duty in creating a story that will enthral you into a world long since gone. George Mackay and Dean Charles Chapman have perhaps produced two of the most fleshed out characters ever put to screen, due to their realistic relationship and emotive performances. How George Mackay wasn't nominated for best actor this award season is beyond what I can comprehend. In summary, it is film that any British patriot or budding cinematographer should see as it truly capture the essence of World War One like no other film has ever done before due to its unique story telling, incredible compositions and masterful cinematography. Roger Deakins you should hold
Your head high for the rest of your life.
Everyone should see this while it's in cinemas, a cinematic experience that will never be forgotten. Thank you Sam Mendes your dedication will he talked about for years to come.
Regard
J"
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,This is pure love for the cinema. Thanks Sam Mendes!
1917,6 March 2020,1/10,"This Movie nothing but How 2 idiots in World War going die because of their stupid choices
That's all."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"I believe this is one of the most breath-taking movies I've watched, from the beggining to the end, you will be the 3rd private following Blake and Schofield on a memorable quest to save human lives in a time when human lives seems not so valuable at all.
The tension keeps growing every minute, and you will find some moments of peace from time to time, but the music, the photography, lights and shadows and scenery will keep you in the edge of your seat.
Both protagonists are amazing and even with the lack of dialogue, they deliver a truly human, believable and heart-breaking characterizations of 2 young men trapped in the nightmare of the war.I loved this, and I think this movie will be an iconic depicture of war, and a case of study for any cinematographer."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"Amazing cinematography, gripping storyline and just an amazing two hour journey. Plus, Tommen Baratheon and Rob Stark play brothers."
1917,19 January 2020,1/10,"So much war, millions dead, reduced to products like this to exploit it all. Cinema is dead. The NWO never stops.
Hitler was right."
1917,22 September 2021,9/10,"1917 is not just a war movie. Not just some soldiers fighting. It's a pure experience ,it's you going to war putting you in the middle of a mission at the horrific events of the first World War. You feel like you are one of the main characters. The direction and cinematography really I can't even explain how perfect it was, you are going on a journey, a terrified one I know but you will absolutely live it. That one shot as it should be done by the mastermind of cinematography Roger Deakins, you never get distracted you are in it. The music also did its job perfectly without a doubt. I can't explain it enough but I can say for sure it's a masterpiece, this is war my friend. Don't miss out that marvelous experience."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,Cinematic wizardry worth watching on a big screen.
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"I don't think the trailers do this movie justice, this truly is one of the best war movies to date. The tension this film has its able to hold it though out. Despite little dialogue it works and we get to know these characters and we feel connected to them and that is very rare in a war film. But the best part is the cinematography by Roger Deakins this movie is so beautiful even though it takes place in a horrific environment. What Sam Mendes is able to do behind the camera as well making the whole film look like a continuous take that is a mind of a genius, and even through the slow moments of the movie that camera moving makes us invested and in for the ride !"
1917,2 February 2020,3/10,"There's no denying the filmmaking in 1917 was visually good with the one shots in both the end and throughout the film done well and deserving of an Oscar.
However the rest of the film felt unsatisfying , rather than leaving me moved at the end I had a rather ""oh"" is that it , which to me is not what a war film should leave you with.From the offset the A to B story felt like it contained a plethora of Unecessary celebrity cameos that had no real effect on the story and some obvious plot holes that brought me out of the film and back into reality, for example the cow and the one bucket of milk , I was expecting some kind of German army to surprise them as I thought the whole point was that they weren't long gone but no the cow was just assumed to have milked itself I suppose and be the only thing left standing in the farm that came out of nowhere. The main character then tells a German to shut up and let's him go when he's obviously going to shout to his friend for help , he then runs away leaving his attacker alive to shoot him which surprise surprise they also can't take a clean shot from 20 m away .The ending also left me feeling unsatisfied with the obvious inaccuracies of the last shot and ending as You would have thought as he went over the trench first then standing up and running he would be an easy target for the Germans but he manages to get to the colonel without a scratch.Furthermore the ending just seemed too straightforward , he went to send a message he got the message there , it was called off . There was nearly no changes to the plot or events which he had to overcome that lasted more than a few minutes and the ending rather than leaving me with a sense of the horrors of war like other war films had it left a rather ""oh so it's done now"" type feeling that the gimmick of one shots and technical filming could not cover .Overall I think that this film had good technical filming and obviously the long shots were powerful but that does not mask the lack of storyline and unsatisfaction I felt whilst watching . I do think for filming it deserves awards but not for best picture."
1917,4 January 2020,10/10,This is a masterclass in how to make a movie. The subject is difficult; most people are turned off by the horror of the First World War. But this film captures the realism with superbly portrayed characters whilst maintaining a fast moving storyline. The choice of the German retreat at the end of the First Somme was inspired (I was expecting 1917 to mean Passchendaele - it usually does). The particular incidents accord with accounts which I have read.This is the first film in a long time which I would have wanted to go back and see again.Excellent.
1917,25 March 2020,,"I think this film with very great shot. also the actors was very good.
But the story didn't appeal to me. haha"
1917,19 July 2020,2/10,"Beautiful filming and god suspence don't make up for this stinker of war movie. Bad soundside, bad acting and worst of all bad script make this a nightmare. It is so urealistic and plane stupid, that you pretty soon hope the boys get killed. There are many great war movies, but this is NOT on of them."
1917,15 February 2020,1/10,"100 years later, the movie is in color, but the story is still as black and white as ever.Germans are ruthless soul-less killers, laying booby traps to kill innocent people, stab their British saviors, are drunk and cruel killers.Their British counterparts are heroic family people, who help French maidens, want to safe lifes, sing folk songs in the forest, and live in perfect multi cultural harmony with their comrades from the colonies.Really?I advise books with a bit more advanced views, such as 'Sleepwalkers', to gain a little more balanced view on the history of the First World War."
1917,8 February 2020,9/10,"Seen this twice now at the cinema and for me it's the best war film since Saving Private Ryan.A stunning technical achievement by all involved but also a haunting look at some of the quieter ""horror"" sides to a horrendous and at times unbelievable part of our history.Just an a great film."
1917,7 February 2020,10/10,It's so good. It really makes you feel something. I dont write reviews and im not good at them I just had to give it a 10 stars
1917,27 April 2020,1/10,"This movie has a good photography and not a bad story but it's the same content in previous war movies and nothing change except the characters and if this continues again in not a long time war movies become a low rate movie because for years war movies that are about WW reveal the same content as the previous ones and not a single change but the resolution got higher , 1917 has poor act and unbelievably low price war action for such a movie , the scene of running in the plain with many explosion around him was so unreal that I ignored the screen . try to make something different about WW not just war being horrible and big explosions . a movie like Schindler's list was about war but with different content."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Atmosphere: 10/10
Camera: 11/10
Sound & Music: 10/10
Story: 9/10 (it's a freaking war movie, don't expect heavy plot twists and you're fine)Overall touching experience. Full recommendation."
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,"What a truly remarkable movie, so much more than just technically perfect.
Sam Mendes created a masterpiece, here he is a the top of his craft.
The competition is strong but I believe this is the best movie of the year and one of the best of the decade."
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,"What a waste I mean u wait for so long for some action that never arrives ,such a bore fest nothing like saving private Ryan or even pearl harbour at least that had action in it"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"From a cinematographic standpoint, this is movie is an absolute masterpiece. Sam Mendes achieved something amazing, that makes one not even wanting to blink.
Also notable is the very uncensored and personal view on war the movie tries, and succeeds to show. You feel like you are there with the characters, for better or for worse - my mother, a nurse, got a little sick, because she could imagine the smell of death a little too well. She still enjoyed the movie a lot tho.
All in all I have nothing to complain about. Camera is awesome, editing is on point, the set design is painfully realistic, story is good and has it's twists, acting is great, the soundtrack is amazing. There isn't much more to say"
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"Just amazing. The screenplay, cinematigraphy and acting are absolutely top notch."
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,"Movie is incredibly slow, spend an awful lot of movie watching the soldiers walking. No rapper is ever built with the main characters and you are left at the end asking yourself 'is that it'. It also hides some of the brutality such as the when Blake gets stabbed or the tussle on the ground with German officer. Thought the film was very poor"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"I've seen many a war movie, this by far is one of the best. I was really tired while watching this in the cinema, I had to keep pinching myself to wake me up. No way I wanted to miss a second of this masterpiece."
1917,9 January 2020,9/10,"Great music, acting, directing, effect, photography, and editing. its faults are normal and very few dialogues, and the firs act was normal compared to the second and third. sam mendes deserves the best director (golden globs). as for the film, it was later"
1917,8 February 2020,5/10,"The action is linear and predictable, it didn't impress me with anything. Weak actors, scenes that force emotion without imagination ... if this is an Oscar movie ... I'll go to just on the theater"
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"The movie is shot with the camera following the two main characters and made and edited to look like it's one big shot. I love the intimacy this technique brings to the film as we really get a sense of everything that is happening, and we never miss anything because there are no visible scene breaks. Some may find the one-shot technique boring, as it shows everything that happens in their journey, but I found it so interesting to be able to be put in their shoes. The cinematography, score and acting are phenomenal and add perfectly to the directing style of the film."
1917,5 February 2020,6/10,"If you're expecting all out trench warfare and bullet dodging heroes, This isn't the film for you. The main character fires rifle around 10 -15 times throughout the movie, This is more of an adventure/drama movie about the main character dodging a handful of deathly situations then it ends"
1917,11 January 2020,1/10,Its like i watched the trailer of Battlefield 1 (videogame).....
1917,25 January 2020,7/10,This film is brilliant at showing that the war wasn't fought or won by the corporals and the general but the millions of people who risked there lives for their country. The cinematography was fantastic the smooth transition between cameras was almost un noticeable and made if very immersive for the audience.However if your going to see this film see its high score on imdb and rotten tomatoes just know that's because of the cinematography and not necessarily because it was well acted or because of its great depiction of the war. Overall the film had me gripped despite dry moments and definitely worth a watch in IMAX and it just adds to that immersion.
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,Mendes' World War I epic is riveting as its continuous shot style lends itself to suspenseful action sequences. Highly recommend!
1917,15 February 2020,1/10,"Yet another film among countless others that is a stunning piece of art in just about every technical category... yet leaves you feeling like crap after watching.For this reason, I don't bother to say anything and just give it a solid 1 out of 10. I didn't enjoy this film, it didn't make me feel good and I never want to watch it again. I suggest you don't watch it either, unless you wanna feel miserable."
1917,15 March 2020,10/10,"What a delightful watch! I couldn't bring myself to blink my eyes, fearing I'd miss out on something. The execution, camera work and sequence of events is so remarkable that it has earned a whopping 10 on 10 from me! Haven't seen such a excellent work in a long time. The music, acting, visual effects... simply terrific!!!"
1917,18 March 2020,10/10,"I'll be really quick! This film kept me on the edge of my seat. Every single technique used by Mendes and his co-workers is unbelievable. Although the plot is kind of ordinary,as there is a bunch of movies about the First World War , what I can definitely say is that this movie has become a huge success. It definitely deserved to be awarded as the best film of the year. (P.S. Why George MacKay is so handsome!? )"
1917,22 January 2021,1/10,"This film is the same like other war films, because most all American or British or French war films, all the way the germans, or japans, or the soviets are the evil, and just they commit crime, and the americans, british, french people just are victims and they never ever commiting war crime... But this is a very big lie."
1917,11 January 2020,5/10,Not a patch on Saving Private Ryan. Plenty of detail and scenes to make you think ; amazing cinematography and all that stuff . BUT the story ? Where was it ?
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"The cinematography is outstanding, as everyone says.
Never spoke a word to friend all through movie.
Simple last scene did it for me when he turned wife's photo over to reveal her message, only someone who has served in danger can truly appreciate that."
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,"The story is a cliche and the performance is awful, I wonder how people thought of comparing it to the Saving Private Ryan."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"One of the beat films i ever see in my life and it sad with thr right music and diractor and every thing
Best movie in 2019."
1917,4 February 2020,1/10,"Worst movie story ever. Starts amazing but the rest is pointless. The stage is amazing though, but the story has no logic"
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"What can I say this movie is amazing on so many levels. Id advice watching it on the big screen, as I'm not sure if you will get the same experience at home on the TV.You really feel like you're there in the trenches, from the atmosphere the visuals and the realistic dialect.I will be seeing this a second time as I'm sure there is plenty of detail, I missed the first time."
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,This movie has a mind of it's own. The way Mendes represents that every second is valuable is just amazing. I just need to watch it over an over again to process the amound of beauty in it.
1917,29 February 2020,10/10,"The movie has virtually no pauses for you to breathe! It's visceral, fast, exciting!
Spectacular the time that was spent in the rehearsals of the whole team and the entire cast involved, the result was great and it really seems like it was shot in one shot."
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"Pretty great experience that is only bogged down by a few gripes. Some of the cuts they tried to hide were extremely obvious and a few events in the plot felt forced and the music was sometimes overbearing. But at the end of the day, this movie is a technical marvel. It's greatest achievement wasn't the cinematography for me, but how well I was immersed throughout the entire thing. I truly felt like I was in the movie, following the characters, which is something very important in a film like this. The entire film being ""one shot"" was a fun and unique gimmick that worked pretty well and allowed for a lot of intense sequences. Character development was pretty light, but the movie isn't trying to be too complex with its story, thus the characters were fine enough and developed enough to be likable."
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"I thought we would finally have a solid WW1 film in store, but instead we got a horror film meets a fairy tail. I wish they spent as much time and effort on writing the plot and the script as the did on the cinematography and set design. The acting was robust no doubt, but I would expect a film of this caliber with a $100M budget to hold at least the slightest bit of historical accuracy or realistic screenplay. This film made Hacksaw Ridge look like a History Channel documentary and The fact that the hollywood foreign press gave 1917 a Golden Global for best drama just proves Ricky Gervais right.... Netflix has already won. They made a mockery out of The Great War."
1917,27 January 2020,5/10,"What can I say it didn't do it for me. I can appreciate the cinematography, but the action was minimal to nil, which is okay if you feel a connection to the characters. Also there where to many ""goofs"" which took me out the experiencing. Wait for it to stream or watch ""The Journeys End"" instead."
1917,30 March 2020,7/10,"It's a good movie. The story it's not so good....not so intense...but the editing...is a masterpiece. Maybe...the film could be an oscar film ..if the story was better.
#stayhome"
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best films I've seen in a long while. Worth seeing on a big screen. Cinematography is outstanding, the one shot process really makes you feel as though you are there. The two leading actors really grasped the concept that human contact can be so strong, especially in such awful situations as war. Insightful, moving and an overall amazing watch."
1917,31 January 2020,7/10,"This film surprised me in such a good way, I'm glad that I saw it. Please give it a chance."
1917,27 October 2020,9/10,"Such a great movie, and deserve to win oscar and nominee in some categories, the shot is incredible"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"I am stunned at how incredible this movie was. The cinematography was just beautiful and so clearly created to fit only one cut scene. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole film. It seems to tick every box needed for a great film. The acting is good; the music is good; the story and development is good; the script is good and the filming was amazing. It was honestly the best film I've ever watched, thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm even more happy that this incredible man will get the recognition he deserves for his brave act"
1917,10 January 2020,9/10,"The whole movie is made to look as one continuous shot, but still captures jaw dropping shots which are backed by an incredible score. The score will bring you on a rollercoaster of emotions that capture the intensity and triumph of the beautiful shots that I will never forget. The only reason I don't give this a 10/10 is because the main characters' logic is sometimes questionable. When the characters face conflict I found myself questioning their reasoning, and some of it just didn't make sense.
Make no mistake, this is a must-see. It perfectly captures the horror of no-mans land, along with the awe of the strangely beautiful war torn landscape of the western front.
SEE THIS MOVIE ASAP."
1917,18 January 2020,9/10,"Just got back from seeing this. Absolutely loved it! One of the best movies I've seen in the past decade.My friend didn't rate it as high as I did (so it may not be for you) but I thought the whole thing was amazing. It is beautifully shot (settings, lighting, color). The one camera, no-cut technique worked perfectly with this story (unlike, IMO, the strange timeline overlay of Dunkirk). And it has many emotional surprises along the way.Highly recommended."
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,"During the movie I was taken away by the ""One Shot"" feel, which faded out the average story and clichés. Only after the movie I realised that it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. I do not think this movie would have gotten alot of praise if it wasn't for the brilliant cinematography. Never the less it was entertaining to watch, and I could recommend to go and watch it."
1917,16 January 2020,7/10,"Great immersion thanks to the sequence planes, a good tension management and an excellent setting, but the film does not allow you to connect with the characters at any time, which are simple and underdeveloped archetypes together with an artificial, predictable, forced script and with a simple and typical structure, putting the show before the background."
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"What a movie. This movie could show the emotional side during the war. The cinematography, effect, music are exceptional. Great movie, very much recommended to watch."
1917,16 January 2020,2/10,2 guys have to go 9 miles and deliver an important message.One guy dies.Other guy delivers message and goes to sleep.We meet a cow a pilot and a baby somewhere in the middle. None of these are important.
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"Soooo many things in this movie do not make sense, periods of time just disappear, on a tight timeline mission to save over 1000 soldiers, but entering into hazardous situations that could have.been bypassed time and again. What the he&% is with the singing in the woods!?! River rapids that suddenly appear, a waterfall, and then calm water again? Really bad writing! Wasted 2 hours of life that I won't be getting back! Cinematography was good tho."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"I've never left a review on imdb for a movie. I generally read most reviews for movies i'm about to watch or shows im currently watching. This movie changed that. I feel as though other people need to know just how unique and excellent this film is.I will admit off the bat that war films are most likely my favorite genre, and that I was very excited for this film before I saw it. It fulfilled my hype. I'm writing this for those that had no knowledge of the film, and dont care for war movies. See it and decide.One cut is what makes this film so crazy unique and anti-generic war movie (gunfights, men dying gloriously x100, this film has none of that) Corporal schofield does not leave the screen the whole movie. You come along for this journey of his. You want him to succeed and stay safe, but there are so many times you are holding your breath for him. When he stops to rest on scene it's almost as if the viewer is looking in the background to be sure he's safe. One scene for example is when the two soldiers are watching the dogfight in the sky just for a Fokker biplane to fly right into the scene, putting an absolute death scare into the viewers. There are so many thriller elements in the film its incredible when you dont expect there to be any.My biggest gripe was how schofield finds the battalion he's ordered to save. (no spoilers) it felt rushed and very random, just kind of stumbles on them, but doesnt change really anything about the movie as there is still much more footage of him attempting to reach his goal once he's at it.The sets are probably the selling point of the film. Won't find a more immersive world war 1 film if you tried. From the trenches to no-man's land to the shelled out cities it all makes you believe it was filmed with an imax camera in the year 1917.Overall, one can have zero knowledge on the first world war, can hate the status quo hollywood war film and still love this movie. The movie could have been based on two german soldiers, two french soldiers, it wouldn't have mattered. It was about beating the odds and keeping you on the edge of your seat as you waited to see if the main character could make it a few more steps closer to their goal unharmed. There was truly so much suspense and action that I found myself hoping the movie wouldnt end. Cannot wait to see again..."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,This film is just incredible. Really makes you feel in touch with every character and the lack of cuts and transitions just makes it flow beautifully. Breathtaking experience.
1917,18 February 2020,10/10,"Extremely touching and beautiful movie by Mendes. The movie really shows some of the hidden history of millions of soldiers and what they had to carry through their lives. The movie also shows the brutality of war, broken brotherhoods and the dirty, miserable standards of living along the front lines. Excellent movie, everybody should see it!"
1917,11 July 2020,1/10,"So many resources wasted. What a disappointment. Luckily, veterans cannot see this trash."
1917,12 December 2019,10/10,"Sam Mendes, did not disappoint with this great one shot film, unlike any war film that I ever have watched, harsh & beautifully crafted flowing perfectly with excitement at every corner!"
1917,13 March 2020,4/10,"You cannot compare this movie any war famous movie, even this is not war movie.
The objective is not logic , the core task is not relevant."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,1917 is an Amazing Film. It Deserves Its Title for Best Picture.
1917,27 December 2019,10/10,This movie was just great! I also like the consistency as well it felt as if the movie had no cuts what so ever. This is probably my favorite movie now. One thing that made this movie outstanding was the actors that were displayed in this movie.
1917,12 January 2020,6/10,It needs unflagging patience to appreciate the realistic beauty of the film and feel the cruelty of the war. Some complain about its insipidity. But veterans say insipidity is also part of a real war. That's what it's like.
1917,1 June 2020,10/10,"I don't know how was that even possible to make the film like that, i'm speechless"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Good picture
Good actring
Good performance
Gust see and enjoy that!!"
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"Here we go. One of my most anticipated films of the year, and it's being released in the dumping ground of the middle of January in the UK. It almost seems too perfect. We have a film that looks like it's going to generate some real buzz from UK audiences out in cinemas at a time where there is nothing to compete with it. Of course, as a cinema goer it's annoying that there's nothing else new coming out, but, if the hype is to be believed, this film is something special. And to explain why I'm looking forward to this film so much, I will need to discuss a war film that came out a few years ago.In July 2017, Christopher Nolan brought us Dunkirk, a furiously raw and bleak take on one of the key turning points in World War II, and ended up being a film I admired rather than loved. It fell in a wired middle ground for me between being too colourless and bleak to be able to get properly invested in, but also the narrative required us to have some kind of feeling towards the characters for it to properly work, and when Tom Hardy spends pretty much his whole role struggling to emote from behind a constrictive mask, connecting with those characters can be difficult. The narrative is certainly satisfying and it's glorious from a structural standpoint, but it didn't quite work for me for reasons I struggled to articulate at the time.1917 looks set to provide the counterpoint to Dunkirk that I've been looking for for the past two and a half years. And, make no mistake, the film looks amazing. I think we might have an early contender for film of the year. In other words, I was looking to see the film the day it finally gets that wide release and see whether it lives up to my sky-high expectations. So, is it as good as I'd hoped?Yes. Not only did this film exceed my expectations, it might just go down as a genre defying classic. Every war movie made from this point is going to be compared to 1917 (and maybe even some that came before), and it is a masterpiece without comparison. I almost feel bad for even comparing this film to Dunkirk in my preamble, because the comparison hardly seems fair. Sure, Christopher Nolan might have had a solid grasp of the fundamentals that make up a solid war movie when he made Dunkirk, but director of 1917 Sam Mendes understands the key thing that Nolan was missing. The understanding that to make a great war movie you don't need to compromise the human core. Dunkirk was a good film, but it felt stone cold. 1917 on the other hand, despite its murky tones and just as heavy themes, still grounds its narrative in real humanity, that being the relationship between two brothers, the younger of whom has been tasked, along with a colleague, to rescue sixteen hundred soldiers, including his older brother, who are walking into a trap after an orchestrated retreat by the Germans. Not only is it a well written narrative, but there are real relationships here that elevate them further.But the characters and how clearly and effectively they are both sketched out accounts to almost nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially in comparison to the technical achievement that this film is. Whoever had the one take idea is a genius. I don't know if Sam Mendes himself had the idea to tell the story in that way, but whoever did deserve all the credit in the world. And it links into the central idea of the film. Everything about it is engineered to create a bleak atmosphere, and the one-shot approach is only half the story there. I am in awe of the team that worked on the set design and lighting for the shots when Schofield arrives in Ecoust, and the acting is second to none, with George MacKay acting like his life depended on it. I believed every moment of MacKay's performance. It had me in tears both times I saw it by the end. There is a belief and a commitment and an understanding of war that, once again, is not so cold hearted to neglect the human element that comes through in MacKay's performance that is damn near transcendent. There is blood, metal, brutal gunfire and a whole lot of fire in this movie, and the diegetic sound that beautifully compliments the framing of every moment draws attention to every little detail of the brutality of war so expertly that it's hard to believe that this film was constructed by people rather than just existing independently of everything.It's nothing short of extraordinary, and I haven't even got to talking about the drop-dead gorgeous cinematography. The wide low-level tracking shots as Schofield and Blake negotiate their way though no man's land are chill inducing, the wide shot of Schofield entering Ecoust is one of the greatest things I've ever seen on a screen, and the camera movement is consistently seamless, especially in the few instances the camera pans. One of the most inspired choices in the cinematography in this film is the use of handheld camera. Sure, there are plenty of still shots, especially as Schofield is in a state of mourning his colleague in the film's opening act, but the camera is never planted and properly still. Just when you thought the film wasn't technically ambitious enough. And this unsettled choice of camera technique only elevates the film further, highlighting the uncertainty of the characters about their future, made all the more tragic by the circumstances in which Blake has his life ended after the pair negotiated the German front line. After a German plane crashes in front of them, Blake attempts to help the injured pilot, even as Schofield suggests putting him out of his misery. Blake's efforts were cut short when he was stabbed to death by the enemy pilot he was trying to rescue. Again, there is a real humanity to the characters that this film is not afraid to foreground. It makes the moment where Schofield breaks the news to his deceased friend's brother in the film's closing moments all the more heartbreakingly beautiful. Again, the ending had me in tears both times I have watched it.1917 is a film so well realised, so exceptionally crafted and so unfathomably and tremblingly raw that it's challenging to express. Amazingly good acting, technical ambition and a story that leaves nothing to be desired. Without a doubt this is the film to beat in 2020, and I'd be surprised if anything does."
1917,9 December 2020,1/10,"A true 1 out of 10 film; We can't understand 75% of what they're saying. The filmmakers go for such historic authenticity, U.S.A. viewers won't be able to understand the dialogue in this film. Me and my elderly father were all ready to watch what looks to be a very well-made film, only to not be able to understand 75% of what they are saying. Completely unwatchable and we lasted 7 minutes into it before deciding we couldn't handle it. Why was this choice made? They didn't speak Russian in The Hunt for Red October past 10 minutes into it..right??"
1917,9 January 2020,5/10,"After reading the reviews on IMDB I decided to watch this movie in the cinema. But the movie was not that good in my opinion. So I felt necessary to make my first review ever for this movie. English is not my native language so bear with me.Pros
1. The filming was pretty good.
2. The actors were good.
3. The plot was ok but could be so much better.Cons
1. The sound effects were just TOO much.
2. The background music didn't allays seem to match with the scene at play.
3. For a movie based on a true story, there was really too much fiction (all the characters were fiction)
4. Some plot scenes didn't make sense (why put it in the movie at all?)
5. There was one lurid joke that was quite disrespectful. (something about a rat, a corpse and some dis balance... don't want to spoil.)The movie good be so much better if the characters were real and not fiction. Make it more personal. What did they achieve with this? Did they earn a reward of anything? How did the characters end up? when and where did it really take place?Conclusion my rating is a 5, but that is on the high side."
1917,12 January 2020,8/10,"I saw 1917 today
directed by Sam Mendes which did an amazing job. the main characters Tom blake played by Dean-Charles Chapman and William Scofield (sco) played by george Mackay are given a mission to deliver a message in enemy territory that will stop 1600 from falling into a German trapThe cinematography is expertly crafted in a way that is very involving through using one shot takesThe pacing is made in a way for you to feel the highs and the lows of the movie with really good sound design almost giving thriller vibesIt has some unnecessary scenes and might seem boring in some areas
In conclusion I give 1917 a 8/10"
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"This is going to be an in depth heavy spoiler review of Sam Mendes' 1917:Where do I start, I saw this on opening day in IMAX (I am from the UK, I know it releases on the 24th in the US in IMAX screens) with my Dad. This is one of those movies that you have to see on the biggest screen possible and the best sound system you can find, it really enhances the overall experience.Let's dive into the actual contents of the movie by talking about the main draw to the movie, the cinematography and one shot feel to it. This does no way feel like a gimmick just to draw crowds in, but an integral part to the story that really made the movie as good as it was, it would not have worked without the extraordinary camerawork from Roger Deakins (guaranteed Oscar) and his team. Some of the shots in this movie are some of the most creative and beautiful I have ever seen in cinema, a couple of examples include the scene with the flares going up at night in the town and the scene where Schofield is running through the fields perpendicular to wave 1 of the attack in order to deliver the message to the commander. Also, the cuts were not obvious and after about 5 minutes I forgot that there were even cuts in the film due to the polished editing and therefore stopped looking for them.This movie also contains what I believe to be one of the most under-appreciated actors this awards season, that man being James Mackay, right from the beginning he sells the performance as an irrelevant soldier in WW1 who is forced to go on a mission with his friend Blake. You could feel every ounce of fear, regret, and eventually, pain and determination within his character. dean-Charles Chapman, on the other hand, gives a solid performance but sadly doesn't really get enough time during the movie to truly shine and have a standout until his demise, where he is phenomenal. The collection of well known actors in this movie have about 6 minutes of screen time in total so I cannot really comment on them, however Cumberbatch delivered the only line of the movie that made everyone in my screening erupt in laughter.One last thing I would like to comment on before I go onto my only negative points of the movie is the score. The score fits perfectly with every moment that it is accompanied with and also fits the mood of the characters very well. One very clear example I can think of is when Schofield is running through the ruins of the town and the Germans are chasing after him, the music slowly builds up to the climax of this scene which is when he jumps into the river below. I firmly believe that Thomas Newman has a very high chance of grabbing that Oscar that he deserves, the only person that could come close to him is Hildur who composed Joker's score.I have two very minor complaints with the movie that I would like to highlight before I give my overall opinion and score. The first of these being that the scene where the plane crashes right where Schofield and Blake are located is a bit farfetched, I understand tat this segment was integral to the plot for obvious reasons but I just feel as if it comes across as a bit of bad luck rather than a genuine risk. My second nick pick is that the scene with the mother and the rescued baby felt shoehorned in just to add another sad moment to the plot, especially because it was never revisited.My overall verdict is that it is a must see technological marvel that is almost perfect and I would not be surprised to see this sweep awards at the Oscars, including best picture. My final rating is 9.5/10, I expect this to change slightly change after I have let the movie sunk in and after a rewatch, but for now it is easily my number 1 movie of 2019.P.S, no one in my cinema made a sound apart from the sound of holding back tears. Everyone's jaws looked like they could touch the floor and everyone erupted into applause at the end, easily my best experience at a screening of a movie ever"
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,I've seen tons of great movies but I have never seen a movie pull off a tenth of the shots from this movie. I am confused at how there where even able to film this. It's God danm gorgeous.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"I HATE blood, gore, and violence. But this movie didn't overdue it in any of those departments. I was in suspense from the first second of the movie! Amazing actors, amazing filming!Has less action than other war movies. Rather, it focuses on the storyline. BUT again I was in suspense the whole movie.10/10 would recommend!!"
1917,11 January 2020,7/10,I was so excited to watch this after all the good reviews. And although it's a good film I can't say it's the best. It lacks something but I can't put my finger on it. It has a lot of emotion though. The scenes are good and I especially liked the detail of the fallen.
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917 the most unique film in the past decade.Sam Mendes and the 1917 team did an excellent job at displaying the bravery and sacrifice of war - a horror that should be the revival of the war movie genre.It constantly entertains an extraordinary plot with beautifully shot scenes and incredible acting. It's very easy to forget this is all done in one. continuous. take. no. breaks. (very well edited, by the way) It's a time-sensitive scenario where we see the characters every decision.The movie is shot in an order oddly reminiscent of how a video game would be played. You and the characters both have the exact point of view and would be forced to make those decisions in this 'almost game-like World War 1 mission'. I'm amazed by how they transitioned between scenes so flawlessly.All in all, a revolutionary way to share a story on the big screen.
The start of ""The Storytelling Revolution""."
1917,15 January 2020,8/10,"That's it, that's the review. It's meant in the most complementary of ways. But yeah. Two young men are sent running towards, away from, over, under, around, and through enemy lines to save the lives of 1600 men doomed to charge headlong to their deaths. Throughout their harrowing mission is heartbreak and terror, success and setback. It's a film about survival and the extraordinary actions needed just to make it home.1917 is a technical masterpiece. Even those among you that are familiar and fans of the work of Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki must reckon with the GOAT-ness bubbling forth from this master class of cinematography from Roger Deakins. Immersive feels like an understatement. Throughout the film are examples of expert lighting, production design that is both grandiose and detailed all at once, and marathon shots meticulously choreographed.A razed French village illuminated solely by the glow of white phosphorus flairs. A brief respite and moment of humanity in a furnace lit basement. A palm-sweating journey into and through no mans land. This film's indelibility lies not in its story, but in its imagery."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is truly breathtaking. From the first few moments of the movie we can see that Roger Deakins is at the helm of the camera. His work in this movie and the work of the production designers are what makes this movie sensational. You really do believe you are there with these men as they go to war. Immersive, powerful and heartwarming are just a few words that come to mind when watching this movie. If you liked 'Dunkirk' by Chris Nolan, then you will definitely not want to miss this movie."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,1917 is stunning in both its visual impact as well as its acting. I have long been a fan of war movies that are done well and this film is the epitome of powerful storytelling of war. Sam Mendes' decision to use a single shot format carries the audience through the trenches with the soldiers. Their fear is palpable and translates from the screen to the theatre. And Thomas Newman's lyrical score provides a superb background to the story-never intrusive but enhances the action. I cannot capture the excellence of the two chief actors who set a high bar for the big names that support them in the story. 1917 is certain to be a classic-I know it will be one of my all-time favorite movie experiences.
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,"It seems for US and UK that the sacrified men were always from their countries. Why not to tell us about the mess they are doing all around thw world nowdays? Nah, better, idealize our passed fights, of course, never saying a word about the russians and their undeniable roll in the wwII. When Epic is there to justify the Us terrorism (if the drone had been from Iran, and the dead man from Us we should have called like that, why not when is inverted?) must be said, and in this movie it is not. Propaganda from US and UK with christmas lighta..."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,This movie was absolutely astonishing. The visuals were amazing and so were the characters. Both characters allowed you to feel connected with them and it showed the chaos of war. I loved every second of this film and can't wait to watch it again. It was perfect. George and Dean are incredible actors who made this movie enjoyable and told the story emotionally but perfect.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"A must see, It felt as war should, horrible and devastating however in the way it was told with such natural flow there was no feel at all as if it were being told through a screen or at any point felt unrealistic. For what this was, a story it was beautiful, I couldn't spot any single use of cgi anywhere or at any point a facade, all was built in depth character and set alike. These two contrasts of the horror of war and the amazing delicacy in which it was told, to parallel opposites, married in to two, creating a perfect night out of thrill and suspense.
The only downfall I found was it didn't have a killer piece of music (the music was great), Hymn to the fallen to be precise, but then again in war you don't have those such soundtracks (if you're lucky you may get the bagpipes when about to go over).""The truth untold the pity of war""We will remember them."
1917,12 January 2020,1/10,"The best movie of 2019 NO the worst. Absolute rubbish. Compare it to the reality of war, the emotion and pointlessness of war, the self sacrifice and cost, the sadness and the mixed happy ending with Saving Private Ryan. This was absolutely a pointless movie combined with one friend getting shot and the other doing a lame version, a ridiculous bullet dodging of John Wick combined with Lassie comes Home. This was boring, uneventful, non technical, lame lame lame. Advertised as the best. A money maker which leaves you feeling conned out of 20 bucks and 2 hours of my life."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"I must admit I was apprehensive about watching this, but having read the reviews both my wife and I went yesterday.
What a magnificent film, really cannot be faulted and holds you from beginning to end.
I had tears in my eyes when it finished and thought about my grandfather who fought on the Somme and was invalided out due to 'shell shock' and this film brought home the terror that those in the trenches must have suffered."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"1917's overlooked color, light, and set design lulls you into a subtle hypnotic trance that mesmerizes you throughout the entire film. The grand feat of Roger Deakon's cinematography evokes firsthand tension through secondhand meticulously visual storytelling. Though the minimal character building keeps the film from being an emotional classic, the extensive world building and methodical shooting techniques of 1917 will set a precedent for all future wartime epics."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"I like realism in my films and 1917 didn't disappoint. I was initially concerned by the trench shown in the promo film, but watching the whole film reveals its context.The film kept my attention from start to finish, jumping in my seat in the underground bunker scenes. Nothing was predictable, and the film moved at a good pace.The scene at the end where the troops prepare to go over the top was quite tense, the use of a whistle to signify the start of an attack sends shivers down the spine when you are aware of what it signifies.There will be detractors stating its not as good as Saving Private Ryan, that is also a good film. There are people stating there are historical inaccuracies in 1917, well look up if there were any Tiger tanks in the American sector in Saving Private Ryan used in the final scene and you will find there wasn't, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good film.The reason few German soldiers are depicted in 1917 is because they had retreated to the Hindenburg line, if you look up any interviews with Mendes he will tell you he choose this particular time frame as the front line was more fluid and it enabled him to produce a film that wasn't constricted by a few hundred yards of no mans land. The Germans had withdrawn, left their trenches and were taking up positions in a well defended line, which incidentally is explained by the officer in the opening few minutes. Therefore it being April, and beyond the no mans land killing zones the landscape would be lush and green.I saw a post on a review elsewhere where somebody was complaining the Indian soldiers turban had been tied in a modern fashion. Like i said I like realism in a film but there is nothing in 1917 that would make me sit back in disgust.All in all a great film, would recommend."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Nothing is needed to be said. Just 10/10⭐
The director, the cast and the team made this movie an absolute P H EN O ME N A L"
1917,24 January 2020,7/10,"This movie's main selling point was that it was made to look as if the whole movie was filmed in one take. The main problem I have with this movie, though, is that Mendes abandons that idea halfway through the movie. He attempts to justify this single noticeable cut in the movie by having the main character come back from being knocked unconscious. This cut could have been avoided in numerous ways, though. He could have held a static shot on the unconscious body of the main character and shown time going by through the sun going down, since he was knocked unconscious while the sun is still up and wakes up at nighttime. Or Mendes could have the same dynamic shot that goes to black but then go back to the same shot when the character wakes up. Those are just two possibilities but there are plenty of creative ways to avoid cutting in the middle of a movie built around not cutting. This was a very annoying part of the movie and really affected how well this movie is as a whole since that was the main idea for the movie. Also, the cinematography left a lot to be desired, especially from somebody as amazing of a cinematographer as Roger Deakins, but there were some very good looking shots still since again it is Roger Deakins. For example, the scene at the end of the movie where the main character is running across the battlefield is easily the absolute best part of the movie. It looked great, the acting was great even though there was no dialogue but the main actor still displayed such determination and fear that it was still a very good performance. The acting in the movie was very good throughout, too, especially from Dean-Charles Chapman. He has a very expressive face that allows him to show many emotions without saying much. George MacKay, though, while he did do a good job for most of his scenes, his death scene did not feel very convincing. The writing in the movie, while not amazing, was still attention grabbing and the dialogue felt realistic enough. Given all of this, if I had to rate the movie, I would give it around a 6-7/10 leaning more towards a 7/10. That one scene I previously talked about alone is worth seeing this movie for. If they had not cut that one time in the middle of the movie I would have given it an 8/10."
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"My review of 1917.In short you must see this film. I don't say this because I have a passing interest in World War 1 nor because I think war is good. No. See this because it highlights extremely accurately a war that now only lives in silent black and white, distant documentary or the written word. It highlights is terror, sadness and pointlessness.Now there are some inaccuracies which manly focus on geography but I won't dwell on them as to point it out and spoil it. If you know Northern France it's obvious.On the matter of mud, of course the whole of World War 1 was fought in the wet and mud even in high summer (a common misconception) the majority of the film is mud free and this is accurate. The chalk pit of guns and chalk tunnels are also near identical to the same areas found in France today.The inital trench scene and crossing into No Mans Land is, I would say, perfectly represented. You can almost smell death. Google images of No Mans Land or trenches after an attack after you have seen the film to appreciate how well it has been created. That is how hundreds of square miles of France and Belgium looked.Note the difference between the British frontline and the German frontline at the start. Well thought out.The camera work is second to none. The characters portray the stress and tension of war extremely well. And given there are few characters it is remarkable that this is acheived.The score never over powers and adds when there is little or no dialog.The relationship between the two main characters, I think, doesn't go to set out and be the focus. The get on as they have been through so much and are just trying to survive. The rescue of the German pilot isn't discussed as to whether they should help the enemy on war morals; they rescue him as they don't want to a man suffer and try to do their best for him.The final scene of men going over the top and the running Schofield can be considered epic and a cinematic master piece. You feel every explosion and every frustration.Thought this maybe a controversial to say, we finally have a war film that does not portray US troops in any theater or war or big name US actors in lead roles. No cigar chomping. No cliched story of a loved one back home. No bravado. No satisfactory ending.It is a true to life (with some Hollywood) war film that covers a relatively little known period of Britians Great War effort (compared to say the Somme or Ypres). It has been filmed with care but does not shy away from the filth and terror and showing terrible injuries that come to mind when remembering the 14-18 conflict.It is worth seeing and then exploring what happened in 1917 as thankfully the film does not set out to educate in this way."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,"I do not want to create controversies but we need to highlight all races which fight for the Allied Forces. I see very few of them with no rating in the film industry or I am missing something. In both World wars every race and ethnicity participated but the praise goes to one community is out of doubt.
""Historians pointed out that 2.5 million south Asian soldiers fought alongside Britain in the second world war. Some 1,000 Indian soldiers were also on the beaches at Dunkirk, not to mention non-white soldiers from elsewhere in the British empire, or the multi-ethnic rescue flotilla, or a heavily north African presence in the French army - none of whom seemed to figure among the movie's 6,000 extras. When you watch Dunkirk, remember that it's a whitewashed version which ignores the bravery of black and Muslim soldiers"" (A review of the Dunkrik)
The same goes for all such movies created to highlight history of the WWI or WWII."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"I didn't know much going into it except that it was a WWI film. What I got was over 2 hours of beautiful cinematography, war scenes in all their tragic glory and a deeper appreciation for those lost in any/all wars. It was a great story of determination and honor."
1917,15 January 2020,3/10,Not since Tom Arnold hid behind a signpost in True Lies has a move character been as bulletproof in a movie as lead protagonist Will.Yes amazingly filmed but the rest of it is just a steaming pile.The plot is terrible and it makes this a bad movie
1917,15 January 2020,5/10,"All Germans are treacherous devils, the only French we encounter are a damsel in distress with infant, all Brits are jolly good fellows. Is this what a century of warfare, decolonization and tentative European integration has taught the inhabitants of Albion about themselves and the world? Great movie, technically, but as far as the message of the story is concerned: Troubling to say the least."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Moving and inspiring, 1917 shows us the perfect combination of masterful acting, directing, cinemarography..."
1917,15 January 2020,1/10,"Just back from watching this film, if this is line for best picture, I cannot see me being back at the cinema anytime soon, absolute tripe from start to finish."
1917,17 January 2020,5/10,"I knew nothing of the film heading into the theatre other than it was based on WW1.Cinematography, lighting, yes brilliant. That of course doesn't make a film deserve an 8.7 rating.This is a war film for the Marvel generation. There is limited emotion shown by the main characters, scenes that suspend reality and cliche, cliche, cliche.Our hero finds a bucket of unspoilt milk at an abandoned farmhouse beside the only cow in sight.A trip wire is tripped by a rat in a bunker in which the two soldiers are in, one is in scratched while the other is buried under rubble, He is dragged out of the rubble with not a scratch, only to have some dust in his eyes. Yet the explosion was so significant it forces the entire large bunker to collapse.Our hero is shot at by a sniper while crossing the bridge. I thought at this point that we finally might be able to see a tense scene. In other good war films this game of cat and mouse might have lasted several minutes. No need. Our hero somehow immediately locates the position of the sniper and is able to shoot and would him. Stunning marksmanship.Yet only two scenes later our hero is running through a town in rubble being shot at by German soldiers no more than 20 yards away and isn't hit.The worst part though, even worse than the tacky scene with the French woman and child, is his escapade down the river, through the rapids, and down a waterfall only the exit the river right at the point at which the battalion he was attempting to locate is luckily only 15 yards away.Things just seem to randomly work out for our hero, and quickly. There needed to be a few sequences where the hero is faced with the enormity of the situation, loneliness, desolation. Rather each time one chapter is finished he is immediately assisted in movies to the next.This film pales in comparison to films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. An opportunity lost. I left the cinema modestly entertained yet empty and disappointed."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,The book (The Bad Canadian) was better. Deserves a wider audience.
1917,16 January 2020,,"I found it an extremely well made film. A shame the plot was Cliched What are the chances of the plane crash landing so close to them? Of all the bombed out houses he found the one with a women and a baby! Also the number of times he was shot at but survived. Especially at the end running across the top of the trenches!
Still as said a well made film."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"This time to my review this movie, i had wath this movie this morning, and make me happy"
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Wonderful movie, that really gives you credit for paying close attention to the minor details.Had me at the edge of my seat for the whole movie.10/10"
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,"A truly gripping first 45 mins but I thought it lost its way a little in the middle, recovered at the end. Wonderful heavy hitting cameos. Script could have been better.
The cinematography was outstanding and deserves all possible accolades in that department. Superb soundtrack reenforced the dramatic setting."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"The best movie I have ever seen. If you can, GO AND WATCH IT"
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"This movie should not have a happy end. WWI was mostly pointless loss of life, that message would have been sent much better if the lead character did not fulfill his mission, then it would have really shown how it actually was for most of those boys that were killed for no good reason..."
1917,19 January 2020,6/10,"Expected more after seeing reviews and award nominees, was kinda disappointed!"
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,The camerawork makes you feel like you're there with the characters.
1917,3 February 2020,7/10,To be watch on cinema. Interesting use of the camera.
1917,28 March 2021,10/10,"What an amazing movie and especially the camera work. It's amazing how you don't notice it's like a one shot movie. Beautiful how you see the main characters all the time, it really draws you in the movie with the characters. Amazing performance."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"When I watched this movie in theaters, I was shook by both the unbelievably beautiful and terrifying pictures and the continuity of the story.
The movie is filmed as if it was one 2 hours long continuous shot and it really adds to the overall movie and helps to immerse you into the story.
The main characters and the rest of the story are just as great so if you haven't seen this movie yet, it is 100% worth watching."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,Watched this with my husband last night fantastic film totally immersed in it from the start felt like you were there with them . Brilliant camera work . Deserves so many Oscars.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"I really enjoyed 1917 because the acting and the filming was fantastic.
The editing was really good too defenetly worth watching"
1917,20 January 2020,1/10,"Somebody goofed!In the scene where the airplane crashes, the house and barn are badly damaged, but the surrounding pasture looks a prestine green, without any torn up earth or bomb craters. Similarly, when Schofield runs across 'no-mans-land' in front of the trenches, bombs rain down, and create craters, but there are no old craters from previous attacks (?) Where he is running looks as well-manacured as NFL astroturf! Also, directly in front of these trenches, there are no coils of defensive barb wire (?)The director could be forgiven for one blunder, but three are a bit too much to 'suspend my disbelief' !"
1917,20 January 2020,4/10,"Don't understand the high ratings. It was such an extremely slow movie. Yes, the way it was film may be different but the story line wasn't that fantastic. LCP Schofield running away from snipers and enemy soldiers within close range were very unrealistic. A long 2 hours to see through this movie...."
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,You have to see this movie. It is for sure the best movie of 2019.
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Breathtakingly realistic, immense setting, perfect acting, shows the brutal reality of WW1, easily the best movie of the year, one of the best movies of the decade, one shot, so realistic that it was almost frightening!One of the best war movies ever made and it easily confirms the Great War as the most brutal and unearthly like in all of mankind. PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
1917,20 January 2020,10/10,"Must watch it. It's an experience. The cinematography, acting, plot, transitions. Everything was amazing."
1917,13 April 2020,10/10,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Not easy to watch, but I'm glad I was able to watch until the end. The one shot technique has this effect of making you feel like you are right there with the characters. The story gives you unique insights about war and how different personalitites react differently to it. I definitely recommend watching it, even if war movies are not usually your type."
1917,22 January 2020,4/10,"This movie is the polar opposite of band of brothers. Instead of action & tactics, you have awkward long scenes of nothing. Left me looking around the theater to see if anyone was loving it, and everyone looked highly bored.
It's long scenes of nothing, where they're trying to invoke emotion I guess, but left me daydreaming because it was so boring. There were about 5 or 6 explosive scenes that were just a blip of the movie, like they had to add some action to qualify as a war movie.
If you saw the commercial advertising this movie, and thought it was an action movie, you will be very let down ... as the commercial showed every action scene there was! Anytime there was some action, it stopped right away with no furtherance of that action, just move along. Weird, odd, not worth the $, and I saw the senior $5 matinee. If you love love love boring brit tv, you'll love this.
Then it ends in the middle of a scene ... when credits started to roll, I looked around, and people were still kicked back, legs up, eating popcorn ...... we looked around like ""that's it?"". Horrible to call this a war movie, I mean, yes it took place in battle, on a battlefield, but the story rolls soooo slowwww. Wish I could get that 2hrs back."
1917,23 January 2020,1/10,"Appalling film, slow, lacking script, storyline & totally unbelievable events."
1917,23 January 2020,7/10,"The movie is shot perfectly to show the raw emotions and the confusion surrounding war. However, some things are too coincidental to feel natural. Felt like the story had some loopholes."
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"The only thing that can be said about this masterpiece that it is art in motion. The emotion overpowers the viewer, it goes in every crack in sour body. One of the strongest movies I have ever watched and probably the best movie to show the emotion of war in a very powerfull way. Reminded me of Stanley Kubricks ""Paths of Glory"""
1917,25 January 2020,8/10,Sad but this film shows us that we are strong creature and we can handle anything just we must go forward.
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Best movie watched in a recent time, i become fan of cinematography.Still I'm getting goosebumps how they manage to a huge lengthy shots? Really appreciate your work."
1917,25 January 2020,8/10,"I rate this movie
""DO U KNO DE WEI""/10That part was hilarious. I'm not a movie critic. Movie was quite great even though the accuracy of the German soldiers was straight out from star wars and that ate a bit of feeling of the movie. Also i think the death scene of lance corporal Blake was missing something. Maybe bit more intense fight scene instead of just bum ouch he stabbed me do you kno de wei and ded."
1917,25 January 2020,1/10,3/4 of the way through watching this rubbish. Thankfully I am a member of a great cinema in Heaton Mersey that sells decent quality wine at reasonable prices. Do not get taken away by the reviews this is like watching paint dry slowly. 2 hours I will never get back.
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"Spent most of the time either crying or with my heart racing out of my chest. Very gripping film with amazing cinematography! It portrays the war in its true horrific style but through the eyes of one soldier and the journey he faced. Defiantly recommend watching, seen in its full glory at the cinema!"
1917,26 January 2020,1/10,"Not sure what all the fuss is about this movie, but giving it a 1 star is very generous. Waste of time and money. I was expecting a 'saving private Ryan' type movie, but was very disappointed."
1917,26 January 2020,8/10,"The cinematography in this movie is just breathtaking!!it makes you believe that you are truly a part of the story from the very first minute till the last one...the acting it's very very good and realistic that makes you feel the loss and the difficulties of an actual war,but on the other hand the plot could be a little more unpredictable!"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"Long one-
I will call it a film and not a commercial movie cz it is not for minting money but to make you feel the vibes of the events captured by camera. It will put you in there right in the middle of the scene and you feel watching it first hand. I mean a movie should be like this. The frames captured by the director is seriously incredible. The depiction of the dead soilders and the dog, the isolated war zone and the protagonist struggle is beyond words. To be very clear, it is not a war story. It has a very simple and short story to tell, but the way it has been told plus the background music with the amazing acting pushes it in a totally different league. Tbh this one has become one of my favourites after Joker and Dunkirk. No surprise that the film has received so many nominations. Hats off to the director Sam Mendes.Short one-
JUST GO AND WATCH IT, guys!! You will not regret it. :)"
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about the way the movie was filmed. I thought it may make me feel as if I am playing a game, just with no control. However this cinematic masterpiece surprised me greatly, with its immersive way of taking the audience on this journey. I am not easily thrilled, yet i caught myself, grasping on the arm rests multiple times. You will feel wide range of emotions and care deeply for the story, so simply, effortlessly and beautifully told. The story that makes war experience so personal and real, even if you've (hopefully) never experienced war yourself. I am a big fan of war movies, but i am sure, that even if such theme isn't your preference - you will like this one and it won't leave you indifferent."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"When you combine an incredible story, with a good acting performance, the proper guidance and the right techniques, you achieve perfection, I guess. Probably the best combination of these elements I've ever seen. I don't know if it is perfect, maybe it's too early to call, but if this isn't the one, must say I feel very excited to imagine where do we go from here!"
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,This has to go to my list of favourite films of all-time. Feels like you're there with them. Great cinematography.
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"I don't expect much when I go to the cinema. After all, most of the movies playing will fade from memory, and only a few will be cherished for generations to come. 1917 caught me by surprise.From the very first shot, it had a sense of timelessness and immediacy, bridging the vast gap between a modern audience, warm, safe, and comfortable in a movie theatre, and the ""torn fields of France."" The sensory details--barbed wire slicing a soldier's hand, shell holes filled with muddy water, broken trees in the mist, corpses, flies, and rats--were overwhelming. You wanted to look away, but the horrors were filmed with such beauty that you couldn't. It was like a great symphony, majestic and overpowering, stirring your deepest emotions, with so many contrasts--fire and water, light and darkness, life and death--interspersed with scenes of peace and quiet.Visually, 1917 is a masterpiece. However, I found it somewhat lacking in terms of dialogue and character development. The movie was also missing a theme, a metaphor, or a conclusion that would have made it intellectually engaging. Perhaps the omission was deliberate, so as not to distract the viewer from the visual poetry or hinder the pace.Some reviewers are calling 1917 the greatest World War I movie ever. I disagree; I think the honour belongs to All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), based on the classic novel by Erich Maria Remarque. The movie is both visually and intellectually engaging, and the novel is a must-read for anyone interested in World War I. To quote the preface, ""This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it."" This was my biggest issue with 1917: it was, most of all, an adventure, not unlike Jumanji or Indiana Jones. A few times, I thought I was watching a video game.Overall, 1917 was a pleasant surprise, and I strongly recommend it. Go watch it in the cinema. It will blow you away, but it may also remind you that great visuals are not a substitute for great storytelling."
1917,29 January 2020,1/10,"This film is RUBBISH.
Anyone with an ounce of military know-how would also know this.
There is so much wrong with this film I could write over 2 sides of A4.
But, apart from the dreadful inconsistency and ridiculous lack of anything resembling military practice WHY would only a pair of men be sent to deliver such an important message?
They watch aeroplanes (instead of getting on with their task) and one has to think (if one has at least one brain cell) why an aeroplane was not sent to land behind the British forward line and deliver the message?
If a German 'plane can be shot down in flames and the pilot survive the crash AND survive the fire AND kill a messenger then a Brit pilot could have flown to deliver the message. Far more believable.
War Horse was such a better film.
These two walk across a water-logged wasteland, enter a tunnel and then appear in a desert-like landscape. Was this Narnia? Who wrote this tripe?
When buried after a rat set off a trip wire, he is hauled out and his helmet is still on his head even though neither of them used their chin straps. They walked and talked - not tactical at all. They entered buildings instead of boxing around them. The last chap engaged a sniper (very poorly) and then entered the darn building. Did he use his grenades that were made such a fuss of at the beginning? NOooooo! He risked the outcome of the mission (saving 1600 men to have a duel). I had to stop watching for a while at this point. The raid he was supposed to stop was to start at dawn and yet with the sun up he sat down and listened to a soldier singing. Please... Give me a break. And throughout the film he had the chance many times over to shout his message to stop the attack, but he did not do this. He had to deliver it to the Colonel. Really? He would have told everyone he met in reality (a) so the message got through if he died (b) because the message would have spread by word of mouth. HOW did the message survive the torrential river scene? How did the paper it was written on survive for that matter? As I say; this film was RIDICULOUS. He even dried off very quickly. I have only pointed out a FEW of the points that made this farcical. WHO has been writing these good reviews? Have they watched:
War Horse
American Sniper
13 Hours; the secret soldiers of Benghazi? True stories, well told and worthy of airing.
This 2 hour INCREDULOUS mess is an INSULT to any soldier and certainly an insult to the poor souls that fought and died in WWI."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"One of the Best Oscar(2019) nominated movie.Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes have some amazing connection, they know how to show something really simple in very cool style. You can't turn your eyes away from the screen, the style as recorded by this movie is just incredible.Acting Ensemble Dean-Charles Chapman, George MacKay super. I just open new generation good Britain actors.You definitely have to go and watch this masterpiece in a movie theater."
1917,31 January 2020,7/10,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is riveting. And it will probably win Oscars. But I left feeling that Mendes should have done better. As another reviewer has commented, it felt like a FPS with the character moving through a number of vaguely related scenes overcoming all the set obstacles. My questions are:
Who milked the cow and why didn't they take the milk?
When all other cattle were slaughtered by retreating Germans, why not this one?
Has Mendes actually been to Picardy? It's a flat swamp, with not a fast running rocky sided stream within 100 km. My grandfather was injured in May 1917 at Bullecourt, the village next up the road from Écoust; I know what this countryside looks like."

1917,5 February 2020,7/10,"The filming is good but other then that it's a very forgettable war movie. The story has potential but it just seems like the writers chose a bunch of WW1 tropes and added them haphazardly into an hour and a half movie. I went to see this movie after I saw it had a 8.5 out of 127000 votes so it was super disappointing when it turned out to be average. If you see this movie go in with no expectations and itll be decent. As for me, I thought it was hot garbage."

Not my cup of tea, as a Belgian.
Lots of cinema but not an nerve-wracking storyline."
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,"1917 could have easily been another feel good war moive but becaue of its brillain cinamotograhpy and amazing acting, 1917 is truly an amazing film."
1917,14 February 2020,10/10,"After i saw this movie i was overwhelmed by knowledge, pain and beauty. Im studying WW1 for personal gain, and im so glad this movie stumbled into my life. It gave me magnificent cinematography, gripping storyline and aweing talent from every single actor/actress (taking to you French lady). Cant wait to rewatch"
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"I saw it twice within a week and could watch it again, no problem. It is the most intense, riveting movie I have ever witnessed. Truly an awesome (a much overused word, but appropriate here) cinematic accomplishment!"
1917,10 February 2020,10/10,"Amazing structure, every scene is special and all dialogues are justified.
Beside the good British and evil German soldier adversity, the movie is incredible."
1917,10 February 2020,9/10,The cinematography and realism of the actor's emotions make this one stunning war movie. Keeps you on your toes until the end!
1917,10 February 2020,2/10,This movie had the worst acting and it was stupid if u like movies ask my opinion. A Robot must of gave this movie Great Ratings cause when I tell u it sucked. U know what go ahead and waste ur money cause u was Bored
1917,13 February 2020,10/10,What can i say exept the title. eisiest 10/10 ever
1917,13 February 2020,5/10,Those guys didnt even got through the 7 days army boot camp. Sorry to say but this movie is a poor politicaly righteous attempt to sell you some tickets. Go and see Paths of Glory... Oscar cmon whats wrong with the world today.
1917,14 February 2020,8/10,"From the opening scene until the final shot, this movie will keep you riveted to your seat and biting your nails. However, it is far from Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz. Several pieces of the story that were unclear or unnecessary. The mother and child scene in the ruins doesn't add to the story line. If Schofield was shot by the sniper, how did he recover? If the Germans had amassed so much materiel in their new position in preparation for the trap and were able to bombard the 2nd infantry unit, why did they not continue the bombardment? The collapsing tunnel scene after the rat tripped the booby trap which followed behind the two soldiers, reminded me of the collapsing tunnel scenes in almost every Indiana Jones and 1950 California mining movie. While my wife thought that the movie reflected the WW I trench warfare well, I didn't feel the tension, smell the stench, or sense the futility as much as she did. The dead and rotting bodies scanned throughout the movie were all face down (with the exception of one soldier caught on the barbed wire) reflecting little cinematographic ingenuity, cruelty, or horror. The bodies in the river were mere stepping stones for Schofield as he climbed up the river bank rather than rotting corpses. In summary, a great story line conveyed by excellent acting but missing cinematographic gore and glory."
1917,27 January 2021,10/10,"So if you want a film that'll take your breathe away and make you question
"" how did the director do that?"" then this is the film for you.As an upcoming film actor I had to watch it as two perspectives : a lovey dovey gummy film lover who fell in love with the art when I was just an infant & then as a student of the game who really really loves the art as a whole and everything about a film can make sense when watched twice.First off the story as a whole is so emotional because its real and apart of us all and it just makes you go damn the world really went through it . Adding to that each of us could relate in a way because I'm for sure someone in the world family member was there , or even the person reading , and on that note wow that's alot to think about .Anyway what I wanted to say was the actors & actresses in the film are so damn good at telling the story , which gets you very emotional and hot from how intense the film is .
George mckay is Phenomenal
Benedict Cumberbatch is Great
Dean-Charles Chapman is Fantastic
Claire Duburcq is GoldenNow on to the director my gosh man where the heck does he get off with that much creativity man! the way Sam lets the film get shot point to point .
All in one shot ! i haven't seen this much eye catching action since :
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which i was luckily to catch as a child in the theater .So in conclusion I high recommend to watch this film when you get a chance ..no watch it whenever you are ready to let go and feel free asap!"
1917,3 March 2020,9/10,"1917 is one of those very few films that give you a one-in-a-million experience. The continuous shot really anchors your senses to the screen as you follow the journey of these two young men. The cinematography, lighting, production design, blocking, and acting are all FLAWLESS. Each scene delivers its own unique composition and emotion that you just can't help but appreciate the vision and treatment that this film was so tenderly given. DEFINITELY A MUST WATCH! DON'T WATCH IT ANYWHERE ELSE UNLESS IT'S ON THE BIG SCREEN. IT TRULY TAKES THE MEANING OF 'CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE' TO A WHOLE 'NOTHER DAMN LEVEL!"
1917,15 February 2020,1/10,"Doesn't worth watching. Don't waste your time.All the scenes are predictable. The actions are simple and even funny.
How could you believe a soldier leave his gun and run away from Germans without getting shot."
1917,15 February 2020,4/10,"This is a good movie for young children around the age of 6 or 7 but besides that it's a complete fantasy, I actually though Disney had made it upon leaving the theater. The camera work and visuals for the most part were pretty great but it was more of a love story than a war. The movie makes it like the guns in WW1 couldn't shoot a fish in a barrel and somehow no one gets a scratch on them when they do find their few adversities. The movie was basically just one long conversation between two soldiers, nothing exciting or worth watching."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,1917 wow. What a film! From start to finish I was fully interested all the way through. Quite honestly one of the best war films I've seen for some time.
1917,16 February 2020,6/10,This film is a total bull**** don't loose your time watching
1917,19 February 2020,8/10,"""Director Sam Mendes employs distinctive but extraordinary shots in the first person during the two-hour footage, which makes the production work in many different ways. Although it sometimes results too shaky, it is thanks to George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman's performances that 1917 preserves both sombre but optimistic tones throughout the montage. In short, this is an exceptional approach to memorialise the hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War"".We are somewhere in France during the Trench Warfare (1915 - 1917) with a depleted British Army; the atmosphere, alongside with the dialogues, can define by itself how was life at the front: scarce water and food, despair between soldiers to go home, endless weapons and corpses scattered on the floor, and so forth. Corporals Blake and Schofield are told to attain a severe/impossible mission despite not having any reinforcements. Before achieving this goal in sending General MacKenzie (Bennedict Cumberbatch) the infamous fallback letter, both privates must penetrate the frightful No Man's Land and experience horrendous life-and-death encounters in many places.Regardless of the silent second half, the absence of preeminent performers and the woozy experience of watching the film in one sole perspective director Sam Mendes and executive producers deliver an eloquent portrayal about surprising facts of the four-year global conflict. For example, both soldiers are bewildered by the superiority of the German trenches in proportions and in quality considering that historically they were far better equipped than the Allied ones which allow the audience the opportunity of a lifetime to analyse the condition millions of innocent citizens were facing. The result improves with some accurate shots at landscapes, underground warfare channels, entire villages pulverised, etcetera. I must acknowledge the last fifteen minutes of the film; it has been a long time since I spotted such an imposing ending. Countless emotions appear regardless of having reached the climax. What a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen!What amazes me the most is that despite being a World War film, 1917 does not give the impression in duplicating the ordinary details of previous same-genre releases such as Hacksaw Ridge (2017). Once Mr Gibson introduced a brief biography of Desmond Doss (the main character) he began recording some ultraviolent scenes as though you were spotting the most savage state of humankind. As an alternative, 1917 delivers some innovative procedures in creating a war film without increasing the brutal strength of instant classics as Saving Private Ryan.Congratulations![80/100]"
1917,19 February 2020,10/10,The way this movie shows the story is one of the greatest. You never get diverted from the story and get totally in it.
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"Hopefully the world will never have to face the horrors of another world war. And maybe we should, to find our humanity again. This is more of a letter to a moment in time we must never forget than an exact account of what happened. The cinematography, acting and editing is beyond beautiful."
1917,22 February 2020,5/10,"There has been set a lot about the cinematographic grandeur of this movie. Though nevertheless, 1917 could not really 'capture' me. Let me explain to you wihy, without going into details too much:The movie to me felt like The Lord of the Rings: An unlikely hero goes with a friend on a quest to bring something valuable into the dark lands. A lot of the praised cinematics of this movie remind me a lot of Lotr as well. The wasteland, the forest with the chanting, the firelands and also Blake dying struck me a lot like Frodo (almost) dying.Unlike Lotr there wasn't really a side story though. Going from point a to point b was kind of it. And it would not have been that hard if it were not for some highely unlikely events. Using the first World War as a scenery also felt somewhat random to me; there was hardly any context concerning the war. Germans are evil and shoot like stormtroopers, but didn't get any human charectaristics. This movie could have also been situated in the American Civil War or the Cold War near the Berlin wall; kind of everywhere where the protagonist has to beyond enemy lines without modern technology.I do wonder what happened to the hero since he stuck his open wound hand in a dead man's body which would seem like a fatal infection waiting to happen back then."
1917,23 February 2020,7/10,Film is very nice it has lot of emotions and we does not get bored will watching the movie
1917,8 May 2020,7/10,"Let's get one thing out of the way: The cinematography of this movie is incredible. The way the camera moves through the world makes this a ton of fun to watch. 10/10 on that front. But the acting and dialogue is average and unnotable. The moments clearly meant to be emotional barely affected me, despite that I was very engaged in the action. Look, it's not that I expect award-winning dialogue from such long shots, but if the cinematography of this movie was just average, this movie would be a 5/10 to me."
1917,24 February 2020,9/10,"Caught 1917 last week, hard movie to watch but really worth it"

1917,2 March 2020,6/10,"What is your reason for showing the Germans wild?
They are very good guys. Please make the movie logical"
1917,29 February 2020,10/10,1917 is a great movie in which you feel involved from the beginning to the end. Great actors work as well. A movie which you can see a number of times.
1917,8 March 2020,10/10,"1917 is the only feature film that made me thrill from beginning to end interruption and made a knot in my stromach for one hour and fifty. I Was enthrealled from the very minute and never got out of the plot, which ends as it began, drawing a beautiful loop. During the mission I Had the feeling that it wasme who was corrying it out. The cameraman's close-ups are impressive during the film. In ""1917"", everything is mastered is such abrilliant was that it is difficult to get out of the film. But what really amazed me was the supporting roles, who are not only there to say 2 or 3 lines. 1917 lasts one hour and fifty minutes sharp and yes thatis important. Becuase the action is supposed to we taking place live time, which allows a total incursion into the plot. I felt like I was on earch adventure with the gun in my hand and not the soldiers'
1917 images take your beath away. I am thinking in particular of a maghnificent sequence which takes place in Ecoust a burning town. The red and black colors on screen while men kill each other: it's as sublime as it is violent.
1917 is therefore masterpiece with beautifull intentions to create surprise."
1917,3 March 2020,8/10,"With director Sam Mendes inspired by his own grandfather, this deeply personal story had fantastic potential to be the next Great War epic.
The writing and filming techniques are very ambitious; they clearly make you feel like you are there, seeing the scenes through the characters eyes. While the cinematographic aspects of this are interesting, it sometimes feels like they focus on this too much, which meant the character development is somewhat weak. We never really get to know the main characters well, making it difficult to be invested in their ultimate fate. It is likely this was an intentional move from Mendes to illustrate the famous British 'stiff upper lip', but it is a little clumsy in its execution. It is important to mention the ending; this film absolutely has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, and while it should have been a satisfying ending, with the characters succeeding in their mission, it leaves you feeling slightly defeated. The way the film illustrates the terrible waste of life, taking you right to the heart of the trenches and ultimately knowing that despite this short respite, nearly 10 million military personal died during WW1 really hits home."
1917,3 March 2020,8/10,"Sam Mendez directed this visually extravagant drama about two young British soldiers on a perilous mission in World War 1. The idea behind the camerawork is meant to be to bring viewers close to the action, which is unique and amazing; this adds a bonus to the film: we feel more included, just as if we were with the soldiers in the trenches, a very realistic seeking type of filming. « 1917 » is certainly a technical marvel, with its brilliant sound work, visual effects, and Lee Smith's editing. The least I can say is that Sam Mendes nailed it. But, the only critique I can say is that we never really know the main characters well, making it difficult to be invested in their ultimate fate and I was waiting for a happy ending which I didn't get. Nevertheless this movie stands as a feat one, making it top 5 on my favorite movies this last year. Great job Sam Mendes, war has never been captured so incredibly."
1917,3 March 2020,7/10,"Firstly, I want to say that I went to the cinema for an English lesson, so I wasn't that hyped but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. Ranked first come action scenes that are really impressive, hook the spectator immediately and are actually stressful. Then, the OST was really goof and perfect. Another great achievement, the set : I think about the burning city where Schofield got chased in particular. Finally, the shooting method that makes it look like an entire sequence shot and the actors' gmae which is not the best but really satisfying make it a great movie.
Now, let's talk about negative aspect. This film didn't make me feel sad, happy or whatever (except a bit stressed), we can't deny a lack of emotion, it is not emotionless but almost (due to a lack of character development : we don't know them much nor how close they are,...). Then a major negative point is that we don't fell war horror and futility, something essential in a war film ; they don't insist on all the soldiers that died for nothing, and that mixed with a happy-ending makes it look like war was easy or nothing.
Overall, this film is great for an action film but takes away the dramatic aspect of war, which is a really important in that type of film ; great entertainment but not the film of the year."

They must cross a no man's land.however it was hopeless to do that.But this is a film and they go send a message to english troops where blakés brother was a soldier (one of the two heroes).this trip is very stressful ,the two guys are often in danger ans (spoiler) even blake dies while trying to help a soldier.i recommend this film but it was some flaws like they mange to get out of a very delicate situation like in a video game and ,in deed this is why i don't rate the film 10/10 .despite that, the film is nice for some childs/teenager ans people."
1917,4 March 2020,10/10,"""1917"" is a poignant film which tells a story inspired by real facts during the First World War. That makes the film more real and more sensational. I was impressed by the way that the main actors play. It was like we were in the film, we were with the characters and we could feel their feelings, their stress. I appreciated the film very much. I want to thank Sam Mendes for directing and writing the script. It gave us the impression that the film was shot in one shot thanks to the sequence plan. It totally immersed us in the atmosphere of the First World War.
Furthermore, the landscape of death and desolation puts forward the butchery of the war. I like the goal of the film. The issue of saving lives is more important than the main characters, hence the title of the film ""1917"".That highlights the impressive number of soldiers who fought in the war.
I think everyone should see the film. It reinforces our knowledge about the war. We are completely in the action, we want the mission to be accomplished.
This a great film! Take time for yourself and go watch the amazing film and enjoy !"
1917,4 March 2020,8/10,"I discovered ""1917"" with my class on a cinema close to my shcool. Or should I say ""I experienced 1917"". This film is a technical revolution for the cinema. The way it was filmed is a way for the audience to be completely immersed in the story. It looks like there was one single shot from beginning to end, and that made me feel every breath, every emotion of the characters. I think I was as stressed as them when they had to cross a silent and horrible no man's land. The setting is also kind of impressive, and it gave me a feeling of realism, especially the trenches. However, I was a bit disappointed by the story. I found the plot too simple and unconvicing. Two soldiers on their way to deliver a message in the middle of World War I, trying not to be killed... Cinematography disappointed me. What's more, to me, the reality of World War I is not well represented. Except trenches, I had the very impression of being on a video game, and for me it breaks the connection with the characters and the reality of war. ""1917"" has to be seen by adventure movie lovers, for the technical aspect and for good actors. But in terms of plot and characters, I have seen much better."
1917,4 March 2020,6/10,"Last Wednesday,I went to see 1917, a film by Sam Mendes released in France on January 15, 2020. This film was imposed on me by my English teacher. I gave this film a note 5.5/10 because I didn't find the film 100 per cent realistic for a film about War. Indeed, the story is trivial, it is not very original. For example, when the main character is shot (after meeting with the Germen pilot), the sets seem to be taken from a video game (I don't understand that). And when he falls in the waterfall, it seems impossible for a man to survive a fall like that. And secondly, I don't think in France there are waterfall as rough as we can see in the film. Despite those details, the film is adapte to the to pic, it shows us the real living conditiond of English soldiers at that time like in the trenches The shots filmed by cameramen are interesting and well staged. Moreover throughout the film, the scenery is wonderful. I'm glad I saw the film because I wouldn't have been by myself. It was a good experience."
1917,4 March 2020,9/10,"1917 is clearly a riveting film with a captivating timeline. The story is simple, 2 young men have 8 hours to get from one part of the front to another, but the way it is staged is completely mesmerizing. Personally, I got caught up in a succession of actions and the fact that the movie is filmed as one shot reinforces this feeling of immersion in the conflict and this constant anxiety about the clock ticking down. On top of that, the scenery is incredible : trenches and cratered no man's land contrast with endless green plains, and the atrocity of the war showed in some quite hard scenes is intertwined with the bonds of brotherhood and friendship between the two heroes, which is the guideline of the story.
However, some unrealistic scenes really bothered me. For example, the passage where the hero runs in a maze escaping bullets looked too much like a videogame scene. The nightmarish atmosphere that the light effects had created broke the realism that had been created so far, and this feeling of immersion disappeared. Of course, it came back pretty soon but that scene disappointed me, just as other unconvincing details did, like the huge waterfall in the North of France, or the hero's last run in the middle of the battlefield, surrounded by explosions.
Don't make me say what I didn't say, this movie is still a masterpiece which is worth seeing !"
1917,4 March 2020,9/10,"3 February 2020, by s.salem
First of all, the film was interesting and a good experience for me. But this film has both flaws and qualities. I liked the sequence shots, with the video game effect. The viewer is immedialely anxious, and immersed in the story. This film depicts the terrible conditions of the war, and emotion.Personally, the main character is a hero because he never gave up, even in difficult times, for example when his friends dies. We can be inspired by his determination. On the other hand, I did'nt like the rhythm of the film. Moreover, the end of the film is not surprising because we know that the main character will succeed in his mission, this is the definition of a hero. Furthermore, we don't learn much historically either. But, the sets, the landscapes are really interesting and well-mastered. I really liked the act of solidarity, when the hero gives the milk to a baby. This film is a good film though, and quite overwhelming. So, I RECOMMEND THIS FILM !"
1917,5 March 2020,8/10,"Don't be naive, these adventures and the main characters role are not the most original we've seen in a film about war. There are two heroes who are given a mission, and have to save 1,600 soldiers of a company, before they fall in a bloody trap. The true success of this film, and what gets it to the top is the outstanding cinematographic demonstration that happens and that takes our breath away. In a continous flow, without cutting, as if we were there, we track the two heroes in their adventure, crossing-over a wide range of sceneries, all around France. We are totally immersed in the 1917 trench warfare and its worst horrors. Throughout this story, we perceive the main characters' emotions and acts of humanity they do , but we immediately go back to the hard and sad reality of World War 1. The incredible shots of this film sometimes make it look like we are in a video game but that doesn't tarnish the experience, quite the opposite, it increases the public's emotions and interest. So, 2 stars less because of the banality of the story but what we keep in mind is the phenomenal cinematographic demonstration."
1917,5 March 2020,8/10,"We went to the cinema with our English teacher to work on our notion : ""Myths and heroes"". Nowadays the First World War is far away, while a lot of people died for us, they are the real heroes.First of all ""1917"" is technically impressive, the landscape is just awesome, we saw real work on it. Moreover Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are wonderful; they are like real soldiers and immersed themself in their character and make us travel.
In my opinion they will receive a lot of prizes !Secondly the story is poignant, we feel a lot of sadness and even pain for Blake when he died , the other side of the coin is that we saw a lot of blood (that was a bit disgusting).
In fact we become soldiers, real soldiers !Nevertheless something disturbed me a lot, why didn't they take place in a plane ?
We saw several allied planes during the film, even by detouring, the message could gave been transmitted faster.Anyway the film is beautiful even if we saw the worst humain thing : war.Last things last, at the end, credits show us ""thanks to H.Mendes"" probably the grand father of Samuel Mandes, director of the film. In fact this story is real (or at least some part) and that enhances the beauty of the film.
You should try to see it !!"
1917,20 March 2020,10/10,"Great movie, locations, emotions, and perfectly present."
1917,16 March 2020,7/10,"All i can say about the movie can be said in the title
It was nice to see it go with the one shot gimmick but 15 minutes in it's frustrating all felt was ""GOOD JOB BOYS BUT CAN I GET SOME MOVIE""
Cuts were always obvious
Obvious enough for a 16 year old kid to spot them (me)
But wasn't the best survival story , wasn't the best war movie and wasn't the best...movie
Had strong points and weak ones
But it was alright 7/10 is good enough for it"
1917,19 March 2020,9/10,What a wonderful movie. It is a art of cinema.Despite too simple story Mendes has been did great job.
1917,3 May 2020,9/10,This is honestly one of the best movies 2019. The way its produced is just amazing.
1917,27 April 2020,10/10,"As I casually sit here with a smug look on my face sipping a pint of ale and smoking a pipe of tobacco with my lovely top hat on whilst knowing that people are getting more British and therefore more civilised as a result of watching this film, well it really does make me so overjoyed. I feel the British colonies were treated with great respect and looked after very much just like little immature children just like they were of course in real life which is not only historically accurate but it's giving more awareness to just how brilliant the lovely British Empire was in the good old days, before the dark times, before globalism.The action scenes were top notch as were the special effects and the British men in this film set a great noble standard of behaviour for all British men to hope to follow and achieve. I urge all Britons to think about what the best times for their country were and if you're not sure, read a few British history books and then come to the conclusion that the early 20th Century was the best time for Britain and it's people and do your best to restore the glory of Britain and the empire, thanks very much for your patience and good luck old bean's."
1917,9 March 2020,10/10,"1917 is going to be one of the best movies of the decade, even if it had just started. The movie is brillant on so many different levels: cinematography is extraordinary. The idea of making the film as if it was one single shot is brillant. Thank you Roger Deakins ! The cast is more than weel-chosen since the two lead actors are truly talented ans their emotions are not faked. I had goosebumps while whatching at most of the scenes. It exactly embodies the emotions of the war: brotherhood, courage, fear and anger and it takes you in the reality of war. The fighting scenes are as breathtaking as they are atrocious, it almost gives you the urge to jump out of your seat to run through the battle field and help those poor soldiers. Actually, I did not really want to see the movie. I was afraid it was just going to be another war movie with a soldier sacrificing himself, a fight and a happy end. But I am glad I went to see this movie during my English class. This movie is so much more than just a war movie and SPOILERS ALERT even if there is a happy end, we can see and understand that after all, this is not a victory, it is just a ma, who fulfills a mission and who has to go back to the battlefields. 1917 is a must see movie and I promise you, you won't be disappoited."
1917,10 March 2020,9/10,"Funny how many people here talk about plot holes and how the story is unbelievable. Millions died in this war, you don't think some of them actually went through situations you would now depict as being ""unbelievable""?This movie is about the general feeling it summons upon anyone who watches it. I have never in my life felt so emotional during a movie as at the moment he arrives at his destination (wayfaring stranger moment). I have never in my life felt the silence and deep emotion in the cinema as at that time.That is what gives this movie it's well deserved high rating."
1917,10 March 2020,10/10,"Wow, just wow, amazing, stunning, thrilling.... just wow ...: the sound and the music, just wow"
1917,10 March 2020,2/10,"To those who have ever been to the battlefields of 1917 this movie is both a joke. and an insult. What posessed the Academy to award this movie an Oscar, apart from the camerawork?
Big names appearing for a five minute part. Probably because as Michael Caine would say: ""it pays the mortgage"".
A maudlin story and a trite rendition of WW1 trench warfare. For those who rate this tripe as ""one of the best WW1 movie I've seen"" I can only assume this is the only WW1 movie they have ever seen. There are at least three far better movies, to name: ""Paths of Glory"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""The Battle of Passchendaele"". Or, for that matter ""Regeneration"" (a.k.a ""Behind the Lines"").
THE thing that spoiled the whole movie? Have you seen the battlefields in 1917? Visit Zonnebeke or Ypres museums. Not a sprig of green, not a tree with leaves and branches. And from the coast of Belgium to the Swiss border, not a waterfall to be seen along the frontline.
It makes the whole movie more unbelievable than a story even the creators of ""Blackadder Goes Forth"" dared to conceive."
1917,11 March 2020,9/10,"A good movie, with good filming.
I can't forget it."
1917,13 March 2020,8/10,"It is a good good movie,i saw it three times.
The 'one continuous shot' method works very well thru the trenches but is probably not necessary elsewhere, apart from a few chase scenes."
1917,13 March 2020,6/10,"For everyone like me who, in 1998, was amazed by the master piece Private Ryan, this movie is nothing new under the sun.If Spielberg would have not released Private Ryan over 20 years ago, I would have at least recognised that 1917 has amazing pictures and sound effects. Although they still are, they bring back immediately in mind the style we all have seen, in much bigger scale, in the Spielberg movie.The whole story is clearly """"inspired"""" by Private Ryan (a low rank sent on a special mission during the unfolding of a wider war event), without any offense...to Spielperg! The 1917 plot could not prove being interesting nor credible (in Private Ryan a squad of 8 soldier is sent to find and bring back only 1 soldier, last living brother of three, to his family; in 1917 only 2 young soldiers are sent to deliver a message to save 1600 souls...really?).Acting is not the best we have ever seen...some character (specially the more famous ones) look so theatrical.Personally not the best Mendes movie."
1917,13 March 2020,10/10,"One of the best movie i have seen off late,,, gud acting by all the charecters.. specially the one who will go till the end to carry the msg of stopping attacks,,,
mind blowing performance of all the actors"
1917,14 March 2020,1/10,"Spoiler alert but maybe I can save you some time you will never get back. My girlfriend and I really wanted to like this movie and were excited because of the great reviews. For starters, it drastically under represents the vastness of WW1 when the characters keep arriving at their destinations so quickly. Our eventual main character gets a bad cut holding barbed wire at the barb... really? Ok... things happen I guess. A rat almost kills them...sure, why not? Save a German from a horrific flaming death, then leave him unguarded and unrestrained? Doesn't seem logical during war but at least we are minus 1 character I didn't care at all about. A company of soldiers just appears in the no man's land that they have been fighting for every inch up to... hmmm, ok. The guy (name?) is onto a truck then travels about a mile to the burned out city (maybe 2 miles total travel at this point). He miraculously kills a sniper, then when a German in plain sight and in open ground fires at him, a trained combat soldier in a war zone, he runs away. Our courageous combatant, seeking a hiding spot, meets a girl and baby and he suddenly has loads of food that he didn't have before and milk he fortuitously filled his canteen with, never mind that there's no way to give it to the baby or that it wouldn't last but a feeding or 2... the baby is saved. Back out to the city where he happens upon upon a young German soldier and puts his hand over his mouth... gee, that didn't work so he somehow strangles him then heroically drops his weapon and runs away from another German who's so drunk he can barely stand up. Our weaponless warrior then bravely runs through enemy fire where he jumps into river rapids and ""escapes"". I'm about ready to leave the theater but Iv'e invested time, I'm trying to see it through. A couple hundred yards or so and he finds the troop he was looking for listening to some guy sing a boring song that we are forced to sit through as well... yawn, falling asleep. Some other stuff happens, not paying much attention at this point. Another hundred yards maybe and he arrives at the front lines where he is to stop the battle. He makes it to a commander as the troops are leaving the trenches to get slaughtered and the commander, like a true badass who commands young men during wartime, is crying like a baby. That's it, I throw up my arms and leave the theater to wait for my girlfriend outside. She said I didn't miss anything. I should have walked out early like I did when Forest started running in that other academy award winning piece of garbage. On a positive note, I thought the costumes were great and I hope they won the academy award for it but the academy awards are irrelevant now anyway, since they just pander to the wokest offal; so actually... whatever."
1917,14 March 2020,4/10,Very disappointed. As an interest in WW1 I looked forward to this movie. It was way too clean and cliche. Not what I was hoping for.
1917,17 March 2020,8/10,"Although it is a war manifesto, motion recording and editing are superb. Definitely, it blows your mind."
1917,21 March 2020,10/10,"This movie takes drama, suspense, beautiful visuals and an amazing soundtrack and puts it all into one movie. I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters, and I've been dying to see it again. The director of the movie is purely brilliant, I'm pretty sure there is only one cut in the entire movie, it looks like one take the entire way through. I absolutely loved the movie, it gave me goosebumps multiple times, it really captures the immersive experience of war. I highly recommend this movie!"
1917,22 March 2020,10/10,Great Movie. Highly recommended. Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout its runtime.
1917,24 March 2020,10/10,"Story - 10
Cinematography - 10
Sound - 9
Acting - 10"
1917,26 March 2020,1/10,"Let me get this straight: A WW1 movie with no tanks, no machine guns, no grenades, no battlefield armies fighting. Got it...I've seen more killing in Hogans Heroes . The ending is lame and unimaginative. The characters are under developed. I've seen better chemistry putting alka seltzer in a car battery. ZERO star power. I was hoping for John Wayne. I got John Denver. I read the other reviews and I totally disagree with their praise. Period."
1917,31 March 2020,9/10,The angles are truly amazing. Kinda overly nice during war though.
1917,27 March 2020,10/10,"This was a fantastic movie. Graphics were unbelievable and the story was really well told. There was action, suspense, drama everything you could want in a movie!"
1917,29 March 2020,10/10,"Between the actors, music score, filmography, and effects, movie is truly a masterpiece! The fact that it was shot in just one take is unbelievable! There are only two noticeable parts where there was probably a cut. The musical score was phenomenal through and through. All in all, it was a truly incredible experience. The place were I thought the movie fell short was in the CGI rats. Regardless, 1917 is a modern cinematic masterpiece!"
1917,29 July 2020,9/10,Best war film since Hacksaw ridge! Really enjoyed it
1917,1 April 2020,2/10,"1st time commenting. This movie caught my attention from people saying it was like Saving Rrivate Ryan. SRR has more action in the intro than 1917*10, super let down. Yea the camera work is cool but it's also boring man geez. If you want to see a war movie don't watch this. First 15 min are 2 dudes walking thru a trench for 15 min. They leave and guess what there's more walking. Straight up boring. Won't watch this movie again even if it's on TBS"
1917,1 April 2020,10/10,"I watched this on a Monday night after completing my online school that I had to do due to the COVID-19 infections. I was bored, and in the need of something to do so my mom put on this film - stating that it was my 'history lesson' for the night. It was totally, 100% worth it.
This movie from start to finish was an absolute masterpiece. The one shot style really does it all to draw you in, and it felt like I was there about 15 minutes into the movie. I caught myself in the edge of my seat, feeling pure terror for our main characters. The realism from this movie made it feel like I was there - and I had to remind myself multiple times that this was indeed, just a movie.
Of course - this film is not for everyone, but those who said that it was 'not action packed' and 'boring' really do not understand the point that this film is supposed to be as realistic as they could make it (so if you are a veteran or someone who has PTSD I would recommend reconsidering watching). Soldiers on the field didn't constantly have things to do or people going after them all the time, and there were multiple moments where soldiers needed to fill said time - hence the people at home sending them photos and other items. This movie uses this, giving us multiple scenes where our two main characters are just talking as they walk across the field - reminiscing on old times at home, distant memories of their family, et cetera.
The one shot style, again, was a masterpiece. The editing that went behind this movie was pure genius and the set designs were spectacular. I keep watching behind the scenes footage of this movie and going 'Wait! Really?! That's how they did that?' and I adore the amount of time this film really took. This film is almost two hours long, but the amount of time this production took to make shows how amazingly dedicated the actors and crew are.
That being said, if you are into realism, traumatic movie experiences, drama, action, and crying at the end of a movie...this is absolutely for you."
1917,1 April 2020,4/10,"It started as a realistic-looking movie, getting me into that mindset. Then a lot of things felt wrong and arcade-ish than realistic. Some gunfire & chase scenes look like cheap army themed TV series. If you want an aesthetic, pop kind of movie go ahead but don't expect a realistic WW1 movie. I don't believe it deserves 8,4 points it has at the moment that this comment was written."
1917,3 April 2020,10/10,"A masterpiece! Amazing soundtrack, perfect! The fact that it was a one-shot makes it more interactive and captivating."
1917,5 April 2020,10/10,"I have to admit coming into this movie I did not expect much, but after watching this amazing film I believe it may have been by far the best film of 2019. Sorry Marvel Fans"
1917,8 April 2020,5/10,"2 guys are sent on foot 9 miles across cratered, muddy booby trapped enemy territory to save 1600 lives by delivering orders to cancel an attack because phone lines are cut. Lol. Really? That important and they send two chucklehead corporals on foot. What about additional messengers? How about a horse? Even better what about a message airdrop from the slow and low flying British biplanes that are clearly cruising over the countryside? 1600 lives would definitely deserve a better comminication effort. not in this movie. thatll do.Right out of the gate the entire premise is idiotic and a work of complete fiction. As the movie progresses it gets even dumber. they carry their standard issue six foot rifles with bayonets through tight trenches on their most important black ops mission. no smgs or additional grenades or smoke. even a revolver or shotgun would be more effective in a trench. They rescue a downed German pilot but dont take his knife. Guess what you got stabbed. their truck gets stuck in the mud but lets all get out and push instead of trying to rock it or tow it out using the other truck 10 feet ahead. the german sniper misses 3 times on a clear shot in the open crossing the river lol. but hey that sniper got what he deserved didnt he! so many other omg moments like germans hip firing and missing when they clearly got the jump and time on target to aim. this entire movie looks and sounds great but it is lipstick on a pig. almost not worth watching but it is great set design. i cant believe it is oscar nominated. not even close."
1917,9 April 2020,9/10,"This remarkable achievement in film, completely blows ""Dunkirk"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" out of the water! Taking the continuing camera flow, all in one shot to the next level, really makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action as it takes place, all alongside the young infantryman Lance Corp. Shoefield. Even the story, and characters are grounded in a tour de force quality in order to show off the horrors and stress on how terrifying the First World War really was! 1917 has marked itself up there with such flawless war movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", and will stand the test of time. 9/10"
1917,11 April 2020,8/10,I don't watch the film yet and I'm not a english I am doing this for support sjjsjsj
1917,12 April 2020,6/10,"I went into this movie knowing not much about it other than it's extreme hype. Many people told me how much they loved it and I thought the trailer looked amazing. The cinematography did not disappoint but the story did. The characters seemed shallow and hard to connect with. The death scene seemed unemotional and the last conversation didn't do their relationship justice- which we actually have no clue how close they actually were. The film also lost steam as everything just seemed to work out for the main character. The convoy, the horrible aim of Germans, the river, the 2nd being 50 feet from where he got out of the river, and more. The cinematography was beautiful but that is not enough to carry this film to the top ranks in my opinion."
1917,13 April 2020,2/10,"This movie was so incredibly boring for a war movie, it was almost as unbelievable as the events in this movie. At the time of this review, this movie was rated 8.4, whereas Saving Private Ryan, the pinnacle of war movies, is rated 8.6. This doesn't even come close to measuring up to that movie. I won't bore you with the details, as you can read other reviews. Steer clear of this one."
1917,14 April 2020,9/10,"1917 is the latest movie from critically acclaimed director Sam Mendes. As the name suggests, the movie is set in 1917 amidst the chaos of World War 1. The movie has made all the right noises in the awards season, bagging the Best Movie Award and the Best Director Award in Golden Globes and numerous Oscar nominations. The movie is presented to the audience in an apparently unbroken shot.
The story follows two young corporals, Blake(played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofeld(played by George MacKay) on their mission to head on foot to reach Blake's brother's company to warn them before they walk into a German trap. The radio lines have been cut by the retreating Germans. Thus begins their journey around the socalled no man's land in Northern France separating British and German troops. In spite of initial assurances that their passage will be safe, their path is laden with danger lurking in every corner and views reminiscent of the phrase ""Hell on Earth"". But, Blake accompanied by exhausted and wise Schofeld stop at nothing in order to save the lives of 1600 soldiers. The movie pulls off an undeniably impressive technical feat. Roger Deakins is one of the all-time great cinematographers and his work here on what must have been an insane and intensely challenging shoot is impressive. Deakins already has a welldeserved Oscar right next to his name for the movie Blade Runner 2049. Mendes has utilized his work well and puts his technical skills on display in almost every shot. The single shot technique is not a new idea but it still enthralls the audience and can pull a flock of movie watchers to the movie theatre. It is quite evident that Mendes wants the audience to notice this feat and drop them right in the middle of the action. The film does not devote much time to build up and throws the characters into a tense atmosphere from the very beginning.
The movie strives to provide a visceral depiction of the horrors of war and stages and executes tense scenes(such as one set in a maze of buildings) to perfection. The movie elicits gasps and awe from the audience throughout its running time of two hours which pass by pretty quickly. The camera moves through dark spots to obscure the transitions. But, it is staggering to imagine the scale at which this movie was made. This apparent single-shot nature endows the movie with its immersive nature and makes the audience feel as if they are on the battle field witnessing the perils and sacrifices of the two soldiers. This gives an authentic and tangible feel to the movie, not to mention its heart-pumping action sequences. The set design looks perfectly accurate and not a single item looks out of place. The background music is in sync with the feel of the movie and contributes to the uneasiness of the audience. The acting of the actors is also on point and do whatever is required of their characters without doing anything unnecessary. George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both very good, and their fresh acts make the audience root and care for them. The movie also has some famous faces with guest appearances from some of the best known actors of the British movie industry. The movie has drawn unfair comparisons to Nolan's thriller ""Dunkirk"" and other war movies. However, Nolan's movie was built as a thriller and is more about the peril a group of soldiers find themselves in and hence did away with the scope of character development. This movie could do more regarding the scope of character development. The movie also pulls back punches when it comes to showing violence and ugliness of the war, unlike ""Dunkirk"". Nolan pulled back no punches beginning the movie with scenes where the protagonist tries and fails to relieve himself several times. Undoubtedly, the movie thrives through its technical brilliance and immersive nature. The movie is made to emphasize its technical brilliance and captivate the audience with that. However, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of this year(it released in 2020 in India) till now.
The movie shines not only because of its technical brilliance, but also because of its ability to give an immersive experience to its audience and enthrall them with its heart-pumping sequences."
1917,18 April 2020,6/10,"Falling in the water could be more realistic. The smoke from the shelling is gray, while the ground is grazed. The brown color would be appropriate to describe the fall of the grenades!."
1917,16 April 2020,10/10,"Cool, this masterpiece deserve many awards, the way it goes is beautiful, the atmosphere, auras, could done better at last scene, the plot twist is amazing tho i thought blake was the main character lmao, beautiful & powerful horror graphics at germans front line and flare scene. Gotta love this movie and the actors, mainly benedict as mackenzie lol."
1917,18 April 2020,10/10,"Wowowowoow that was sooo good. It really made me think. Seeing how they made it was even more inspiring. I really felt immersed and i wished there had been more to watch. The music and the acting and the camerawork is just phenomenal I cant even describe. You could really feel the emotion of the characters and i was torn up at how horrible it was. Im some ways i wished it had been more grotesque but it also was a really good eye opening amount for the amount of time they had, and they did a really good job with that. The pacing was really good too. It didnt feel too slow or too fast and i really felt like i was there. It made me start thinking about living life like that for years and years on end. Horrific. Just watching was intense, so i couldn't even imagine living in that fear for years. Just wow"
1917,20 April 2020,5/10,"Fascinating endeavor, hollow in execution. Recall all those meaningful, character building and surprising twists of Saving Private Ryan? None of those exist in this film. While it presents a different era, I was underwhelmed by this shallow presentation and wish the team well on their next endeavors."
1917,22 April 2020,7/10,It is an interesting story and nice one shot movie. I personally like the scenes but I was waiting more action and more guns shooting because it is a war movie. That is the reason I rate this movie with the score of 7.
1917,23 April 2020,4/10,"Combat vet here. Just finished watching 1917...while I know this movie was markedly polarized regarding overall cinematic reviews, I think I know why. The artistic part of me that I don't often show can appreciate that seemingly never ending scenes throughout the movie...it's as if the entire 2 hour film was directed without a single cut. That said, the other side of me understands that this alone cannot stand on the podium of excellence by itself. The acting was at most average, the storyline and plot itself a bit dullish, and for a two hour cinematic piece was contrary to a speeding car chase. I feel that for a war that was to end all wars, it has been all but left out of the Hollywood spotlight, so this could have been a major success, but unfortunately for me it fell flat on its face. More more quarantine reviews follow me at Matt Caple. Lol."
1917,26 April 2020,2/10,"I'd heard such amazing reviews about this movie and I'd wanted to watch it in the cinema for a while but I just didn't get the chance,I watched it at home instead. In my opinion George's Mccay should of swapped roles with Richard madden as he seemed to come across as more of a hero and brave.The story was that Corporal Schofield and his friend had to deliver a message to 1,600 other corporals including Schofield friends' brother yet his friend died on the way because they saved a enemy so he couldn't even see his brother😂.It gets worse because Schofield doesn't even deliver the message on time because he's too busy complaining and moaning even though he's not been injured once...So basically most of the men died because he didn't deliver the message and when he was running to find about 3 different people to pass on the message he tripped a few corporals over and they died.Honestly if you want a good war film watch Hacksaw Ridge. If I was to direct and write this film I would of started the film from when he is running to tell them to stop the war and then carried on the story with someone else who actually did save other people and was a hero."
1917,27 April 2020,10/10,"This was simply one of the finest movies of 2019. Its brilliant film-making would make you believe that it has been shot in a single take which is a technological feat and makes the events look shockingly real. Though it is classified as a War drama, its edge of the seat action and adventure would keep you guessing and even some of the scenes would move you to the core. Its a must watch for all movie fans out there."
1917,6 July 2020,4/10,No doubt the movie has very good cinematography but apart from that this movie has nothing no acting no sense. just a man walking in a 2 hours movie and when he stops movie ends.
1917,24 May 2020,10/10,"Please ignore the stupid ""rip off Saving Private Ryan"" comments. This film is not that at all and isnt Hollywood in its glitz and glamour. It's real British storytelling that is captivating from the start. The cinematography is utter astounding and you feel it throughout. The actors are real, no need for over selling the script, they are natural and takes on the story properly without having to add in jokes or plot twists to grip us. Perfect WWI film and I rate it higher than most other war films. Fantastic work and a must watch"
1917,30 April 2020,9/10,"This movie clearly shows the importance of communication backthen. No wonder how one simple information could change the course of millions of soldiers.
The set goes back to the first World War where two British soldiers were ordered to deliver a message calling off an attack doomed to fail soon after the German retreat to the Hinderburg line during Operation Alberich, which was operated in 1917 and thus the title is justified.
The movie is portrayed in a way that it would resemble a one shot movie, that is the whole movie is shot using one camera comprising ongoing scenes as the two soldiers move. This revolutionary idea not only created breathtaking thrill but also portrayed how vulnerable the life of a soldier is.
Overall a great movie to sit back with family and watch."
1917,8 May 2020,5/10,"Quite a slow movie that is quite unbelievable, lots of very basic mistakes throughout movie.
Story line is quite weak and underdeveloped, they do at least set the boys to task quite quickly but with very little intrigue/character development.
Compared to movies like saving Private Ryan this movie is basically like a high school project"
1917,10 May 2020,8/10,"The movie tells us about how every second was important in war,1917, the most recent film by acclaimed director Sam Mendes (Skyfall, American Beauty), is a phenomenon to say the least. With a magnificent combination of excellent editing, superb acting and an outstanding score from Thomas Newman, 1917 is a rare example of absolute cinematic perfection.Sam Mendes created this story base on his grandfathers tale happened in WW-1."
1917,9 June 2020,9/10,"Wow. I often struggle to keep my mouth shut during movies, even in the theatre. 1917 was an exception."
1917,12 May 2020,7/10,From the field full of little yellow flowers to slowly sit down and finally breathe a sigh of relief in the prairie cattle gradually smaller house.Forever there friend helipiao Cherry Blossoms night fire abandoned town only from the sound of gunfire and silhouette feel the enemy.Even the crows on the carcass are the first to feel such a poetic description of the delicate and magnificent.
1917,19 May 2020,10/10,"I usually don't write reviews but I simply had to with this one. If you haven't seen it, please don't miss out. It's one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. It's brilliant and a piece of art! Really great acting and the screen work and directing is amazing. To film the movie in one shot, I couldn't sit still. So trilling, raw, heartfelt and enticing. Deserve every Oscar they get!"
1917,19 May 2020,8/10,"I am not a huge historical movie fan, but I do enjoy action scenes and a good story line. And that's what I got from 1917, the story line was very very good and the action scenes were pretty good as well. The only critiquing I have is that during the preview for the movie they displayed many action scenes but overall they were not as many as I was hoping for. The director did a great job at creating that feel of the 1900s and it complimented the movie very well/. Overall, this was a very good movie just some little minor changes."
1917,20 May 2020,10/10,"1917 is a prime example of a well-produced and accurate historical film that gives the audience a real glimpse into the perspective of a solider(s) in World War I ! This entire film, in my opinion, has very purposeful elements throughout it. First off, the feel of the single-shot videography was great! The editing was top notch and I even had to question myself whether or not there were cuts in the photography or no at times, fantastic! Second, this movie had a great intentionality to it! The violence and actions were purposeful and weren't for the sake of themselves, but rather an accurate presentation of the sequences and events that occurred. You can really see the director's intention in the film clearly. The context and the presentation were executed very effectively, but be aware of its violence. The audience should be over 18 to be able to fully grasp the historical understanding of the film which is so impactful. Viewing in this lens, the film does an awesome job inspiring the audience through its main character Lance Schofield in his very heroic deeds throughout the film. His unconditional actions are absolutely rooted in fundamental truth, and his respect for people with his respectful attribution to his lost friend and soldier Lance Blake is beautiful and also inspiring. I personally was very inspired after the film and gained a much bigger appreciation for anyone who serves in the military, especially my godfather who served for many years in the marines. Overall, 1917 was a fantastic film which inspired me in a very positive way, and I know it will be doing the same for many others. I will be watching this film again very soon!"
1917,23 May 2020,1/10,"This is possibly one of the worst films I have seen, a serous subject made almost comical. Let me see I fall in a river, don't bother swimming to the bank, yep very believable. I then get to my destination to deliver letter that did not get wet in my top pocket, my photos stayed dry too. O and on the way . I bumped into a girl and child, just to tick that movie box. Also turned up to the frontline sing along ( movie must have tick) and no one bothered to getup and chalange me"
1917,5 December 2020,5/10,Looked forward to watching this but got really disappointed because the story seems to be made up of a million coincidences strung together.Too unbelievable and a lot of the acting felt acted
1917,28 May 2020,9/10,The hole movie was good but the ending is weird (spoiler alert) the ending wasn't very good
1917,7 July 2020,10/10,"Actually, I don't like war movies, and 1917 is the first war movies that touch my heart deeply. Script, Scoring, Acting, Cinematography, Directing all of them are excellent!"
1917,9 June 2020,10/10,"A truly immersive, three-dimensional cinema experience. I implore all to watch this masterpiece, crafted by the illusion of being solely one shot."
1917,10 June 2020,10/10,It's the best movie ever made It's the best movie ever made It's the best movie ever madeIt's the best movie ever made
1917,13 June 2020,10/10,"This was amazing , I enjoyed it and seeing WW1 from this one Camara motion was amazing , this opens up a new type of film where we don't randomly cut away to see another part of the story , it was continuous and an amazing ideaRecommended watching it if you haven't"
1917,19 June 2020,6/10,"I found the film mediocre to say the least,a few scenes were so standout as scenery,appeared that no attempt had been made for realism,I found that some scenes didn't seem to make sense,when sniper was shooting at the lead,apparently the soldiers on the truck wouldn't assist even though they were only metres away,very 'arty farty' in my opinion."
1917,30 June 2020,10/10,"I have such a profound respect to productions that pull off long-take shots. My hat goes off to cinematographer Rodger Deakins. This film brings you deep in the trenches of humanity, capturing the emotion of two young boys adventuring through a brutal warfare to complete a rather small but lifesaving mission. Having the film look like a one-take, it makes you feel like you are in the journey itself and somewhat like a video game movie. It's definitely worth the watch!"
1917,4 July 2020,9/10,Very good movie good cam location very lively all around a good war maybe my favorite
1917,23 July 2020,10/10,The cinematography is completely over powered in this excellent telling. I'm a huge fan.
1917,25 July 2021,10/10,"This movie was in my watch list for a long time, and I didn't have the urge to see it. Then today I finally saw it, and thought to myself- why didn't I watch it earlier?The cinematography was soo great and the direction was great.great acting.I particularly liked the one scene where Schofield was in the stream holding onto the log and there were cherry flowers showering. He then gained strength to continue his mission as it reminded him of his partner Blake. It was a beautiful scene."
1917,2 August 2020,7/10,"Visuals and sound was great, definitely a deep movie. Feel like it could've showed a little more about what the trenchers were like for soldiers during the war.Will probably need another viewing."
1917,29 July 2020,10/10,1917 is a cinematic masterpiece. It is so visually impressive/beautiful from beginning to end. The storyline is so engaging and the action sequences are unparalleled. The 'one shot take' technique application makes you feel that you are right with the characters experiencing everything in real-time. It is an incredible watch.
1917,5 August 2020,9/10,"Pointless to explain more, this movie is really good. I'm not in to war movies, but the story in this one will have you focused throughout the entire movie."
1917,4 March 2021,10/10,"1917 is a cinematography masterpiece. Unlike many other adventure or war movies, this one actually makes you feel like you're tagging along with Schofield and Blake. You feel what the feel, fear what they fear, and hear what they hear. The story is not only told extremely well by the writing, the dialogue, and the acting; but I'd argue the camera tells much more of the story. With the feel that this movie is shot in one take, it makes the experience feel authentic as if you are there with them. This adds to the tension, anxiety, and desperation these characters are feeling as they work to carry out the mission their superior ordered them.I remember when this movie came out there was a lot of talk about the cinematography with extra focus on how the film appears to be shot in one take. You can appreciate that just hearing about this cinematic feat, but experiencing it is a whole other story. This movie is not another war movie. It is so much more than that. And for that reason, 1917 deserves a 10/10."
1917,7 September 2020,10/10,"Me and my friend hamada (Hard stuck D4) loved the movie. He dedicated his life ever since to watch every morning before doing anything. The famous Syrima, he was just like blake, an honored man who survived all of the D4 players and still going. Great movie 11/10 Alhamdullah"
1917,9 September 2020,10/10,"This film deserves the true respect for Cinematography and the Actors. To the enticed build from the beginning to end it keeps you on edge. A real thrill. ""1917"" emerges you and keeps you trapped in such of a devastating time period. The scenarios that the main character is put threw is a jaw dropping expierences. This movie will 100% be in my watch list Including my top 10 lists of films. 10/10 Reccomend."
1917,5 April 2021,10/10,Captivating story perfectly staged. Simple perfect.
1917,20 September 2020,10/10,"The film 1917 is a fantastic dark depiction of a near suicide mission to be completed by Lance Corporals (Lcpl) Blake and Schofield. Lcpl Blake is played by Dean-Charles Chapman, who does a fantastic job portraying a British soldier that emits innocence early on in the film. Lcpl Schofield, played by George MacKay, is a darker more experienced troop in the British war machine that has experienced more combat, and has a far less optimistic outlook on things than does his partner. The film revolves around Lcpls Blake and Schofield being given a mission to travel through no man's land, and deliver a vital message to the Devonshire line to prevent nearly 1,600 British troops from advancing into an ambush by the Germans. The Germans here had recently made a hasty retreat from their previously held line in favor of falling back to a more fortified position to bait the British forces into pursuing. One of the major reoccurring themes in the film is that of the horrors of warfare, and the toll that it takes in stripping the innocence from what are basically children.Throughout the film the camera angles used are incredibly important in giving a look into what is being experienced by the two Lcpls as they navigate through no man's land, and cross into previously held German territory. The way the camera seems to roll in a continuous shot revolving around the two Lcpls gives an incredible play by play display of the obstacles they are facing, as well as providing close ups on their faces giving insight into the human emotion involved. The camera is constantly rotating around the two as they trek through this new dangerous territory, keeping always on the alert. With this, you are able to see truly how horrific the battlefield was in WWI, with dead horses and soldiers strewn across the landscape between massive artillery craters and lines of barbed wire.Lighting in this film also plays a huge part in displaying truly how horrific war is. Back at the beginning of the film you first have Lcpls Blake and Schofield having a nap by a tree in a grassy field. It is sunny in this moment before they are awakened by their Sergeant to begin their mission. As they move out of their trench line and into no man's land, a sort of overcast covers the battlefield. It is certainly an ominous effect as they enter formerly German trenches. They are then plunged into a tunnel system in order to navigate through the lines, and the lighting is very minimal here. This effect makes you feel the terror that is experienced in a German tunnel system, especially so after they trigger a booby trap.Lighting and camera angles are utilized fantastically in this film to truly show how terrible the war is and Lcpls Blake and Schofield's personal reactions to it. Lcpl Blake is ultimately killed halfway through their mission when he is gutted with a knife by a downed German pilot. In this way, Lcpl Blake did not have the opportunity to become battle hardened by war like Lcpl Schofield, however this death certainly seems to take away whatever innocence that Lcpl Schofield had left.I personally give this movie a 10/10. Everything about the film was done in such a way that truly gives you an immersive experience. Watching the two young Lcpls as they take on this mission really hits home how horrible war is, and how it can just downright strip a young optimistic soldier of their innocence. The differences between Lcpl Blake and Lcpl Schofield at the beginning of the movie truly show the difference combat makes on one's spirit."
1917,23 September 2020,9/10,"First, that i want to say, that this film showed me the real WWI. Fascinating cast, amazing special effects. For me, the person who watched only famous films like avengers and other projects from marvel, this film brought something new.
What i can say about plot. so, it's not predictable, somewhere it's gripping. I think, that the main idea of this film, is show the life of a soldier in WWI. There is only 5 or 6 shots, it's not action film, where main character can kill all enemies after 100 hits, its real life, but only 1 bullet can kill you, and for this i like this film.
Finally, i want to watch this film again, and i will do this soon. Just watch this film and you will not regret."
1917,21 October 2020,2/10,"Really, really boring. It may be interesing for British as a memory film, but as a stand alone it just doesn't work."
1917,25 October 2020,9/10,"I've seen a few war movies in my days too saving private ryan, enemy at the gate, fury and even of course paul harbor who no one even talks about. Sorry Ben Affleck, but I have to say this movie is close with saving private ryan and other really good war movies.But I'll have to say that Sam Mendes is a f#$Cking genius. His vision of interuppting no man's land and the massacred that followed after was brilliant. The film's cinematography, sound effects and everything is so beautiful.You will feel like you're watching a continues clip with no cuts like it went through morning, evening and night.A masterpiece. I recommend to watch it. Oscar winning movie! :)"
1917,13 November 2020,1/10,"I had high hopes for this film, as the trailer looked very interesting. But after the 20 minutes of the movie, it went downhill. The movie was so boring that I was fighting sleep, and lost that fight. At a certain part of the movie after the soldier left the woman and the baby, I didn't understand what I was watching because the props and background looked so fake and poorly done. I wasn't sure if it was cardboard backgrounds and drawn, but it was not appealing at all. All in all, this film was boring and uninteresting and I wish I didn't waste my time watching it."
1917,23 November 2020,9/10,"1917 is one of the cutest and sweetest movies ever. The visualization is impressive.The place and the story are interesting.The cast and crew were very talented in the making of this movie. You can cook it in one take
and make the movie taste a variety of flavors They let the audience see Wound in the heart and Story in WWI"
1917,22 January 2020,10/10,I was overflowed with goosebumps and respect for all those brave and unselfish men who gave their lives for greater cause back than. Much of respect also deserve the filmmakers who managed to make such an Ode about this horrific times.Movie left me speechless.
1917,29 November 2020,5/10,"Without doubt, it is a great movie, most of the reviewers and critiques praised this movie that's why I would not like to repeat the sametings.. But.. delevering the letter is the main event of this movie, unfortunately there are a huge mistake that director didn't pay attention to it.. I won't mention it here for two reasons; first to not spoil, and the second is, I want anyone else to watch it carefully and mention it."
1917,13 December 2020,10/10,"1917 shows a soldier Lance Corporal Blake selected for a task he assumes is medial; he chooses another soldier Lance Corporal Schofield to help. They soon learn they will be going over the top and through enemy territory to deliver a life-saving message to another unit. The two must give this message to another General before an early attack that will entrap thousands of soldiers in this other unit; Blake's brother included, they must begin their mission immediately to make it in time.
In 1917 we saw a sense of duty where these two young men have been subscribed a deadly task; ultimately, only Schofield achieves the goal. He could have quit many times through, but events along the way reinforce his sense of duty. Schofield could have stopped when the tunnel collapsed, knocked out when fighting a sniper or when the pilot killed Blake. He pushes through, each event layering hate for the enemy, building his drive to save others, or removing a way out.
Like Saving Private Ryan, our men are on a mission to save a brother; the group keeps pushing forward toward potential death. Questioning the mission turns toward a real sense of duty by the end of the film. Both movies have an anticlimactic scene when they get to the task, and the people on the other end do not want to listen to the message delivered.
1917 is a rare sort of film where the time spent watching the movie is the same length as the soldier spends on his mission. Masterful editing allows this to happen without any feeling of the camera cutting away. Viewers walk alongside the soldier from start to finish and never look away from his experience. Lightning enables the editing to keep a single thread in time by creating moments where the set can change through dark black transitions. Scene cuts additionally are obscured by explosions, dust clouds, or motion blur; never is there a noticeable cut.
The single thread in time gives viewers a sense of how life might be during the Great War and builds the viewer's sense of duty. Many other war films cut away from the horror of battle with flashback clips to better times to give viewers a break from the hopeless feeling. 1917 keeps the viewer engaged and focused on the mission, along with Schofield they want this to end, get to the resolution just as much as Schofield. Granting the audience a sense of what it might have been like to live two hours of the war.
Watch 1917 in a quiet place with a large screen and decent sound. Take it all in and join these men on their mission."
1917,16 December 2020,9/10,"Seriously one of the best films of our time. A fantastic film, bravo!"
1917,31 January 2021,7/10,"I was waiting for a movie that won't use shaky camera shots and non-stop of close ups that can be inpresive but can also ruin small parts of the movie...Acting is amazing with non of the actors makeing mistakes. Action is realistic and showes how you can make action real, brutal and fun to whatch"
1917,2 February 2021,10/10,"I strolled into the theater expecting a decent war movie and walked out with a feeling that I've never had in theaters before. I was completely captivated and satisfied with what I had just witnessed. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting was fantastic, and the story was inspiring."
1917,7 January 2021,8/10,"Agree it's a wonderful film ,deserving for its incredible cinematography--some plot holes that have been pointed out on this site, I'll add a minor one--the Generals orders to stand down -that piece of paper survived that ""Niagara falls"" like plunge-the paper handed to the Colonel looked pristine!!"
1917,19 July 2021,7/10,"Exceptional film production, shame about characterisation and storyline."
1917,24 January 2021,4/10,"Storyline boring, there is nothing much to say about it actually...great cinematography,but that's about all good I can say...sorry not sorry,there are much better movies out there."
1917,19 January 2021,7/10,"I like how the actors done the movie in this way, very nice movie I like it"
1917,23 January 2021,10/10,Love the way they made this movie action filled when that plane came in on my 4K tv the way the bombes was hitting the gun fire this movie really has you on the edge of your seat I love the beginning how it kicks off how realistic they made this movie omg
1917,24 January 2021,9/10,Amazing cinematoghraphy. I was one of those soldiers while I was watching! A great story.
1917,23 January 2021,5/10,"Let's start with the positives which are the environments, sound design, props and the overall gritty feeling of war in the picture. Many are also praising the cinematogrophy however I don't actually like the 'one take' style since it creates such weird inconsistencies in time.In normal moviemaking when you transition between shots, there is the opportunity to let some time pass between the shots and the viewer is aware of this. But when I watch this 'one take' style and time passes on the other side of a wall for example, I just got confused and really thought it would be better of just throwing in cuts in some places. You could still use long immersive takes without making the whole movie 'one take' for a meme or something.Regarding story and characters, this movie is just not good. The story is very simple and quite frankly, ridiculous. The characters appear very briefly and is never seen again except for the protagonists which struggle during the whole movie with walking, occationally running and lots of panting.If there would have been an interesting story with perhaps more character developments, this could have been a great movie. In reality if you have seen the trailer you pretty much have seen the movie. There is zero rewatchability.
I don't understand the high rating this movie has gotten."
1917,25 January 2021,2/10,"From start to end was a snoozer. If I wanted to watch an hour of someone walking with no action I would watch my ex wife on a treadmill. This is by far the worst "" war movie"" in existence , if you can call it that. The only thing it has going for it is good camera work. Even the blown up town looked like it was made for a high school play.
Other than that it was just waiting for something to happen."
1917,29 January 2021,5/10,"The cinematography was top of the line, no doubt in that. The camera work the environment details was brilliant too. But the movie lacks in true reality, only 2 mens were sent to deliver a message to save the lives of 1500 mens!! By a GENERAL really! ""C'mon guys it's not like the audience gonna think that this CAN NOT happen in reality whatsoever, -you know what you are right i should not waste time in making it's events more realistic lets realease this!"""
1917,14 September 2021,10/10,"I wish I could rate it 11. Awesome scenery and wonderful acting. It really hits home what our farthers, grandfathers, great grandfathers did for us!"
1917,30 January 2021,5/10,"The quietness of this movie was an instant reminder that the producers had little idea of the reality of the Western Front. From Flanders to the Swiss border you could - at any time of day or night - always hear the distant booms of artillery barrages.Also, this movie was so full of 21st-century features - non-white troops embedded with British front-line units and so on - that it's a wonder the producers didn't try to work in a lesbian subplot.As a piece of fantasy it's not half bad. As a realistic portrayal of the Western Front in the spring of 1917 it's a dud."
1917,6 February 2021,10/10,"This film had me sitting forward in anticipation for the whole experience. The way it was filmed (as one continuous shot from beginning to end) was done masterfully. The characters, dialogue and overall atmosphere was remarkable. A must watch for war film lovers."
1917,6 February 2021,9/10,"""1917"" is a gripping British war film, produced in 2019. The film is based on true events and narrates a few days in the life of two British soldiers during World War 1. Sam Mendes successfully created a spectacular story out of a relatively unknown incident.After realising a strategic withdrawal by German troops to start an ambush on a neighbouring battalion, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) were ordered to deliver this information to their threatened friends. Due to cut telephone lines the two set out on foot early in the morning. To accomplish their mission the two Britons, must escape from German front-line soldiers, cross minefields, and brave harsh weather conditions. This tense journey through northern France makes the film stand out, moreover, the acting is very convincing and well produced.The film provides a short but intriguing insight into the courageous life of two soldiers. I was particularly impressed by the plot, which was designed with meticulous detail and in a realistic manner. The structure of the film was unusual and quite new to me since the whole film only shows a period of about four days. I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in having a look at a supposed sideshow. It is by far not a typical war film with large-scale attacks and many deaths, but it offers a very personal view from the perspective of two soldiers."
1917,11 July 2021,5/10,"I wanted to like this movie but, after all the hyperbole and accolades heaped upon it, it failed to deliver.The plot is thin and no amount of stunning cinematography can fill in the gaps. The absurdity of sending two junior NCO's on this mission when aircraft, passenger pigeons and the good old telegraph could have easily warned the 2nd of the trap cannot be explained. The incident with the German airman left me shaking my head as the flyers of the day were notoriously civil in captivity.I wish there were more WW 1 movies to compare this with but, if you have an hour or two, watch, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" with Ernest Borgnine and a young Richard Thomas and ""Paths of Glory"" with an amazing performance by Kirk Douglas.That is all..."
1917,12 March 2021,1/10,"This won't be a popular opinion, but I just couldn't get into this movie. I love WWI and WWII movies and documentaries. I just thought this was boring. This is from someone who adores stuffy documentaries. Yes, it had great cinematography, but I felt totally unengaged by it. I don't remember even the first name of the protagonist. The dialogue was too quiet and the rare bits of action were too loud.Long story short, I didn't care about the characters and I tried liking this film.I feel like people saw that it was history related and so they just thought they were SUPPOSED to like it. WWI was mostly waiting to die in a trench, but exciting things did happen. Once again, I love documentaries and I also love British movies and TV."
1917,12 March 2021,9/10,"I went to see this film after it won 3 2020 Oscars in Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. So, in my view, I only expected to see how the director, Sam Mendes, portray WW1 scene and how he could deliver emotion of character through the camera work. The result is not disappointed and I could understand it clearly why this film won 3 of technical category awards.Before going to see this film, most people reviewed it as great in only cinematography but 'normal' or 'too cliché' in main plot. The plot is about 2 wartime messengers who got assigned to deliver vitally important at the front line on time. If you are a fan of war film, this plot might remind you of all time famous war film 'Saving Private Ryan (1998)' which is about a captain who got assigned to find a private named Ryan whose three brothers died in combat and bring him home before his family will be losing all sons. I admitted that the plot of 1917 really sounded cliché, but I have to compliment to 2 main casts including George MacKay as Lance Corporal Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Blake that they both could portray the feeling and pressure of wartime messengers perfectly. Their acting made me feel sympathetic to them and pray that they could accomplish their mission until the end of the movie.Plus with long-take cinematography style throughout the film and the editing such as zooming out when the main cast was in the middle of battlefield full of front line soldiers or zooming in at the main character's face when they are hiding their enemy. Again, if you are a fan of war film, you might be familiar with the film called 'Dunkirk (2017)' which use the same cinematography technique with 1917 but it had some boring editing part. In 1917 film, Sam Mendes, the director improved it flawlessly. Even though the film was not filmed long-taken in 1 shot but the editing was perfectly smooth in the level that the audiences couldn't notice that each scene was filmed separately.Moreover, the sound mixing combining with 2 components mentioned above gave this movie more powerful impact. Throughout the movie, this movie made me feel exhausting physically like I was hurrying to deliver the message along with those 2 main characters.Overall, this movie had remarkable point mostly in cinematography technique but I could say that if the movie miss another important part such as cast's acting skill or the plot, the outcome of this film would not be this successful. I will give it 9/10 because the plot is too easy to predict and will give it 10/10 if ignoring it."
1917,14 April 2021,10/10,One of the bset WWI films i've ever seen. Very detailed and the plot is solid. A must watch.
1917,27 March 2021,4/10,"Not much there. Two guys wander, and then wander, and then wander, anddddd......you guessed it, they wander again. Boring, uneventful, and anti climatic."
1917,5 April 2021,8/10,It's means something like friendship or war or humanity I love it.
1917,15 April 2021,1/10,"I agree with many disappointed viewers: this is a rehash (a bad one) of All Quiet on the Western Front, Gallipoli, Private Ryan, Butch Cassidy and Two Towers (the gorge, the waterfall, the jump into the rapids and all of that in flatlands Flanders of all places), and then some.All Germans are mean (and stupid because they die after getting help by the kind English soldier), the baby looked in pretty good shape after having been in a war zone for who knows how long, two messengers walk into a deep bunker / Unterstand without checking directions or whatever, but hoping it will get them ""there""... Outch.The Devons are ready to go over the top in a highly contested hostile frontline, they hunker in a wide broad trench dug out of the chalky landscape (was it a battle in the Champagne?? ) and there are no craters in front of the trench anywhere, virgin land (the Germans obviously didn't know anything about scorched earth, particularly when they purposely retreat to create a trap: make the approach easy, pleasant, that'll fool the English...).I don't doubt the director's grandfather's stories. He must have been a great story teller, but even 'tall tales ' happen in context or they are just fairy tales.The film (actually the director) couldn't decide if it wanted to be a war story, a personal journey, a feel good movie, an action flick or a deep reflection on humans (i.e. Men, there was only the mom and the baby), in the end , it was neither."
1917,26 January 2020,4/10,"Got a few issues with this film.
1. The letter. Why is is not a ball of wet mush? Even the ink isn't smudged.
2. German soldiers that went to the Star Wars Stormtroopers School I'd Learn To Shoot. Even the shrapnel couldn't hit the side of a barn.3.Trust an enemy to be quiet if you take your hand off his mouth hey?
4. Amazing that not one soldier questions- or even notices-that a unidentified wet and muddy soldier isstaggering through the undergrowth and joins them whilst listening to a guy sing...for too long.I could mention a few more (lady with baby...why does this scene even exist? The cliche waterfall. )Anyway, anybody heard of an 1981 Aussie film starring Mel Gibson, ""Gallipoli ""?
Well the writers of1917 obviously have.
Watch it... it's a better movie with no cgi rats in it."
1917,15 June 2021,10/10,I just cant even explain how well made and amazing this movie is. Just absolutely wonderful.
1917,6 June 2021,1/10,"Periodicals are my preference so I was super pumped for this film. I didn't make it past the opening scene lol. Dean-Charles Chapman was cast as a starving teen soldier in WWI. He and his mate are walking back to camp complaining about how hungry they are, yet Chapman looks like he's had a couple slices in between each take they've shot. I don't know how anyone is supposed to take this film seriously when you can't even cut the weight to play the part. The film may have been better than I've rated it but I just can't waste 2 hours of my life watching something when the star's character isn't believable. Try again Hollywood."
1917,30 June 2021,10/10,"I never really like war movies but this hits different. Everything about this movie is just perfect. Sam Mendes did again a great job. I need to appriciate the choice of actors. George MacKay was a great choice of a mane character becouse he has something that the other actors don't have. I don't know if it's the look or a pure talent but he definitly did a great job. Dean-Charles Chapman on the other hand was too good and I mean it in a good way becouse his acting has everything I wanted and his performemce was phenomenal. I also like the choice of supporting actors such as Colin Firth,Mark Strong,Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Scott... .The thing what interest me the most was the tension in every second minute. You don't know what's going to happent and you love it. Basically this movie is must watch and I definitly recommend it."
1917,28 July 2021,9/10,A recapitulation of World War II History of United States overall takes a modern look into what soldiers and nations fought to liberate from war and obtain liberty/ Must watch to know more details of 1917 movie.
1917,2 November 2021,9/10,"With a unique style of a ""one-shot"" movie, it's script is a masterpiece, having almost not a single mistake, but being able to turn those mistakes in a way to create a bigger connection between the main character and the audience."
1917,8 February 2020,10/10,"An incredible achievement - superb performances, beautifully shot and an outstanding testament to the brave souls who gave and risked their lives.The film captures fully the brutality of war but also the sheer innocence of those involved, reminding you that these brave young men were just that, young men caught in an unthinkable situation.The pace of the film is measured in part but also equally relentless, while the tension of the situation never leaves full respect and understanding is given to the characters, with them and their relationships portrayed beautifully.A thought provoking, relentless and ultimately very important masterpiece."
1917,26 August 2021,9/10,"Exemplary angles and plans If you haven't watched 1917, you will lose a lot. The fact that most of the war movies secretly or openly propagandized a state and made the masses sleep with the intense nationalist sauce and made a war beautification made me very far from war movies, it also reduced my curiosity to discover a good war movie. In this regard, you have witnessed many war films, especially as I have witnessed, in which America tried to impose its ideology on the world through Hollywood. So I almost lost hope that war movies would offer something new about the tragedy of humanity. The last war movie I watched was Mel Gibson's ""War Valley (2016)"", but movies like ""Dunkirk, Cold War, Tall Girl, Painted Bird, For Sama"" that I watched later, once again removed my prejudices. Now, the movie ""1917"" has been added to the list of movies I have mentioned. The movie ""1917"" focuses on the story of two British soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), who crossed the enemy lines to deliver a message to their armies that would save the lives of hundreds of soldiers. Of course, it will not be easy to convey this message on foot and as soon as possible."
1917,14 October 2021,8/10,"A really beautifully presented film. I think I enjoyed the cinematic aspect of it more than the story itself, but overall it was a really engaging film."
1917,26 October 2021,10/10,"A small detail I'm sure not many people noticed but I found and is probably one of my favorite aspects of the story, is the story of the trees. At the start of the film we see both of our protagonists sleeping and leaning against trees when they get called for their mission. As the story goes on and one of them dies, there is a tree that has fallen over across the road blocking the soldiers path from continuing. Then at the very end of the film when our main character finishes his mission, he walks over to a lonely tree and rests upon it after a long journey. So, to me it is so cool how the trees life is telling the story of our protagonist."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"A stunning beautiful (if you can call it that) film from start to finish. An impending sense of dread that not even Dunkirk managed. The sound, visuals and acting all perfect."
1917,13 January 2020,7/10,I quite enjoyed the entire film but one criticism (that just bothers me) Stop changing historic events by putting black actors in movies trying to change history. It's dumb and does nothing for the movie or the person watching it.
1917,17 January 2020,3/10,"It is beautiful and a technical achievement. The story is ridiculous and I am pretty sure the Germans are Stormtroopers, because they can't hit anything numerous times in the movie. There are so many things that are utterly ridiculous that these soldiers do. Maybe WWI soldiers were that poorly trained, both German and British."
1917,15 February 2020,9/10,"Loved the long shots, the action and felt with the guys almost instant"
1917,28 April 2020,10/10,"Sam Mendes' 1917 is an amazing cinematographic experience. You feel like you are inside the screen with those soldiers. Every word, every tear, every run depicts perfectly the fear and horror in trenches of the Great War.
This movie almost achieves perfection in every technical category and George MacKay's performance is as excellent as it is undervalued.Mendes proves that he is a ""great storyteller"" as his grandfather Alfred was!
10/10"
1917,7 February 2020,3/10,"This movie is an insult to the millions who suffered and died. It just does not make sense, isolated regiment (massively stagnant front line), walk into battle only (do not run due to the creeping barrage), Indiana Jones style underground explosions, float down a river in full wooden uniform, webbing and boots, finished off with a waterfall in the middle of the flattest patch of ground on earth. So blatantly hollywoodised it is a blessing that all of the veterans of that war are not alive to see it."
1917,14 March 2020,1/10,"Great Cinematography, expected from a 100 million budget, and a seasoned Director and crew.Okayish acting. But no story... apart from Soldier A gets shoot, omg a trap, ohh some explaining to be done to character L whos in charge.Soldier A and B are expected to deliver a message to squadron C who's preparing an attack(while messaging pigeons existed), to avoid squadron C to be ambush in a trap... Also there's something about soldier B brother(Who I cannot bother to answer, cuz Ive gave up on seeing it, also seemed like a cheap ploy to attract on the trailers Soldier Ryan fans)"
1917,12 April 2020,10/10,"Well done semi-historical/war drama. The dialog was minimal so it was left to the costumes and sets to take us to 1917 and the Great War. And that is exactly what they did. The uniforms had an authentic look, though I'm certainly no expert in British Army uniforms, they appeared to have been well researched and were convincing. But it was the sets that took me to the 1917 trenches. I could almost feel the mud. The single shot camera work really drew the viewer right into the action. All in all, a breathtaking movie experience."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,Gripping and Intense. The cinematography makes you feel you are actually in there. Amazing backscore and set. Am sure it is going to win best picture fingers crossed.
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is one of the greatest war movies of all time. The direction of this movie is mesmerising. A true testimony to human will and a remainder of the sacrifices that so many soldiers made during WW1.
With everything that has been going on it seems that this is the perfect time for us to reminded about the horrors of war."
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"One of the best war movies so far , gave it 10/10 for directing and cinematography. A must watch"
1917,18 March 2020,10/10,"This is a perfect movie. It's that simple. It's flawless. And it's not as heavy as you may think, the elements of hope and achievement lighten it up complete with some tender moments and a happy ending. With the technical execution and acting...it's perfect."
1917,25 March 2020,10/10,Every second of this movie keeps you on toes. A must watch!
1917,19 January 2020,1/10,"I really don't understand all the rave reviews on this film. It is tedious and boring. The dialogue is stilted. If you enjoy watching men walk through trenches, then this is the film for you."
1917,22 January 2020,5/10,"There was a lot of action. Some violence. An arc to a stated goal. But, it didn't make you pull for the protagonist. There was a brother that was in danger, but you never had a reason to want him to live. Very little backstory to describe him as worth saving. No special ability of the 2 protagonists to do an impossible job, other than it was one's brother. An interlude with a woman that was supposed to reflect a version or reference to home life, but didn't do it well and was never revisited save an ambiguous picture with a note (sister, wife, girlfriend...who knows?). In short, the character development was sophomoric. The story was as boring as it could be for an interesting premise. The cinematography and realism made the movie watchable. But, at no time during the movie did I think, ""Wow, this is a great movie."" I went to see Spies in Disguise with my son 2 days afterward and thought that that was a much better movie. Better on all fronts."
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,"This isn't a gimmick. If you get the chance, please watch it in the cinema, it was quite an experience. I went with family members and the journey home was silent, it left the lot of us speechless."
1917,30 January 2020,10/10,"This is my first review ever. I had to write it because I am fascinated from what I've seen right now. With all respect, Citiyane Kane, 2001: A space odyssey and 1917 are the most revolutional direction of all time. Master peace of world cinema, so glad that someone made something like this in TV era."
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"I've never left a review, but this one deserves all of the praises. It's one of the most beautifully done movies I have ever seen. You feel you are right there with the soldiers, getting completely immersed. The camera work, the music, the scenes, everything was on point. The two hours fly by so quickly, in the best way possible. There isn't a moment that you feel you can look away. Watching it a second time, you can truly pick up on the subtle actions of the character Schofield and why he seems shut off. You can better understand Blake and his intense desire to just go without stopping. The characters compliment each other greatly, and the actors were brilliant. Very well done!"
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,The way this movie is shot bring you inside of the action and make you feel like you are following in the footsteps of the character.
1917,5 February 2020,8/10,"... but a completely different experience. You are submerged during this time in the world that surrounds the main characters, close to what they're thinking/feeling. I found myself more than once trying to make the camera move to see another angle. It is impressively made."
1917,10 April 2020,2/10,"First solder dies, the second solder delivers the message. There are some chasing scene and good cinematography, just it. The movie is not realistic.
Perhaps teenagers like it.I am so sorry for Hollywood."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"Enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would. Will see again in the cinema. Gave me everything I was hoping from Dunkirk but didn't quite get, even though I did like Dunkirk. Loved the cinematography, feels like you're there too on the journey. Good luck at The Oscars, hope this movie rakes in the awards."
1917,10 February 2021,3/10,"This is most over-rated film I saw recently.
After first 20 minutes everything goes down the hill. It's became way too slow and use all cliches possible.
Moreover starting from some point it also lost any logic (scene in the wood is just kind of joke, really)"
1917,29 February 2020,9/10,"It's a female war movie experience, sam Mendez. Reality is at the forefront and a very successful camera angle ..full metal jacket, thin red line, er Ryan, has been a very high quality film with a distinct value as well as masterpieces."
1917,17 February 2020,1/10,"A boring movie, if there is less than one star I will give it 0 or even in minus !!!"
1917,1 January 2020,9/10,"Mendes managed to capture the suspense, the intensity, the horror, the madness & the camaraderie of this crazy, horrific episode in time called WW1. I certainly don't want to spoil anything for anyone who have not seen this movie, but it is, by far, the best war movie in quite some time."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It's an astonishing piece of filmmaking
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,"This movie is amazing! While not based on an actual event, the story is based on stories from the directors grandfathers WW1 experiences. Probably the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan (Dunkirk is up there as well). And the editors make it look like a single shot which looks incredible."
1917,16 May 2020,6/10,"Watched the movie today. The screenplay is somehow simple: there are just two main questions whether the message will be delivered in time and action will be cancelled (vaguely said in order not to spoil anything) and whether the brother will be met. So, no other twists for me there... But an incredible cameraman work keeps interest of a viewer till the end. The gluing together of shots is so smooth that there persists an illusion that the movie is made in one shot. Also, the music - it sound with the precise scene mood at the right time which amplifies watching experience. Neverrminding the screenplay and my rating of 6 stars, it certainly worth watching at least one time."
1917,15 February 2020,1/10,"Tried to like it, but no. Incredibly boring from start to end. At least the picture was good. But the rest, nah. The plot: a guy and his friend walking for 2 hours. They tried to put in emotional scenes but failed miserably. I usually get really moved by those, but I didn't feel anything this time. I guess it wasn't my cup of tea."
1917,23 December 2019,10/10,"This story follows a journey, mainly shot real time...and the cinematic visuals make the viewer think they are part of the story.
Night scenes with flares give a surreal feel
and the camera operations are supremely executed. The sense of being with the 2 men is real as good as it can be.
Moving story, very well choreographed action, brilliant for the actors to play and very gritty and real looking trenches and buildingsThe story...it shows the futility of war particularly WW1."
1917,16 June 2020,10/10,This movie makes you feel all the emotions as if you were there. First review ever on here and this movie was worth it. From the start to finish this movie is everything you want in a war movie.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"I'm really amazed at how they shot the movie ... I'm speechless.. this is definitely a 10/10
Best movie since 2014 's Interstellar"
1917,8 August 2020,1/10,Expensive production to portray war as something of drama and emotion. War is hell and death. Kill or be killed. Those that benefit from so many giving their lives to this horror are now benefiting in the glamorization of it. Complete garbage absent of any touch with reality. Sick.
1917,21 July 2020,4/10,"A beautiful movie, yes.
It had me, my gf and her family sitting in the couch laughing from how unrealistic a lot of the scenes were.Definitely a good thing if it were a comedy but this were supposed to be a realistic war movie."
1917,21 March 2020,6/10,"I had high hopes for 1917......""even better than Saving Private Ryan"" I heard people say. Nonsense. While it may be a technical triumph, the characters are boring, the acting from the two leads is poor, and the story is predictable. World War One involved a plethora of fascinating characters and events and was a truly paradigm-shifting moment in history......1917 is just a movie we've seen a thousand times before.....the tragic futility of war told via the experiences of a couple of generic cockney corporals with no personalities whose lives are valued at nought by pantomime villain officers that just want to send men over the top for the sheer fun of it....blah blah blah. In short, 1917 is a technically spectacular work which delivers a cliche and generic portrayal of the war."
1917,13 September 2020,1/10,"Characters without depth, absurd situations that do not contribute anything to the plot, the direction of Sam Mendes is far from other of his acclaimed films. An horrible bad version of ""saving private ryan"""
1917,22 January 2020,3/10,"Worst war film I have ever seen! Don't waste two hours of your life, most exciting bit was a van getting stuck in mud! Terrible pantomime acting!"
1917,16 April 2020,1/10,"Beautifully filmed bs story about something that never happened in a pointless war without purpose.
Badly edited storyless and with poor poor acting and ....... Why?"
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Wonderful in so many ways. Excellent story, great acting, sets are amazing. Quite disturbing at times, the tension rarely drops but the effect of it being filmed as a single shot is quite extraordinary. Highly recommended."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"It is refreshing to watch a war movie that truly makes you feel every emotion from love, to terror, to sadness and beyond in the span of a couple of minutes.
The cinematography is a true masterpiece, seamlessly edited.
All the actors deserve a standing ovation and have my utter admiration."
1917,20 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is intense, heartbreaking, mesmerizing, and at times stressful. The cinematography in this movie is absolutely BREATHTAKING. As someone who hates watching war movies, I'm so happy I went to see it."
1917,5 February 2020,5/10,"As most others have said, the cinematography was amazing and the sound effects as well. But them surviving the explosion, fallen plane landing right in front of them and the multiple shots was so fake. I thought c'mon they're like Rambo!"
1917,29 May 2021,8/10,"I think this film really looks and feels like a dream. Even inception which is focused in dreams due to the immense amount of special effects fails in showing how a real dream really looks like , well at least for me. Sudden landscape changes, sudden characters appearances and almost surreal scenes make of this story a great and special movie to see."
1917,28 January 2020,9/10,"I think the best way to describe this movie is to say that it feels like an incredible journey.The plot is absolutely one that warrants the decision to film it as if it was one shot. I know it wasn't the first film to do this, but I feel it had a more profound effect on the overall feel of this movie than this style did for others like it. It forces you to feel the weight of each passing minute, and evokes a sense of urgency like I've never experienced before.I highly recommend doing some research after watching the movie about how they designed the sets. The choice to film the movie as one shot meant they had to be extremely precise with the speed and distance the actors needed to travel during each scene to make sure the pacing of the movie made sense.I think it's fascinating how factors such as weather, lighting, and set design needed to be just right to achieve the final look they wanted. I appreciate the consideration of these minute details, as I can tell how crucial each element was in tying everything together into the masterpiece that it is. It's hard to think of a reason anyone could dislike this film - it's truly an incredible watch!"
1917,18 February 2020,9/10,"When Schofield is travelling with the caravan, there's an officer on foot who chats with him. I swear it was Stanley Tucci. But he'snoweher to be found in be credits. Did my eyes deceive me?"
1917,28 January 2020,2/10,"I watched this film on Sunday and I'll admit I started falling out of love with it as soon as the plot was established as I found it hard to believe, but then multiple things kept happening which further took me out of believing and being invested in the film and into downright incredulity most of the time. Something which I could perhaps have got behind if the movie acknowledged its dreaminess, but as it wants to be judged as a ""based on real events"" type basis, I'm afraid its a hard no from me on believability.So those events, which others have remarked upon: Getting blown up and surviving without a scratch, but which destabilises a supposedly well built German bunker, Star Wars mine shaft jump, who milked the cow, why is that cow still alive, why aren't they concerned that it probably means someone is around, helping the German pilot (not the last time these two are shown to be terrible soldiers), I didn't know enough about Blake to care for him before he died and I was glad when he did because the German pilot stabbing a naive Brit for pulling him out the plane was what he deserved it was just stupid, the truck fulls of Brits turning up at that moment (more on that later), Schofield not jumping in the water as soon as the sniper starts shooting, Schofield briefly becoming an incredible soldier and hitting the sniper before going back to being a terrible one, didn't roll a grenade in through the sniper door, weird back of the head injury that knocks him out, but again doesn't kill him, then disappears, more bad soldiery running down the middle of the Main Street of the town that you know has Germans in, not shooting at the soldier that comes out of the fire, just running away and being missed multiple times from extremely close range, not got a lot to say about the baby scene except he briefly loses sight of his mission, why do the Germans seem to not be looking for him in that period, again trusting a German soldier not to speak even after the lesson of the pilot, I was fully expecting him to stab the other German, but then he just runs past him... the waterfall in the river, if its the same river as the downed bridge crossing couldn't he have just crossed it at the point he eventually gets out and skipped the town? how did the 1600 soldiers get across the river? Why are they set up in the field instead of clearing and holding the nearby town? At the singing scene why are there no sentries, you are deep in what was German territory a matter of hours ago guys! we've just seen there might be snipers, Lastly, holy cow thats an impressive brand new trench, are you sure you haven't got any supply lines? Because that sort of set up looks like it would have supply lines. Getting up out the trench... meh I was gone at that point.So on to the point no one has made yet. The movie constantly undermining itself. Lets go back to the beginning, a trench full of Brits seemingly waiting to go over the top at any moment. We go through no mans land, but the German trenches are empty, so actually we worried for no reason, and the men really should have been stood down, forward to the British trucks... WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? Did someone build a road through no mans land in a couple of hours? Up to that point we are believing our two soldiers are alone behind enemy lines. But actually they aren't behind enemy lines because the trucks are there and everything is so casual! its clear they know there are no Germans around, so what was the opening of the film even for? There was ZERO danger apart from a booby trap, they should have driven there. OK Why does Schofield run into the town? As I said earlier if its the same river its really stupid, but I could go with it being a different bit of river. Back to the singing scene, everything is safe again. The way those soldiers are, its as if they are behind the line (which they sort of are) not part of some advance.OK the final bit, we are told at the start that they must halt the attack before its starts to prevent a massacre as the Germans have amassed a far superior force (this is the premise of the film, then we are told the brother went off in the first wave, but here he is, back from the first wave, alive. So how bad could this attack and the German response even have been? It would have given the film some poignancy back if Schofield wandered round the aid station, found the other dead brothers surname on a dog tag, went off to his tree and wondered about the futility of war."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"The most emotional and heartfelt film I have seen for years. Don't hesitate just watch it. Awesome, I wanted to immediately see it again."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,Excellent cinematography & acting. Very powerful. Would highly recommend this movie.
1917,1 December 2020,2/10,Anybody that claims this movie is intense should stop watching movies all together
1917,15 January 2020,1/10,"This movie seems like it was shot with a great camera and no talent. Close up shots 75% of the movie, poor acting, horrible script writing (most doesn't even relate or make sense), way too many panning scenes done poorly. To be honest I walked out towards what I believe to be the ending of the movie. I kept hoping for better but it's a flop IMO. Not sure how this made it to main screen. Tho I believe it was the title and history content it was supposed to have. No action all. Bet they didn't spend any money on the ""set"". Lol needles to see I was disappointed with this movie. Save your money till it's free on Netflix."
1917,14 June 2020,10/10,Without doubt an instant classic the best in every aspects
1917,10 January 2020,2/10,"It felt like watching Transformers but from the WWI set. The music felt totally out of place, thus being very repetitive in style and over scored. Couldn't make the connections.
The acting and direction were boring. Actors were generally too soft and too welcoming between each other. The environment lost its hostility based on the XXI century kindness represented in the movie. Horrifying in that sense.
The script had potential but many obvious Transformers like dialogue lines.
The makeup felt wrong at all times. All actors and extras seemed to have come directly out of a very nice shower. Actors would only look stained (as well as their clothes) after accidents, though they still managed to somehow be quite clean again.
I believe there lacked studying of this historial matter in every sense.
Visually, the lightning was very well achieved, and most of the camera shots were very nice, though sometimes the movements were a bit overdone.
CGI was noticeable in the ground explosions... even in the 70's they made it better than today. Sometimes it's just better to simulate the real thing. It's even cheaper than CGI."
1917,2 February 2020,6/10,"Worth watching.
Not one I'll be added to my dvd collection though.
And Indians and black people were alive in 1917 so get over it."
1917,16 January 2020,10/10,"I recently went to go and see this new film at the cinema and was very pleased with how Sam Mendez made me feel like I was actually present within the story as if I I was there in 1917 living the life of the soldiers. The way he's managed to do the film without any cuts scenes and being a continuous rolling shot of the film made you feel like you were constantly with Lance Corporal Schofield ( George Mackey ) throughout his journey of the story. Right from the beginning of the film your hooked on this emotional rollercoaster of a ride that you go though! Where it had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the next move was. Any giving you a look at the emotions that Lance Corporal Schofield was feeling During his journey. There were highs and low laughter and sadness and terrifying situations that you can only imagine what a soldier during that time went through, within even a short period as it is in the story but you can see how difficult and how much the soldiers went through even if it was a short timeline like the film. I was very pleased pleasantly surprised with all the surprise cameos within the film like Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin firth and many more. And that you've got to see not just an inside look of the story of Schofield but the story of everyone else that is involved with his journey. This film is definitely a crowdpleaser and a must see film of 2020 and will definitely most likely be up there in one of the war films to remember along with saving private Ryan, Dunkirk and hacksaw ridge."
1917,24 January 2020,6/10,"The story seems like saving private Ryan, but the final quality is pretty lower. good cinematography especially camerawork but the plot and characterization is awful. it's a mediocre movie"
1917,13 September 2020,10/10,Simply amazing! A must watch for a film lover or average watcher of the medium.
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Just walked out of cinema and had to post a score for this. 10/10 doesn't do it justice, amazing cinematography, still don't know how it was done. Amazing direction, Sir Sam is a genius, taking an idea he's already tried in Spectre and broadening it out, the structure, the story. What a tribute to the young men that gave their lives for our tomorrow. Faultless."
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,No other movie has affected me so much. I never fully considered the debt we owe to these men.
1917,4 December 2019,10/10,The cinematography and sets were unbelievable. Go see it just for that. But the entire film was fabulous.
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"I've been watching BTS videos of 1917 all week, wanting to know all about how the one shot filming process was done. Went into the film worrying that I'd hyped myself up and would be disappointed. I sure wasn't. 1917 is a masterpiece, from start to finish, gorgeous shot, beautifully acted, the music is stunning, every emotion conveyed is felt to its fullest, with such a dynamic score, from the rising tension in the bunkers, to the epic buildup during the trench run.
1917 also manages to convey the horrors of war, both physical and mental, without relying heavily on gore, it's a good balance.
I could not recommend this film any higher, do yourself a favour and watch it while it's in cinemas"
1917,22 March 2020,10/10,"A true masterpiece in filmmaking. There really is no need to go in more detail. Parasite is well deserved of all the praise, but I truly think this film should've won."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,I was mesmerized by the technology used to produce this movie. This overshadowed the wonderful story and fabulous acting.
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,The movie sucked you in from the very beginning. The way it was shot like everything happened in one take really trips you out but also make you part of the story and keeps you on edge. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,"Espectacular,intensive moviewith less shots thati see after dunkerke.
Good actors, you feel how youre inside the history.."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Saw this film in imax ,what can I say please go and see it ,it was brill wow ,it's one off those films you have to see your self ,"
1917,12 January 2020,6/10,I've seen some reviews say this is the greatest war movie ever and that baffles me. The story was very predictable & left little to the imagination. Cinematography is amazing though & was very well shot.Also not sure why it was rated R. PG-13 would have been better in my opinion.
1917,15 July 2020,10/10,The historical event in this epic movie of the Great War (WWI) is monumental. It begins with a simple order to get a couple of young corporals deliver a message to the colonel responsible for a large 1600 troops to attack the German opposition. The one shot camera work does an amazing job in keeping the viewer alongside the young men at all times. I Could not take my eyes off the characters. The director put me in the middle of all the action and I literally felt like it was me running around and dodging bullets. Once I started watching I was hooked. The story is a simple one and as far as any war movie I've seen I have always been intrigued by simple characters doing extraordinary things. I put this movie alongside Platoon and Saving Private Ryan for their simplistic view through the innocent eyes of young and innocent men doing their best to stay alive. War is terrible and as we see it through the eyes of the soldiers their job is to just make it alive. Sam Mendez should have won the Oscar for this masterpiece. Two thumbs up 👍🏼👍🏼
1917,18 January 2020,7/10,The movie is not the masterpiece all are stating it to be..its a technical showcase nothing more..Its over hyped in the media a lotIts not a bad movie but not a masterpiece ala Saving Private Ryan
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"The cinematography in this film is oustanding. I knew about the long takes going in, but some of the shots are just mind blowing of how long they are and how many people are involved in the scene.I really didn't love the main duo that much in the beginning, but by the end of the film, I was impressed with both of them. Add this one to the list of great war films."
1917,18 October 2020,3/10,Flat and boring. All Germans are bad shots as well apparently.I heard this was to be a great film but after finally watching it I was left very disappointed.Not as much as Dunkirk but close.
1917,9 February 2020,10/10,"One of the most stunning, breathtaking film experiences I have ever had."
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,Masterpiece. No better words to describe this movie.
1917,21 November 2021,8/10,The way this movie is filmed is not just for the sake of trying something different. The story feels like you follow it as a third person. George Mackay is a bit Stoic and yet dramatic. Ongoing tension without extreme special effects. Classic for the future.
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,I was hoping for a good drama / war film. This veered another direction and did not keep me entertained.
1917,12 January 2020,2/10,The acting was terrible. I watch many many movies and can not understand how IMBD GAVE IT SUCH A HIGH RATING?
1917,27 January 2020,4/10,"I really gave this a for strictly because of the technical merit. As far as reality in this movie goes it sucked as I said, where did the bucket of milk come from? Who's going to pull an enemy pilot out of a burning plane and not disarm him? Who's going to suffer and then closed explosion underground without having busted eardrums. The whole town in the dark sucked. Who's going to allow a man to walk up on a group of soldiers sitting around singing kumbaya songs getting ready for their last charge to meet their maker and not stop him. It just sucked disappointed me to no end because of the the rationality of the whole thing."
1917,13 January 2020,9/10,"Stunned and completely lost for words. Rarely do films reach such high thrills or encompass so deep and meaningful visual storytelling. In short, 1917 is a piece to behold leaving you on the edge of your seat while never failing to grasp the profound and heartbreaking impact of the Great War.The films compelling message is also greatly enhanced by it's Soundtrack. Composed by Thomas Newman, the score is both beautiful and extremely tense. Neither is it ever overused or absent when needed most. As such 1917's Score is a perfect blend of emotional musical cues and nerve wrecking strings.It is hard to fathom what those brothers, fathers and friends have endured in those trenches or how they ever returned to society. Arguably in the scene where these men sing ""The Wayfaring Stranger"", a song about the plaintive soul on the journey through life - it is evident why they are often referred to as the 'lost generation'.1917 is their hymn."
1917,13 December 2019,10/10,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary."
1917,28 February 2020,10/10,"This is definitely the best movie of 2019. Should have won Oscars for best director, best soundtrack scoring and best picture. It's amongst the best movies ever made. A masterpiece that is great in every aspect I can think of. Watch it."
1917,15 January 2020,10/10,"Brilliant!!! Absolutely brilliant!!!!
Cannot wait to get it on bluray just to see how they did half that stuff!"
1917,1 February 2020,10/10,"1917 is a masterpiece, you must watch it in the biggest screen you can get.
The cinematography, acting and the music are all on point.
The last scene will give your eyes a photography pleasure that you probably never felt. Sam Mendes created something that I hope will go down on history as one of the greatest war movies ever made, if not the best one.
Go watch it."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I won't give away any spoilers, but the way they shot this movie is a game changer. You feel like you are IN the action. You see everything the character sees. This is a special movie and it's worth seeing in theaters. In fact, I think seeing it in theaters is a MUST! I will be seeing it again. I'm adding this movie to my top 3 favorite movies of all time list..."
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,Amazing film. Modern day saving private ryan. Excellent from start to finish.
1917,4 February 2020,4/10,"Great to look at , nothing much else.Best film ? Do me a favour."
1917,30 January 2020,8/10,"What do you call appearing in Game of Thrones and a hit such as, Captain Fantastic?"
1917,7 February 2020,9/10,"This is an incredible movie / thats how make you tense to sitting on chair and watch all over the movie , best costume designers and best sequences, and best directions with characters ."
1917,24 January 2020,5/10,Hard to stay awake for this one. Even harder to understand how people can rate this movie a 10/10.Disappointed from the start to the finish.
1917,23 January 2020,10/10,"Gah, brilliant! One of the best war films I've ever seen!"
1917,23 April 2020,10/10,"I won't say much as I really want as many people to see this movie. It is everything a great film should be. Beautiful, moving. exciting, and provocative. The basic tale of a hero's journey through trials and tragedies told against the backdrop of a hellish war. You follow on a close personal level from the journey's beginning to end. Trading artsy cleverness and controversy for one man's story, 1917 is why basic story telling will never fail."
1917,11 February 2020,5/10,Mesmerizing first 30 minutes! But the weak story-line and weaker lead acting got me bored halfway into the film. It's a real shame.
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"First review ever. Short and sweet. I went to view the visual masterpiece in hopes of being in awe. I wasn't impressed. It was interesting, but not enough to wow me or any of the others in the half filled theater. Based on a true story to some degree, but really lacking. I never felt drawn in emotionally like many other good war films. It wasn't bad by any means, I just think most people would place this near the bottom of the top 25 war movies. Clichés abound. Above average war torn scenery. Two or three intense scenes. I struggled with a 7 but feel like it deserved extra for the cinematography alone."
1917,23 March 2020,9/10,Good one. Just like most of war movies. At some point you will think it is far from the reality but that d{sent affect much for the whole story.
1917,3 February 2020,1/10,"This felt like a lot of old stories all mashed together, a loose basic story chucked over the top and all so poorly stitched together you can almost tell when it switches from one story to another. The only impressive part of this patchwork film was the long continuous shot at the start of the film but that wasnt due to the acting or story but the director and film crew get the credit for that. There were so many wtf moments that were so unlikely to happen and a few moments that felt like they couldn't of happened even if it was by chance!"
1917,22 January 2020,9/10,Sam Mendes has done a tremendous job. Cinematography is on point. Feels like the movie is shot in one take. The pace of the movie is steady and the background score keeps the audience enchanted. Definitely one of the best movies of 2019.
1917,20 February 2020,6/10,"Visual good to watch, well acted. But it was a long drawn out boring film."
1917,10 February 2020,4/10,"I like war movies. Last one I saw was Dunkirk. This didn't rank up to it. The dialog was lacking. The way it was filmed got me nauseous , motion sickness . The plot was little weak. It was ok movie. Not a wow moment"
1917,21 January 2020,,"At war, everything is beautiful
At war, every man has a perfect jawline
At war, everything is perfectly framed
At war, every landscape is breathtaking
At war, enemies always miss their sniper shots
At war, enemies only kill by stabbing
At war, you get shot at close range and survive
At war, when you are on the storytelling side, you are benevolent to your enemies
At war, flares are used to create an absolutely magical sense of artistry in shattered and ruined cities
At war, flower petals sail on a calm river
At war, a kind infantry boy sings in the woods to sooth your mind
At war, music peacefully stops when your heart stops beating and you give last breath
At war, luckily, you arrive right on time to deliver a retreat order
At war, luckily, you save hundreds of lives in extremis
Because, at war, your country cares about your life, and casualties are okay, I guess, only if Deakins frames them in order to get his Academy Award.
Because, for Mendes and Deakins, at war, you enroll for a hell of a ride!"
1917,5 December 2019,10/10,I saw a preview screening about two hours ago and I am still in shock. This is the best war movie I have seen in a decade. The shots Mendes uses and what he demands of his actors is nothing short of incredible. If you get a chance this will probably be the last must see movie of 2019. I will be seeing this again on release.
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"I don't normally gush about films, but ""1917"" is a singular masterpiece of cinema, which draws you into the action, the drama, the tragedy, the bleakness and the beauty. It never cuts away. It takes you on a journey into one day of the Great War, to witness the quiet and simply stated heroism of those who lived through the War. ""1917"" isn't so much a war film as it is a gripping and immersive experience, which holds onto you until the very end. It is the best film I've seen in years."
1917,8 March 2020,9/10,This is awasome movie. Which depicts the hardship of soldier's life.
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"The cast, the crew, the direction. The portrayal of war, and through a single shot view, is cripplingly heartbreaking and beautiful. I have never seen a film like this and I feel it is unlikely to be as amazed by an actor's performance ever again. Everything is tied together by the close of the one shot and it is beautiful."
1917,28 February 2020,5/10,This really is the most overhyped film in history. It's OK at best but is merely an ego trip for Sam Mendes.Why it got any awards I really don't understand.Hugely disappointing.
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"1917 is an expertly crafted war movie that takes you right into the trenches of World War 1. The film follows two young British soldiers as they journey across No Man's Land and into enemy territory to call off an attack that will cost the lives of 1,600 men. The story is based on the account of the director's grandfather, who served in the war, and bears a stiking resemblance to the plot of Saving Private Ryan. The film delivers a deeply moving experience as you see the true human cost of war and scale of destruction left behind in what was supposed to be ""The War to End all Wars"". What really sets 1917 apart is the excellent Cinematography from Oscar winning DP Roger Deakins. The film is shot and edited to appear as one long take, with the exception of one intentional cut that fits the plot of the film. Although it isn't the first film to achieve this, it might be a first for a war film, which is truly impressive when considering the amount of practical effects and extras used in many scenes. This style of filmmaking really works with the story as the characters refuse to take a rest and push on with their mission, so does the camera refuse to take a break. If you are interested in history or are fascinated by the art of filmmaking, watch this movie!"
1917,25 January 2020,1/10,Great quality film for artistic purposes. For the general public.... worst and most boring film I've ever watched!
1917,18 March 2020,8/10,Wasn't overly intrigued by the story during the movie.. but the cinematic storytelling was great.
1917,2 February 2020,3/10,"Hi everyone. This is the first time reviewing a film. 1917 on the surface, from the trailers and from the reviews, seems like something you would like to see. I went into it hoping I'd learn something and feel something after two plus hours of viewing. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. The, 'one shot' choice of cinematography, at least to my mind served not only as a gimic but also as a hindrance to the entire film. I love film and I love films about war. The thin red line, full metal jacket, the hurt locker, saving private Ryan. The despair, the pointlessness of war, it resonates with me on so many levels. This film however doesn't resonate at all. I felt nothing throughout. As a brit, I've seen the first world war butchered, in wonderwoman and now used as a puff piece in 1917. I look back at that day, admittedly when I was young. There was an honesty to blackadder season 4. I was able connect to those characters. The tounge in cheek, stiff upper lip comedy, quintessentially British. Nothing in 1917 resonates like blackadder does. I remember my mother crying when baldrick and the boys went over the top and the screen disovles to a field of poppies. I remember how poininant that was for me as a child. The sacrafice those men gave. It's one of the most humbling moments in human history.It might win baftas and Oscars but 1917 is a poor reflection on the real war that unfolded 100 years ago. Its more a reflection of holywood and the self indulgent, narcassitic, style over substance agenda they are pursuing."
1917,31 May 2020,9/10,"The only failing of this movie would, and could only be, two parts.
First: That it is so incredibly rich and full bodied in raw emotion, and delivers to us all a sense of magnitude, that one soldier can carry on his shoulders that if he dose not fulfil the duty of his orders given. This could be a over powering sense of Reality and maybe even an awakening for some, who didn't know just what the price of serving there country might be at all like in a trench or in a war. more then that, it's shows the weight of courage that only comes when the lives of your fellow man is at stake. Using the art, and magic, of the cinema it's clear to all those watching this movie, those who carried such a Humongous task in war time real were the hero's that this film proclaims then to be.
Second: the only other fault any might find is simply that this movie is so outstanding outspoken, because it has none near, or close, to its excellence in its masterful delivery as a feature film. New a fresh camera styles, that need no mention, as there awards given speak in far greater magnitude then I could tell you. Mix this with a story, that clearly holds close place in the directors/writes heart, can only equate to a masterpiece of film making artistry that Is matched in all areas around this movie. Cinematography, props, sound, lighting... any aspect that we look at closely, I can promise you won't find faults or room for improvements .
This means that such a Goliath of a movie, is stand alone at the top, only with a handful of others. Not only of its genre, but it is so rare a work of art, that is can not able but out weight its opponents, because quite simply its in a class of its own.I believe this film to be the greatest work of this masterful filmmakers that I have been privileged to enjoy, and I believe fully that as a testament to his grandfather and the service to his country, That sick a beautiful and power take upon his story would have made him overwhelmingly proud and thankful to his grandson.On a personal note, this is first first movie to ever inspire me to write a review of my feeling as the credits roll up screen, and I hope the passion of my writing over comes, what I sure I have made, is a lot of grammatical errors.Thank you, for this film."
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"A beautiful study of human courage, determination and compassion. Really enjoyed how the protagonist emerges from an initial state of reluctance and resentment."
1917,1 February 2020,3/10,"The story if I may call it like that is basically nonexistent.
Movie doesn't bare to show any emotions.
However there is some sort of continuation throughout the picture.
Cinematographic is terrible, and there is absolutely no 'sound effects'
in case you're hoping for a great sound track.."
1917,24 January 2020,4/10,Expected alot more going by reviews on here. Did not enjoy. Poor acting I thought with terrible story line. If you want action you will be disappointed.
1917,13 April 2020,7/10,Fascinating Camera techniques but with a normal war story.
1917,1 December 2020,6/10,"A war movie with no war action in it. If you are a fan of war movies with combat, lots of action, that tension that comes from movies which can really portray great battles and brave men in combat, you might be a little frustrated with this film. It is more like a journey of two boys who smell like milk to deliver a message, you don't get to have that feeling of real men bravely fighting and acting like real soldiers. It is more like two kids running through a studio scenario in an individual journey. Not a war movie."
1917,10 February 2020,6/10,"Even though it's my favourite genre, i haven't been blasted by this movie.
In my opinion the story is one of the best parts.
Sound and camera are outstanding, therefore the oscars for those categories.
Overall i can't understand the outstanding reviews, as it is a new and nice, but fairly average war movie in my opintion."
1917,24 January 2020,1/10,"They forgot to write a story. Yep,, that's it. They just forgot. No need to have a story. Is this review long enough now? Or do I keep going till the bots say, 'yep' that's long enough. Kinda like they though how short could we make the story to be a total non story..."
1917,3 May 2020,7/10,"So I felt like this was a ""Saving Private Ryan"" rip-off... but not nearly as good. Instead of a squad of men out to save a private, a corporal and private are ordered to save a brother and 1600 soldiers. And my first thought, only a corporal and a private are used to save a division of soldiers? Why did this get so much praise? The cinematography was incredible, the suspense and buildup were enthralling, but that's were it stopped. The story was not at all believable, the characters weren't relatable, it made the German's look like the worst shots in the war, the military tactics were deplorable, and the ending was almost humorous. Saving Private Ryan is the hallmark. Band of Brothers is a close second. Even Fury was far more interesting. Other than the visuals, this was just okay... and those English accents were hard to understand!"
1917,29 August 2021,9/10,"While the single shot may seem like a well pulled off gimmick, Mendes packs the gimmick like a master. The symbolism with the trees, character view point and soldiers are used wonderfully. The scripts maps to the gimmick but this doesn't imply it isn't good - again, Mendez wraps the script around his gimmick like a master. It is amazing the amount of perspectives Mendes gives from long view panoramas, to amazing actions scenes to views on family and military medals. Watch for story, stay for the gimmick - because it was done beautifully well."
1917,31 January 2020,2/10,Movie about nothing. So worth nothing. Don't waist your time.
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,"A story isn't told exclusively by dialogue, this movie proves us that, trough amazing visuals we are told not only the adventure of being inside the war but also we live the struggle as if we were in there."
1917,3 February 2020,1/10,"A useless exibition of technique in a desert of emotion, a flat electrocardiogram, a collection of inexpressive faces, a story so predictable that the phone guide in comparison is a masterpiece. Good cinematography is not enough to save this ultra boring bucket of chamomile. Something not to be proud of."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"If I had a give a quick summary, this film is breathtaking.It sounds cliche, but it is one of the few war films which made me feel like I was there, like I was in the same situation as the soldiers - helpless, with a fear that an attack could come at any time. It doesn't focus on the typical action scenes you often find in war films which present the situation as an appealing and exciting one, but shows the monotony of trench warfare and portrays the emotions these young men were feeling.One of the biggest assets to the film is the way it is shot, the single- shot camera work truly adds to this effect spoken about above. This combined with the fantastic acting and the details of the environment create, what I believe, is one of the best representations of war on the big screen. Go and see this film."
1917,29 October 2020,4/10,"Laughable in so many ways. Some scenes reminded me of the Blues Brothers where they kept walking out of carnage with not a scratch. It is a visual treat, but the story is pants. Moves more slowly than a one legged sloth with arthritis. People rating this above the thin red line or saving private Ryan is simply baffling. They must have long cover symptoms. One scene where the ruins are lit up like daylight by thunderflashes is beyond ridiculous. Last film this over rated I saw was Solaris"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"Wonderful movie, directed and filmed
............."
1917,21 June 2021,10/10,There are some movies that make you respect the art of film-making. 1917 is one of them.WHAT. A. MOVIE.WHAT. AN. EXPERIENCE.
1917,22 March 2020,6/10,"I believe this movie is belongs to british people and their nasionalism, and categorised as that movies which shown germans (in the world war) a monster
against manner of mother world and truth"
1917,24 January 2020,9/10,Inspiring story combined with mind blowing cinematography = Go see it.
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"From the moment the film opened until its closing shot, 1917 had me on the edge of my seat. A slow build up of tension and emotion all releasing in a dramatic and explosive climax made this film one of the best war movies I have ever seen. While not as action-packed like its predecessors, 1917 still managed to both get my blood pumping and my tears rolling. An incredible film, and an instant classic for me."
1917,2 February 2020,10/10,What a well made cinematic triumph. Best character driven war film for a long while..
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,"The way this movie is shot brings you into the experience. You feel as though your trudging through the mud with Blake and Scofield. When they're in a gunfight, your there too. The tragedies that happen to them also happen to you. I left the theater in a state of bewilderment and awe as viewing a movie shot this way left me feeling as no other has in a long long time."
1917,15 March 2020,10/10,"What a masterpiece, This is a movie that you can watch and get amazed by it even after 30 years."
1917,14 January 2020,7/10,"High marks for setting props. Not really taken with the lone character focus midway through the messenger mission.
Having been infantry with 1st MarDiv in South Vietnam in 1968, I was able to relate at times to the characters but this story was a bit too much Masterpiece Theater 'feel' for me.
Breaker Morant and Platoon caught me more than '1917.'"
1917,24 June 2020,8/10,"I absolutely loved this Film for the most part. The one-shot take is fantastically well executed and immerses you into the film as few have done before. The narrative is also well written as are the characters and you quickly establish a connection with all of them. However the movie has one major drawback for me, the same drawback that a lot of world war movies have. The trying to make you believe that the enemy (In this case the Germans) have absolutely no military competence whatsoever. I mean how many shots can a trained soldier miss?? It is ridiculous and really dragged me out of the experience. Luckily these encounters with the enemy are few so it doesn't ruin the entirity of the movie."
1917,4 February 2020,6/10,"I'd heard how fantastic this film was, so I was expecting to, if not like it (I don't normally gravitate to grim war movies), at least be moved/impressed by it. Not so. I felt let down - the script and lots of the dialogue were just so painfully corny at times - eg back of the truck, grumpy sergeants, and no more so than when the beautiful (of course) young girl and child are discovered in the ruins (just time for a quick nursery rhyme); it lacked any real tension, I think because of the gimmick of breathless continuous shooting; it was unrealistic - the damsel, finding your way through the ruins of a bombed out city at night, no map, no compass, etc etc, surviving the river/waterfall in spite of it all; then that piece of 'luck' happening on an 'open-air concert' at the end. Apart from the lead, the acting was no more than average. This movie was all about the set and the photography - grimly effective. Very disappointing and certainly not Awards material"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,Only on Imax. What a great experience it was. I was breathless afterwards.
1917,4 February 2020,10/10,"I felt dirty, I felt tired, I felt hungry, I felt a will to succeed and I felt sadness when I was watching the movie. It felt like I was also fighting to reach Colonel MacKenzie for two hours. Several hours later after my emotions are still outside my body.
Fantastic photo and music. Good casting of staff.
The movie is just perfect!"
1917,24 March 2021,8/10,"Very nice scenes of nature.
It is very interesting movie,there is no to many boring scenes."
1917,5 April 2020,2/10,"I rated this movie 2 stars and that is too much. Story and anything that happens have no logic and are pointless. If you still want know what is story of movie watch first and last 5 minutes of movie and you know everything, events in between are unrealistic or boring"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"Best direction, best cinematography, best actor, best movie.This is a phenomenal film that reminds me what good cinema should be.This is not a feel good movie. But it tells the story of WWI in gritty reality. The effort and thought that went into the making of this film, to make you realise how desperate the conditions were, were worth every second.I'd recommend you watch a trailer and some of the YouTube videos on the making of the film before you see it. It wasn't quite shot in one continuous take, but it feels like it.George MacKay deserves an Oscar nomination at least for this. His exhaustion at the end was palpable. Amazing film - it's the best 'made' film I have seen in at least a decade. Go see it."
1917,28 March 2020,9/10,"Definitely one of the best 'great war' movies ever made. The storytelling, the cast, music... etc are above average.
But the art of camera... motion shooting is superb."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"(This review has previously been posted on Chick and a Flick.)I don't like war movies, never have. They usually play one of two ways - an effects-heavy love ballad to gore and violence or a hearty tale of brotherhood among men who can't wait to talk about the girls waiting back home. The ones that focus more on fact over fiction will hold my attention a little longer, but my historical interests tend to skew towards the royal court of Henry the Eighth. So no, I don't like war movies and I didn't like 1917. I loved it.The story follows two British soldiers during the first world war and their journey across hostile territory to pass on a message that will save hundreds of lives - if they make it. Blake, played by Dean-Charles Chapman (Game of Thrones' Tommen Baratheon) and Schofield, played by George MacKay (Hamlet in the 2018 film Ophelia, which I only recently learned about and is now on my watchlist) are quickly likable and their easy, youthful friendship gives the movie a light start. Unfortunately, movies that attach you to the main characters so quickly tend to immediately send them into danger and 1917 is no exception.Schofield and Blake are called to see the general who informs them that there is an attack planned for the next morning that needs to be stopped. Turns out the Germans weren't really retreating, they were luring the British into a trap and if the attack goes on, all 1,600 men will die. Unfortunately, the phone lines have been cut and they can't call them, so the only way to warn them is by a hand-delivered letter. This is where Blake comes in - with his expert navigation skills, he should be able to make his way past the German front lines and to the camp of the 2nd battalion. In case orders aren't enough, the stakes are made even more personal when it is revealed his brother is one of the 1,600 men.They set off on their journey and we're quickly - too quickly - exposed to the horrors of war. The devastation is immediate as we are first introduced to the wounded, and then to the dead. As the pair begin their trek across no man's land, we see horrors that no man should ever have to witness and with each devastating visual, you are reminded that this isn't just a movie - this is someone's past, someone's memory.Though the story is a work of fiction, it is in fact based in some reality - director Sam Mendes' grandfather, Alfred Mendes went on his own life-threatening journey across no man's land in his time serving during World War I. These tales of war first relayed to Mendes in his childhood, stayed with him, eventually inspiring the creation of 1917.And what a creation it is. Emotionally charged from start to finish, it's hard to not judge this movie from such a personal perspective. Beyond just being visually stunning, it's the way the visuals are presented that takes it to the next level - the entire thing is made to look like one continuous take.I will admit, I was skeptical about the idea when I first heard what they were doing, but within minutes of the movie starting, I was hooked. Something happens when a movie unfolds in ""real-time"" and in such close proximity - you become a part of it. You're no longer watching two soldiers delivering a message during a war. You are the third soldier, a silent partner on a dangerous mission. There isn't that detached feeling of an observer, your emotions are heightened because you're experiencing it with them - the fear, the anxiety, the sadness, the determination. I will say this again and again - movies aren't just meant to be watched, they're meant to be felt and 1917 does this brilliantly.There is so much to like about the movie - the actors, the music, the story, the sheer artistry of it all - but it's the emotional core that gives it such a high place in my heart and my rating scale. This is more than just a war film - this is a story of humanity, determination, loyalty, and friendship. It's a harsh but necessary reminder of the cost of war, a hope that we can be better than we were before. It's a testament to the bond between a grandson and grandfather. It is a truly wonderful piece of art, the kind of movie that awards are made for. The stunning package is just the pretty ribbon attached to the medal."
1917,12 January 2020,7/10,"I was a little apprehensive going to watch this film after watching the trailer and knowing who the director was (I wasn't the biggest fan of the recent James bond film spectre).I was preparing myself for an overly dramatic and glorified war movie which in parts it was, but I must admit I thought they did a good Job! I liked how the movie was shot, it really felt as if I was accompanying the protagonists of the movie step by step. It conveyed a very intermate expirience between the protagonists and the viewer coupled with some thrilling and nailbiting cinematics causing me to pull off some grimising facial expressions throughout. I wasn't completely convinced with the acting, there's a particular scene involving Dean-Charles Chapman (lance cpl. Blake) that I wasn't too impressed with but maybe that's just me. I felt asif I was more emersed into George Mackey's character (lance cpl. Schoefeild) perhaps unfairly I found myself comparing their acting performances to Joaquin Phoenix's Joker as that was the last film I watched in the cinema xD they're two completely different films mind!Overall - If you don't mind abit of an overly dramatic and glorified war movie and enjoy an intense thrilling cinematic expirience it'll be worth your while getting a cinema ticket! It's gripping from start to finish with some great shots. I still rate Hurt locker a better war movie but it's in there with the likes of Fury, black hawk down and saving private Ryan."
1917,11 January 2020,9/10,"Absolutely brilliant camera work coupled together with a story to remember. Acting was top notch, the movie totally immersed and captivated me. I felt like I was part of the journey myself. The authenticity of the scenes, uniforms and soldiers gears was brilliant to watch and realism created by the environment felt very realistic up to a point of even being shocking. An absolute must watch."
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,Great cinematography and acting. Amazing suspence. On the edge of my seat the whole movie. A war.movie unlike any other war movie.
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"Serious gritty and immersive, remind me a bit how Kubrick would do a movie.
One of the best films i have ever seen, just watch it and see for yourself."
1917,11 February 2020,10/10,"What a absolute beautiful take on a movie. Had me thrilled and excited through every minute! The way Sam Mendes has made this movie is pure genius, the actors being truthfully to their roles and so many amazing shots! This is an experience everybody should witness, i was never bored and never wanted to leave the cinema. This movie is such a joy to watch and really takes you on a journey you'll never forget.Gonna remember this for the rest of my life as a masterpiece of beautiful cinematography! I'm thankful to Mendes for creating this movie and let it tell a important story in It's own way. Absolute beauty!"
1917,24 January 2020,1/10,"Allow me to rewrite this entire nonsensical movie to what would have really happened:
General hands a pilot a message and tells him to drop it a couple hundred yards away.
Roll the credits.
Oscar for the shortest movie in history.
Thank you."
1917,29 January 2020,2/10,"My rate for story is 3
for sence 8
and other 6
to my openion this is not great film"
1917,1 February 2020,8/10,Feels like playing a fps game. Many short special appearances
1917,2 February 2020,4/10,"Sam Mendes, so disappointing and unexpected. Good image but so badly done facts wise. Night becoming day like pressing a fading switch, a dead that became grey just after 2 minutes, a guy being shot being shot right after he left a entire battalion like 3 minutes ago who didn't came to support...a fail!"
1917,28 February 2020,10/10,Something that everyone needs to see. Probably the only way to avoid all this pain and sadness the war can cause. One of the best and heart touching movies ever.
1917,24 January 2020,6/10,"A quick search of top rated titles have only two movies rating over 9. Why are there are SO MANY user ratings at 9.5 or 10 for 1917? Is this movie really almost perfect? Far from it. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film making immensely, however it was the one shot idea that made the movie ultimately unsatisfying. Great idea, but overplayed to the detriment of the pacing and story. I got bored several times due to having to follow the actors constantly. Followed by brain mashing cliche after forced plot after totally improbable scenario that seemed crammed in to allow the one shot feel of the story to flow.Nothing wrong with the idea, but not the entire movie. There are many parts to the story that worked well using this style, however Children Of Men did it better because they chose where to have the one take scenes for maximum impact.After 1917 I felt a bit like I had drunk too many beers, I felt good for a while, but the goodness didn't last for the whole experience. I should have known when to stop, Sam Mendes didn't."
1917,15 February 2020,10/10,"Have you ever watched one of those ridiculous superhero movies where time after time after time the hero escapes death even though you know when the real world they would have surely been dead? That's what they have created with this movie. You have to suspend reality over and over again during the course of watching it if you're going to enjoy it. O
ther low reviews here detail the many unbelievable coincidences and cliches that occur. I won't detail them again but will just say that those reviews hit the nail on the head. When I go to see a serious movie, I don't want to be saying over and over again, ""give me a break!"""
1917,12 November 2021,10/10,This is such an amazing movie! I you like war movies like I do this is a must see!It tells an amazing story of two young men who fought against the Germans in World War II.
1917,11 April 2020,4/10,"After about 10 minutes of watching this movie you think that you'll see a wonderful WW 1 epic and frankly you we'll watch an epic movie but in just how it was filmed.
The acting is mediocre and the story is very bad, very unrealistic and unbelievably childish.
The Screenplay is as bad as the story is...It's like a 10-year-old wrote this story where only one hero can travel all the way to the top with only luck and the bad shooting of his enemies...
The movie is also very boring after about 40 mins the bad story just stops and repeats the nonsense that happened earlier and completing the series of miracles that is truly unbelievable.
Simply the movie was horrible and wasted 2 hours of my life looking at a movie very will filmed but very bad written."
1917,30 December 2019,3/10,"This plot literally made no sense at all.
Why were these two soldiers (and only them) chosen for such an important mission?
If it was so imperative to get this message to the troops - why not seed it by plane?
The message could have reached the troops within an hour instead of two days.
If the messenger is on such an important, life saving mission - they why does
he take on snipers and other enemy soldiers he encounters?
I was anticipating much more.... oh well.
I'm glad I didn't waste money at the theatre for this."
1917,7 February 2020,7/10,"My Great Uncle, Rifleman William Phillips R5080, was a member of the same Battalion as Sam Mendes's grandfather, to whom the film is dedicated, the 1st Battalion, the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Unlike Sam's grandfather, William was killed in action and did not survive to tell his stories or have a family. This was 17 February 1917, about 2 months before the film is set, and he was buried in a shell hole where, so far as we know, he remains today. He was one of the 73000 who remain unidentified. However, to commemorate the centenary of William's death, I travelled to the Somme, to Miraumont where William was killed. Before doing so I extensively researched the King's Royal Rifle Corps. I read the Battalion War diary and countless books on the action in which my great uncle was killed. While I do not wish to challenge any of the stories on which this film is based, I do have a couple of observations. The action in which William was killed was described as the worst going for infantry in the whole Somme campaign. This may not have applied in April, but the few photographs that exist show a terrain far worse than the film describes. The mud was knee deep and completely littered with line after line of barbed wire and layered trenches. By comparison 1917, while muddy up to a point, gives the impression of a country walk. I do not understand why what is obviously a dry dock was used to play the part of a river, nor can I find white water rapids anywhere in Northern France, still less a large waterfall. I'm afraid that for me this detracts from the authenticity of the film. As a piece of theatre it is a good film, but as a tribute to the actual conditions that soldiers faced, it is an understatement."
1917,17 January 2020,5/10,Over rated hyped . seen far better ww1 movies. gallipoli for one far outshines . 100.000 000 budget jeez. poor.
1917,12 January 2020,5/10,"Feels like I just watched a GO PRO footage of WW1 , low level acting couldn't connect with characters plus poor dialogue, stick to bond movies . The only emotion this movie can evoke is fatigue. There is a reason people dont film a movie in one cut ,watching this you will realise . To round this film up .... it's a over hyped art house con movie !"
1917,1 January 2020,10/10,"After viewing the trailer for this film I thought it would be nothing special. I thought this movie would be mediocre and dull. However, this movie has completely blown my expectations away. Shortly after the film begins, you are sucked in and feel the urgency that the film is trying to display to the viewer. You are on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. A true masterpiece and definitely one, if not the best, movie of 2019, and it is definitely one of the greatest films about war ever created."
1917,31 January 2020,2/10,"The story, acting, action is good but this one thing about movie. from the start till the end in one shot it is really boring, annoying, making u sick and stressed. I know it is very very hard work and the best credit goes to the makers of this movie but for audience this type of shooting is really annoying well at least for me it is."
1917,14 August 2020,3/10,"What a shocker ... one of the most implausible, laughable attempts at a war movie I've seen.
Compare this to Saving Private Ryan, you can't.
This is so very badly produced and acted."
1917,16 May 2020,6/10,"I had high hopes for this film. I love war films of this genre. From a visual and cinematography perspective, this film is really impressive. The colours and expansive landscapes are spellbinding and the trench scenes are particularly gripping and immersive. Clearly a lot of work went into this film to make it as realistic as possible and make you feel like you really were there watching live.However, I think the big challenge for this film is that the third person view / one shot principle was followed to the extreme and honestly I felt I was watching a third person shooter console game.For example, there is a scene where Schofield and Blake reach the outskirts of a farm with an orchard and outbuildings. The combination of the atmospheric music and camera angle as they walk through the broken wall and survey the farm buildings in the hollow of the valley below looks like a cut scene from Call of Duty.Maybe this was the intended effect by the Director but for me, it seemed hyper-real - almost unbelievable. After 2 hours of this, the novelty had well and truly worn off and I was pretty bored with the whole thing. There were really disctinct 'levels' to the film / game and travelling sections inbetween the levels which made it all the more feel like a game being completed.Finally the characterisation of the soldiers was in my opinion quite thin, not much in the way of a backstory or insight into their personal lives other than then odd conversation about life back home with little in the way of detail. Again, this might have been deliberate but I wasn't really rooting for the main characters to succeed.Oh and two or three pretty pointless cameos to try and jazz the whole thing up couldn't really save a dreary and uninspiring plot and a rather unsatisfying experience.So overall, nice visuals and will while away a couple of hours but nothing for me to make this film very memorable."
1917,2 April 2020,9/10,British Saving Private Ryan. Plethora of talented actors.
1917,30 March 2020,2/10,I was expecting much more! I can't believe this movie is everywhere! there's nothing special in the movie!
1917,8 April 2020,4/10,"Yes, the movie is shot well and picturesque - but it all goes downhill fasta rat drags something into a tripwire - instead of shooting the rat, they yell.....
then you get to the destroyed bridge.....he walks along the top of the bridge and the ""sniper"" has at least 3 shots and misses on all of them, but he manages to ""pop"" out of cover and wound the sniper
then he walks into a town and happily stands silhout
he runs through the same town and again the Germans need to check their sight alignments, as they continually miss him from 10 metresthis movie is shot well and is a visual masterpiece, but the story is terrible......"
1917,18 February 2020,10/10,Beautiful film. Everything was so... real. And the 'one take' was brilliant.
1917,30 June 2020,1/10,When people said it's the best war movie since saving private Ryan I was excited. But it never got going for me just felt flat the whole movie. Felt like I wasted my money and time.
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,A phenomenal movie! Absolutely loved it! You certainly feel every second as the director wanted.
1917,31 March 2020,10/10,"Surreal, beautiful, moving, tense masterpiece. can't say nothing more. just watch it and don't listen to critics."
1917,13 February 2020,9/10,Long war time not stop!! And very hard see! Very never forget that
1917,24 February 2020,5/10,Unlikable characters with aimless dignity that was not sold by it's story or actors.
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"The movie is shot amazingly, the camera work is so great that you become speechless. You feel like the movie has been shot in one take. The way the story has been told and portrayed the WWI battle field is amazing. Hats off to Sam Mendes for this brilliant piece of work."
1917,27 March 2021,10/10,Just saw it. I miss words. And I guess this sums it up best.
1917,2 May 2020,1/10,I think this movie is highly overrated. I hoped for some action.
1917,18 April 2020,9/10,"Sam mendes , thank you for this. Eternally grateful for this creation of yours. And sir, Roger Deakins, you are magnificent 😭👏👏"
1917,23 May 2020,9/10,"A new movie about World War I, haven't you had enough of these movies yet?
The two great wars (as they are called in most historical literature) were the most prominent events of the twentieth century ever, and perhaps the most prominent events in the history of mankind. It is said that one of the most important characteristics of human blood is that it is difficult to get rid of it completely. These two wars have claimed the lives of more than 100 million people. It is no wonder that they are engraved in human memory, with all this blood that does not disappear.
For all this cinema does not stop quoting stories from these two wars, but in reality if we look at the matter more broadly, we will find that all the arts are nothing but recycling of the human story, including with it even to the first sin that was the reason for the existence of man on these Earth. All human stories throughout human history, from the pharaohs' papyri, their excavations, and their inscriptions on the temples dating back thousands of years, through Greek mythology and its various myths, and ending with cinema that did not witness its birth until a century and a half ago, all revolve around the human being and recycle his first story that does not Stop repeating, so why are we asking the cinema to stop returning to the two wars?
In British director Sam Mendes' movie (1917), and as the promotional trailer tells us, we are following the story of two soldiers assigned to an urgent mission to save 1,600 soldiers from the trap set by the Germans. For two hours, when the story of the film does not depart from this narrow framework, we continue this journey in an almost realistic experience. So what might the new movie Mendes bring? In other words, how did Mendes recycle the story of World War I?
Escape to the truth
The movie is truth 24 times a second, and every cut is a lie.
French director Jean-Luc Godard
If we are going to talk about repeating the stories, there is nothing wrong with repeating the famous story of the movie ""The Train Arrived at LaSoute Station"" by the Lumiere brothers, which was shown in 1896. The fans, who were watching this technical miracle for the first time in history, thought that a train was moving towards them and on And about to break into the big screen, the audience panicked and won their seats.
This story is always cited in the talk about cinema between fiction and reality. With the development of viewing experience, and the development of cinematographic techniques by extension, the viewer became more aware, but he did not answer an answer to the question of truth and fiction.
In the 1917 movie, director Sam Mendes chose to narrate the film - which takes place over one day - continuously as if it were one shot and if it was not already, as the scenes were designed so that all the montage pieces are not noticeable, which is the method that preceded It was previously presented in a number of experiments, most notably the movie ""The Robe"" by the great director Alfred Hitchcock, and ""Birdman"" by the Mexican director Alejandro Enrieto.
Here in 1917, Mendes aspired to present time in his closest realism, in order to intensify the public's experience of the story, heroes are racing against time in order to complete their mission and save a large number of soldiers from meeting their deaths free of charge, and through this method the tension that this massive task creates It is the viewer's responsibility that belongs to the second decade of the twenty-first century, and a whole century separates it from these events.
As time progresses, the films acquire the adjective ""classic"", and a new classification called ""the new classic"" appears, which are works that, even if they are closer to their predecessors, but they are old enough to launch the adjective of the classic, and from this standpoint, films such as: (The Great Escape) may be 1963), Patton 1970 classic films, and other films such as Saving Private Ryan 1998 and The Thin Red Line 1998, as each generation has its own classics. Extending the streak straight, modern films like 1917 are potential classics for the newest generation of viewers.
This newer generation does not see just another story of world war, but watch it in the vocabulary of its time, and its mechanisms and modern techniques, and re-live a story that he does not belong historically, but he can identify with it humanly, which brings us back to the question of truth and imagination, and to the saying of the great French director Jean Luke Godard, in which montage pieces are like lying.
When the viewer in a dark hall follows a number of actors re-simulating a fictional or realistic story, he realizes that what he is seeing is not the truth, and that this actor who was killed on the screen did not really die in reality, but at the same time he experiences completely real feelings.
This meticulous selection of montage style deepened the reality of the viewing experience, and made it easy for the viewer to identify with the story's heroes, their sense of time and its centrality, whether at the level of the drama or the level of narration that increases the dose of excitement and suspense awaiting the unexpected that can be expected. But at the same time, he brought the movie closer to Hitchhiker's style, with more focus on action than drama.
Although the camera that follows the heroes throughout the movie does not skimp on the viewer with many pictures that convey the true face of this war, the suffering of the soldiers who are fighting death at every moment, and sheds little light on the position of the military leaders in their dealings with thousands of lives, but all of that It comes on the sidelines of the main line, which focuses mainly on the excitement-wrapped mission that attracts viewers to the edge of their seats for two hours, and they only occupy one question: Will the two soldiers succeed in saving an entire battalion from death?
Between commercial and technical"
1917,15 June 2020,2/10,"According to the ratings, 1917 is on one level with Apocalypse Now and Paths of Glory...better than Das Boot and All Quiet on the Western Front? Seriously?
This world is doomed."
1917,31 January 2020,3/10,"Because I don't know what the heck ""being shot in one shot"" means, I merely focused on the story.
From the get-go I found it hard to believe two soldiers would be sent on a mission like this.
The guy gets his hand cut in barbed wire because he isn't wearing gloves. Really? No gloves? Then, it's filthy but never gets an infection. And appears to heal real fast. I thought he would get an infection for sure.
Then, the plane crashes into the barn, they run I. The direction the plane is going and then, rescues an enemy pilot from certain death. Then. One guy turns his back while the other guys gets stabbed. Thanks buddy. Why they didn't just shoot him is beyond me.
The night in the burning village, he grabs a soldier, covers his mouth and then lets his hand down? Really. Like this was one of those ""good"" Germans?
But the real
Kicker is when he jumps in the river, floats over a waterfall, grabs a log and floats to the shoreline, dripping wet. Yet later, when he finds the officer, the note was completely dry, as was he. Then it ends with him sitting under a tree and pulling out photos that are also I damaged. Wow. Some war.
They did a good job with the trenches and ""no-man's land"". I have a hard time believing the English were singing ""Poor Wayfaring Stranger"" as it was a spiritual. The depiction of the death and destruction was reasonable. The overall story was unbelievable, though.
Sorry Sam. Too many flaws to call this one ""great""."
1917,13 March 2020,5/10,"So grave is the subject matter, and so infuriating the execution, I am forced to lament the exceedingly poor choices made by the director and the scriptwriter of this otherwise epic production.
Unbearably cringe-worthy and trite dialogue is the mainstay of this film.
Given the gravity of the historical subject and the truly visceral and real experience that should accompany any review thereof, I am very saddened by the pathetic treatment of the narrative evinced by the blithe, uninspiring and predictable dialogue. For goodness sake! If you're going to go to the expense and hard work of such a production, at least employ an exemplary writer and director!"
1917,24 January 2020,3/10,"Clearly, putting actors through war just so they'll be able to portray soldiers in battle believably is nothing a sane person would consider. But that doesn't mean that doing what 1917 does is a good idea: having soy boys portray men of arms. The performance of the main actors makes it just too painfully obvious that, growing up, they were never yelled at, slapped, punched and never had to endure any other significant amount of physical discomfort, i.e. never went hungry, never froze and, presumably, never had to walk more than a few bus stops. Being unable to fathom/understand even low-level intensity of violence and suffering, they seem bizarrely out of place in a WWI-setting. And that, in turn, makes for something worse than just a boring and non-immersive movie: a mockery of the unimaginable pain and sacrifice their grandfathers went through in order to keep Europe free."
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,A masterpiece with simple straight forward writing but an immersive story!
1917,6 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is hands down one of the best war movies I have ever seen.
The cinematography is so extremely well made, and the acting of the protagonists is spot on. Deserves an Oscar. Very memorable piece of art."
1917,9 February 2020,7/10,"1917 is ultimately a frustrating experience, more than anything, given the expectations and hype around the film, and talk of Oscars. Hype in which the film does not live up to. 1917, is a film that is, in my opinion, perfect for those who are easily impressed, allow me to explain.I will start with the positives, 1917 is a beautifully and audaciously shot film. It is split into two long, unbroken shots, a commendable feat. This is to give the audience a perspective of the horrors and chaos that comes with war and to give the audience a sense of exhaustion throughout the film, the latter, I believe is achieved. The former? I'll get to that.The cinematography is at times stunning. It has one of my favourite shots of any movie around the midway mark of the film and an action sequence in the finale that will win many viewers over. The soundtrack is also a positive and helps to build tension, as well as it possibly can.The problem with all of this is, while the movie looks beautiful, it has very little substance to back it all up. Yes, the film is shot in two parts and that is meant to portray what war is really like, but that all counts for nothing when the movie is in essence, a poor portrayal of war. This is, by all accounts, a sterilised, Hollywood version of war, where the only emotion that truly shines through is courage.The acting, while solid, does nothing to help. Neither Dean-Charles Chapman nor George MacKay deserve awards for their respective performances because neither delivered on what they set out to achieve in their portrayal of the main characters. MacKay was the stand out of the two but fell short in many of his pay off moments. Whether the blame rests solely with them or is shared with the director is a discussion that could be had.The most troubling aspect of this film is, without a doubt, it's attempt to explore it's themes. As already discussed, the attempt to portray the horrors of war, missed its mark, but many other themes, such as the futility of bravery, hopelessness and what comes after war, were fumbled through almost comically and the opportunity to give any message as a takeaway, was missed each and every time.For these reason I say that 1917 is a film perfect For those easily impressed, It looks stunning and has all the bells and whistles, but lacks any substance. I likened the experience to a roller coaster, lots of fun and definitely fast paced but ultimately there is nothing to take from it because if you've been on one roller coaster, you've been on them all. 68/100"
1917,7 February 2020,1/10,"This grandpa is a terrible liar, the story sucks and is so unrealistic!"
1917,13 January 2020,8/10,It was the best directing I have ever seen in years.but the story was poor and predictable.It worth a watch just for the visual feast.
1917,3 May 2020,7/10,"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece
Very authentic and true to the period"
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"It seems like every war movie in the last 20 years has been described as the ""best war movie since Saving Private Ryan."" This one really is. Few movies have given me such a visceral reaction to what I'm watching. 1917 grips the heart and mind and doesn't stop. An absolutely incredible film."
1917,4 February 2020,9/10,Bests film in last 5 years. Fantastic camera and so emotional
1917,28 March 2020,5/10,"Overrated! That's it, that my review! Cliche, poor performance, worse screenplay, long boring..."
1917,14 February 2020,9/10,"Before watching this movie I've heard plenty of people complaining that it was boring or that nothing actually happens. Nothing falser, the film is not only a good story of war, but also a lore of survival and a cinematography wonder. The idea of shooting the film in a continuous frame made the watchers feel more like they were right besides the soldiers on their journey through fire and death. Truth be told, there were couple of moments where the film seemed a little dragged, but in the end, for those who have a clue about WWI, that's how the entire war actually felt like: static and dragged. The way they managed to recreate the atmosphere of those times could have competed with a documentary in certain ways.
Therefore, 1917 is, in my opinion a story of survival, somehow similar to what Nolan attempted with Dunkirk, only better, grace to the brilliant idea of taking the watcher from his seat, right in the middle of WWI, through the continuous shot technique."
1917,17 January 2020,8/10,"Hey all you numn**ts, this was not supposed to be a run of the mill action war movie. If thats what you were looking for, then rent Saving Private Ryan. Was it the best movie I have ever seen? No. Does it deserve Best picture? I don't think so, But different stokes, for different folks. I liked it. All of you who say it was boring, I guess there were not enough scenes with people getting their heads blown off .I liked the camera work and the natural progression of the story. Will I watch it again? Maybe, maybe not. I got an idea, for your next movie watch Sorority House Massacre"
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"It is incredibly amazing how 1917 takes you on a journey by just following the two main characters on their objective in one take. 1917 is a must-see. It is a painful realistic and emotional movie, Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins did it again. Hands down."
1917,29 January 2020,9/10,"I read more reviews below and some of the negative stories about a thin script. I get that some plots are
maybe a bit easy but it's also a movie. A great movie which tells a 'small' story in the 'great war.'
I could see the plane coming from a mile away..Here is my own interpretation of that time.Guns weren't as good as in WW II, so I believe that people missed more often. I also believe that the soldiers back than weren't trained as good as you see in other war movies from the 2nd war etc.. they were young boys who had to go to war. That considering I think it's an very realistic and beautiful movie about what soldiers had to endure during that war."
1917,13 September 2020,9/10,"Wow wow wow...
Such a amazing story and good acting
Great war story"
1917,23 February 2020,10/10,"Unbelievable that it did not win best pictureI just left the movie theater and yet I still feel like I am with the two main characters. Sam Mendes as director did an incredible feat with his ""one shot"" film technique. I have seen Parasite and I very much appreciated the movie and was not upset it when it won best picture but, at that time I had not yet seen 1917. 1917 definitely should've won best picture and I feel sad for everyone involved in that film as it was monumental. If you have not seen it go now, go right now!"
1917,29 December 2020,9/10,Loved this film! Its hard not to become immersed in the story straight away due to the style of cinematic camera shooting..they did a fantastic job!
1917,2 February 2020,9/10,A really awsome detail and story that bring a lot to the movie
1917,29 January 2020,1/10,"The story is total boring, the movie is slow, this movie is a huge disappointment from Sam Mendez, totally overrated, don't waste your time with it."
1917,17 January 2020,10/10,"Speechless is how I would describe my feelings when this film ended. To watch this film in all its glory on IMAX is the only way to fully appreciate it. The sets are amazing, the visual effects, the greatest I've seen yet and yet I was unable to tell the difference between what was real and what was CGI. All who were involved in this masterpiece of cinematography should be very proud of what they have produced and they will surely be fully honoured at the next Academy Awards.I hope Sam Mendes continues to make more films of this historical significance in the future. We need to be reminded that war is hell and should be avoided at all costs."
1917,15 January 2020,6/10,"Technically beautiful! Well filmed, great stage, great actor but huuuuge lack of a story. Midway through it becomes even a bit boring.
I just felt like it was more or less the Private Ryan's story with less energy and emotions.
Good entertainment but not the movie of the year"
1917,18 March 2020,4/10,"Loved the photography, and the equipment and uniforms were mostly correct in their detail.However, the plot is explained by Colin Firth, that the British reconnaisance aeroplanes have produced 'aerials', showing an unprecedented build-up of German forces, and that if the Devons proceed in their attack, they will walk into a trap, therefore, the two designated soldiers must deliver the message before it's too late.I couldn't help think, if they have the evidence in the form of aerial photographs, and they plainly already know the location of their own attacking forced, why on earth can't they drop messages to the Devons, via the same Royal Flying Corps aeroplanes, directly to the Devons? That thought was immediately reinforced in the scene where British aircraft shot down the German in front of our two central messengers.I saw my point is listed as a frequently asked question. The response from someone was that aircraft were a relatively new thing at the time, and quite sparse!Oh well..."
1917,2 May 2021,10/10,"I'm pretty embarrassed and a little ashamed to admit it, but other than Lone Survivor and the scenes in Forrest Gump, I have never watched a war film. My husband convinced me to watch 1917, and I was absolutely overwhelmed. It was stunning! What an incredible film. The acting was sensational, the cinematography outstanding. I really can't speak highly enough of this film!"
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,This film pulls you in and doesn't let go until the very end. Magical
1917,7 June 2020,2/10,"Laughably, howlingly unrealistic....for a soldier on an urgent mission, there are a lot of long...long....drawn out dramatic sequences and highly improbable events that seem totally disconnected from the mission and motivation of the lead characters and unrealistic in the middle of a brutal trench war."
1917,8 January 2020,6/10,"Personally I see NO reason it was ashyped as it was abd found it quite boring. Not climactic events, very few mediocre action scenes and honestly poorly written. Nothing about it was gripping nor had me on the edge of my seat in the slightest. I don't expect full action and killing all the time in a war movie to enjoy it but this was just flat-out very boring."
1917,21 September 2020,9/10,"Loved everything about it , not exaggerated but strong enough presence to capture you completely.
I wasn't expected much but very good movie & the cinematography was on point!!"
1917,17 January 2021,10/10,This movie is awesome! Intense from beginning to the end. Lots of action and heart!
1917,13 January 2020,10/10,"If you are considering going to see this movie in the cinema, do it. This film will no doubt be a classic and is in the same league, if not better, than 'Saving Private Ryan'. The one-shot cinematography of this movie allows the viewer to be fully engaged and contains a rollercoaster of emotions until the very end."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,Heart pounding grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. Heartfelt moment of true compassion and a will to carry on.
1917,10 April 2020,10/10,Great movie to seejxigjgxigxohcohcoh o clock gkxhcbIfjdjfkvkv
1917,26 January 2020,2/10,"'1917' is the worst war movie ever
 new production's strengths are vitiated by a wrongheaded conception of cinematic time."
1917,11 January 2020,10/10,"1917. Breathtaking, raw and inspirational. Leaving you speechless and shook to your core, you will not find a better war film. Watch this, buy this and learn from it."
1917,23 January 2020,3/10,Waste of my time and money. Good movie if you suffer from insomnia.
1917,31 March 2020,1/10,The story is so simple. The director strach the story to 2 hours. I think Hollywood just dont understand the actual meaning of movie making. And i realy don't understand the how this movie win golden globe..
1917,29 March 2020,9/10,"Absolutely Mind blowing On what this movie sets for It,I was Speechless walking out of this movie,So If you don't have anything to do go See this Movie!"
1917,28 June 2021,10/10,"WOW! This movie is completely and utterly beautiful! The cinematography, score, and acting of this movie are flawless. This movie made me tear up twice, which is rare for me. The long takes of this movie are exquisite, and the hidden cuts in between those long takes might be even more beautiful. If you gave $1 million dollars to find all the hidden cuts in this movie, I couldn't do it. They are executed so beautifully and seamlessly it's hard to tell that they are even happening unless you are looking for them. And even then, I still struggle to know where many of the hidden cuts are. Also, if the hidden cuts and long takes are not something that you appreciate like I do, that's ok. The movie is still incredibly immersive! I truly feel like you are with the characters on their journeys. Conclusion, this is a beautiful movie and has become one of my favorite movies ever and my favorite war movie ever."
1917,27 February 2020,6/10,This movie make me boring especially after half duration
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,"Once in a while a movie comes along that moves me to my core. One that keeps running in my head over and over. 1917 has had that effect on me!!! Stunning cinematography, with very very long shots beautifully crafted. I realized that I was holding my breath a couple of times when watching the movie and everybody in the audience was extremely mesmerized and quite, just absorbing every bit of this work of art!!! I can already hear the words... and the Oscar of Best Motion Picture goes to 1917!!!! Very well done!!!!"
1917,2 April 2020,5/10,"I was starving to watch this movie after I watched some scenes from filming and location preparations. Well, those are the only points (as well as sound) which at the beginning push you watch the movie,
but there is nothing more than a running man and a bunch of naive Germans whose shots never hit a tired soldier!!😂😂 (such as Bollywood movies🤣🤣🤣) 🤦🏻🤦🏻If anyone wish to watch 1917, well, it's up to you but watching Saving Private Ryan (1998) for a 2nd or 3rd time is highly recommended.To sum up, I never enlist this film as a must-be one (save your time😁)
Thanks"
1917,15 February 2020,6/10,Had very high expectations of the movie but lost interest very quickly. I have to agree with the content other reviewers place here who are also not blown away as others apparently are. Bad plot and story line.
1917,25 January 2020,9/10,"This movie was so beautifully shot and directed. One of the cinematic experiences of a lifetime and full of mesmerizing beauty. Roger Deakins has once again cemented himself as one of the greatest cinematographers of all time. Thomas Newman's profound score elevates every situation into a frenzy of abominable melancholy. Every moment of this film was intense and nail biting, the world building details were insane and they made the setting feel all the more realistic.
A must see in the theaters."
1917,27 March 2020,3/10,The sounds the lighting and and the camera work is awsome the action is as well. But the way it jumps from walking to running to riding to daylight to dark is dumb. They walked a mile and he was alone then maybe a 1/2 mile he road and his first destination to the town was 9 miles which he never did. Now you can't say movie magic cause they used a type of filming were there are not stops or cut aways. I love war movies this one was a dude for story or realistic. But a good dumb action movie
1917,13 January 2020,,"This film reminded me of the movie ""Dunkirk"" . Very long, wanted to love it but I could have waited and watched it at home."
1917,16 January 2020,9/10,"A enjoyable WW1 story set in the trenches and no mans land.
Visually the film looks great with a lot of detail going into making the scenes look authentic and realistic. The camera work is impressive through these settings.
Although set in the trenches,I wouldn't say this is a high intensity action film. There are periods of action, but not as intense as I've seen in other war films.
It does have a dejavu of Saving Private Ryan... but this doesn't detract from what is an excellent film."
1917,15 January 2020,9/10,"Definitely one to watch in the cinema. I didn't expect more than another War horse (which i didn't like) but it was great. Uses tricks used in Gravity to make a rollercoaster of survival and was clevery sewn together to make one long shot. I'm not entirely sure why, but it does create a good effect and a feeling of being in the action. Tastefully done with respect for the dead, several of the audience were clearly horrified and moved. A few bits were overly sentimental, over explained and unnecessary so only gets 9 stars. Good 'cameos'Features detailed horrific dead bodies, adult film"
1917,3 February 2020,10/10,Just watched 1917 fantastic film but with very mixed views in my own opinion. I can't say to much because some people haven't yet watched it. I enjoyed the whole aspect of it and would recommend people to watch it.
1917,21 March 2020,9/10,This is the best oscar movie in my mind this year.
1917,24 January 2020,4/10,"So they send two men over a hot LZ to warn the other company of a nazi retreat (trap). The planes did recon and reported it.
Why didn't the plane drop them a note... come on man... that is just a start..."
1917,8 March 2021,8/10,"I told my friend the movie looks like Balde runner a lot on the subject of camerawork, and it turns out the cameraman is the same one. There were some insane shots where I couldn't belive it really was shot without any cuts, I couldn't wrap my head around it. It must'vebeen an insane amount of work to make it look like that. I suppose they used cranes and car, maybe they used rails and removed them is post-production,anyway, it was perfect and the movie absoulety blew my mind. I really liked that the frame never left the human point of view, we were there with him the whole time. Perfect photography.
I had some problems tho, for example the music was really really out of place sometimes, like when he got to the city ruins, for some reason there was this sci-fi-ish space adventure like composed music, it really didn't fit, and when he left the french woman and was hiding from the germans a tribe-like drum music was playing like in a jungle adventure movie, it was properly annoyingfor me. Even when it wasn't out of place it was okay at best. The movie had a beautiful framing with him laying under the tree both in the beginning and at the end, shows how much can happen in a couple of hours in wartime. I had several problems with the flow of time tho.The general told him it takes 6 hours to get there, but since we saw it real-time because of the one-shot style of the movie, it made it a bit confusing to follow how much time have passed. One example, when he was with the french lady, we hear the bells, telling us it'smidnight, couple of minutes later the woman tells him it's getting dawn, several minutes later it's already day-light when he jumps in the water. It also made distances look really small, like walking for 2 minutes takes you to miles further. That'salso my main problem with the movie.
I had a huge problem with the death of his mate. So, a german soldier crashes and for some reason they want to help him because the english were so good at even wartime, and he brings him water, and the cruel heartless german soldier stabs his mate. Why would they want to help him in the first place? Makes no sense, it's what every hollywood war movie does, too one-sided and uncalled for.This made the death of his mate weightless for me even tho it was such a beatiful scene, would've been really heartfelt if it wasn't for a cheap trick. I loved the acting and how realistic everything isfrom the sound of weapons to the crash of the plane. No unnecesarry explosions anywhere. Really good film alltogether, I liked it a lot. Probably a lot more things will come to my mind, but these are my thoughts on it right after seeing it."
1917,23 May 2020,1/10,Inconsistent. A rip-off of Gallipoli and Saving Private Ryan.
1917,17 March 2021,1/10,I really don't know what to say... I've never seen a war/dramamovie that was soooo boring. Wasted 2 hours of my life for this stupid movie.
1917,9 January 2020,1/10,"1917. Masterpiece? Ridiculous war film in the trend of feelgood brexit movies like Dunkerque was one. With of course the brave Tommie and the eternally bath Krauts. Much better: paths of glory, Johnny got his gun."
1917,1 April 2020,10/10,Didn't think they made movies like this any longer.
1917,16 January 2020,3/10,"This movie is very overestimated. Its loud is annoying.
Make a good war movie, not a soft muddy it."
1917,17 January 2020,9/10,"Not many films leave a lasting impression like this. Roger Deakins' pioneering cinematography made it an awesome film, but this certainly was not the prize of the show. This enhanced the great story that Mendes successfully portrayed. It captured the grit of what I would imagine war in the trenches to have been like. If you want 2 hours of backside clenching, give it a watch."
1917,8 February 2020,,"Intense, emotional, and seat-gripping. Beautifully done!"
1917,26 January 2020,6/10,Regardless of all the good reviews that the film took. i have been waiting for better story :(
1917,9 October 2021,2/10,Doesn't eat or shave for days but has the energy to run the equivalent of several marathons without any facial hair growth. Soldiers coming from trenches without a spec of mud. Shame on you Mendez.
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,"This movie was gripping, terrifying and so real that I spent much of it in tears, hoping for the end to come. To have a physical reaction like that to a film...I cannot describe how it deeply effected me. As a mother of two young adult men, to think this could have happened to my child...George was AMAZING in his role. I found myself mesmerised by his strength and determination against unbelievable odds. It was like watching my own son endure the unimaginable. I strongly recommend this film. As important to see as Schindler's List, a haunting reminder of what could happen again if we do not learn from the past. I would like to see 1917 again however I'm not sure I'm up for the emotional experience. Interesting...I have a CHOICE to expose myself again. We, however, will not if careless, impulsive and self-centered decisions continue to be made by our leaders. God help us all if that day should come again."
1917,13 February 2020,10/10,This is the first 10/10 in 2020. I think i'll watch it again and again. A simple story but with a great method of storytelling through cinematoghraphy philosophy.
1917,18 January 2020,8/10,"Very Beautifully Made Peace Of Drama, The Scenes Are Very Well Dressed And The Actors Depict A Very Well Told Story However Some Scenes Do Drag Out A Lot For No Apparent Reasoning To The Stories Being Told. The Writing Is Super With Loads Of Thought Provoking Moments That For Many Leaves Them Wanting More, The Direction Is also Spot On And The Use Of Single Shot Is In My Opinion Perfectly Executed To Tell This Story.. Very Well Done"
1917,27 March 2020,5/10,This movie has nothing special. It is just like any other movie where the actor has to struggle a lot to reach his destination. Nothing else. I couldn't understand why it's rating was 8.5
1917,18 January 2020,10/10,That film is vor me just a wish come true. The camera moves are so nice and well done. The sound is so realistic and great... It is just a very good movie...
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"One of the best pieces of cinema I've ever seen.
A visceral, emotional and impactful depiction of WW1. It finds the perfect balance between a moving story and depicting the harsh realities of trench warfare.
I loved how the story is revolves around the idea of stopping a battle rather than showing war fare itself.
The cinematography is a feat in cinema history.
The direction is sure to win Mendes his 2nd academy award.
The production design is perfect.
The acting is glorious.
Watch this movie!! (In a cinema, preferably imax)"
1917,9 April 2020,10/10,"🙏🙏👏👏 1917 is a mile stone in film making history
And it's bloody experience"
1917,17 February 2020,1/10,I dont typically write reviews but this movie was such a dissappointment. I was expecting a war movie but got 2 guys walking around the country for 2 hours now dont get me wrong it started off very interesting but got boring very fast. Great shots and they captured WW1 very well but they should have have some good action sequences in there.
1917,14 January 2020,10/10,"Incredible movie,one of the best of the decade!!! must see and enjoy"
1917,2 February 2020,2/10,"Have just got back from the cinema having watched this film.
I had made up my mind on it at least half way through.
When it had finished I immediately turned to my partner and asked what she thought. Her reply, not much.
Our opinions were the same.
Nothing happens in this film
I found myself not really caring about the characters
No way would I recommend it.
A far better film about the same event is Journey's End.
Stay home and watch that one on Netflix"
1917,28 January 2020,10/10,Amazing film! The cinematography is out of this world.
1917,24 January 2020,10/10,"I don't even like war movies but this is a masterpiece
Like there are moments like fucking blow my mind, and it's better to watch it on the cinema."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,Tense all the way through. Amazing how they shot this whole movie in 2 takes. Must watch!
1917,20 October 2020,10/10,"Beautiful to watch, easy to understand, realistic dialogues, straightforward message."
1917,27 January 2020,10/10,"I saw this movie fully anticipating it to be a spectacle, not knowing much of the story. In conclusion, I can say, this is exactly the mindset to have. Yes, the plot may not have been majorly intricate. But this movie is perfect for what it was. It was a beautiful and absolutely heartbreaking yet simple story, told through the brilliant eyes of Sam Mendes.This movie was the first that I have seen in a very long time that left me staring at the screen with chills. There were moments where I thought to myself how fantastic it was to be able to see such a visually stunning marvel of a movie in theaters. The acting, the music, the emotion, the direction, and the overall visual poetry of this movie were astounding.If you want to get caught up in a tale full of plot-twists and character backstory, then no, it might not be the movie for you. But, honestly, that's not at all what I'm expecting out of a WW1 movie.
If you want something that will both break your heart and fill it, something that is so visually enthralling that you won't be able to take your eyes off of the screen, and something that spotlights some of the best acting of the generation, then 1917 is absolutely the movie for you."
1917,23 January 2020,4/10,This movie was boring. I fell asleep multiple times. Dont get what the big deal is here? After growing up with Saving Private Ryan..Hamburger Hill and the likes...this movie was a snoozer!
1917,26 January 2020,9/10,"This movie is amazing. The way it was filmed as one shot gives a unique feeling, it had me more captivated and to be honest since I was watching it several times I taught that I need to see the way it was filmed & behind the scenes shots.Since the beginning of the movie you can realise that they put a lot of work in making it. All the trenches that where made, according to the director more then a mile of trenches in total. Just amazing work and money well spent.The actors where great, especially for two young actors. They obviously had to learn a lots of lines as the shots where so large.In the end, a great movie, great actors, the way it was filmed was amazing, definitely a must see !"
1917,6 January 2021,5/10,One long shot... the only thing interesting about the film. Rest the film is mediocre in every aspect.
1917,1 February 2020,6/10,"Awesome cinematography can't make up for an impossible, unbelievable, and not that great of a story."
1917,2 February 2020,1/10,"Please,save your time and watch a good movie. That one is full waste of time."
1917,20 April 2020,10/10,"This is the best film in cinematography, and the best film in teknik single cam,"
1917,12 February 2020,5/10,"Just saw this movie. Disappointed would be an understatement. I appreciated the ""one take/scene"" approach but the movie overall was SO BORING!"
1917,11 February 2020,1/10,"Sorry to say, buy I just can't understand how this boring movie got so many good reviews. Good thing I pirated it, too bad I lost 2 hours of time tho. Could have watched a better movie."
1917,12 January 2020,9/10,"Everything was amazing, how the shots were made, and they managed the tension in scenes was very good. The only thing it's that I think the main character was really stupid in decision making."
1917,9 February 2020,9/10,"I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and the oneshot aspect only added to the tense atmosphere."
1917,11 January 2020,3/10,Very good sets but I was yawning half way through. the ending was the best bit (when it eventually finished). I'm obsessed with war history but struggled with this one :0( but they captured the look perfectly.
1917,17 May 2020,10/10,"It is movies like this that make you watch the screen untill the last words of the end credits roll up. The essence of filmmaking reaches its zenith when it blossoms through such paragons. The finest technique, finest cinematography, finest screenplay. There's this thin line between something good and great. 1917 has far crossed that line. It's extraordinary. A delight to watch. Works like this, set the bar too high.
The movie reminds us that time is everything. The grotesque depiction of war in this masterpiece makes you wonder the value of human life. It's not just the countless soldiers who die in the battlefield, but families, memories and dreams. We are puny mortals in a tiny part of the universe, busy with our petty affairs. But we are involved. And that makes commitment necessary. Commitment to live. Commitment to appreciate life and beauty."
1917,16 May 2020,10/10,"I thought it was incredible! I had a mixture of anxiety, nervousness and apprehension the whole way through. I was waiting for the change of scene in the beginning and I found it so satisfying to just continue through each scene. I enjoyed it, It just gave such a sense of realism throughout, it left me so immersed in their/ his journey that I didn't want it to end. It's so interesting to see a perspective of the men in the trenches, it was gruesome but gave you an insite into the conditions they were living in. It didn't feel like a film about a hero and even though he was, it just didn't feel glamourised! Definitely worth a watch!"
1917,20 July 2020,3/10,"I want to start by remembering all those who lost their lives in both the World Wars and pay all due respect.Unfortunately, this will not give me back the time I spent attempting to watch this totally unconvincing and utterly boring war melodrama.If you like authenticity in filmmaking, this film won't deliver. The plot is totally fake and contrived.A massive waste of resources."
1917,3 February 2020,8/10,"What a great movie all in one shot, brilliant, compelling, stunning war drama which you will have a great time watching from start till finish. The cast is brilliant to watch, keeps you hooked to their characters absolutely no off putting elements there's literally nothing that can put you off while watching this great film, so yeah you will have a great time with this one.ENJOY, because i absolutely did."
1917,12 January 2020,10/10,"This movie by far is one of the best movies I have seen so far . And yes the title is right , I was so into the movie that I didn't want to miss any second of it"
1917,26 December 2020,8/10,"I beleive Dunkirk has certianly changed the point of view in to war movies! If you expect to see a bloodshed like Private Ryan which led the minor human expressions by the way, this is not your movie. See Dunkirk first..."
1917,5 December 2020,4/10,"Great cinematography but very contrived, not believable, story with a highly predicable ending!! This story has been told many, many times? Nothing new here! The Thin Red Line and Fury were much better films!!"
1917,3 November 2020,10/10,This is the best cinematography yet to come out of Universal Pictures
1917,21 January 2020,10/10,The pace of the movie is excellent and it shocks me to believe they were able to shoot this all in one or two takes. The flow of the movie seems perfectly fluid and emotional along the way. The scene where all of the men climb out of the trench and charge all while being shot at by cannon fire brought me to tears as I could not imagine what it must have been like to actually have been there and this movie makes it seem incredibly life like. A stunning achievement that deserves every bit of praise.
1917,29 January 2020,10/10,"Very unpredictable, the film is arranged neatly and like real."
1917,6 February 2020,10/10,"The work and craftsmanship behind the movie really payed off. Not only was the cinematography fantastic, but the actors did a great job at portraying two young scared soldiers.When I watched it I felt like I was present and got really caught up, because of the whole one shot thing."
1917,13 January 2020,1/10,"I found this movie to be lacking in a story line and 3 unrealistic scenes. The movie was very graphic showing the realism and brutality of what war is, except for three scenes that ruins the entire movie. The first when the British soldiers were saving the German pilot after he was shot down. Never have I seen in real life nor in a war movie based on real events a soldier giving aid to the enemy with the enemy's head in his lap giving him comfort. Nor have I ever seen a soldier putting his hand over an enemy's mouth telling him to be quiet then removing his hand after the enemy nodded he would. And then the unbelieveable scene when he ran out of that building away from the enemy leaving his weapon behind!! Because of those 3 scenes I found that movie to be disrespectful to those who serve/served in the Brittish Military. I served with them in the 60's and they do what they are trained to do and they do it well."
1917,31 January 2020,10/10,"What an amazing picture. As we follow the protagonists through the film we learn about both the aftermath and the ongoing horror that is a world war. The cinematography is truly one of a kind. We are guided throughout the film unknowing of what's behind the next plain, or if it's an enemy or ally. A special film indeed!"
1917,25 January 2020,10/10,I was totally in the film and by the end have a tears in my eyes. What a master top camera work. The madness off war makes me silent. Oscars!!!
1917,19 January 2020,10/10,"To this day I haven't had a more extreme and emotional cinema experience. The storyline itself is original, though some parts of it are just basic war movie cliches.
But that is not what this movie is about, it doesn't matter that it contains some cliches because the way they portray them on screen is the best and most original way possible. I had goosebumps the whole movie and it kept surprising me over and over again. U get so invested in the characters right away and character building works so well with this personal type of filming. I don't know if 2020 is gonna bring anything else this enjoyable but I'll be surely rewatching this movie as soon as possible."
1917,26 January 2020,10/10,Very intense and touching story. You can feel the excitement and the heartbreak as if you're there. It's really a must-watch.
1917,27 March 2020,2/10,"1917, this was the most over-hyped and portrayed the greatest number of unbelievable events that I have seen in any movie since... ah... ah..."
1917,13 January 2020,4/10,"The movie was beautifully shot but it was soooooooo slow. I couldn't stand just watching the characters walk, and walk, and walk. It was pretty frustrating and boring. Anyways, the movie is not as great as everyone else is saying."
1917,26 January 2020,7/10,"Good movie, great suspense moments, great sets. But it kinda felt you were watching Counterstrike the game 80% of the movie. It didn't move me. I was expecting something else, a better plot."
1917,14 January 2020,2/10,"A badly strung together set of ideas / scenes, where gritty reality should exist instead of over long sequences of men with weak expressions on their faces. The longer it went on the more daft it became. Emotional nonsense with none of the logical nouse that a real war gives its participants."
1917,17 February 2020,3/10,"This movie is very well shot, but the exaltation ends when the rat triggers the trap. The explosion leaves the two soldiers unharmed, but is still is strong enough to collapse the large shelter and underground tunnel, built to withstand heavy artillery fire for hours and days?
And it's downhill from there. The whole movie is like a shooter game where the protagonist is stumbling from one fight to the next. Except that computer games do a better job of connecting the little adventures. The lowlights have been mentioned too often already: Cow, milk, plane, pilot, dead buddy, but at least we got milk for a sidequest. Brits appear and disappear. Countersniping the worst sniper ever. Enemy soldier rushing. Mother with a baby, and she needs ""lait""! YES, 150XP.
Enough already,"
1917,8 December 2020,8/10,Fansinating use of cinematography to tell the story
1917,20 January 2020,7/10,"A very very good film for today's standard. Cinematography makes for a good watch but the relatively predictable and cliché storyline makes the viewer feeling that the film could have been so much better. Regardless, it is definitely a must see film and a good experience overall."
1917,1 February 2020,9/10,"Such an amazing movie, the fact that it's all in one shot makes it so powerfull and really makes you feel connected to the characters. There is a constant tension which keeps you concentrated on the movie for the whole 2 hours. It has beautiful emotional shots. A real must see!"
1917,14 January 2020,9/10,"Incredibly moving reality of WW1, no Hollywood style action sequences. Brutally honest account of the brutality faced by those young men sent to war.Easily one of the best war films in a long long time since Dunkirk, Saving Private Ryan etc."
1917,31 January 2020,8/10,"Great war movie, bit a war movie none the less.If there are war movies you like, you'll probably like this. I'd Saving Private Ryan wasnt your cup of tea, this wont be."
1917,13 February 2020,10/10,"I have never been to war, but experienced my share of life-threatening situations, including facing the wrong end of a gun. Watching this movie almost felt like the real deal, it let me glimpse the human condition in war. Ruthless reality coming at you too fast to allow pondering on your emotions, having to tuck it all away in order to stay alert, in order not to die. The randomness of who gets to live and who doesn't. One second your companion stands beside you, the next he is dying, and then on. Trying to focus on what is relevant in the now and here, and not losing focus on where you need to go. The actors deliver a brilliant performance in conveying this struggle convincingly. Additionally, brilliant screenplay and cinematography. One of the best movies I have ever watched."
1917,29 January 2020,2/10,"I just can't understand how can this film be so highly rated. This is absolutely the worst war movie i've ever seen. Poor and unconvincing acting, laughable 5th grade-like dialogue (especially at the beginning), pointless scenes (such as the french lady spot, totally unnecessary stuff), dreadful makeup (completely clean faces while hands and bodies covered in blood), such clear photography for a war picture, non-realistic visual effects (like the ones during the explosions at the end), the costumes could've been much more trustworthy as well. It gets hard to people who have watched 'Saving Private Ryan' and even 'Pearl Harbour' to swallow such a film. And the worst: it gets a 8.5 rating and it is nominated even to Best Motion Picture. Either I'm going crazy, or is this world."
1917,10 January 2020,10/10,"Beautiful, Engrossing, Revealing- A Cinematic Masterpiece. I think everyone should see this movie, whether you like war movies or not, hands down."
1917,16 June 2020,9/10,I saw this in the cinema and man alive i had a feeling of complete change. It was brilliant. Every single detail was thought of. Recently watched it again at home. Damn did I miss the cinema aspect of it big surround sound but still was as good! Well worth the watch.
1917,23 January 2020,4/10,Was expecting an amazing movie since this is an 8.6/10 rated movie but I found it very slow and lacked action considering that this is a war movie. Poor storyline and over acted by some of the cast. The Mise-en-scène and narrative extremely poor
1917,10 January 2020,7/10,"The cinematography of this film is amazing as expected from Roger Deakins ! It has beautiful shots and some great actors ! But the screenplay is very awkward/cheesy at times and seems like a classic oscar bait film overall ! Could have been a great film 6,5/10"
1917,22 October 2020,9/10,Best cinematography iv ever seen unbelievable work and talent from the photographer and all the teaam .. thanks for this Piece of art
1917,13 May 2020,3/10,"I dont know why this has 8 stars. Its not a goof movie at all. Core actors are mediocre at best and the whole movie is a running simulator with epic music. The music is by far the best part of this film.
A few top actors make tiny lines here n there but no doubt just to boost the popularity contest."
